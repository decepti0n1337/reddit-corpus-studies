Yeah I will probably take a similar route. Varying between play styles, switching things up every now and then.
---
No fun at parties, but yes fun at Arby’s
---
Hunters also deal damage that ignores armor. 
---
Casual pve for sure and also super casual pvp for me
---
I'll give my experience as a casual and hardcore raider from the private server scene. Having never really played vanilla before, Nost was my first real experience with the game.
---

---
On Nost I raided with several guilds, in the end I raided with a hardcore EU guild during the afternoon and a casual American guild in the middle of the night. I also flunked out of university unsurprisingly... Anyways, in the casual guild we mostly did MC, Onyxia and ZG. There were like 10 people or so who min-maxed, iirc it was the tank and offtank, me as a healer, two other priests and the rest a blend of mages, warlocks and rogues. The rest went in there with PvP specs, completely random gear and didn't listen much on Discord. I still think these raids were much more fun than the ones in the hardcore guild. We just tried to speedrun our way through the raids as fast as possible. "Just get it over with" was the mentality which I find really sad. 
---
We eventually went into BWL and butted our heads against Razorgore for months. Eventually we got a hunter who really knew his shit and who could kite the dragons in phase 1. We soon killed the boss and everybody rejoiced. This lead to quite a few people suddenly starting to focus more on the game. They respecced, got their pre-BiS and even enchanted their gear. Vael fell relatively quickly I want to say which surprised us. We also started using some limited consumables but most didn't. Suppression room took ages because our rogues sucked and "stack in the corner" was four words apparently nobody understood. Yet, with persistence we got through it and killed the boss. After that came the many wipes on the trash, but the three dragon bosses afterwards fell pretty much immediately since they are pretty easy. 
---
Then came Chromaggus... Let's just say it took a while and nobody enjoyed it because he's one of the most annoying bosses in the history of the fucking game. I still sometimes to this day "happen" to disconnect when we get to Chrom. I hate that boss. We downed him though and now we only had Nefarian left. I really enjoyed progressing on him because it was a moment of joy each time we reached the next phase. Eventually we did kill the dragon and that was one of my happiest moments in my WoW life, even though I'd farmed the boss for months in the other guild. Killing him with this ragtag band of very bad players was extremely joyful. The kill happened literally one or two days before Blizzard shut down the server, so it was a bittersweet kill I guess.
---
So a casual guild can with great persistence and determination clear BWL. It is definitely doable and odds are the players on Classic will be better than the ones I raided with. 
---
Now we move on to AQ40 though. Different guild, different server, the same kinds of people. It did not go well. Skeram's mindcontrols and aggro resets are a nightmare for casual guilds. Also just the fatigue of having to repeatedly explain the boss every single night is just maddening. We eventually got through it though but only because we overgeared the boss. This post is long enough so I'll briefly explain the rest of AQ. It was hard as nails and we wiped many many times. I was still raiding with my hardcore guild and here I would say it was actually more enjoyable to raid with the hardcore people than the casual ones. Without proper focus you just won't get anywhere in AQ. It's just impossible. We also tried Naxx and some fights were actually easier. I think we got Anub'Rekan and Noth down while not getting past Princess Huhuran in AQ40. I think most casual guilds will either have to accept that they will be stuck on this part forever, or they will have to shape up and become more hardcore. 
---
same with that guy who eats WWII MREs and has like 5 million followers- soothing voice = very noice
---
Don't listen to trolls
---
"Dark have been my memes of late...where is Diablo? Where is my son?" ;_;
---
He eats C-Rats?? I know modern MRE's will keep for a couple decades but geez...
---
This system is the one we used to use in Wrath/Cata, I personally feel its awesome but it has a pretty fatal flaw in its default design.
---
A player who quits for a while can come back and Immediately get loot that someone has been desiring who has been there every week, so long as he left at the top of everyone he was against. Because you only need to be above the ones your rolling against, not at the top.
---
Source: I main tanked Heroic DS and was going for the BiS paladin chest from Ultrax. I spent 3 months going for it, But never went above the guy who had quit 1 month before that. I got odd loot that helped and was mildly useful but the BiS never dropped. After a total of 5 months the guy returned and on the first raid he did, it dropped. Needless to say, after all the work I put in, to loose the chest to a player who had only cleared DS once, sucked.
---
After this we made the fundamental change that fixed the Suicide Kings loot system: We added decay when you're away for a certain amount of time, but not enough to punish you for missing 1/2 raids.
---
We also made seperate lists for each class.
---
Not full BiS gear is one thing. Coming to raid as a ret paladin (even if you have full BiS gear) and doing less damage than the tanks is another. People know its a meme spec, and they will see its a meme spec on the dps meter.  Fury warriors can just right click bosses half the time not using abilities and out-dps you. Same goes for boomkins. Why would you ever bring that to raid? Why would you ever give any gear to that person, who everyone knows is getting carried through the content?
---
I ran loot council for my guild for a while, i was raid leader at the time. It worked well with little to no complaints...yes i was on the loot council but it was done fairly. 
---
When we introduced it i personally received no loot from raids for the first 6 weeks, GM wasn't in the raid group and my wife doesn't play WoW so no "GM's girlfriend" being favored. My lack of loot was mostly due to me being main tank, already being much better geared than the other tank and not much dropping that was of use to me. 
---
I was the only person who missed out on loot for that long and i didn't complain to myself. Others saw no one was getting favoritism and it just worked. 
---
I acknowledge that this isn't the general case though...the majority of the time loot council seems to be abused. 
---
Yeah, decurses, sheeps on Domo, blizzard for a lot of AoE pulls, fire in AQ, etc. They do get to do other things; but there are a lot of fights that are just frostbolt spam. But they’re still so versatile and robust in the world and dungeons and PvP. You can’t hate just cause some bosses in MC and BWL require frostbolting.
---
In regards to the pet mechanics, it’s generally not that difficult and you will pick up on them after a while. Things like pet pathing - If you jump down into an area - like Gnomeregan or the Rend fight in UBRS, the pet will take the long way around, learning to Dismiss Pet or use Eyes of the Beast in those situations isn’t hard. Only other factor is knowing to stable your pet and go out to tame specific other beasts in order to learn new skill ranks for your pet. Again, not difficult, and with the amount of guides that are available today, is pretty easy to do.
---
Weekly maintenance used to be the only time I left the house to catch up with friends (who I also played wow with). We spoke about wow. 
---
+1
---
I think the elites in Blasted Lands around Doom Lord Kazzak might be the strongest outdoor non-boss mobs in the game. They are scary as hell.
---
It is because they can attack from range. If you watch their location closely you can keep them out of most melee danger.
---
It's a matter of the options being terrible. Most players will do a mixture of these things, or fall somewhere between casual and hardcore. The answers are too black and white.
---
He's gotten better. He used to get stuff wrong pretty often.
---
True, options are bad. Im a casual both and picked other...
---
I’m at a bad impasse with deciding between hunter and warlock! I know what most people say. Hunter is better early and worse late while warlock is better late and worse early. I don’t really care about DPS as much as if I can be useful and get a raid spot. I also want to do the Rhok Delar quest so bad. Both classes have great flavor too. What do y’all recommend?
---
I don't know why you're being down voted :( they *did* normalize run speed at the end of vanilla too. Zg bats used to be able to catch people on 100% mounts lol
---
I've been plenty of good guilds that had great progress/all content on farm. Loot Council was never perfect and just isn't objective.
---
Yes of course, so will I. I'd be happy to see a more in-depth poll too.
---
In practice it rarely is distributed, in most guilds most of the officers and the guild leader are the closest friends already so their choices and decisions likely align.
---
I dabbled in Vanilla raiding, and I can affirm this. No one gave a single shit back in the day; we were all just happy to be there. 
---
I think it definitely had its roots in TBC, I don't remember it early on but towards BT it was there at least for our guild.
---
At least he recognizes you should disenchant it before giving it to the hunter.
---
How is this related to classic
---
My vanilla experience was similar to yours never beat BWL, but did MC, Ony, ZG, and AQ20 and the first couple BWL bosses. Although most of what you said was very similar for me back then, I dont think it will be that way again this time. People have been playing private servers for years. Some of these servers have fairly accurate encounters. Combine that with the shift in gaming culture minmaxing even for a casual player AND the readily available info for players to do so? Well I just dont see guilds not caring at all, or players not using "bis lists". I've played in a casual guild on a private server. The playtime requirement is similar to casual guilds back in vanilla, but BECAUSE we have bis lists and consumable lists, players can maximize their time far better. You dont spend hours as a hunter trying to do UBRS runs over and over for the beastlord chest. Instead you go do DM tribute runs for the ogre forged hauberk. But how does that save you time? Because tarnished elven ring, leggings of destruction and barbarous blade all drop from there. This saves you lots of time. But how do consumables save you time? Because once you have all your prebis you can spend that hour a day or so you log in farming consumables for raids. This let's you clear ony and MC in one go in a night. Sure your casual guild may never do AQ40. But you'll have better gear for world pvp and your guild will be able to clear zg, aq20, bwl, mc and ony in 2 or 3 nights even at a leisurely pace. Classic wont be as hardcore as private servers can be (fuck I hope not). But they wont be as lax as vanilla was either.
---
Lol way to get personal :) 
---
Its actually more a matter of the mental aspects of people experiencing what its like to be a part of something big, with all that it entails, good and bad. 
---
Think of it this way, when you go to boralus today and there is 0 people around, how does it make you feel? If the place is packed you might be lagging more but you get the sense that a lot of people want to play this.
---
Urgency is something important, why do you think people go so nuts on sales like black friday etc? when they open the gates and everyone goes on a frenzy, thats urgency. Its not pretty but its funny as hell in an ingame world. 
---
Not gonna waste more time arguing about this with someone as rude and frankly one sided as yourself.  
---
I played hunter im vanilla and seeing her play one badly would hurt my soul. Theres such a big difference between a good hunter and a bad one.
---
I was leaning towards her mage or holy paladin. As a pally she'd be able to play dress up having access to all not class specific gear so I'm sure she'd like that. She might like mage too but theres a lot of buttons and situational shit that she prolly wouldn't get.
---
I'm gonna sit her infront of a pserver let her read the flavor text and see where she goes, may the Light protect me.
---
I honestly think Classic is going to be fucked up by Activision Blizzard, I am choosing not to support their current business model and dev team, the Blizz team of old is gone.
---
I’m wet
---
One time in UBRS the Blackblade of Shahram dropped from General Drakkisath. A hunter won it. I was livid.  
---
For reference, the Blackblade had no stats, only an on-hit effect.
---
I also rage quit when my guild gave a tier piece to a new player instead of me when I was one away from 4 piece and had won the die roll...
---
i’m not sure the point of this post. i don’t think anyone has claimed that vanilla was full of tryhards shitting on meme specs and being extremely knowledgeable; in fact, i’ve only seen quite the opposite.
---
however, times have changed. the general mentality of online gamers has altered GREATLY. it’s a brave new (online) world. an entire new generation that has grown up on the internet and knows the culture is going to be playing classic, and they will be as ruthless as they are in retail WoW and every other online game.
---
I had a nostalgia bug and made a level 60 on a private test realm just so I could go look at them. 
---
I don't think he was denying that. "Mere" memes can contain statements and they can be discussed.
---
If people put in the time, they deserve the loot.  If they suck and the raid leader doesn't kick them that's a problem with the raid leader.
---
You go around the same way in your day to day life to ? Whelp my boss cuts my pay, ooh well nothing I can do about it.
---
There is a good game, it's called World of Warcraft. They can use that or make it some sort of refurbished rip off .. 
---
Stonewatch Keep gets my vote. For many people that was their first encounter with elite mobs. A big peak in the center of the zone that was death for anyone who wandered in Solo. With 2+ "bosses" to boot. 
---
Druid or Priest.  NE female.
---
It depends just how casual a guild you were in. The first raid guild I was in never really progressed past MC and had terrible attendence problems, so they took anyone they could get, ie. spec didnt really matter as long as you werent a ret paladin or a feral druid without tank gear. And no they didnt check spec either, but paladins and druids healed, unless you were a druid with good tanking and dps gear.
---
In my experience, every Warrior in a guild was treated as an offtank. There was none of this QQ i dont want to tank a single mob because its gonna hurt me on meters. It was just always expected and yes, non prot specd warriors tanked all the time in raids.
---
Fire resist for Rag was definitely a thing back then. Pserver meta has definetely made a lot of people forget that, everyone in raid was told to wear good FR gear for Rag. However, I do seem to recall not bothering once he was on farm, maybe the meta changed later in Vanilla? Not sure.
---
The term meme spec didnt exist, though I dont think the term Meme existed back then either, so they were just known as shit or joke specs back then.
---
I have to disagree about addons, most even casual guilds had mandatory ones, even ones that sucked. I think MOST guilds for a while used CTraid for targetting, since the target symbols were actually added VERY late in Vanilla (I think it was like 1.10? If you dont remember trying to do targets with only Hunter's Marks you never raided vanilla). A lot of guilds also had a lot of dumb addons like Calenders for guild events.
---
You're delusional if you think servers can't handle it. If a couple of fans can run a 12k + pop stable from there basement. Activision should be able to do it on a lower server cap 6-8k ?
---
Ha, that's awesome!
---
"You will not kill me... YOU WILL NOT KILL HIM!"
---
People sort by hot and new, untill it doesn't stay clipped to the top if you sort I'm all for a daily sharding post.
---
&gt; Shouldn't work inside instances, makes everything easymode.
---
It really shouldn't.  I used to PvP or even better if it hit on alt, get some easy mode leveling in.
---
Boralus was packed with people on BfA’s launch day. 
---
There are days when Ironforge doesn’t have many players around on the private server I play on. 
---
Is your entire point just to restate the obvious?
---
dun, dun dun dun, dun, dunnnnnnn
---
That's what I thought he was doing, he had no intention of respeccing when I whispered him (And never did the rest of the expansion)
---
I'm gathering it was to pad his gearscore at the time.
---
Yeah I think that's what they were intended for. I don't think saving the buff for clears was the design thought behind them.
---
And even some of that can be a draw to his channel. It's nice to see someone mess up every once in a while. It just reminds us they're human, and maybe offering correction or assistance is a good way of connecting with his community:)
---
That's scummy, especially since assassination was useless on H LK
---
Sorry if the representation in the poll isn't faultless.
---
5k on weekdays and over 6k on weekends during EU peak times, without a Chinese population, is falling off like a cliff?
---
As a hunter I'd roll on that. The procs are good for when you're in melee which is when you want to use a 2h anyway, and you'll be spamming wing clip so more chances for procs. If you want stats you dual wield. Not many good 2h for pvp hunters before BWL, the quest staff is decent but in vanilla and on many pservers, the hunter/priest quest items were added to the chest in the elemental invasion patch iirc. 
---
The boss mod I remember needing was CT Boss Mods

---
Have a look for yourself.
---
Not exactly true. Pets still had unique abilities you would need to tame and learn.
---
Please. Improved totems add up to something like 10-20 strength. 
---
Higher Nightfall uptime is mich better. 
---
There is quite an amount of depth in hunter, besides your basic rotation and keeping track on your pet staying alive and not buttpulling the whole raid, you can do a lot of tricks like split pulls, in-combat trinket swaps, melee weaving if situation favors it etc.
---
Rogues may seem simple, but they are very mathy and you have to plan your CP usage ahead according to the situation and time your Sinister Strikes if Horde.
---
Warriors DPS is highly interactive and requires making optimal decisions quickly according to your dynamic rage generation while keeping in mind GCD's. 
---
Healing is another type of activity you can make interesting - just like playing a whack-a-mole with 40 other people in raid who stand in fire. 
---
why do you think? for a change
---
Paladin.
---
Bubble is a get out of jail free card. Also, Lay on Hands.
---
I thought it was good. I laughed at it lol
---
Classic will not change the company. The dark powers of Activision have already sunk their talons to deep into the heart of Blizzard. It's all about money now, and Classic is a low risk cash grab. Once Diablo mobile explodes in the huge mobile market in Asia, all their properties will be focused on mobile games due to the low risk high reward those games are to make. To be honest I doubt Blizzard will ever be the same again.
---
I usually play druid or palladin fir vanilla but for classic i want something more mangable something i 100% will be able to get to the cap and then beound I kinda torn beetween mage because relatevely good leveling and great lategame scaling warlock good leveling not a popular class especially on the alliance side and hunter but there are will be way too many hunters i m not sure i mwilling to fight for a raid spot withthat many people i might roll warrior if my leveling buddy would roll a healer but only in that case
---
My first heroic dungeons I ever ran in Wrath were with PvP blues I bought off the AH.
---
I didn’t even know how much of a noob I was until I had recount installed and saw my damage spike with actual gear.
---
Here's what we did, and it worked extremely well:
---
Loot Council with Class Officers + Rotate random raider into the loot council every raid. Class Officers should be EXTREMELY knowledgeable about the loot that will drop and should know how good each item is for their class, while also knowing the loot situation of ALL members of their class, as well as the effort and performance they are giving in a raid.
---
Rotate randomly rolled raid member into the loot council every single raid, which helps with transparency and fairness. They get the chance to see how a loot council actually works (typically via votes), and nearly 9/10 the random player doesn't want the responsibility or just defers to the permanent LC because they have no idea as to who deserves an item.
---
For example, if an item drops that is 100% BIS for a Druid, and I'm the Druid Class Officer, then I'll make the case in the Loot Council as to why the item should be more weighted to a druid over a Paladin or Priest. Then I'll make the case for druid X, since he shows up with consumables, performs well, and he could use the item more-so than the other druids.
---
Then the other Officers will input from their class pov and we decide on who gets it. Normally we know what items will go to who before they drop, but for all big ticket items, we have discussions and votes on it (including the random raid member added to the LC for the raid). We know which rogues getting full t2 first, which rogues are dagger spec or sword spec, which hunters getting the xbow first, which hunters getting the t2 set, etc.. If one particular person gets a big ticket item, then they obviously aren't in line for the next one, even if it's not the same item type (dagger vs trinket).
---
It works extremely well, and makes sure insane items aren't nabbed or given to shitters/friends of the GM.
---
I'm switching mainly to keep the questing a bit fresher. I played Alliance for vanilla into BC and WotLK so I am pretty familiar with those starting areas and quest progression. I did play a horde priest for a time when cataclysm came out, but since the leveling was significantly sped up, I didn't spend as much time in the starting zones. I guess I just want to make Classic as new feeling as possible! That also means that I have avoided looking up information about leveling paths for horde side. I am definitely someone that likes to read through guides, item showcases, profession strategies, etc. but I feel like speeding through the leveling portion of classic with the most optimized guide I can find would ruin the experience!
---
TLDR: New Areas, New Experience!
---
Skullflame Shield and Dragon's Call
---
I mean most books take longer than 2 hours to read though
---
&gt; You have absolutely no control where loot goes at all. You can have some total random who is a friend of some guildies join, with a truck load of gold, first raid win a staff of the shadow flame. 
---
That guy that comes in with a truckload of gold makes everyone else rich by the end of the raid when they get their cut. That uber rich guy who comes in on the first raid and buys a tier head piece for 10k - he could have won it from a roll or dkp instead so the other 5 people still wouldnt have got it, but in gkp they and everyine else in the raid atleast come away with 200-400 gold each from that piece alone, as does everyone else in the raid. The next raid that same piece drops again but this time the uber rich guy isnt there or doesnt bid on it so it sells for 200-1k gold, or maybe only 50g if other people dont have much money.
---
By contrast, the new guy either can get any single piece they want in a dkp system like ep/gp or they can't get good loot for months in a dkp system particularly if they take/are given the less desirable loot. "looks like i will never have a chance at that piece cos everyone else is hoarding for it, so I might just take some lower pieces no ones rolling on, bottom out my ratio/dkp and move on to the next guild. 
---
Dkp can be a barrier to retaining new recruits. Not to mention the drama around accurate recording of dkp, how much dkp should be given to what - how exactly do you relatively weight the value of that guy who turns up everytime on time with full consumables but does garbage dps and dies every fight vs the guy who can only make. 2/3 raids, usually needs a summon, doesnt have consumables but out dps's everyone else of the same class even though they have worse gear, while managing to avoid more damage than everyone. How do you balance picking a raid group - that shit player with tonnes of dkp who is saving everything for the tier chest cant spend it if he gets left out of the raid consistently because of another player who is better. How is the dkp system fair to that constant attender in that scenario, or conversely the good player being left out cos some scrub has been there longer. 
---
&gt;You impose a meta where tanks and healers need mage or hunter alts to farm gold to stay competitive. You encourage segregation, where people who don’t need anything will loan their gold to their friends to ensure they get their item to screw over someone they don’t like or because they’re selfish.
---
The tank and healer dont have as much competition for their role specific pieces so they end up being cheaper, leading to a differential advantage when rolling against dps classes on average resulting in them not having to grind on alts to keep up full consumables/enchants. How many healers, clothies, or non shield classes are going to pay 100-500g for a tanking shield? Is a dps warrior going to bid aggressively for a tanking shield if they are saving cash for that trinket/ring? If people really want to fuck others over they can just ninja loot anyway regardless of the system. 
---
&gt;For an organized guild though I don’t believe this is even remotely close to optimal. Like, not even close.
---
I agree, but neither is dkp or loot council. If it is like you say that the vanilla mindset is about the raiding itself and downing the bosses, then the optimal loot system for achieving that end is to gear the shit out of your best players first. If no one cares about individual loot but only downing bosses - as you claim - then they should want to maximise the probability of killing things by having the most powerful raid group possible. This is achieved by giving your best players first preferance for all gear. 
---
&gt; Think about how you would feel, as someone who put in your time and effort building rapport with the guild, raiding every week, being prepared, spending the hours wiping, only to see that happen. 
---
You directly contradict yourself with this. 
---
&gt;Your original post about people getting mad because they didn’t get loot one week and spent time raiding and farming consumables is an antithetical mindset to what vanilla raiding is all about. If you get into a worthwhile guild, the raiding itself, the time you get to spend playing with friends, and the fun of downing bosses is the reward itself.
---
Yep. The pets you're going to see are the wolf from LBRS which trains max rank Furious Howl, and the ZG windserpent which trains the highest rank of their nature shock.
---
Yeah it seems ok for the more casual guilds. I wouldn't be in a guild that had a loot system like this for long.
---
You are a low effort recreation of your mom.
---
you can clear MC, ZG, and aq20 with meme specs. the people this post is geared to just straight up don't care about dps meters, or clearing all content, or who has what spec.
---
I'm glad you had a positive experience. It is unfortunately the vast minority.
---
I've been in a few loot council guilds (pserver, in Vanilla was DKP) and each and every case had shenanigans and shafting. People in the inner circle of friends (in one case including myself) got huge favoritism and newcomers or "not cool" people who did everything they can do contribute and stand out, even making "donations" to the guild bank etc, got shafted.
---
That's right, holy hell! I have been watching it stuck on 30k forever :P
---
Great stuff!
---
There are great tweaks to each system. SK can have a list decay for days or weeks missed. There is also -1 for no-shows.
---
A great guild I was in which used a DKP system used anonymous bidding through /whisper, so no bid wars would happen. In DKP systems, often time the highest point players can "milk" other players points by inflating bids. This is why anonymous bidding is so important.
---
Secondly, the highest bidder would win the item, but only pay the second highest bidder's bid. This is another way to combat bid wars, and to make sure everyone simply bids "what they are willing to pay" and not try and game the bidding system.
---
If only one person bid, he pays his bid (the top bid).
---
AUlright I walked into that one. 
---
I think *any* non-arbitrary system is better than loot council, which is literally "trust me bro, I'll decide for everyone."
---
Anything with transparent rules and non-arbitrary decisions that everyone can see is great. The system you describe seems fair, though complicated. Still preferable over loot council.
---
You're right, best for PvP.
---
But many hunters brought it to PvE raids either without knowing any better or because they thought it was a dps gain, even though it's a raid wide loss in dps.
---
DKP systems can be used to basically prevent new raiders from ever getting a chance at good loot. As the long time members can potentially amass enough points to have first choice on any item that drops in the foreseeable future. Nothing like looking at the point totals and realizing that you'll never get certain drops unless certain people stop showing up to raids.
---
I've only had a brief look at your stuff but I love your enthusiasm and dedication on YT and everything, good luck pal! 
---
How far to 60 will a week off get you? 
---
(serious question, its like 7-10 days /played right? Its not linear tho, so maybe 35? 40?)
---
&amp;#x200B;

---
I'm in a Naxx progressed guild. I don't want to poo-poo them at all, great guys, but there is shenanigans and favoritism behind the scenes.
---
Certainly. Not sure how much he reads comments or whatever, but he seems super nice and has worked hard to get his channel to a great spot. 
---
Then someone near the bottom gets it. You pay a very small price if you're near the bottom.
---
If someone is sacrificing so many upgrades for "that one item" then that's their decision. It's not like no one is getting the upgrade in the end.
---
Yes but those are specific to different species, not rare named mobs
---
I've been in two Naxx progressed guilds (post Vanilla pservers).
---
Loot council has always been shit in every case. Of course the inner circle of good old boys don't complain about it.
---
I've also been in a Naxx progressed guild with a simple /roll system with loot council hybrid, where the council decides who gets to roll based on extreme need (like MT prio) and things like raid attendance.
---
Personally come Vanilla, I'm going to look for a modified DKP or modified SK loot guild. No way will I join a loot council guild unless A) I'm in the council or am class officer and B) they're impeccable people.
---
Thanks mate, it's always good to hear experiences from different players.
---
That's just a bad DKP system. I've been in guilds that give DKP- for noshows, and DKP+ for farming/bringing/using consumes. 
---
You can design DKP to *objectively and transparently* reward effort if you're not a retard.
---
ONSLAUGHT, on K\*\*\*\*\*? That system is perfect and I've been using it everywhere since.
---
Yep. 
---
Man you are in for a treat, all of those zones listed, redridge, dun morough and places like elwyyn forest, westfall, teldrassil, Lake moch or whatever that place is next to dun morough. ALl solid zones and the alliance themes is a much more relaxing one imo.
---
The aesthetics of the alliance capital cities are great as well. Iron Forge is fun to hang out in and so is the sprawling city of Stormwind. Alliance may come across as the newb faction but theres nothing better than downing a big tauren as a gnome rogue and /lol
---
I have no idea if I even want to. I was originally die hard gonna go Alliance because one of the characters I planned to play at 60 was a paladin but now I'm not sure if I want that. Tempted to go Horde for a Tauren Shaman instead. It'll either be:  
---
Alliance - Human Paladin, Human Warrior, Gnome Mage
---
or
---
Horde - Tauren Shaman, Forsaken Warrior, Forsaken...caster of some sort maybe not Priest if I already chose Shaman since they all go Resto at 60 anyhow.  
---
This hurts me so much inside...
---
Savage as fuck 
---
I don't want to be like "you guys decide for me" but some feedback towards why picking one faction over the other would be appreciated and I'll consider it over the time we have before Classic launches.
---
This thread made it seem like mages were better at almost everything you mentioned:

facts
---
here's a simplified version
---
&gt;is it a weapon?
---
&gt;can it be equipped by a hunter?
---
if the answer to both of these questions is "Yes", then it's a hunter weapon
---
My last P server rush was 120 hours as a paladin (with OG vanilla XP rates).
---
Most current speedrunners math out 86-100 hours for a good leveling class like hunter or warlock. Routes have improved since Joana.
---
I'll be taking a week or so off. Assuming a Tue release? There will be 60s on the weekend.
---
even as the slowest leveling class, I'll be punching Onyxia in the face before the first reset.
---
This is indeed what I am hoping for!
---
In fact, we probably got Classic because of Activision....  Initial cost to bring back the classic experience is probably not soo high. They already made millions from virtual tickets from hardcore player who buy it just for the classic demo. 
---
And the game will probably in maintenance mode so no big team, just need few workers to keep everything ok, some fix but little cost.
---
In exchange they gonna get millions every months.
---
I am happy, really really happy but don’t think ActiBlizzard as a «  we have listen to you », it’s more like a «  we realise we can do a sh**load of money with classic server »
---
Depends on personality tbh. Does she like being up in someone's face smashing them to pieces? Does she like keeping her distance and pissing people off? Does she like the unsung support role?
---
Shadow priest gear is basically taking weird cloth pieces that mages and locks don't really want and somehow making it work.
---
That's tru
---
Same, nobbel87 and doronsmovies were good for that too 
---
Having NA players hear you have 450 ms always blew their minds.
---
&gt;It's not like no one is getting the upgrade in the end.
---
Until no one else needs it.
---
Vanilla does not have blood elves, so the next best looking things (for me at least) are humans. 
---
You might be right and it makes me sad, but you remind me of Saruman from [this scene.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBMiyEzOJmI&amp;t=1m8s)
---
I don't want it to be that way honestly, but i'm just going by patterns have suggested will probably happen. Activision Blizzard may be able to market stuff still, but the large reduction in good-will and faith toward the company just says too much for me to think otherwise.
---
It's perfect because in the first frame Theoden's supposed to be terrified of the Mumakil, or the shit storm to come.
---
Healing is interesting because it is often more important to know how to use utility spells than to just spam heals. Priests knowing when to shield, Shaman totem management, Druid’s use of all of its toolkit, Paladin... equipping your 2H on farm bosses?
---
There are quite a few times where shifting into bear or catform has helped me to save myself or my raid. 
---
They also eat almost anything and had Dive for good movement speed! They swoop in and zap the boss and you call them back until they get 100 Focus to do it again. Back in the day pets didn't automatically attack a boss' butt so it was dangerous for both the pet and your tank since the boss would parry your ghetto 50 damage pet and use the parry haste to hit your tank again.
---
This got way too real. 
---
It's only good for caster pushback in PvP and nothing else.
---
Which is amazing.
---
&gt; He always talks about people saying he's monotone and lifeless
---
You know, I don't care how "monotone" or "lifeless" someone is (of which, I wouldn't consider him either of those things and I'll explain why in a second), but he's just someone who genuinely enjoys the game and you can tell, because he's himself when he does the video. He doesn't have to have some loud and/or fake personality, he just wants to talk about WoW to whoever will listen because he really loves the game and, that means something to me, it's a lot better than a lot of the other "content" creators we see, and I hope Madseason keeps cranking out vids. 
---
Sure, if you're fighting people who just stand there and cast.
---
I was that "not gamer wife" 12 years ago. My husband talked me into it "just try it for a month, and if you don't like it you'll never have to play again." I rolled a rogue. It was okay but it didn't really do it for me. He was a mage so I tried that. Hated it. He suggested a hunter. Worse than a mage, and I have to carry a quiver and keep buying arrows? Pass. On a whim I rolled a warrior and loved it. I still love it. Ive tried every race and every class and warrior is still my favorite. I love logging on and just beating the shit out of things sometimes; so cathartic. He stopped playing shortly after cataclysm, and now I'm the one trying to get him to play again.
---
My gf was happiest with the Hunter - she loved taming different pets and it was the most forgiving to play.
---
Night Elf Priest
---
Hahaha! This made me laugh! I miss you WotLK
---
You missed the ogre elite area in loch modan, and the elite dwarf area in Wetlands, also Grim Batol in wetlands for high level elites. 
---
Season 3 welfare epics. My hunter was raiding kara with all pvp gear lol.
---
To play a shaman. 
---
Lol. She’s gunna be a dot lock ftw haha
---
Can't stand this guys voice.
---
Sounds like a lot of work for nothing. I mean its fun I guess but not very efficent and optimal for the guilds progress. I havent seen a single guild use that on any Vanilla server I have played on since 2015.
---
Mechanically vanilla raid bosses are incredibly easy compared to later expansions, most bosses only have 2-4 mechanics, with some exceptions.
---
Ty for the response. Maybe I’ll reconsider
---
Ive never heard this before, must be cus i never died 8)
---
&gt; Charge: This ability will now properly cause the warrior to go into combat with its target.
---
From Patch 2.1.0
---
Off the coast of Dustwallow Marsh
---
The videos that I posted are all pre-2.0.1 though. So there would have had to have been a change sometime between them and 2.1.0 where Charge did not put you into combat that was not in the patch notes.
---
There isnt enough content to raid 6 nights a week
---
Unless your including consume farming as being part of raid time
---
I raided as both a mage (super boring) and a rogue. Consider rogues if you like to live on a razor edge. You have to constantly watch the threat meter (unfortunately a must as a rogue*) and know precisely when you are about to go over. At that point, you either need to exceed and quickly vanish resetting your threat OR reduce your damage so you don't die. This is an art. You don't want the boss to turn completely around since that freaks everyone out (especially the tank). But, to maximize dps, you can't vanish prematurely. 
---
If the boss is mobile, you have to constantly reposition to avoid getting cleaved. You also have evasion so, if all else fails, and the boss is at 1%, you can actually tank (with luck) and finish it off. Finally, like hunters, if it hits the fan, you can vanish and likely survive. If you are an engineer with jumper cables, and you succeed in bringing back a resser, everyone in the guild loves you. 
---
Besides all that, they have very very good dps and are in demand.
---
*I personally am not a massive fan of threat meters (especially in 5 mans**) since I think knowing your class is knowing your threat. Also, this game has very broken threat (no indication of who's going to be targeted next) which I really wish they could have worked a bit harder on it before release... but oh well. 
---
**And for all you idiots planning to post the threat afterward during 5 mans (and especially the ones who do it after each boss), if you really need an ego boost that badly, just whisper it to yourselves. 🙄
---
Just curious, how far did you get with each of the classes?
---
How does this work if someone jobs the raid after a boss kill or leaves early?
---
I don't see it being a thing any more than it is currently in retail which most weeks is just restarts, rather than down time.
---
Progression, world bosses, and when more raids are released, etc. Was more figurative than literal. 
---
Kek 
---
Activision will ruin classic too. 
---
Thanks for the response!
---
Ph lol yeah world bosses take up the majority of your time if are the unlucky few who are scouting QQ 
---
Oh no... right in the feels. 
---
Couple of hours a week, probably leveling then some pve and world pvp
---
This sad but true
---
I hope it won't be so bad, but it isn't TOO bad on p servers from when I played. People advertise "prebis or higher, only", but most aren't 100% strict about it or even know what bis vs for each class. 
---
I think the biggest risk there is a gear score mod. That is a black and white number you can draw in the sand, rather than "yeah, his gear seems good enough to me"
---
My first level 60 vanilla toon was a hunter, I had leveled war to 59 before server swapping.
---
I agree that a hunter pet is viable on trash but I do not agree that the pet is as versatile as a warrior.  I have tanked some pulls in dungeons when the warrior was dead and running back.
---
To be specific I think a hunter pet is decent but in a situation of 3 targets, a warrior will have better aggro management than a hunter pet will because of a wider ability set compared to the hunter's pet.
---
Depends on the kid. My 1st left me with no time for the first year. My second one basicly sleept through the first 3 months and barely changed my schedule and had plenty of time for my self once they were both put down for the night.
---
I only see hardcore progression guilds having an issue with the meme specs, or if you try to join a raid that only has healer slots left. 
---
There will be pressure to heal either way, though, if you are already in the raid and they are short healers. I heard more than one ret pally sigh before saying he can heal so we can get started lol.
---
I was hunter class leader at 10 years old. Cleared midway through naxx.
---
As a strong supporter of DKP systems and opponent of loot councils, theres 2 major problems when it comes to DKP systems.
---
1. Collusion (not the case here)
---
2. People passing on items they need because theyre waiting for a rarer item.
---
This has a very serious problem with the latter and its a problem for a number of reasons. You might think "well, ok, that persons just screwing themselves out of good loot", but really, this person is dragging down the raid with terrible gear every single raid and not taking pieces they need and then they end up with the one good rare piece that would benefit the people that have been taking gear and performing well in raids much more. Theres going to be a tremendous amount of passing and rolling in this system. 
---
First off the third video is clearly private server footage so that could be thrown out.
---
The issue with finding a recording of this is that the two crossed swords occur both when you're in combat or when you have your auto attack enabled, and because charge enables your auto attack it will have the two crossed swords (at least on the default UI). I imagine what you want to look for is a mount on their bars not being grayed out as they charge.
---
At 5:02 of the Pat PvP video you can see it being not grayed out for at least a portion of the charge, but I'm not sure what gets him in combat later on into it or how exactly entering combat works so I'm not sure where to go from there.
---
Then their reference server is bugged or he didn't test it enough, because although there was a bug (fixed in 2.1), this wasn't the behaviour of the spell. Looking for retail source material between the dates of 22nd August (1.12) - December 5th (tbc pre-patch) we can find the following evidence:
---
1. https://youtu.be/PgxwYD4h6W4?t=97 - This is my favourite one because of the completely isolated environment, mount, food and charge fade on bars immediately after charge, and way before damage is dealt or taken. No buffs or debuffs on either player or target (apart from charge on that frame ofc).
---
2. https://youtu.be/qlL28HV5M5g?t=47 - same frame as rage-gen
---
3. https://youtu.be/pPsn6F9UUB4?t=15 - Video is scuffed for a few frames but we see combat is added (mount fades on bars) with no debuffs or damage taken. You can also see himself and target being 100% hp next to the frames
---
4. https://youtu.be/PgxwYD4h6W4?t=21 - Again mount and charge fading on the very next frame, way before the first attack is made.
---
https://youtu.be/cyGOAFV0SkE?t=49 - IDK exactly what patch this one was but we can see a &lt;8 frame gap until combat is added (mount and charge fading) with no damage.
---
I might add some more Blizzlike examples but these are liteally the first results of [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=warrior+pvp&amp;rlz=1C1ASUM_enGB757GB757&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A8%2F22%2F2006%2Ccd_max%3A12%2F4%2F2006&amp;tbm=) google search (hopefully that link works, if not, [this](https://i.gyazo.com/ee641a42538fa46d0d4d2162c00b8efe.png) is what it looked like).
---
Pretty concerning that their "research" seems to be so half-assed.
---
You're correct, didn't look at the description for that one about it being Pre-AQ patch and didn't consider it talking about private server progression. I'll take that one down.
---
Just throwing it out there, most people don't get off work till 6, or 5 at the earliest. If you factor in an urban commute 6PM is going to be way too early for most.
---
In WotLK I ran a similarly themed guild, hardcore raiders who were very tight on time - We did 8-10 x3 a week. That gives people enough time to get off work at 6, get home at 7, and put the kiddos to bed in time to be ready for the raid at 8 sharp, then out of the raid early enough to get to do RL stuff and get enough sleep for the next day. It worked pretty well.
---
My pleasure! It was quite the ride! Looking forward to what 2019 brings :)
---
Vulgar language?!"?? This is the language of the light. It's the opposite of vulgar...
---
Do people think Classic WoW is gonna fix the company or something? Activision has its fingers so far up Blizzard Classic wont change it.
---
Classic may not "save" blizzard but it can provide momentum for change 
---
My wife has zero interest in games and used to ask me "haven't you beat that game yet?" 
---
Not even on the higher end. My guild cleared all the content until we got to the four horsemen and realized that we didn't have enough tanks and there were none to be recruited on our server and faction who spoke our language.
---
We didn't even know about debuff limits and consumables were a novelty at best. I remember one of our mages using a flask once during BWL. 
---
We opened the AQ gates and everything on our server.
---
Congrats 
---
This pretty much describes my experience as a Paladin. Hell, my spec was something like 10/26/15 and I did a lot of pvp as a ret reckbomber, but still healed MC raids.
---
Jintha'alor. Hands down 
---
Thank you, you pretty definitively answered this. It's kind of funny that people are using this interview as confirmation of the idea that "private servers are completely inaccurate" when it turns out that they are actually more Blizzlike in this particular example than Classic WoW will be. 
---
The likelyhood of lupos being the best at classic launch is the same likelyhood that cthun will be available at launch
---
I would just raid only with people at the top of the list.
---
Blood DK wasnt even remotely good DPS by the time ICC came out. Him rage quitting that shit guild was justified
---
For me it sucks all the fun out of the game. I don't want to spend 4 hours preparing for a 2 hour raid just to get it down to 90 minutes. 
---
If you're having problems with the encounters, sure use all the tools at your disposal but using them for trivial content makes no sense.
---
You're potentially wasting a lot of gold playing like that too.
---
Blood wasnt good DPS in ICC. The diseaseless cheese spec was viable in the first tier and thats it
---
We established this 
---
I've been spending my time playing Total War: Warhammer 2, Divinity: Original Sin 2 and Witcher 3 (never played it before). There's tons of great games that came out in the past year. Mostly PS4.
---
"Diablo's death was not of your making..."
---
Beware of this scenario. “The crucial roles had been taken”. In this situation, many people will alter their class choice or ultimate goals to appease a group of people they don’t know. Inevitably these guilds turn out to be in a FAR worse situation than fresh guilds... Inevitably everyone will level at different paces, you will have level 30 priests who are heal officers while the core group is singing 60 and those officers begin gatekeeeping the guild from adding members and so on and so forth. It’s always better to meet people who are at a similar position as you are instead of limiting your options and being strapped down with no guarantee.
---
But muh epic gm bis set
---
Honestly, those classes would benefit most with a warrior buddy. Especially someone experienced with the game. You could get by with Druid or Paladin ok, but with that clothie lineup, you wont need to be a hybrid for anything. Side benefit being warriors are great end game if you really commit, so maybe after awhile you wanna really get into warrior, you already have one high level.
---
yeh thats true, didnt think of that
---
I haven’t played wow since vanilla. I played alliance back in the day. Want to roll horde this time just to see what the other side was like. Simple as that.
---
The 8-piece bonus mentions healing your GROUP not your whole raid. I don't think it will help much. And you're only going to auto-attack if not casting... so if you want to be a raid healer &amp; constantly casting... this won't be doing anything useful for you. Plus this set has strength on it (for ret) which ends up lowering the potential amount of +healing/int you could be getting (compared to leather/cloth gear). 
---
Or are you looking to be ret? 
---
I do remember seeing my fair share of full sets of this being used back in Vanilla, but back then it seemed like 90% of what you saw people were always struggling to get gear and would use just about anything. Will be curious to see how it turns out these days. 
---
I like the effect that "bis" being a thing has as far as loot distribution goes, honestly.In a way it dies narrow upgrade options, but it also adds a bit of guarantee. I know I can get fang of the faceless now, even though I'll have to stick with my AV xbow a bit longer while striker's mark goes to a rogue. 
---
I'm not sure how big of an effect that has on caster gear, though. But I like the idea of less wasted upgrades. In the end it benefits everyone more, just so long as people don't go overboard on requiring it beforehand or having gear score mods
---
Hah, I remember farming for the green ooze pet that turned you green, for, like, days and so, just so I could earn enough gold for a mount. It sold quite well, 5k or so. 
---
TB was always less busy than Org, and it had gentle tauren music instead of the constant drums and grunts/shouts. And yeah seemed easier to navigate too. 
---
Can't go wrong with either one really... 
---
I don't know if it fits, but I always liked Alterac Mountains.
---
What a pet can eat is such an underrated quality.  That's why I always liked boars
---
/r/MurderedByWords
---
What you mean by timing SS if horde ?
---
WPvP and city raids were a huge part of classic. If they cant be done due to server issues then Classic will fail and thats alot of time and money they threw away.
---
I played vanilla when it was live. I mained a hunter back then and this coming summer, I'm going to play as a warlock. I can say that I've played every expansion (at least some) and the Rhok Delar quest chain was definitely the most fun/memorable experience in the game. It made me feel awesome doing all that stuff, and then finally getting the sweet bow and staff. I'm going with warlock this time around only because I already did the hunter thing and I'm looking for something new. I was playing warlock on a private server, and made it up to high 40's when blizzard announced classic and stopped. Both are solid choices and useful end game. Side caveat - If the class spread is anything like it was when vanilla was live, it may be harder to get into a group as a hunter. This is cause they have slightly lower dps then the other classes end game, and hunters are usually fairly heavily populated. 
---
Yup, that would be Nethergarde mine, in the Blasted Lands directly next to the path to/from Swamps of Sorrow.
---
I played Alliance Vanilla-BC, and Horde hardcore in Wotlk. 
---
I think I'll play Horde again in Classic for my main, but may end up rolling an alliance alt later &amp; do things slower when/if I have downtime. I remember loving Redridge Mountains back in 2005, vastly preferring it over Duskwood. 
---
I feel the best way would just be to never increase the max level. Make the starting quests and mobs in TBC scale to about a tier 2 difficulty level. You walk in with greens and blues from a fresh 60 and you’re gonna get 1 shot and not complete any quests.  Also you could add some random drop in mc or BWL that you need to be able to use professions in tbc, like a scroll or something....makes old raids still needed.
---
Sure a few TBC geared people could help a fresh 60 out, but they could also run you through raids so it’s the same concept.
---
Just a thought...
---
Ironforge all day long.
---
Made up stories from Private servers. Blues didn't have their current stats until wayyy into vanilla, same applies for T1 and T2. People were getting their set and were happy about it. Made it to 10/15 Nax in a guild were consumables were only used by the main tank or a few people in the raid. Hit cap was mentioned time to time, but most casters were not hit capped. 
---
[Demonstrably false.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ah5p2o/did_warriors_charge_put_you_into_combat_in_vanilla/eebq9cm/)
---
Typical gnome hates all other races
---
Depends what you are farming and your faction. Generally, as Horde, I'd say Undercity for being right in the middle (or near, anyhow) of Eastern Kingdoms and with access to the zeppelin. For Alliance, Menethil Harbor for similar reasons. That being said, you will likely end up making it in one of the major hubs instead, because of the social contact necessary, trade channel recruitment for groups (LFG channel is fine, but not everyone will use it). It really depends a lot on how the community builds up. If they manage to stick all the recruitment for groups to the LFG channel it'd be easier, you could stay tuned in while farming somewhere, but we have no guarantees. 
---
I laugh every time they say that guilds doing NAX were flasked and world buffed. Most guilds stopped at Four Horsemen not because of buff, but because of a lack of tanks. I made it to 10/15 NAX and I can count on one hand the number of times I took a flask on my mage. 
---
Those ogres would wreck you too. They also tended to shout and draw other ones. I remember that being one of the toughest group quests.
---
Cheney/Bush!

Westfall FP is there on 1.12

Blood elf warlock, I think she was demo. Got her to top level (70) and then lost that account. I just liked the appeal of the "dark magic" elf.
---
What if there’s an item that no one wants to suicide for, but it could still be used?   Does it get DE’d?  
---
Under city was mine
---
My original post was removed because they thought the set name was a private server or maybe I messed that up so I was in a rage reposting lol. The set is for soloing content. So me going prot/holy to solo as much content as I possibly can is my goal and the 8pc with reckoning will be solid healing. Combine that with sapper charges and seal of light consecrate and a shield spike and some random reflect if there is anymore to get I will be doing solid dmg. My goal is to solo maraudon uldaman scholo dire maul. It doesn’t have to be efficient. I just want to do it. That set bonus will get me going in that direction. Cheers and ty for the repost. I feel inspired!
---
This, I was like "WOW" when I heard that some guild flasked a whole raid to get world first. And I made it to 10/15 Nax. I feel like the people on private server are try hard that never made it to NAX back in vanilla and have this idea that everyone was flasked and world buffed. Which is absurd. 
---
Ele shamans problem always has been, and always will be, running out of mana before the boss runs out of health.

Best spot fir allies no question.

This is an amazing example I've found, he charges NEVER AUTOS HIM and is clearly in combat based off of his mount. A horrible look for blizzard's "reference server" and classic.
---
Warm bodies is the keyword. It seemed like in any 40man (PUGs or casual ones), you constantly had 5 people almost always dead, 10 people standing in fire, and 20 of them all auto-attacking/not giving it their 100%, keyboard turning, maybe press a button here or there. It was abysmal looking back. The 10-20 people who were really paying attention did a lot of the work to keep things moving (good MT/OT, main heals/raid healers, and a few good dps). 
---
I'm not expecting it to be a cakewalk in Classic, it'll definitely maintain its difficulty, but I think the skill of the average player increased greatly in TBC/Wotlk, I know it did for me and everyone around me, I'd expect most of that to be retained in Classic. I don't know how players are these days, every expansion they've made things easier. Those that make it to the end of classic however should be pretty good though. 
---
Might compile all these into a separate post because yeah its really worrying that this is all gonna be brushed aside because of that latest interview.
---
"It's a meme you dip" is a meme (you dip) :)
---
and why pally t2 boots? 
---
tell em about classic
---
I think this is probably the most accurate prediction I've seen for how Classic will be. I think you're right about most of what you said. 
---
Same thing for my guild that made it to 11/15 Nax. Outside of MT and some healers, no one gave a shit of your spec and at least 5 to 10 people in most guilds were meat bag doing bad DPS or bad healing. 
---
I geared for pvp and I don't even remember trying to achieve hit cap and I was my guild top mage dps.
---
Blizzard cannot be saved. Don't kid yourself.
---
Loot council sucks imo for one simple reason: I join a raiding guild to gear a character in the way I want and I want a fair chance in the regard. I don't want some other guy to decide on what items I can and cannot have. Of course taking into account class priorities. 
---
I started playing towards the end of Vanilla and was hardcore raiding throughout WotLK.  I’m going to play casually this time around, and one of the reasons is that I have no desire to step inside Naxxramas ever again, simply because of how much time I was in there during WotLK. I know that it’s different, but not really.  Especially as a healer, I was constantly being begged by friends to come heal their Naxx raid.  Every week.  Other content, like ZG, I CANNOT WAIT to get into again.  I miss the old ZG so much. 
---
So what if paul passes on all loot in a raid to get rid of the negative on his name but a piece drops that everyone passes on including paul but it’s an upgrade for paul still. Does it get sharded or is paul allowed to speak up? Does taking items no one needs mean he keeps that negative? I’d rather he scoop up scraps he needs over sharding it. At least that way he has no priority and only gets it if no one else wants it. 
---
I love loot council. It’s worked in every guild I’ve used it in and I was never an officer. It’s more than one person deciding.

I don't think you'll be able to solo Scholo, I remember in 5-man groups we'd always have to CC just about everything in order to get anything accomplished, but I wish ya luck! Maybe not ulda either. Definitely should be able to do the others though. 
---
It really is insane the pure damage you get from those world buffs. I'd like to see the pure numbers on a rogue with vs without warchief's blessing, onyxia buff, zg buff, DM tribute buffs, and darkmoon fair buffs. That's

- +15% attack speed
---
- +340 attack power
---
- +5% crit

- +15% to all stats

- +1-10% extra damage
---
Absolutely insane
---
I raided in classic and my experience was similar to this too. My guild was progressing through AQ40 when TBC was announced and we didn't use consumables, I didn't even know world buffs existed besides rallying cry of the dragonslayer, I never heard the term "BiS" until much later, etc. 
---
My concern is come Classic WoW it's not going to be the same "meta" so to speak that vanilla WoW had. It's going to be much closer to current WoW or what you see on private servers and you're going to see people inspecting at IF bridge making sure you already have basically all the gear you could need from the raid just to get into the group. This will be compounded even further by how lockouts work, once you get saved to a raid you can't join another one that week so people won't be willing to take risks imo.
---
I played a NE Feral Druid in 2005 and got to rank 12. I would do very well in BG's and even better in wPvP...maybe everyone was just shitty back then. But having the ability to stealth and deal a decent amount of damage, pop out to throw a few HoT's and then keep attacking was great. One of my favorite classes/specs for PvP. With good gear you can absolutely kill people.

NEET.
---
A developer should never have to bury their game...
---
This is a dedicated sub so it's gonna have a higher % hardcore players.
---
&gt; The only thing left in Blizzard that is reminiscent of old times are  some 'rogue' developers who will attempt good game design despite  pressure from corporate bosses. 
---
And Overwatch, lead my daddy Jeff Kaplan

Cheers ty
---
I agree with everything you said, except I think that the chance of success for Classic is not small, it's actually really really huge. I think people overall underestimate how genius this game was, and how much potential it still have, even in 2019
---
Hey, thanks for responding to the post. I actually didn't expect so much interest, but about 10 people have reached out so far! So, I threw together a reddit community that I think would be a great place for us to start.
---
https://www.reddit.com/workingadultsguild
---
One of the other members that's joining is setting up a Discord server. I'll post that to the reddit channel when it's up. I also posted some basic information about what I'd like to see in the guild, proposed DKP system, etc.
---
If you guys are interested, we'd love to have to have you. And please, feel free to comment on anything you'd like to see once we roll into WoW Classic!
---
I feel this is true as well. Unless Blizzard can somehow become a private company again, like Bungie recently did. But I guess this is not possible in the case of Blizzard?
---
You have to find a guild that fits your schedule. 
---
I have a full time 2-11PM monday-friday job. I also have 2 kids and a wife who is a teacher. So i always get monday-friday mornings off!
---
I found a hardcore guild that raids from 7am-noon.
---
It might be logical, but doing it different is what the US does. Seeing a US school right it differently is definitely a red flag. 
---
It was patched out before 1.12
---
But the game pretty much doesn't need more development after the initial Classic version is finished. There will be no new content. Perhaps every few years there might be an update needed for a new version of Mac OS and Windows and apart from that the occasional bug fix. That the original WoW dev team is gone, is at least in my point of view of no concern. 
---
Oh ok sweet. Getting a piece of Tier gear for a class we couldn't play when only a few pieces dropped for entire raid really felt like a kick in the nuts, lol.
---
Personally I'm banking leave days to spend when classic comes out. Should have 2-3 weeks, easy enough time to get 60 in ~1 week IRL time, then make a few thousand gold before people catch up.
---
Rank 14 you pretty much gotta be unemployed or a streamer though. 
---
Yep, pretty close to Theramore. Go say hi to the Varian, he's being held in the prison below.
---
Break up with your significant other/make them play with you, quit your job, move in with your relatives, stock up on caffeine and snackums, prepare the sock or bedpan, and put on the heavy metal.
---
I do soler penels 
---
It was? I thought patch 2.0.3 just 'fixed it' by giving the factions the other classes. 
---
I'm a loser, my friend is a day trader.
---
I would say figure out what Race/Class/Faction you want to play so you are not giving up a character at 20 because you dislike it. Best way to do this is either hop on a private server or watch videos of the class you're interested in.
---
Other than that, figuring out your professions early will save you a lot of headaches down the road. Nothing sucks more than throwing away a profession with 100+ in it because you decided something else is better.
---
Usually work part time/unemployed or students. You also basically have to not have a gf as well.
---
This is probabaly the funniest post I read today. Dunno why it made me lol though haha
---
Nope, because there is something i can do about that.
---
There is a good game, and classic will be a good game.
---
I was a NEET when i got r14 in 2005. The cap for the person with most honor was 500k to 600k honor on my server back then. It was definitely possible to get R14 if you had a job.
---
But on pservers, it's a different story. On a popular one, during AB weekend, some people got over 2M honor. To get that much honor, you have to be a NEET or multiple people playing your account. It's mathematically impossible to get that much honor without playing 14+ hours a day. Remember that on pservers, there are a lot of people from countries with a high unemployment rate so you better be a NEET if you wanna compete with them.
---
imo, since the pvp honor system will come out much later in the Classic timeline and people are better at raiding, there might be less people doing hardcore pvp this time around when you can get epics earlier and easier in PvE.
---
A lot of BiS lists comes with knowledge of everything that is currently available and what is coming next.  
---
I like world buffs but I also like how certain private servers disable them during the first month of new content release.
---
Kargath as horde :P
---
What the article is saying, and I guess I can't blame you because it's kinda lost in translation, is that Charge itself did not make a creature aggro you - it was the auto attacking that followed it that made the creature attack you. He's not talking about Charge putting you in combat or not. This is why he specifically gives the neutral creature example - in this situation you charge and cancel the auto attack so the creature does not turn hostile to you because you did not auto attack it. In contrast on retail (and on private servers) if you charge a giraffe in the barrens and cancel the auto attack before you reach it, the create is still hostile to you even though you never hit it.
---
I still like EPGP the best. Show up? Get EP. Kill bosses? Get EP. An hour passes? Get EP. Get gear? Get GP. You and someone else want that item? EP/GP higher number gets it. Decay at 20% each week.
---
Other than moving back with my parents everything else is gunna be ready :p
---
I lost the only gf I ever had when I did the pvp grind in 2016. I don't recommend it. I'm 37.
---
Thank you, building on this reply I think I'll jump on a sever and try each class I'm interested in to 20
---
You forgot Songflower buff: +5 Crit and +15 all stats.  Also the 83 first fire resist buff from mind controlling the mob inside UBRS has been extremely common to do before entering MC/BWL.
---
It would actually be like saying mm:ss:hh :)
---
I’d say it will, at least in the first few months when they’re sorting the bugs out 
---
do you guys have a single video of 
---
&gt; If you attack a **neutral creature** and turn off the Auto Attack while your character is still heading toward the enemy, he will come out of the Stun and then walk away as if you were not there
---
or are we just going to keep linking pvp videos?  
---
The good thing is, Blizzard or Activision now can just buy John Staats book to remember how a good game is created.
---
[Ah](https://i.imgur.com/1WU8ron_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium)
---
I used to show up as a Moonkin when I was 12/13 and do shit DPS, buuut we never got passed the second boss in BWL. Never killed Hakkar. Cleared MC, did some AQ bosses I think?
---
We were pretty casual, but I was also young.
---
Didn't started to get good at the game until WotLK.
---
wetlands for alliance is uno1
---
Hmm, I could have sworn it was patched, but I can’t see it in the patch notes right now. I’ll have another look later, but you might be right.
---
I did consider that a possibility, that he was only referring to Charge causing a neutral creature to aggro even if you don't cause any damage, but in the context they were talking about things people reported as bugs in the Demo that were actually functioning correctly I don't think that is what he is saying (although you could be right).
---
How Charge worked in the Demo was clearly not how it worked in 1.12 based off the videos that /u/leaguesky posted, so hopefully you are correct and that is something that they know wasn't working as intended and fix for Classic.
---
Yeah, a ton of stuff in the demo did not work like it did in vanilla. At least we now know they did read all the feedback from players about stuff not working correctly and went to check/fix it, so hopefully when an alpha/beta is out it will be much closer to 1.12.1.
---
Getting mistaken for a girl when talking on vent is probably up there
---
It’s taken me about 7 tries to get a Druid to level cap 
---
I guess thunderfury was a bad example since it took a player finishing the questline first, unlike items on loot tables.
---
Yes this works too.
---
The reset command was usable though while soloing instanced content.
---
Grom gol for horde, close to Zeppelins for orgrimmar and uc, Access to top half of each continent. And close to booty bay for bottom half of kalimdor. Also close to blackrock mountain, zg for raids. Also for hunters there is a class trainer there.
---
Do research about life post-60 as well.  
---
Playing a druid 1-60 is fun, feral is great, and it's a tier 1 leveling class.  
---
You reach 60 and 95% of the population is going to automatically assume you're a healer because that's their strongest spec at 60, and in a lot of cases the only raid-viable spec.  
---
&gt;Nothing like looking at the point totals and realizing that you'll never get certain drops unless certain people stop showing up to raids.
---
 
---
Sounds like an issue that could be solved with a low hard cap on DKP.
---
No, this was patched out at some point.
---
I started raiding after it was patched out, which is why it was so hilarious to us when 2.0.3 dropped and we were getting Shaman tier gear in MC/BWL.
---
Fun fact: In vanilla there was an exploit you could do that went like this:  
---
If you're Horde, for example, you'd have an Alliance hunter and mage kite an innkeeper, any innkeeper, to Blackrock Mountain (or any location you want) The mage is there to sheep the innkeeper for re-heal. Hunter preferably reducing his damage by as much as possible. When the Innkeeper arrived where you wanted him, he would be too far away from home to "run back", and so he would just evade. During this evade, a horde character could speak to him and set a hearth point. In vanilla, hearth points were spells that were cast on you and recorded your current position to the stone (you can LOS a hearthstone spell for example, if you've ever set a hearth and wonder why it didn't work)  
---
I don't know when this was fixed, and I doubt you will be able to do it in Classic, but it was cool either way.  
---
Worth?
---
5hr raids for Classic???
---
You trying to do MC+BWL+AQ40 in the one session or something?
---
Sbux - I always have weekend off, so I am just gonna take a week absent, so I will have 2 weekends and a work week to no-life. 
---
I wonder that too sometimes, then again I know a couple people (I wouldn't call them friends) who are able to play video games all day and are supported by their affluent mothers.... at ~26 years old /smh.
---
Working 40+ hours a week makes the pvp grind undoable, not that I would feel compelled to no-life that hard, even if I had the time.
---
Tier 2 is holy gear dude.  All Paladin plate in raiding its holy. Pvp gear is hybrid,  but closer to ret than anything else you'll find. 
---
Mine is a sad tale and I shall share a brief version of it and hope others don’t get dragged into the dichotomy I am stuck in.
---
I first played Alliance.  None of my other friends played WoW at the time.  Throughout leveling, multiple friends started playing and planned to play with me.
---
Two ended up just rolling Horde on another server and left me to my Alliance.  Thankfully, I had two other people from school that joined me and we were really good guild buddies.
---
Funnily enough, I never talk to these two outside of WoW (and one high school class shared with one of them) and have not since.
---
Just before Cata came out, they stopped and I trooped on my own.  My guild disbanded and one of my previous Horde friends had a need on their server.
---
He was the guild leader and one of his friends/officers paid for my character transfer and faction change.  We did ICC 10 or 25 (I don’t remember which) with me as a tank for my first time tanking a raid.
---
Ever since then, all of my characters have been Horde.  I miss the Alliance, but I am more empathetic to the Horde story.  I also like to try being a special snowflake and see that the Horde is slightly less popular according to polls and census data.
---
So ultimately, I’m horrendously split between the two and don’t want to make a mistake like the multiple issues my retail account has.
---
I'm a labourer and hired as a casual so they can skip out on paying me any additional benefits. (IDK about the rest of the world, but it's the norm here.)
---
So when Classic comes out, I'll just tell them that I'm only available for 1-3 days over the next month. Or maybe not at all.
---
That’s still perfectly valid. Blood DK DPS was monstrous with Shadowmourne.
---
What market is your friend in? Is he making bank or just making a living?
---
Then you can get first pic on raid pieces
---
IF for Alliance.
---
Mages had the luxury of freely teleporting to capital cities, therefore were able to choose a more convenient Hearth. Some did Feralas for DM farming,  others Tanaris, but usually people chose the lower half of Kalimdor since it was the furthest to access for Alliance.
---
Tier 0 didn't have class requirements
---
When i look on classic db , judgement seems to have nice stamina and strength. 
---
&gt;a warrior could wear they pally stuff
---
Good joke. :) 
---
&gt;mm:ss:hh
---
See what I mean!
---
&gt;right 
---
:)
---
I am considering changing factions.
---
Through most of my time playing WoW I played horde. But with the release of Classic I am considering alliance. Mainly because my main will be druid and the Night Elf forms are more beautiful and also I would like to experience alliance questing a bit more.
---
I like to have my main and alts on the same faction, so I can create a guild bank for my chars and easily share crafting items and have more space in personal banks for things like gear and utility items.
---
Eventually I'd like to level at least the following alts:
---
- Warrior
---
- Warlock
---
- Shaman
---
The problem of course is that shaman isn't available on alliance. Perhaps my shaman would have to play alone on horde faction or I should just not bother playing the shaman. Or perhaps just play horde.
---
Choices, choices ...
---
My guild used SK throughout TBC and WOTLK and it worked pretty damn well, though there were some glaring downsides that we had to address through our own modifications. 
---
People would avoid taking any gear at all even for off spec use. This was a problem for us as a small guild because we very often had people play their character in more than one spec. With DKP you can spend just a little bit of points to get an item that wasn't a big upgrade, but SK forces you right to the bottom of the loot priority list if you take anything at all. We eventually had to create a rule where taking an off spec item would only drop you a couple spots on the list. I can't remember if it was 3 or 4 positions, but it worked VERY well for us with almost all hybrid class players taking off spec loot. 
---
Another change that worked very well for us was making the loot priority list completely invisible to everyone but the GM/Master looter. Yes, people could mentally keep track of where they were, but we noticed a marked improvement in terms of people taking loot, even when it was only a small upgrade. 
---
Overall SK worked out very well for us except for the fact that our guild's first skull of guldan wen't to a fucking moonkin.
---
You can count out the combat icon on the portrait as proof since this appears when auto attack is activated.
---
Also the fading of food and mount on the action bars could be a result of being stuck in a stasis during the charge animation.
---
It is still a possibility that it functioned differently in PvP as opposed to charging a neutral mob or critter. 
---
This case isn't closed yet.
---
Hunter all the way. Most fun class imo, especially pvp. 
---
That f’ing quest was the worst.  THE DEN
---
Depends on the day but yes its 1-2 instances a day
---
Ah ok thanks for the clarification. I thought private servers might not be a good indication as they aren't always identical to retail (at the time) numbers but if they are confirmed vanilla XP rates then should be kinda accurate.
---
The fact that everything has been datamined and optimal routes calculated makes total sense - we know so much more about the game nowadays than we did back then (early thottbot compared to current wowhead).
---
Still crazy that people can sink in 120 hours between Tuesday-Sunday, thats like 20 hours a day! I think I'll be lucky to do 2 hours a day :p
---
I thought there were 60's in something ridiculous like 5 days on northdale... but I also think his guild was pumping him through so they could own devilsaur spawn
---
A week off? I could get to 50 I think. Enough to be ahead of the masses hopefully
---
Super rich, sitting on my laptop with a martini in Greece just pumping out kobolds
---
Right. Why exactly did we get 2 factions instead of 3, 4? Forsaken should have been it's own faction (with racial choices of human, dwarf, blood elf) and Night Elf another. I'm not sure how you'd impart more races to Night Elf though it's possible they'd be the eventual allies of Draenei and Worgen.
---
  
---
But from a game play aspect who cares if there's more than 2 factions as long as the classes are balanced between them? You have your faction and all the other 3 are enemies. Would make for some really cool world pvp
---
probably crypto, you can make bank 
---
Probably came from old school RuneScapes success... that’d be my guess
---
T2.5 is (near) worthless for healing priests. The guild token shadow priest should be gearing up hardcore in AQ.
---
Necro-Knight's is stupidly common in Naxx trash, too. It's BiS for PvP.
---
Plus, you're theh only caster that doesn't really stack spell crit (it's mostly worthless for shadow), so pure spell damage gear, like the hat off Heigan, is really good for you and not so much for mages/locks.
---
But otherwise, ya, you're right!
---
Spelling might be logical, but doing it different is what the US does. 
---
I'm a geologist but I mostly am in the office these days. I play games in my office. 
---
My guild was top 500 worldwide throughout tbc and wotlk on only 8 hours of raiding per week and we used suicide kings. 
---
So many serious comments :0
---
I just wanted to say that this is a too notch meme.
---
It might help to find an instant 60 server and try clssses at 60 first to get a feel for what’s fun without a lot of time commitment.
---
Then play the 1-3 contenders to 20-30ish
---
Melee hunter 
---
yeah, simple decision for Alliance. Near the ships, near MC and BWL
---
My guild fixed this by simply freezing your position if you weren't there. You just couldn't move up the list unless you were present for raids and people would indeed jump over you in line. So yeah I guess if you stopped showing up while you were at the very top of the list you could theoretically just swoop in and take a good item when you know we're working on a boss that drops nice gear. But we were a small guild so we also demanded over 90% attendance unless there was some extreme circumstance that was obviously more important than the raid you agreed to show up to when you joined the guild. 
---
I don't think r14 will be achieved by only one person. 
---
It's going to be done by a group of friends. 
---
At least that is what I suspect. 
---
Personally my goal is just r10. R14 is even too hardcore for me. 
---
Be prepared to log off in STV and do something else. 
---
60s on both sides are ruthless. 
---
I tried to switch to the alliance, it was a total disaster.
---
I thought it would be cool to see the game from a new perspective, but I just ended up missing the other side. 
---
The good thing is, I got to test some classes and didn't spoil anything. 
---
So hyped for horde. 
---
ok buddy 
---
I think there's merit in wanting to relive the good ol' days and stay on your faction *or* choosing a new experience.
---
Thanks! I'm excited about classic :) 
---
Mind if I roll need?
---
Us fans are Gandalf in that last panel
---
You can smash out MC+BWL in 2hrs.
---
AQ40 is around 2hrs, maybe 3hrs if you're just starting to do it.    
---
Naxx is ~2.5-3.5hrs.
---
If you're in a "casual" guild that waits 1hr for everyone to finally rock up, then do full trash clears, stand around doing nothing after each boss while loot gets done and take a 30min bio break which turns into an hour break because some people are still AFK, the yeah, maybe 5hrs.
---
But if you've found a hardcore guild, as you say, you shouldn't ever need 5hr raid slots.
---
Even if you're trying to clear 2 raids a night.
---
I work in hospitality and i've just said i'm not available for 3 weeks straight sometime the middle of the year. its cool. I'm single and dont have wife and kids so whenever a mmo expac or launch comes I do this and it's awesome 
---
They were absolutely a problem in raids. I very clearly remember getting shaman T1 in raids as alliance.
---
So was naxx really this hard and are the stats explain true?? I watched this a month or so ago and thought most people wont ever see all of naxx
---
https://youtu.be/XBPHRlgczmk
---
Used to run a LC guild. The amount of conversation and discussion about how to maximize distribution and do it fairly was enough to make it the hardest shit ever. Honestly, working in emergency medicine was less stressful sometimes than doing loot
---
Loot council is always helping officers
---
All a hunter needs is a nightfall. Everything else is a waste of gear that could go to another class. They can max out hit with blues and greens.
---
This is the elitist stuff people are talking about by the way. I'm just joking. For the most part lol
---
Favorite item ever in the game, hit 100% ArP with the proc. Just sat outside ICC and when I saw someone walk by would pop all my cd's and 1 shot them, haha.
---
If you don't know too much already, I'd actually suggest going in somewhat blind.
---
It's pretty rare that you get the chance to enjoy being a noob these days.
---
Depends on the server. For instance, horde on nost PvE server would do their ranking for about 20-25 hours a week. A lot of playtime for sure, but compared to the Wild West of old vanilla, it’s not that bad for items that last till naxx
---
Loot council where every week different regular members are included for transparency isn't that bad. 
---
probably yeah. The person at the bottom of the list can always take it since they won’t be safricing their spot. They’re already at the bottom of the list, so taking the sacrifice won’t move them any further down
---
Nice, I’ll try them out. I’ve been trying to get Grid and Clique set up like that for ages and I could never get it just right. 
---
can’t tell if you’re trolling. 60 in a week. when was the last time you did that grind in vanilla? 
---
buddy below saying you need 14 hours a day to hit rank 14 on pservers. misinformation flying all over the place. 
---
I did r13 twice on pservs while I was in college, during the summer months. I had a part time job at a restaurant but only worked 12-15 hours/week while I was ranking. 
---
Premaded for 16-18 hours/day and slept about ~4 hours/night on average. Only got through it with copious amounts of caffeine and the fact that I was prescribed ADHD meds
---
All I can find is references to drops occurring as part of the 2.0 patch right before TBC dropped. So almost certainly it wasn't a thing in 1.12.
---
https://www.engadget.com/2006/12/07/judgement-dropping-for-horde-working-as-intended/
---
I couldn't find any reference to Shaman/Paladin drops being fixed for Alliance/Horde in any of the vanilla patch notes, but there are a few notes that are just vague like 'adjusted loot tables in Molten Core'. So if it ever was a thing, then it could have occured then, or it was hotfixed, or it just wasn't included in patch notes at all.
---
needles cougar has 1.2 attack speed. its close to as good at BT and 10 days less grinding, so id recommend that instead
---
god damn the IQ of this sub is low. 
---
It's not misinformation. The amount you have to play yo reach r14 varies based on how much honor everyone else on your faction accumulates each week. If your faction is small and communicates well (like on the old pve server he is referring to), then it is possible to lower the total hours everyone spends and achieve the same goal.

fucking bank dude. and he barely has to work at all. definitely drop out of school and learn day trading by reading various blogs. best advice i ever got. 
---
Yeah tbh it can be horribly abused, but if you have a good guild i think its a fine system. Last guild had great officers.
---
Still have a screenshot somewhere from winning felstriker 
---
There's a part of me that likes the idea.
---
But realistically, it would never work.
---
-
---
There are many different types of players out there. And only some of them like raiding. Some will only play Classic because TBC was their favourite expansion and they're just hanging out for that. Or maybe they wont play at all and they'll just wait for TBC.
---
Forcing players to get through all of that raid content, that they might not enjoy, just so they can access TBC sounds like a really bad idea when thinking of it practically.
---
I like the horde infrastructure. I can't stand alliance for that single reason. 
---
That's actually a good idea 
---
This is extremely calming to read. I was getting worried about the culture classic would have. 
---
Wasn't there a blue post on forums just few days, maybe weeks ago where a community manager said Activision doesn't have that huge influence on Blizzard as people think?
---
People should stop blaming Activision for everything bad, it's mostly Blizzard and only Blizzard ruining themselves. It's just that people need to blame this shit that's been happening in the past few months on someone else than Blizzard because they still think it's still that good old Blizzard that can't do wrong.
---
I 2nd this. Going in without knowing shit is the best way to go. Take your time to find a class, leveling, exploring. The endgame content wont run away.
---
Guilds that truly have MC on farm can bang it out in legit ~42 minutes. Dont have to be crazy hardcore, just on the same page.
---
Finishing that and BWL under 2 hours is pretty legit though, fastest i think we've done both is like an hour and 45 firing on all cylinders.
---
Wait.. I thought blizz was starting Classic off in the earlier patches then slowly releasing content leading up to naxx content. 
---
I agree it's easy to see the idea of corporate overlords as universally evil when the truth is always more complex.  I saw the meme originally without the last bit with Gandalf so I added it, thinking people here would get a kick out of it ;) 
---
Mage. But if you are playing a warrior or other melee a paladin would be a good pocket healer too.
---
We've been doing ~1hr 10min BWLs.
---
There's a few trash skips that you can do.    
---
Things like skipping techies and going straight for Vale.
---
Or getting a hunter to pull the room post vale, the raid running up to the suppression rooms, then the hunter FDs and gets summoned back.
---
Or the raid using invis pots to skip the three drakes (I think) and running straight to Ebonroc.
---
Little things like everyone having 1 sand to remove the bronze after Chromaggus can speed things up a little bit too.
---
Then yeah, quick jump down to MC for a 40min clear and BAM, MC + BWL in 2hrs.
---
No? There are way more Resto druids than feral druids.
---
I would have my partner play whatever they think they might like idk she probably has her own brain and thoughts 
---
Yes, and then they need to take gear from both your MT and your full time furies. Is that really beneficial to the guild as a whole when a Feral can offtank perfectly fine? Assuming both players tryhard, the feral wont even be that far behind when you account for Leader of the Pack in a stacked melee group.
---
For sure a Druid. Tauren. 
---
&gt;If you only want to play few hours a day (or few hours a week), feral druid is perfectly fine and will find spots in casual/semi-hc guilds.
---
And this is why the meme exist that feral is trash. Because players who can only play a few hours a week pick a spec that you need to tryhard more than almost any other spec to succeed at and tries to raid with it.
---
If you can only play a few hours a week, pick a healer. All you need to get for raids would be mana pots.
---
Don't get me wrong, it's still funny. It's just that I've noticed so many people, on this sub or on any other sub related to Blizzard games, blame everything on Activision without even mentioning Blizzard. 
---
Im pretty sure it wont change much. Same story with blizzard. 
---
Looking at this 26 days too late, LOL. I’m guessing the deleted pictures were just areas made up by exterior level designers to spruce up an otherwise empty landscape. Not planned or even named. Just a little whimsy, using art assets (and in the troll village case, dance animations) to make something cool. Probably took only a few hours to make each “Easter egg.”
---
Don't you guys have phones????
---
&gt;If you pull threat or the tank gets CC'd or something and the entire mob group scatters and starts beating on you, you need to use whatever tricks you have to not die right away
---
If you pull aggro, the tank suck.
---
If the tank gets CC'ed, which almost never happens. [https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=3387](https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=3387)
---
&gt;Yeah tbh it can be horribly abused, but if you have a good guild i think its a fine system.
---
If you abuse it, you will find that the every good player you screwed over has left the guild. And since classic is like 2 years of progression, i would much rather keep the core intact than hoard items for myself or friends.
---
It's still like this on private servers as well. I got invited to join a guild for their first try at MC when I was still lvl 59, and basically only wearing greens. I managed to hit lvl 60 one hour before the raid, but we still had a lvl 59 in the raid for our first couple of tries. 9 months later we are currently progressing in Naxx and clear AQ40 weekly, where our first C'Thun kill was with a boomkin, two feral druids, one ret pala and a spriest. 
---
Assuming the private server crowd is generally more hardcore/dedicated than your average classic player, this style of progression/guilds will most likely be very common in Classic
---
Even if this was the case in Vanilla, i dont think it will be all that easy this time. Reason you ask?  
---
In Vanilla, it was all that wow was. Everyone playing WoW was playing vanilla. Everyone was noobs except for the top % HC players. Hence easy to find noobs to create casual guilds with.   
---
Now though, only the top % HC vanilla players + a buch of oldies are comming back. Meaning the playerbase will be vastly different then it was 14 years ago. There will ofcourse be guilds with that mentality still, but i belive they will struggle to find enough ppl
---
T2 was originally a ret set back when T2 dropped in MC, then it was removed and revamped for BWL (1.4?). After the release of BWL it was a pure healing set for a short while I believe, before it was changed at some point (1.9?) to be more hybrid oriented. It seems to have decent str and +spell dmg and a +spell dmg set bonus in its 1.12 status so some ret paladins used it, but if you’re gonna PvP as ret just go for full on str and crit gear similar to Warrior pvp stuff, this is much better than str and spell damage.
---
Some Paladins wore T2.5 as well, which was a very nice set for ret, but was considerably harder to get.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=505
---
This is not true, since improved shadow bolt can’t stack the chances of your warlocks shadow bolts consuming all 5 charges before critting again and refreshing it are significantly low. Let’s say a miracle happens and you have 10 hunters in a raid and only the minimum 3 warlocks for curses. If every one of those hunters has Lupos stealing all that extra shadow damage buff then swapped to a normal cat or wolf, you would absolutely find the dps of the raid go DOWN. 
---
100% true
---
Typical horse can't count past 3.   If you could you would see that I only hate Trolls and undead
---
\&gt; I would have my partner play whatever they think they might like idk she probably has her own brain and thoughts 
---
I'd gather the point of the original question is to get a feel for the difficulty level of the classes to be able to to make educated suggestions to someone. Not to poll the community and make the decision for them.
---
Ive seen the opposite too. Officers/LC members going out of their way not to take almost anything to keep it "fair". When infact it wasnt fair for them, doing the extra work and getting least amount of upgrades.
---
Seen this too, mostly it was between melee dps and tanks taking TPS items. 
---
I'd take a gathering prof for the money if you're dead set on doing enchanting. I think leatherworking and enchanting together would be way too costly to skill while you level to 60. Tailoring is less expensive, but bandages are still useful even on a healing class. I used them plenty raiding in vanilla, an extra mana free heal is not a bad thing to have.
---
For the horde !
---
Except classic, classic always been alliance ! Nostalgia and more !
---
&gt;That's just a bad DKP system. I've been in guilds that give DKP- for noshows, and DKP+ for farming/bringing/using consumes.
---
Sounds like the guy doing the DKP updates, should get DKP for that.
---
Arise, arise, Players of Classic!
---
Spears shall be shaked, shields shall be splintered!
---
Grounding totem, Frost shock and Purge are all insanely valuable, tremor totem as well.
---
You don't have friendly dispells or instant healing like a priest does, so that's your weakness.
---
But really your biggest advantage is that warrior friend you'll have with you who'll murder the face of anyone who looks at you twice with that sweet WF totem.
---
Where does this stupid idea that you shoul "prepare" for the game come form?
---
Seriously, i have never encountered people "preparing" for coming games before like the tend to do for vanilla.
---
On topic: preparing and reading guides is the worst thing you could do now. You are killing classic experience with your own hands.
---
sounds interesting but you most likely need a complicated excel sheet and have to make a huge effort in maintining that list. Also might be overwelming for new recruits I guess.
---
lemme guess: you were never an officer...
---
Their most recent encounter with the Alliance at the time of TBC were Tyrande's sentinels spying, scheming, and sabotaging shit in their homeland while they're recovering from genocide.
---
Thanks. So tier 2.5 or rank 10 ret gear it is
---
Mostly because most Druids aren't dedicated to Feral and just shrug and begin to heal
---
More resto druids (if it were true) doesn't mean the above sentence is right.
---
I hit 60 on a pvt server over Christmas and have cleared everything before AQ since, most raids have contained a feral druid and most guilds I know have one feral druid.
---
Spears shall be shaken, shields shall be splintered! A sword day, a red day, ere the sun rises!
---
For the Horde!
---
Or, some alliance mantra but never played :&lt;
---
Play 12 hrs a day during two weeks and I suppose you are there (with a good route and some discipline). The 1 week irl time is not that real, it’s private servers with shinannigans mostly, or very extreme Joana-ist style marathoning. 
---
&gt;So obviously, Thunderfury goes to the MT and is not suicided for.
---
I hope noone commits suicide if the MT gets Thunderfury o\_O
---
Norm here is that you always get paid monthly with pension saved, paid holiday, and the security to take loans if you need it. But the downside is you always have to be at work :( With exception if you get sick then you dont get paid for the days you are sick obviously :/
---
If you regret, then try to find another one dude
---
tier 2 is good for ret the only problem it has no agility or crit on it. but i would rather have t2 then warrior gear with no int on it or spell power. like young said, t2.5 is the king of ret sets in vanilla and its your ultimate goal. but the rank 10 gear is good too especially with the set bonus to reduce hoj to 30 seconds if you already have it talented. but honestly ive tried grinding for rank 10 as a paladin with bad gear and its not fun at all. when molten core is out you could get t1 and rank as holy
---
What we did, we had a list of every non-tier healer item that dropped from example BWL. Then the CL's of all the healing classes decided that this item is better for example a priest. All items were kinda ranked so that each of the healing classes had items that was prio for them. After the classification we made a rotation based on the prio., because most items are good for almost all healers. 
---
It could be like first 2 were priests, then druid, shammy, priest, shammy, priest shammy etc. On another item they would be shammys on top etc, like i mentioned.
---
After that google excel sheet was done, the CL's put up a names of their own classes to each of those slots. Meaning every item was 100% decided before entering the instance.
---
The weakness of this system is that IF certain 1 item just wont fucking drop ever, the class that has prio on that might suffer a bit. But each classes had multiple items on prio so that helped. And then you had the tier pieces to even out loot distribution for those people that might have been new and thus lower on lists for big ticket items. And sometimes we just adjusted the priorities based on what had dropped to compensate luck of the draw.
---
And then per attendance, performance and what loot you got you could modify your own slots as you went.
---
i will get some holy gear and rank as it. do you rank slower as a healer?
---
&gt;your tank should really only be handling 3+ mobs at a time when things go wrong. Trash Packs are typically 4 max, and most groups will be composed in such a way as to be able to CC 2 mobs. Those that can't typically will have a character or pet that can function as an off-tank.
---
Yeah, and all that relies on the dps being somewhat decent players. 
---
That's what full time or even part time work is like here too.
---
But full/part time roles are almost non-existent for labouring jobs.
---
I am a teacher lol. still I live for classic wow and will abandon everything I have for this game
---
Thanks a lot for your help mate. Yeah I didn't realise that riptide didn't exist in vanilla. Loved that spell during legion.
---
Have a blast on classic mate!
---
&gt; ...do you think most dps will do either of these things?
---
No, but in low level dungeons that's pretty much the only "skill" that is required. This is what I'm talking about, the tank is only expected to carry the group because dps are usually shit. If they are good the tank can be shit and it won't matter much. 
---
Ah okey, like bulding stuff kind of Jobs?
---
Only if you also let someone kick the balls so far up into your body that it can accurately reflect your prepubescent status in 2004.
---
;)
---
no you rank faster because holy is a superior pvp spec to ret. dont get me wrong ret is fun and perfectly fine in pvp but when your holy, your gonna be a way bigger help when it comes to winning bgs and turning the tide of the battle. but once your done ranking dont worry about being ret or anything, always just play whats fun and its pretty fun as a geared ret 
---
Tier 2: https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=217
---
Blue PvP set: https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=401
---
Depends how you play.
---
Not only am I not trolling, I expect world first 60 to be in under 5 days RL time. Possibly even under 4. I'm also predicting Rag to be dead in under 2 weeks from launch.
---
I'm expecting it will take me the full 7 days RL time, playing 16hrs a day, sleeping 8. Possibly with a 30-40hr stretch at the beginning to get ahead of pack.
---
Will be slightly faster if I go hunter, slightly slower if I go priest.
---
SFK and RFK are pretty far. SFK is not very hard to run to from Wetlands though, only problem is all the horde in Hillsbrad. RFK is not very far from Ratchet, although getting to Booty Bay for the ferry can be a bit tough in the early 30s. 
---
SM isn't too bad around lvl 40 though, you have quests in Alterac Mountains anyway. And you would be picking up the FP in Chillwind Point, only problem is running through that forsaken camp into Tirisfal. 
---
This heavily depends on the promised commitment. We are round about 100 people already because we all know that  Classic won't release in the next six months and life happens in between.
---
In my opinion it's the best Thing to get organized and find likeminded people Prior to the release because it will mit ne easy to find a guild with tue Same mindset when you are limited to the server of your choosing
---
the aura, sorry should specify.
---
"Blue collar" work, like building things, warehouse work, factory work, merchandising, machine operator, being an assistant to someone with a trade (while not being an apprentice), etc.
---
But without having a trade to back you up. Like electrician, plumber, etc.
---
Ideally it is always helping good players, but I guess gm's girlfriend took your sword or something.
---
Not to mention, the thing that would decrease warlocks' dps is them having to stop due to threat issues. Them having their shadow bolts do even more dmg would just mean they'd have to stop dmg earlier
---
R10 is a good place to start but you can replace some of the those pieces with non-set epics from early raids.
---
also one more thing. the weapons from rag in MC have a 3.4 weapon speed while the unstoppable force has a 3.8 weapon speed. this means TUF has very similar damage to those weapons but they just do more dps because they are faster. however SoC is based on procs per minute. this is not a limit for how often soc can proc but just a way to figure out its proc %. tuf will be closer to 46% and the mc weapons will be closer to 39% or 40% (im just guessing on these numbers but they will be quite a bit lower) so no matter the weapon speed you get the same amount of procs, faster less proc precentage to make up for the faster speed. that means in pvp since you have poor uptime, your actually getting fewer soc procs on a faster weapon, since it has a lower proc rate. imo this makes tuf&gt; those rag weapons. your big 2 handed upgrade would be ashkandy or hand of rag, but hand of rag has 3% drop rate for the eye.
---
so yea you might be using tuf for awhile
---
https://youtu.be/AgNion-cGRE - From Swifty, you can clearly see the mount icon not fading before the Auto hits. (unsure of the patch but probably early)
---
I agree, gromgol for horde is the best choice
---
Pets also aren't hit capped. They miss/dodge/parry a lot
---
I don't know how it will be on official Classic. But on E he did shadow dmg until 1.9 so it depends on the server
---
If youre gonna play on a PVP server a rogue or Druid for stealth isn’t a bad idea to avoid some frustrating gankage that can drive newbies away.
---
On my german PvP server Kel Thuzad there was exactly one dedicated hardcore ranking premade on horde side. That's 15-20people actually pushing past rank11. I can imagine you can contain bracket breakers reasonably well in such a small sample size.
---
Also on pservers there are a lot of developing world country players who sell their characters once done or sell brackets. A 3000$ r14 character is a lot of money in China, therefore they break brackets and do everything to get their product ASAP.
---
I always figured that we do it in a weird order because that's how we speak the date.
---
People tend to say "January 3rd..." for example, not "The 3rd of January..."
---
I was born in EU but raised US so I've just accepted multiple formats.
---
But a US school wouldn't write the date like it is on this form.
---
It doesn't matter if it is neutral creature of pvp, if it puts you into combat it just does.
---
They love furr
---
OP got gold for this shitty meme
---
I am (and will continue to be) what I call a hardcore casual raider.
---
By that I mean, I will find a raid slot in one of the top guilds, but in an average week I'll only be online for a total of 4-9hrs a week.
---
I'm getting excited for Classic. Last time I had a sub was during BC. I'm thinking of joining a private server to get reacquainted with things. My two mains back then were warrior and rogue and I focused on PVP. This time I want to try out Priest (Probably undead) and focus more on PVE. Ideally I'd like to focus on having high healing for raids. I really don't know much about Priests. I hear most people go Shadow then respec at 40-45 to Holy/Disc for a healing focused Priest. Is that right? Also, should I consider making an alt for farming?
---
Most people playing WoW Classic will come from some of the later expansions. In retail WoW right now you are definitely expected to be specced somewhat correctly and do decent damage if you want to do raiding. Looking up guides for how to play your class is expected of you. Using consumables is maybe not expected, depends on the guild I think. But having decent gear and enchants and stuff is. You won't get into a raid group in retail with random greens and stuff. 
---
People will carry those expectations with them into WoW classic as well. And people will be looking up guides and stuff for how to play their class properly, even casual players. If they manage to do it properly or not is another question, but they will at least try. 
---
The reason people were the way they were back in vanilla was not because the game made them that way, it was because that's the way WoW culture was back then. Now it's different, and will be different in Classic too, even though the game stays the same. 
---
I think we spent 15-20 min arguing everytime a DFT dropped.
---
They're releasing raids in patches. The rest of the game data will presumably be fixed to 1.12, just like private servers do 
---
&gt; Maybe I am missing some context on how it is used now in retail
---
It's not really used in retail any more. You have certain trinket or azerite traits (dynamic armour traits, similar to tier sets) that work really well for your class, but most of the time you just want the gear with the "most" stats (ie. higher ilvl). I think right now the place "BiS" is used the most by far is on private server. It probably originated in some earlier WoW expansion that I didn't play, but it's very applicable to Vanilla WoW since gear is so unevenly itemised. 
---
My very first 60 was a Dwarf Rogue.
---
It didn't last long (was on a US realm as an OCE player. 600ms and early morning raid times where too much for me)
---
I then switched to an Undead Mage. Which I played through to Cata.
---
Now I play a Dwarf Preist. I'm not really sure why I switch back to Alliance but I think it was good that I did because I'm not sure that there are any OCE guilds on the Horde side on my server.
---
When Classic comes out, I want to switch back to Horde.
---
The Horde just feels right for me.    
---
I even start to get emotional when listening to music from Horde cities/zones/maps(WC3).
---
#Lok'tar ogar!
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they time the launch so that there is a decent downtime a few days after it launches so that the speed-runners get some sleep.
---
Otherwise a decent number of people will probably play for 4-5 days straight going for world first - with a mandatory 12 hour break in the middle the health impacts will be substantially lessened. As one of those speed-runners I kinda hope they do.
---
Just hope they dont go into next expansions like TBC and WOTLK, both of those already had a bunch of issues. I truly wish they build upon vanilla, with all their mistakes in mind. Vanilla even had inaccesible area's and unfinished area's, lets start off with those.   
---
Also all the features we LIKE about TBC, could be brought in, WITHOUT having the features we dislike. For example, arenas, but no flying zones. 41 point talent tree's, but no Outland, etc.
---
So.. I'm torn between druid and rogue. I played hunter on a pve realm in vanilla, so now I want to try a pvp realm. I don't have much interest in mashing lowbies, or even attacking other people on sight, but there's a certain amount of excitement when you are fair game for the other side.  
---
Even then I get so excited and into the supposed danger of being attacked by other players that I become super careful and avoid roads, avoid potential contact - therefor I think a stealth class would suit me best.    
---
I had a dagger rogue alt that I very much enjoyed doing pvp with, but I feel that I will be one of many rogues in whichever guild I join. Since druids are regarded as a bad class and there will generally be less of them, I believe I'll have a much bigger chance of getting raid slots and gear, though I recognize that I will be healing.  
---
TLDR Should I pick something I know will be fun or pick something I think will be fun that will guarantee me dungeon/raid spots?
---
&gt;where you can't get a raid spot without full BiS gear.
---
There isn't even BiS gear in retail any more. People just look at item level. It's very lenient, mostly just a minimum for being useful, your spec matters much more. 
---
Hardcore raiding.
---
I don't have the time to raid Mc on two days a week when I can do Bwl and Mc in one day. 
---
Do not understand why people on this sub outright hate me for not wanting to spend so much time on raiding. 
---
You can do that. But most people don't want to bother with that shit. It's much faster to clear MC, ZG, and AQ20 with decent specs, decent gear, and players who know what they are doing. 
---
that blue set is the old set and not available to purchase. unless blizzard allows it but its removed from vendors 
---
Tirisfal Glades is in the northernmost part of the Eastern Kingdoms.
---
And that should be part of the PvP server experience.
---
I'm sorry, but you sound very much like a snowflake.
---
If you're playing on a PvP server, nothing is sacred. As simple as that. Play on a PvE server if you have a problem with being ganked.
---
The game was meant to be like that. There is a reason they made PvP and PvE servers. To cater to different people. Please accept that.
---
I was told to get a full healing set and a full feral set and then switch whichever.
---
As far as I saw in pvp videos you basically kill people in full healing gear with dots. 
---
Go cat and bleed them with 2 cp and then switch to normal Form and do moon fire, root them, if you have it skilled also insect swarm. 
---
Then you go into bear and charge and stun them with Bash. 
---
Or heal if you need it. 
---
Sometimes finish him with wrath. 
---
It's so cool to murder people in healing gear lmao
---
Sorry for this answer, as it will not help you \^\^  
---
There is no right or wrong, with or without experience in gaming. For her to enjoy the game, its best to talk to her about it, not Reddit :) whatever she feels good/ok with is the best answer.   
---
If you want her to have a good experience, gameplay is more important then race/class. Play slow, read quests, let her explore the world with you tagging along :) Help her and let her ask the questions before you answer them. 
---
Can you post your specc?
---
There are so many options as a druid it's a nightmare. 
---
That's your opinion. I'll be on a pvp server to pvp with players who are going to be a challenge, if you're not good enough for that then go ahead and gank lower levels all day.
---
There is no "that's your opinion" here buddy.....Blizzard allowed ganking low levels in Vanilla and that's going to be allowed in Classic as well.
---
This is how it's going to be. You can want to not do it, that's perfectly fine - that's your right, but stop being a condescending bitch about it.
---
There isn't any need to alter how it was, to suit your 2019 image of how people should play.
---
During progress it's not uncommon, or in Naxx even during farm (depending how tryhard your guild is).
---
its good that we still have reasonable people in this community that actually remember how the game was played in 2004-2006.  
---
its sad that these people only get a couple of upvotes.
---
Back when Blizzard hired people who actually played the Genre they were working in. Good times I guess.
---
Those are warrior pieces normally. Dont know if a guild will allow me to roll on them. thats tje proble.
---
Probably the main tank, but that spot's usually reserved for someone dear to the guild master in guilds that I've been in at least. You'll do a lot of babbling during boss fights and essentially carrying the weight of the entire raid on your shoulders.
---
honestly if they even do peogressive style, i thibk they still put the updated pvp sets
---
Depends. If you legit have zero contacts, then I would wait until 60 in classic. However personally I already have a guild lined up, but it's a guild of people I've known for years, people that I've raided with on private servers.
---
To be fair. 12 of the bosses in Naxx ranges from super easy to somewhat challenging (by todays standard, if everyone uses proper consumables and worldbuffs and ofcourse pre-knowledge of the fights, which people didnt have back then). 4hm, Sapp and KT are still pretty damn hard though.
---
This is better than decay IMO
---
Unless you are a Mage, then your hearth is where you are currebtly questing.
---
You go RFK via Theramore. 
---
Same here. In vanilla I Had no clue about BIS and had not even heard the word. In TBC I was using Landsouls dps spreadsheet to maximize my dps setup.
---
True, that works too. Are quests to pick up in Ratchet though. 
---
They would take you though
---
I wasnt relevant for 90% of the vanilla population, but it will be more relevant in classic as it will draw back alot of tryhards.
---
The casual to tryhard ratio wont be the same this time around.
---
If it ever gets to Wrath my ultimate aim in the game is a DK with Shadowmourne. 
---
In PvE i have no idea how anyone can find Ret fun. Just auto attacking. 
---
Nothing is ever enough for giant companies. They'll make profit, and then want to make even more profit. To unrealistic standards.
---
Vanilla times: student, I reached Naxx
---
Today: husband, father, employed. My priorities wont allow we to "nolife" to 60 but I never did that. You will miss too much. In my maybe clouded memory, vvanilla was very elaborate and huge. So enjoy the ride to 60. I hope to find a great german rp guild with a bit endgame ambition. I think I will pvp a lot because it is not that time consuming. Looking forward to tarrens mill :-)
---
When EU servers went down for maintenance, I'd log on the a US server and play my chars on the opposing faction.
---
I got the Rake on my hunter on a private server, 1.1 sec attack speed.
---
Correct spec and gear is ingrained even in casual raiding guilds and puggers today though and that attitude isn't changing. If you think the lack of knowledge of Vanilla guilds is going to be the same I think you are sorely mistaken.  
---
if she leaves you are your lowest she doesn't deserver you at your highest rank.
---
Eww, why on earth would you listen to heavy metal over the in game music? Anyone who plays wow without the in game music hasn’t truly played WoW 
---
try explaining your stance instead of linking retarded subs to "prove" your point  
---
Naxx is a joke compared to nowadays content. No comparison there. It is going to be a joke for 40 people who knows what they are doing, pots are not even going to be necessary imo.
---
Really? That was one of the obvious ones which is why we couldn't mindlessly spam dots. No such thing as affliction locks back then.
---
I just find it hard justifying to *myself* the idea of rolling a non-dwarf priest or my dwarf warrior again (knowing how late game plays out). Gnome warriors (PvP) and dwarf priests are just much better than any alternative, and I feel I'd get annoyed a lot if I keep losing just because of the race I picked mainly for lore/appearance.
---
Don't care what anyone else picks tho
---
SKS is great.
---
it doesn't degrade.  
---
new players progress in the list the same way old members do.  
---
its fair.
---
the only thing I would do is have several SKS lists for different items.
---
PvP item SKS lists  
---
Tier SKS lists  
---
off piece SKS list  
---
etc.
---
Any caster will rock Bloodvine well into Naxx generally, the amount of SP/Crit/Hit gained from those three pieces is absolutely stupid.
---
wrong boots belt and pants no?  
---
Also, Dark edge of insanity is clearly the superior axe for this transmog.  
---
Also also, am I the only one that prefers the lionheart's helm look as opposed to endless rage?
---
You're comparing private servers to retail right?
---
[Joana's record was 4 days 20 hours /played on retail 1.10.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_eCOl94MEA)
---
I don't think people will make 60 much quicker than that. Ultimately it will come down to how accurately gameplay is reproduced. Maybe a really skilled player can shave several hours off, but under 4 would take a lot of route innovation. Perhaps it's possible with a max level character to payroll twink items, consumables, and skip looting kills - arrows won't pay for themselves. But not something that is likely possible as a fresh start on release.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if the first 60 takes 5 days because they won't have the luxury of sleeping like joana did between sessions. With the first rag kill around 6-7 days.
---
Short comment of resistance gear in MC&amp;BWL: nobody in our guild but tanks and so some enthusiastic melee tried get some, and we top1 guild on the server. So it's kind of amusing to hear these statements about importance of resistance gear.
---
For a casual guild its about RNG when it comes to Chromaggus. It depends on breaths he get (this is random each week). If you get timelapse a casual guild will get fucked.
---
If those other pallys are holy oriented, they will NEVER use any of those set pieces. They are total trash for healing, even if you count all item progression phases. I dont think i used a single piece ever on private server (maining holy). T2 pants and head are in some patch progression good, but nerfed later on.
---
So in reality you might use T2 head+pants for healing, everything else is PVP/offspec.
---
Went from helping start an up and coming raiding guild to a server top raid/PVP guild.
---
Starting the guild: BWL was JUST released and we had nobody that even stepped into MC.  The GM had a job that allowed him to play during work and made a ton of gold watching the AH and grinding.  He funded and handed out flasks to everyone and a ton of other elixirs and consumables.  My rogue would always run with mongoose+agi pots at the least.  He thought this was necessary to "catch up" to the others.  They started requiring certain specs to even be able to raid and the officer leading the charge was just a total elitist asshole.
---
Soon, I got in a huge argument with said super shit officer and switched to the other guild who was already on Chromi thanks to PVPing with a lot of their members.  This guild would flask the MT and sometimes the OT, but other than that, we would have PVP specs and the like and virtually no other consumables.  I was playing DPS war at this point, but had a rogue that was a herbalist, so I would stop up my warrior with at least mongoose pots for progression fights.  We didn't see all of Naxx, but we did kill a handful of bosses before the pre-TBC patch came out and everyone preferred to mess around in PVP over actually progression raiding. 
---
I'm a bit concerned that with all of the extra information we have now that there will be a lot more guilds requiring stupid shit.
---
6 k? Yeah right. It hasn't seen 6k since it opened. Might want to look at the pop of the vanilla server. Oh and there are lots of vanilla servers. TBC sucks. The only people that want to play it want to relive their arena glory (can't because no one will play 3's and 2's balance is horrid), the hard raiding (can't cus the encounters are known) or failed at it and sucked at Arena or couldn't get out of Kara (the loudest ones advocating for it)and want to succeed this time around. Can't because they can never recreate accurate pre nerf, which was overtuned and stupidly hard due to the consumables you had to use. 
---
TBC does not offer anything else. It's a BAD MMO. It's when Brack was brought in. He has made every iteration past Vanilla worse. WOTLK just had lore people loved, some of the best zone design/music, was accessible so that people could do that in addition to the half arse wpvp like wintergrasp. Arena was more balanced.
---
TBC is the most fondly remembered by the people too young to have done anything, too bad to have done anything who liked Vanilla more to be honest. The leveling experience was still there that was good. 
---
The hardcores hated the start of WOTLK but the average player liked it a lot more than TBC. Was still a bad game.
---
I think he meant sap... Lol!

105 days added to /play time.

And brush your teeth
---
Joana already stated that he expects to do it faster than 4 days; 20 hours this time around.
---
I have no idea how anyone could accomplish that.
---
What would have been cool would be blood elves going whole hog on the revenge path and following illidan, thus majorly pissing of the night elves and distancing themselves from alliance.
---
Alliance and Horde (-Forsaken) meanwhile start butting heads again and become hostile to one another while still maintaining some relation to either elf faction.
---
That way you'd have 4 factions each at war with the opposing one but neutral to the two others. As players you maybe could interact and party up with neutral players but could also declare war on their faction and kill them, similar to other neutral factions in the game.
---
That way you'd have more sensible factions maybe while also having higher player populations and more variation in terms of possible zones and quests and at the same time more potential pvp.
---
&gt; In this situation, many people will alter their class choice or ultimate goals to appease a group of people they don’t know
---
Well, im sure people playing right now on private servers will form new guilds into classic. They know each other and play the roles they want to play. 
---
If you talk about gathering before the game releases i would suggest getting people into discord, getting to know each other and play together. Doesnt even need to be wow (vanilla or retail), just get some connection and friendships going.
---
And if level up is pretty meh point, unless you are in HC guild going for realm firsts. You got years to raid, so if you need 2 months to levelup and pre-bis, just take that time. Those that are L60 first, help out on attunements and getting pre-bis gear.
---
You can do MC in whatever gear if you have somewhat geared tank.
---
The difference is absolutely massive. Especially for warriors who do more damage the more damage they do due to rage. Not gonna say they double their DPS but don't think it's over the top to say it's like a 30% DPS increase. It's much less so for casters, but still a sizeable DPS buff for them too.
---
Well it depends on what people want to achieve. If someone never played classic and wants to discover the world I would agree but there are also guys who want to know as much as possible and are just hyped for anything classic related while they are waiting for release.
---
By the way, even on private servers there are  casual guilds who do not do consumes or gear checks. Just find a guild that suit you. Of course even casual guilds will have a limited tolerance for meme specs - because in reality even casual players don't like to chain wipe or have very long runs because your raidcomp doesn't make any sense -  but I am sure it will be very easy to find relaxed raiding guilds in classic.
---
Could plan your vacation time to do either of those. Especially get to 60 since that won't take too long if you no life it. 
---
R14 you need a lot of weeks, but depending on where you live/your job you can do it on your vacation. I don't see why anyone would though, waste of time. 
---
I'm guessing most are unemployed in some fashion, at least temporarily by choice. 
---
It's more like comparing 2004 to 2019.
---
Some of the earlier private servers had some pretty inaccurate data.    
---
But the current servers are pretty close. They may not be 100%, perhaps as low as 95% accuracy.    
---
But the point is that they not &lt;50%.    
---
They're not so wildly inaccurate that feats accomplished on them should be dismissed for being impossible.
---
The speed runs that people are doing today will be very close to what will be possible in Classic.
---
Back in the day, nobody did things like world buffs, BIS, full consumables, trash skipping, invis pots, every raid member with engineering and sapper charges, etc.
---
But these are some of the things that guilds do today.
---
It really should be no surprise that guilds have found ways to min-max a 14 year old game.
---
Tier 2 is dog shit for healing. 
---
same kind of experience, but idk if it was because i mostly raided in "early vanilla" , like  1.5 or something? It was mostly our Raid leaders talking in a very 'school - teacher' like manner lol, it's weird cus we were super casual in terms of gears and consumables, but then had this really strict tone on ventrilo and in general. I think there might have been a 'core' of the raid that made things running mostly, because i just remember throwing heals out on random, dying half the time and not bringing enough water or potions for that matter. 
---
Thought, i think it might have been not so casual for our leaders trying to keep this shit show going. I took it serious and all but as mentioned i didn't  really contribute much due to being a total noob, and a child. Kungen (nihilum) actually talks about this himself in one stream, that they'd have total cluess noobs progress with them long into nax because it was so easy to "hide in the crowd" so to say. I have friends that were like 12 at the time and cleared AQ  because they were just staying the back spamming frostbolt and 'avoiding fire' while the leaders were probably stressing their ass of with figuring out tactics, arranging the raids etc. 
---
How the other half live..

BG's in TBC is whoever has resto druids with resilience  and a couple warriors with Stunherald. The counter is other druids on the other team and cloning to slow it down. SUCH FUN! AV is completely broken and no different than modern WoW and just a rush to the end. 
---
You could do well with healers/warriors on Vanilla. You couldn't take out an entire BG with 2-3 people. The healers could be CC'd long enough without hots being so strong. The healer could be killed fast enough due to no resilience. Healers are all that matters in modern BG's which is why you stack them in RBG's. Any dps can be replaced by a traffic cone.
---
Everything past vanilla is trash outside 3 v 3 arena. It's the only thing the game is balanced for and everything else is really, really bad. The arena players know it's bad to. The only reason SOME of them are positive on stream is because it's their occupation. You can't trash what makes you money. 
---
Tanks and healers in pvp was peak stupid by a Blizzard desperately trying to get people (other than bots) to play BG's again. They know it's bad, but they just wanted people there to sell that it was content for new players. The game is so broken now outside 3 v 3 it's pointless. Nothing about it is fun. I mean a little kid might enjoy killing anyone but healers/tanks on a Legion rogue with the legendary shoulders and the Ravenholdt companion inside a cheapshot, but I got bored of that after about 3 times. Just like owning an entire BG with a resto druid on a warrior in TBC, with a dumb weapon that procs stuns. It's fun for the first few times. It gets old really fast. Most of the PcP players who like TBC are druids. I wonder why? Cus they were OP as f@#% like sub rogues in Cata (we actually made fun of rogues who only got relevant in Cata). That doesn't make the expansion good though or pvp outside Arena good. 
---
The people in charge of modern WoW don't even understand Vanilla game design or why AV was the way it was in the first place. AV was designed to get PVE players into PVP and PVE players into PVP. It was brilliant. It's something Brack doesn't understand and Ion doesn't care about cus he hates PvP. I will be surprised if AV doesn't end up with a later version that is garbage in Classic. 
---
Wintergrasp kind of did the same thing but it wasn't even their intention. They just needed a catch up mechanic to keep people on the only real remaining piece of content in the game (Raiding)  and everyone was crying there was no wpvp left. Amazingly it kind of worked. When they tried it again with Tol Borad it was a complete failure.

This will be a comment to remember

McDonald’s 
---
When I was playing back in the day, I was remotely managing a web development team in India for a startup in California. Most of the people in India didn't speak English, and I was the only person in California who spoke tech, so we had this long chain of communication where the people local to me in California would tell me what they wanted, I'd communicate with the one guy in India who spoke English, he would translate for his team, then builds would come back which I would review and critique on no particular schedule provided that things got done by our bi-weekly meetings.
---
I could wake up at noon and play midnight, spend at most a few hours reading/writing emails, then go to sleep and do it all over again, at least 4 nights a week. Then every other Friday I'd meet and chat with the California crew at the local sushi place, usually that was only a couple hours but worst case I might be busy from 4 to 10. Sometimes I'd lose a day or two out of the weekend with actual work, but that usually only happened when there were major builds. Team India would release a build on Friday, I'd review, test and critique it over the weekend, and they'd come back to my feedback the following Monday. But it's not like that happened every week. Sometimes an entire month would go by without a major build, so I could pretty regularly have at least two, sometimes three weekends free per month, where I wouldn't have anything more than an hour long Skype call plus an hour or two of emails.
---
So I was playing 12 hours a day, more days than not. 
---
It also helped a lot that I didn't have to drive into an office every day. A 20 minute drive, two ways, plus 20 minutes showering and shaving and putting on a tie an so forth, that's an hour every weekday I didn't have to spend except for the bi-weekly meetings. No mandatory one hour lunch, that's another hour I wasn't losing. I would wake up, grab food and it took maybe 5-7 minutes between waking up and playing. 
---
Once you've worked remotely to compare, it's actually kind of amazing how much time is wasted on transit, lunch, dressing up, standing around being polite and making small talk after hours, walking out to the parking garage, all of that stuff takes time. 
---
Once the setup of a spreadsheet to do this has been done it should not need a lot of work to upkeep it. There just needs to be a lot of cross reference lists.
---
Thanks Kris, appreciate it!

---
A lot of the modern routing is much better also.
---
Then you use zero sum dkp so someone can always get a piece if they want it if noone else wants it.
---
How about when items are passed on, but someone takes it as a side-grade, they get punished to the bottom for  making use of a piece of gear that would otherwise be unused.
---
I would go in blind but decide what you want to do. PvP, PVE, both. Then make a class, faction and race decision based on that. Getting to say 15 on every class or 19 like in the demo is not gonna do much. Many classes change drastically past 20, then again at 40. 
---
Maybe state what you want to do, what kind of player you are (social or like to play a lone a lot), what role you want to do, how much you plan to play. 
---
There are some class choices that are a very poor match for certain types of players. Example. Casual, likes to play alone a lot, is on a pvp server and warrior are not a good combination. You will be miserable. 
---
If you are social, hardcore, loves to play with other people most of the time, warriors are a fantastic choice. 
---
&gt;In terms of mechanics of fights, vanilla is pretty simple. The difficult part is gettings 39 other active and able players, grinding materials for consumables, and not having to flexability to swap specs as needed. 
---
And because of loot system ( very low number of loot / boss while having 40 ppl in raid AND most items are so class specific that plenty of loot will go to waste ), keeping that core roster is the most important part of the guild management. If someone quits or leaves for another guild replacing that guy with similar geared member means either getting someone else from another similar guild or gearing up a new guy (and that could take 1-2 months).
---
Yeah I understood ;) It's ND
---
In other words; It was a bug, not a feature.
---
Kungen explained all this here. He was the best tank in the world for the best guild for the first three expansions and quit in Cata. Basically he says raiding as the focus broke the game, killing the previous expansion world is the wrong way to expand. Everything past Vanilla is basically bad. It's "world of minigames" with no real community or world. 
---

You swap BV set for T2.5 si AQ40
---
Going to that trash for the first time, jeesus fucking christ. 
---
I sincerely hope that the amount of non-hardcore players that are also interested in Classic, will mean that classic servers will play more like this, and less like private servers. I am afraid, however, that the private server norms will have an influence on a lot of classic servers. We sadly can't force people to forget all they know about how MMOs work..   
---
That being said, I am pretty sure that there will be plenty of casual raiding guilds, and that at least some of them will manage to clear BWL and maybe even a few bosses in Naxx or AQ - just because the average level of knowledge has increased. So it's not all bad I guess.   
---
My main hope is actually that the hardcore people don't make leveling a hell for newcomers to the game, as they'll definitely quit then. It's hard enough getting to 60 as it is, if you're constantly being reminded that you're doing it wrong, people might lose interest.  
---
You should ask in /r/wowservers.
---
My girl was onyl into spellcasters (esp Mage). But when she tried Druid, she fell in love with shapeshifting, bear, cat, travel form, she loves watching all of her dances and different abilities. She doesn't like raiding or hardcore things. She is into fishing, cooking, questing, dungeons, killing random beasts (she loves grinding xd). 
---
If it works, there will be strong pressure for a BC classic server and a WOLTK classic server (up until the LFG tool was put in)... 
---
Heck thats basically me tidied over until i die.
---
No raiding? Hunter.
---
If she plans to raid and is on a pvp server. Warlock. If she wants to heal. Paladin. Hunters are easy to level but their raiding rotation is the hardest of the ranged.
---
If you aren't on a PVP server and she wants to raid and you are helping level. Mage. Spamming frostbolt is pretty darn easy and pet management screw ups and pulling things not intended won't be an issue in dungeons (which is why people hated hunters). Mage has a high skill cap in pvp though, which is why she should avoid it on a pvp server.
---
Also her making water and food on the mage will be nice leveling for both of you.
---
Heal on non pvp? Again Paladin. Girls are usually exceptional healers btw and really seem to like it in my experience. Holy Paladin would be a a good starter healer class. Maybe progress to priest/druid later if she gets bored.
---
I'll definitely have the music on at the start, but after a few hours when everyone on my discord wants a break from each other, I'll turn it off to watch netflix or some shit.
---
It's ok mate, hard to get it right, so many play styles, there is some interesting data there anyways, pve owns the place heheh.
---
I remember I once had a weird schedule like that when I was playing another MMO, in the end I joined an australian guild that raided from 9 am to 1 pm my time (I'm in the UK, and this MMO didn't have oceanic specific servers).
---
Seafarer here, I work out on a ship for a month then im home for a month in which I can play as much wow as I want!
---
That's not true. It does the same dps as slow hitting pets, but has more opportunities to crit because its hitting twice as often which means more procs for attack speed.
---
they will probably use their vacation days if they want to lvl up quickly.
---
But for people like me, who want to just play the proper version of wow, there is no need to rush. I will enjoy my adventures, it will probably take me three to four months to ding 60. Then I will run dungeons with my guildmates. Maybe I will do some casual raiding from time to time.

Big island Northeast of Dustwallow Marsh, you can find Varian (king of Stormwind) in a cell there after the Defias captured him.
---
The pet follows the target and will most likely outrun it so it will delay casters a lot in AV and wPvP
---
Engineering is number one of all profession both for PvP and PvE.
---
For PvP due to all the gadgets.
---
For PvE, if all your 40 raiders can throw Goblin Sapper at the same time that's some massive AoE damage that can help you deal with packed mob like the one in BWL
---
We froze. Freezing is part of the SK base system and it doesn't fix the issue I spoke of. No one moves above you if you're top. Clearly you dont understand SK in depth and just ran with it, probably because it worked for you, which is ok.
---
If you're top and you're not there, The next guy will get it.
---
Frozen or not, they just move about under you. And I'm NOT talking about being TOP top, I'm talking about what people never think of with SK, which is being top of the people your rolling against. Which is also rather common in SK giving a lot of chance for what I described to happen.
---
What you're actually saying is your guild fixed this by demanding attendance and just ignoring the odd case of loot fuck up. Which works sure but It's also very progression focused. The players that choose these types of guilds are often able to work out loot without issue because it's not their primary goal - Simply put, a lot of progress raiders players don't give a shit about loot/loosing loot as long as it benifits the raids progression. Thus a lot of them prefere loot coucil because in that situation it's flat out better.
---
If a player is not in one of these progression focused guilds I honestly believe SK is the best loot system. But it has to have decay to work. Without it you just hemorrhage a player every month or less for no reason, and build hatred of the system.

Freezing is in the base suicide kings system and doesn't solve the issues. So you mean forced 90% attendance? I mean, it's not for me but go for it dude.

Even so I don't understand how somebody can have 10-20 hours to devote to computer games when they have a full time job, partner and baby.

Sadly you are speaking the Truth. Now days money guns errything. If im not mistanken the ceo of activision is also a chairman for Coca cola.. 
---
That Explains alot. 
---
Sorry for mispells, mobile and autocorrect is a bitch sometimes!
---
I know I used charge on neutral mobs when running to and from towns/quests and it did not put me in combat. It puts the charge "stun" on the target but it wont fight you if you cancel your autoattack mid-charge, in my case i just hit charge and then escape right away.
---
I can't remember how it worked in pvp though... 
---
None of these 3 things are going to be in classic from what i gather. I can say for sure /sit and Quiver speed are private server bugs, i can't say for 100% on the Melee weaving, but even if in the game i won't use it personally.
---
When windfury procs from an instant attack, it resets your swing timer too.
---
It's better to use SS right after an attack so you don't "waste" the reset on an attack that would come out soon anyway.
---
It's the same for sword spec procs or HoJ procs on alliance, but it's not such a big deal.
---
I feel certain, I had heard the term but I don't think I had ever heard of "preraid bis" or needing it to step into a raid. 
---
The Skeletons in the towers are elite and so are the patrolling pudges.
---
yea they seemed pretty weird. Why wouldn't you use the melee thing?
---
Just need the right people on the council and the right kind of guild I guess. The "inner circle" was sort of 5 people including myself but only 2 of us were on the council....the general "circle" was the entire core raid group though, about 15 people.
---
In terms of favoritism...my brother is the only one who complained about not getting loot when he was passed over for a 20ilvl upgrade and it was given to someone that it was a 5ilvl upgrade. I told him to suck it up...my brother turned up for the first time in 6 weeks, the other guy had been there every raid night for the last 3 months and the item was BiS. Pretty easy choice which player getting the loot would benefit the group more.
---
So when the raid leader tells his own brother to get in line it sets a good example for everyone else.
---
Bloodrage is the ability that puts and keeps him in combat, not the charge itself though.
---
Fun fact: before 1.11 you could click off bloodrage and you would exit combat for a very short period of time so you could with a macro deactivate bloodrage and charge right away, mid-combat. 
---
First aid, by far
---
Yeah I was surprised by that comment as I'd often stance dance for berserker rage just to fill the rage bar better.
---
I used Quel'Serrar, and was one of the first people on server to get it. It is the only loot roll that I really remember winning.
---
Even without these three „advices“ you will just level up easy and fast enough. It‘s just a small rotation to figure out, you won‘t need a quiver 
---
Casting a spell or firing a wand should reset swing timer. If you had a 1.5 speed weapon and 1.9 wand, maybe?
---
&gt; Quiver speed
---
What's that?
---
you should heal in pvp because you'll be more useful
---
level as fully shadow
---
Going in blind is the best advice given here, as it‘s a lot funnier not getting spoilert before and just enjoy the gimmicks and tricks during leveling
---
We made changes that worked for us so you jump right to me not understanding it? I I bet people like talking to you in real life.
---
I also very clearly addressed your point. A guild is made of people and if we see such a clear attempt at scamming the system we'd simply kick your sorry ass.
---
It was kinda sad to listen to those gankers at first segment. I am good person because I will have 2nd daughter. Argument of century. 
---
&gt; I played nost a while ago but never went back to private after the shutdown.
---
The nost database and chatacters are still live under a different name today. Ita not allowed to name servers here buy you can find ut easy.
---
&gt; I think a lot of people are in for a rude awakening when they realize that there's actually nothing but dungeon blues and crafted gear for this spec.
---
hey man, im cool with that!
---
im hoping to go blacksmithing and enchanting, i just love that from a fantasy perspective
---
thanks for the helpful info!
---
Because they aren't run by retards?
---
Zeppelins give a way to get continent to continent much, MUCH faster than on ally side as they are right outside your capitals. On allys, you have to fly 5-10minutes to get to a boat. 
---
Also getting world buffs as alliance for raids is pain in the ass and going to every instance feels way worse than on horde.
---
Wands are very important for Priest leveling iirc, not sure if for shadow or holy though so i could be wrong.
---
As for PvP i have no idea but i know shadow is pretty good in pvp 
---
My warrior is at max, my next highest is a shadow priest at 85, my original rogue is in the 60s, I've got a monk in the 50s, a hunter in the 40s, and everything else is below 30. I do have several warriors of various races ranging from 20-60 just for fun. I've never made it past 20 with a mage/druid/shaman/etc before getting bored. I discovered that I just really like beating things to death directly rather than with magic.
---
I did Rank13 solo in Vanilla while still being at school! But its was quite the grind and I don't ever want to do it again. The worst part was that I was forced into playing, because after like Rank11 you are commited! I had like 4-5hrs of Sleep over ~2-3 Month. 
---
And crafting the Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros, has a cost of between 10 and 15k gold. Which is, a lot of gold. Farming as paladin isn't the greatest, so you might want to just rather pick up some other 2h. When it dropped for my guild, literally nobody wanted it due to the cost to craft it. 
---
I did Rank13 with Broken Tooth and my Hunter still has him.
---
Closer to the middle than stranglethorn, where the other zeppelin is.
---
what made you like warrior/
---
I agree on what you said but you have to look at the infrastructure back then. There was Thottbot as a sort of quest helper and some sites that gave advice on boss tactics, usually written by the big guilds like Curse &amp; co but no YouTube, no reddit, no nothing (I am not sure at what point elitistjerks emerged). So people didn't know shit.
---
Little anecdote:  I played a mage back then, and after clearing AQ40 in fire specc I went back to frost because I enjoyed the specc more than fire (for reasons I cant understand today lol, I think I wanted IceBlock when pulling agro on AoE trash) and noone gave a shit about it (we cleared roughly half of Naxx in the end). I never heared the term pre-bis before I joined my first pserver after quitting retail MoP.
---
once you wiped a couple of times because your MT's thunder armor stacks were gone and some dude pulled agro we found that out the hard way :D
---
Isn't the flying snake thing from ZG the best when that comes out (realise that is ages). 
---
A ton are unemployed - in many EU countries unemployment benefits are quite generous (I am from EU and I am not suggesting this is a bad thing net)
---
I also remember this "travel method"! Mashing esc before landing the auto attack.. Maybe it works differently in pvp and vs neutral mobs?
---
You got me confused for the youngins!
---
Hunter is really only answer. 
---
Warrior and Rogue are nowhere near as "complex" as people pretend they are.

Vanilla is a marathon in it's difficulty, in isolation no small section of it is hard but the overall process can be.
---
Retail is a 100m sprint,  you need very quick reactions to deal with mechanics and rotations etc.
---
They are different (although I would argue Vanilla "easier" net because most people can train for a marathon if they have the drive but it's harder for people to become really fast at a 100m sprint".

I work in I.T (Systems/Figaro Support Analyst) and I'll be using 15 days of my 25 holiday days of 2019 to no-life to 60 on my main, max its professions &amp; then maybe an alt or two to 60 or world PvP / dungeons.
---
That r14 grind is gonna be a long one for me though, I can play avg of 6hrs with 16hrs being the best outcome if the GF doesn't go mad.
---
get wand spec, you'll need it.
---

---
You'll run OOM rather quickly as a priest, the wand spec gives you the damage you need to compensate. Also, with 5 points in wand spec, with a good wand equipped you do almost as much damage as with spells. So it will help you with the MP5 rule and helps you lower your downtime. 
---
I've been leveling a Priest on a Private server and bye using my wand efficiently I have almost zero downtime and can keep going without drinking. I only drink in dungeons when I heal to be fair.
---
Totally agree we don't need a Q&amp;A, just need a Beta and can Q&amp;A based off of that. 
---
Most private servers has had slightly higher horde population. So if you want to be a snowflake you should probably roll alliance (as a warlock).
---
Snap!
---
If you are there, turn off the music and crank up the ambience sound. You will hear a heart beating.
---
Dotmegently
---
The problem is once you commit to it, you'd get 10x better performance from any other "real" spec. Feral will be awesome for the whole leveling experience with all the tanking you can do and good enough in early raids. 
---
For example hunters have one of the highest skill ceilings, yet I would still suggest them to a bad player because they are okay even if the player is bad. It's a similar principle.
---
They are also friendly to alliance at daytime!
---
personally, while i'm all for min maxing, something about reliving having to hit the wand key again every time i want to attack, except twice every time doesn't jive well with me, if it's in and people do it, i'm glad, i just personally don't want to
---
there's a bug on Private servers where quivers, which give at the basic level 10% ranged attack speed, apply to wands, which isn't intentional
---
Paladin will be great, there might be a lot but you can almost never have too many. So so so useful.
---
Studying at university worked really well for me with hardcore raiding, even though the school wasnt that time consuming as some other ones. I had the priviledge to have some parent's financial support during my first years.
---
Honestly it's much more about not having a girlfriend than work, if you work you still have like 8 ish free hours a day, and even 5 hours a day of playing will keep you at the hardcore level if you try. If you have a girlfriend or wife, you usually spend a lot of your free time with them.
---
This was the hidden Darkspear troll village in Felwood/Winterspring (iirc). Had trolls hanging out in what was a small outpost/village, but you couldn't interact with them.
---
In my opinion TBC did not make Vanilla irrelevant at all. I think you may be thinking too much about how retail/live is currently. 
---
If you started a fresh character in TBC you still had to completely level your character and professions through vanilla before you could access TBC leveling/professions. 
---
The only content that became somewhat irrelevant was the raids. They were replaced by TBCs raids instead which I’m actually ok with. Not every player wants to raid. Some want to just pvp after lvling, or farm gold etc. Making everyone stop to do raids while leveling would be similar to telling raiders that they need to go hit rank X in pvp before they can progress to TBC. 
---
For the current live version of WoW I can agree with you though. You can boost a char to 110, grab professions and immediately be BFA rdy. Only need to touch BFA content for anything you need. Even leveling alts is done quickly in heirloom gear by spamming dungeons and not needing to use old world quests. Vanilla-TBC was hardly a transition that made content irrelevant in my opinion. 
---
Wand is pretty important,  it's a 25% damage increase 
---
The last vanilla private server launch, the realm first 60 was Critten as hunter in about 3 days and 10 hours. Sure it is private server, but it's a good one and classic will hardly be a lot different than that.
---
For hord its Kargath. When the majority is 60 and have started raiding you will always have mages selling portals in Kargath so you are close to Blackrock and can teleport to all cities.
---
On private servers the average slow mc run is like 3 hours.
---
In vanilla I remember doing an MC that took upwards of 5, and we only killed up to majordomo.
---
i dont plan on getting world buffs anyway, always hated it and will never do it again except if it's like patchwork progress or smth like that
---
100%. Me and a bunch of people from the same server rerolled alliance deep into vanilla.  And we progressed so fast that most of us had mostly blue gear. Some even had green when we cleared bwl for the first time, was also alliance first. Lots of drama when we started shit talking. (we had experience from before but still).  I did Hakkar at lvl 56 or 58 as a healer and got the staff before i could even use it. Good times.
---
And i can't remember us using these insane amounts of consumables, apart from tanks using titans. Pretty sure i only used mana potions and we did just fine. And we ventured far into naxx before we stopped for tbc. 
---
An old speedrunning record like that will have been thoroughly beaten by now (and has been on private servers). There's a shitton of room for optimisation over 4 whole days of play, and over a decade for people to optimise strats. 
---
As for us more normal people, hitting 60 in under 6 days /played is still an incredible feat.
---
There are too many problems with copying of characters that I have to highly disagree with this option.
---
Like some pointed out, you could give one character tons of money from the guild and give it back after the copying is done and repeat with every member. 
---
People would abuse this. 
---
Right now I guess there are two options.
---
Forever vanilla or tbc. 
---
There won't be anything in between. It's a very simple solution that won't need a lot of work and will keep as many people playing the game. 
---
Like p-server.
---
Pick the expension you liked the most. 
---
Focus leveling, then respec pvp at 60. Not only can you afford it, it's far better in terms of overall gold earned given how much more you can get at L60 compared to say L30.
---
Still exploitable, let me put RoA as my number 1 as a hunter :p
---
dont know about gameplay and mechanics wise but lore wise it was always a DK weapon to me, although that diddnt stop me helping my DK mate to get it so i could have that sexy paladin tabard.
---
That's not true. Quests give much more exp in the current private servers. Spawn times are different and more. I listened to a podcast not too long ago where Joana was interviewed and he mentioned it himself. 
---
Lived in those 2 areas to farm gold for my epic mount.
---
BT is the shit. I'll definitely try for it.
---
That is exactly what I want to do. 
---
I don't want to be that guy, but that's a personal private server which probably doesn't have entirely accurate gameplay and Joana had to compete with other players for mobs. 
---
I'm sure you can knock 12 hours off Joana's time. I'm just sceptical as to taking it below 4 days. Especially on release.
---
Yeah you definitely want 5 points into wand spec. You could put them in first or you could put them into spirit tap first or you can alternate. Whichever you think is best.
---
For PvP you will not be wanding much unless you run out of mana which happens sometimes during 1v1s or if you are ever silenced.
---
**Orc Resto Shaman or Fury Warrior?** 
---
I only started playing WoW in TBC and I remember Enhancement Shammy being quite fun, including during end-game. However, it seems like it's not too viable for raiding in Vanilla. 
---
Warriors I never really got to play a lot throughout my entire WoW experience (TBC to Firelands Cata). In WotLK I did play a plate dps as a main (DK), and it was my most played character when it came to PVE content. 
---
I'm a bit at a crossroads here since I have played a melee dps as a main for most of my time in WoW. I'm not afraid of resto, I actually think it would be quite satisfying to play as a healer. However I may still need to scratch the melee dps itch, but I'm not really sure how I'd feel. 
---
I will be playing casually so it's best if I focus on a main as I may not have time to level both and play them actively. What would you choose?
---
I teach at a college, so the summer is very flexible for me. I do spend a lot of time prepping for new classes, travelling for conferences/professional work, and doing my own research, but scheduling is pretty relaxed. I won't go for hardcore raiding or r14 or anything like that, but I'm planning on setting aside a few days or a week to just play classic when it drops.
---
I was expecting this to be higher up
---
Yea, another thing to consider about Alcor's from retail vanilla is that this item was unique in the sense that it was a BoP world drop epic until like patch 1.9 or something - so it wouldn't even be considered something you could realistically get as a tank for like over half the game.  
---
Quel Serrar is actually a pretty legitimate tanking weapon all things considered, definitely a good starting weapon depending on what route they go for with itemization. If they keep to their original plan that they announced at the blizzcon panel QS will be the go-to tank weapon for most tanks for all of Phase-1, excluding some hardcore guilds.
---
Def gonna take time off from work. Union ironworker herr.
---
Probably 10 days or so. Load up on weed, some adderall, some snackys.
---
Try and play 24hrs strait to get ahead of the pack and then just crush it strait to 60. I do plan on leveling profs and fishing along the way so I'll probably be slowed down a good bit
---
When i was hardcore back in 2005-2008 I washed dishes in a restaurant. I ended up working in Surveillance at a Casino then moved into real estate... Im really wondering if i should go back to washing dishes just for nostalgia
---
Yeah we will see.  The way blizz is now I'm worried about the "temporary sharding".
---
Not sure what spec you were playing in BFA but for the 4 classes I played they all had best in slot stats.  Typically haste mastery or haste crit.  On my arms warrior for example I would go down a lot of item levels to get an item with haste and no mastery.
---
While I may not agree with you, this is true vanilla mentality.
---
Oh yeah!  Using the standard convention for the place you live is retarded!
---
It won't retain players as much as you think, all you have to do is look at server populations on pservers from launch to 6 months later. After the initial hype and quenching of the thirst for nostalgia a lot old game design problems come into play. I get that some people might enjoy insanely low drop rates etc. but the design of WoW Classic is very out of sync with modern game design. 
---
Games are now, for the most part, very rapid and very easy to play 40 minutes of and then drop out. You can't really just play 40 minutes of vanilla and do that much. 
---
Does that mean vanilla isn't great? 
---
Not at all, but the likes of Goldeneye, GTA Vice City and the other greats for both multi and single-player experiences are incredibly dated now. Which is why when you go back it's actually really clunky to play those games. 
---
I am not trying to be negative about vanilla WoW but you have to be realistic when thinking about player retention and the modern market. 
---
Nah, first 7 points to spirit tap and imp swp. You may not get a decent wand right away and imp swp is just so good. Get imp wand there after.
---
Watching Joana's play through you can see a lot of areas where it could be improved with just a more modern mindset about the game.  
---
So, this is going to be an unpopular answer and I'm well aware of this, but I do not enjoy playing with other people. I find raids tedious and boring, I dislike groups, and if friends say "hey lets log on and play" I'll do it for a couple of hours just for the social aspect but I do it more out of obligation than enjoyment. Different people get different things out of the game, and this is important to remember when trying to get new people to play: they may not enjoy things about it that you do. 
---
I like warriors because they're the easiest to solo, they are capable right out of the starting gate and when you're trying a new race they're the best bet for handling yourself (again, this is purely my experience, your mileage may vary) when you want to see new terrain. I also enjoy beating the crap out of things with my own hands/weapons. I dislike distance/spellcasting. I find that it takes too long and I get annoyed and end up hitting shit with my stick anyway (and usually dying because cloth wtf). I like warriors because I feel invincible. I'll never forget walking into Un'Goro at like level 38 when everything was red, and one of my guildmates was all "wtf are you doing!?" and I replied "just checking it out" and then promptly dying. Did I leave? Nope. I leveled faster in Un'Goro than anywhere else because everything you kill gave great xp when you're low. I like my warriors because it's easy to farm for skins/herbs for my other alts (I'm a ridiculous altoholic) because whatever I kill is usually skinnable and I rarely die while doing it (because again, I'm invincible in my own mind lol). Warriors are perfect for the gaming style that I enjoy. And while I do occasionally give the other classes a go, I always come back to warriors.
---
Yeah things aren't quite 1:1, but it's also important to note that on that private server there were no hinterlands quests or blasted lands quests too.  It puts a huge hole in your ability to quest to level.
---
"most"? Most people are in casual guilds not caring about meme specs. Hardcore raiders have and will always be a minority on every classic server. 
---
Back in vanilla we had 2 serious raiding guilds on both factions. I was feral and sometimes took the healing slot, but could often just *be* feral and end up just below the serious dps classes but above the people that didn't give their 100%. Of which there are a LOT in casual guilds and in vanilla wow.
---
It's hard to find another server as good as Nostalrius though. 
---
Yup.. for pre-MC, MC and BWL.. raiding hordies use Kargath as a hearth.  I guarantee there will be a mage there selling portals if you need to go somewhere else.
---
getting sulfuras was my private server dream since 2011. i finally got the eye in 2017 and i farmed so much black lotus (at least 12 hours a day for months) and when i finially got the hammer made i quit from being so burnt out. then the server died 
---
&gt;Paladin... equipping your 2H on farm bosses?
---
Cant heal and auto attack at the same time in private servers at least. 
---
Watch rest of the raid die. 
---
According to shitty simile, Saruman would be the one going "We must join with Activision. That would be wise, my friend." 
---
Making it to 60.
---
I'd get spirit tap first at least, the first wand you can get as horde is at level 14 iirc UNLESS someone has already started making wands from enchanting and selling(we talking classic release here i assume). But spirit tap is just amazing, spirit tap and spirit on all your gear and you pretty much never go oom.
---
I do still think meme specs will be welcome in casual guilds, but because everyone can now indeed optimize their casual play time much more, progress and gearing up will be made much faster. I wouldn't be surprised if true casual guilds make it all the way to Majordomo on their first MC night. Simply because by the time they have 40 raid-ready players, loads of them will already have a lot of BiS of close-to-BiS goodies equiped AND they know the fights.
---
I'm planning to roll one of those. I need to decide before Classic launches. hahah
---
Multibox solo all Classic dungeons 
---
You will be wanding for at least half of mob HP even in shadow. Mind blasting and mind flaying will be quicker, but you will run oom after 2-3 mobs. So I would definitely suggest improved wand no matter the spec you level with. Once you are 60, you can drop it depending on your spec.
---
Have you ever done a 40man raid in Vanilla?
---
First five points go into imp wands. Throw the rest in shadow however you see fit. I like to pvp spec shadow on pvp servers.
---
Throw the rest of the points in disc for imp shield imp for martyrdom etc. 
---
Once you get mind flay your rotation looks like
---
Mind blast,SWP,MF,Wand to death. Throw a renew and let your health/ mana regenerate with spirit tap and on to the next mob. You literally can grind endlessly with this spec. It is a tad bit slower, but you can go infinitely as long as you dont over pull and fight mobs your level or a level below
---
I wanna roll a nelf, and do Deadmines after doing all the quests in Elwyn Forest and Westfall.
---
Basically do the human questline as a nelf lowbie.
---
Main goal for Classic is to help out guildies or others who didn't play through Vanilla. Going to no-life launch week to get ahead of the pack, then focus on helping the lowbies after hitting 60. Helping Warriors down Cyclonian, crafting extra Shadoweave for the Warlocks/Priests, running people through SM when I go back to farm mats to level Enchanting, etc. I've played through Vanilla's content probably a half dozen times now between retail and private servers, so at this point I'll get more out of helping my server's community than just playing for myself a seventh time.
---
Paladin is great, very noob intuitive and you can pretty much autoattack and heal your way through. Priest could also be nice. And if she's not into healing and supporting, I'd suggest a warrior as it's pretty straight forward
---
The issue is that for the most parts - the "vocal" parts - it's not the casuals who "decide" how the game is going to get played.
---
It's the very vocal guys in /2 who are looking for people to play with in groups that say stuff like "LF2M BRD Full Clear, must know best routes, must have this, must have that, must know everything else"...
---
That being said, I'm just waiting and see how it's going to progress. For the most parts - I believe - I'll end up in one pretty big guild that does all the content and will just hang around with guild mates and probably never ever bother with global chats at all.
---
To me that's the way this game is meant to be played...
---
You know what is the best thing about vanilla? You can raid everything in 1 evening if you have a competent guild. I havent seen that in any other expansion to be honest. You can go through MC and BWL in around 3 hours and AQ shouldnt take more than 2-3. And yeah, once Naxx comes, you will probably have a separate night for that but its a long way to get there
---
I've been introducing my 9yr old to classic on pservers. So far his favorites have been Mage and Warrior.  Paladin was too easy (with healing macros we made for him)/boring to keep his attention.
---
Paladin is a good choice for a first character because their heals are very straight forward and efficient and you can get by leveling/grouping with macros that you can hit \[for example, if health is less than 70% cast X spell\]. However, the 5 minute buffs are super annoying
---
Mage is a good choice because they do good damage and have some fun utilities. He was obsessed with blink and keeping mage armor on himself. It is very straight forward to play and get good results. Doing a lot of damage was very appealing.
---
I have never played a warrior, but my son enjoyed smacking/charging everything. My husband has played a warrior and says fury is a really easy spec to be decent at in Classic with as well. It doesn't require stance dancing and he thought it was something our kid could get good at.  Warrior was appealing because you run right up to the mob and smack it with your weapons. 
---
Obviously your wife is not a 9yr old boy, but her video game skills may be similar.
---
How much will you be playing together? If it's going to be duo all the time, it really doesn't matter; just make sure one of you can heal and you'll be able to roll right through with whatever class you think she'd enjoy the most.
---
But if she's going to be playing some solo, I'd steer clear of the really slow, grindy classes like paladin, warrior, and rogue; and towards hunter (even if it'll pain you, it has the lowest skill requirement by far), warlock, druid, and wand spec priest.

No life my way to one of the first 60s, and become the harbinger of death in Stranglethorn. Waging war against the alliance for the blood soaked flag of the horde..
---
I've almost always played alliance but recently have been practicing leveling horde on private servers and they seem to have a much smoother 1-40 than alliance. 
---
It's not that you need Imp. Wand it's that you want it.
---
It's amazingly good for leveling, not much for pvp.
---
For your 10 first talent points I would recommend using them to up Imp Wand and Spirit Trap alternating between the two (1 point in IW, one in SP, one in IW,...).
---
You'll definitively find yourself wanding a bit in pvp but in a purely pvp point of view it's not worth spending 5 points into it.
---
My friend had the Heroic version drop in a pug and the raid leader ninja’d it and transferred off the server.
---
60 quickly still means a month or so in real time, and thats what i usualy play "new" games anyway.
---
I usually work 8am to 4pm, sometimes, like once a week from 8am to 8pm. Then i get home, i have a wife and a kid. My computer is in the living room so usually when they watch tv, i play. Or if the kid is in her room playing, i get to play.
---
Sure i get afk ganked a lot, but not too much, just run a bit off the way and afk behind a tree or just log off. Raiding is easy, i can easily and have arranged so that my current pserver guilds raid times, twice a week for 3 hours, are mine to play, and the girls take care of each other, raid time starts around the time the litle one goes to bed, so my wife just puts her to bed in those days.
---
Playing in a HC or semi HC guild is better in my opinion. I know the raids will be done in time, they start in time, and no longer i need to corpserun for 6 hours wanting to clear a raid. (Disclaimer, atm. waiting for Aq and Naxx, thats where i fear this will change!) Farming for mats is a lot cheaper when you dont lose your buffs too often in a raid.
---
Also, roll a priest, they have by far the easiest consumables. Only thing you need is some GFPPS and mana pots and runes , flasks maybe for a few starting raids. Money will be tight in the start, but once you get your bis gear, not much need for enchants. Most priest gear is blues from dungeon until BWL.
---
Piggybacking on this post, as I'm in kind of the same boat.  I had been planning on suggesting my wife try a Druid so that she can kinda try tanking/melee/healing/ranged all in one convenient package.  I'll probably level my own Druid or Hunter with her, so leveling should be a breeze.
---
But on private servers it's was probably prerepared with gear for every level, no competition, consumables and AH bought quest items when available - live from nothing racing thousand upon thousands of others with server lag thrown in.
---
I doubt the WF will be under 4 days, but it's impressive it it is.
---
Enh Orc shaman with Sulfuras and one-shot build runing bgs every time I log in

---
The issue with Classic will be that that genie is out of the bottle and its not going back in. The standard knowledge level of mmo players is much higher now than it was then, you can expect people to be pursuing whatever BIS is available to them at all times and I wonder how classic will react to that
---
&gt;If you started a fresh character in TBC you still had to completely level your character and professions through vanilla before you could access TBC leveling/professions.
---
Shortly after TBC was released, vanilla content was made easier and faster to clear. Things like elite monsters have been turned to regulars, more questhubs have been added and the xp rate was increased.
---
People also went to Outland below level 60, since in vanilla that 58-60 slog was a long road, but in Outland you had those new quests with a gazillion of XP.
---
When I leveled my very first Rogue, it was this area's fault that I put my first 11 talent points into Subtlety.  The two stealth improving talents were just great QoL features, and 1 more point for Ghostly Strike seemed like a bargain before refocusing and going down the Combat tree.
---
Exactly this 
---
Yup.. I clearly remember this method too.  Charge itself did not put you in combat, it did queue up an auto attack which made you go into 'combat' (which grays out mount and food) but pressing esc makes you out of combat if you don't get the swing off.
---
It queues an auto attack which puts you in combat.  Pressing esc cancels the queue which makes you leave combat as long as you haven't gotten the swing off.
---
Launch-week I plan on no-lifing to 40.
---
From there, I'm going to stop and smell the roses from 40-60.  Once at 60 I plan on running dungeons like a madman, farming tons of gold and playing the AH for fun, and *maybe* hopping in some low-tier pug raids from time to time.
---
&gt; No nothing (I am not sure at what point elitistjerks emerged)
---
There was the Fires of Heaven forums, I posted about my guilds bugged Lucifron kill circa Jan 05 and Tigole PM'ed me wanting to know more.
---
Stock trader and real estate entrepreneur. I've been on "vacation" for 5 months now though and will probably stay away for another year or two so I can just relax and play classic WoW with friends.
---
The chances of them developing TBC Classic are much better than you think, because Classic... Classic will have already laid the groundwork for everything they'd need to do. TBC is very similar technologically to vanilla, so odds are all the tools and scripts they developed to convert the old database, maps, assets etc. to work with the new client will work for TBC as well. In addition, the mechanics changes from vanilla to TBC are much more incremental, so it will be substantially less work to upgrade Classic's mechanics to TBC Classic than it was to replace Legion's mechanics with vanilla mechanics for Classic.
---
The example given was on an 'open' private server with over 10,000 people playing on it.

Not in Education, Employment or Training. So basically someone who does nothing and has all the time in the world. 
---
Rank 11 for the mount, maybe rank 12 if it doesn't look like it will take too many hours per week. I'm thinking a month or two after the battlegrounds are released will be the best time.

Dynamic spawning. People are massivly abusing it on private servers. Plus there are always some mobs who give to much xp. I mean sure you can beat Joana nowdays but not like 30h faster.
---
&gt; I was hunter class leader at 10 years old.
---
wut?
---
Same. Was triple majoring in college and got to rank 13.  Didnt cap becuae of a death in the family and had to travel.  Did not have a portable PC in those days.  
---
&gt; all you have to do is look at server populations on pservers from launch to 6 months later.
---
To be fair, private servers have a lot of factors that contribute to players dropping them. The most common one probably being that the server isn't nearly as bug-free as its developers made it out to be (and somehow everyone is always surprised by this). Then there's all the other issues like corrupt staff and exploits and hacks galore.
---
Not in education, employment, or training 
---
The issue for BM is pet scaling is not there. A full BiS Naxx hunter's pet and a fresh 60 pet will be the same, considering same talent choice. But anyway, one of the 2 endgame PvP common builds is BM based (for Intimidation, nice stun and it still allows you to get scatter for even more cc).
---
Raid Crossroads with at least 40 ppl.
---
If they've no interest in geology they will hate it :)
---
Yeah that would be true if only people playing classic would've been moder players, but the classic will be for the oldschool fans first, and they don't care about modern design.
---
Super easy, just clear MC every week.
---
Much like the previous comment about how he/she thinks it will be successful, you're comment is just your own opinion with zero facts to back it.
---
It's way more than 30%. Just the 10% crit and 10% damage from DMF adds up to 20% alone and that's for casters too.
---
Warrior mechanics plus actually benefiting from the stats increases leads to a HUGE improvement for their damage.
---
I don't think you understand what a private server is... none of that stuff you mentioned applies. 
---
WTF... did you have a stroke while typing this?
---
Yeah you're right it's insane. They should really disable world buffs in raids. It will be a true vanilla extract experience this way since nobody used them in vanilla.
---
Uhm unrelated question. Are AQ 20 and AQ 40 completely separated raids? Or are them 2 difficulties of the same?
---
In my case I leave in the morning. Get home at like 6 or 5:30Kids are put to sleep at like 8. By like 8:30 Im usually done with anything I needed to do for the night. 
---
From there I can do whatever. I'll usually go to sleep at like midnight because sleeping earlier rarely works for me. So if I just went and played video games each night that would be 3x7=21 hours in a week. It's usually more like I'll play for 2 and then spend some time with the wife. Some nights it's just games. Some nights it's just wife. In any case it's def 10+ a week I'll play.

Dyanmic spawning only increases spawn rates if too many people are in the area, which they wouldn't be if you are leveling faster than 99% of the population.
---
Also if there are some mobs that give too much xp then there is an equally likely chance there are also mobs that give less than they should. 
---
And they fixed the xp rates for the 30+ quests before the last big launches. Not to mention Joana did his fastest time when there were a lot of additional quests in the game that private servers don't launch with.
---
Which is a good trade for rogues as they cant have both mh poisoned and wf at the same time as it overrides wf
---
I'm not basing it on speculation, I am basing it on the current state of the gaming industry. All the shifts in development have been towards making games more drop in and drop out. Even a seemingly long winded game like RDR2 (by today's standards) allows you to do a mission and reward you appropriately to make you feel like you've accomploshed something in well under an hour. 
---
MMORPGs as a sub-genre have died out because of such trends in the market.  I am most definitely basing it on facts so your point is invalid.
---
take my time for leveling, having as much fun as possible, enjoying the open world and communitx and play alot pvp :)
---
Those are slight adjustments. I wouldn’t equate those changes to making content irrelevant. Elites to regulars isn’t much. More quest hubs would actually be more content unless you consider the grinding mobs during the quest gaps better than just more quests. Slightly better xp rate isn’t a big deal either and along with going to Outland at 58 just all resulted in no more mindless grinding. Those changes put together, more xp, more quest hubs, Outland at 58 all ended up just cutting out the mindless mob grinding that was part of vanilla lvling and made it so you can continually quest til 70. 
---
I consider that fine tuning and flushing out the questing but i can understand that some ppl may enjoy the mindless grinding breaks that were originally there. Personally repeatedly killing mobs wasn’t fun for me unless I’m gold farming. 
---
I'm very tempted to because I wanted a change of pace. But I get the sense it won't feel right, even though I only played for about a year.
---
I was thinking about rolling paladin aswell, but I dont want to wear all random cloth/leather stuff in order to have some decent healing gear. 
---
Dual spec wasnt in vanilla and I dont feel like paying 50 gold whenever you want to switch between pvp and pve.
---
Oldschool fans most definitely do care about modern design. Trying to convince my vanilla guild mates (with whom I cleared ZG as a server first with) to play on pservers and even classic is a push. For every vanilla player who has the time to repeat the experience many simply do not have the time as they have demanding careers, families, and other activities they care more about now.  
---
You can't just make such general statements about the player bas considering that it has been about 12 years since vanilla ended. 
---
Or a catheter
---
You cant have them pay the 2nd highest bidder's bid because if I know I'm competing against someone for a piece of loot I can just bid one under their max points to completely drain them so I'll be able to get the next few pieces.  You bid what you're willing to pay privately and then you pay that amount.
---
Completely separate. Vanilla didn't have anything like that where it was different based on how many people entered. There are somethings like 45minute Baron in undead Stratholme and the Dire Maul North Tribute runs which are "hard modes" of the time. Different strategy for the dungeon that rewarded better gear.
---
LC is fine if you are in a guild with competent leadership.
---
Trolls really are struggling these days ain't they....
---
Same. Also been in one where there are 3 random non-officer's promoted to the loot council every raid. This would give them visibility into the voting and the ability to vote for a person outside of the guild leadership. Works perfect IMO
---
Lol nice bait
---
Dwarf priest on a nightsaber mount by level 40.
---
Ah. Dunno that place, but there were lots of built areas with no gameplay because there weren’t enough rewards (there are only so many slots on the character), so points of interest like that village were abandoned.
---
A certain pserver beginning with K and ending 3 is probably more stable and closer to vanilla than anything ActiBlizz are going to put out. If you think Classic WoW is going to be better in terms of exploits you're dreaming. 
---
Also the concept of something being bug-free is a complete fallacy. Just look up the seven core principles of software testing. 
---
ActiBlizz are clearly using nostalgia as a cash grab meaning that in terms of continued support things aren't looking too promising. If anything due to the community, bugs in pservers are remedied much quicker. Whether that be through GM intervention or fixes. 
---
1-6 takes about an hour in classic. Im not sure on 20 (5-7 hours?) but it’d be a bit of a time investment to level each class. 
---
High quality bait
---
Suicide kings has the same problem.. probably even more extreme in the SK case.
---
Dual wield frost was {kissing sound}!
---
As a ret paladin you want a sizable amount of melee crit gear. Tier 2 stuff has no melee crit. You'll be running around auto attacking and being a general nuisance and nothing more. 
---
**Every** loot system has flaws, and people will try to exploite them.
---
In a DKP system you can go negitive, or at least the one i was on could.  
---
You aren't in a top tier raiding guild for the loot.
---
SK has its problems too! Once you have all the gear what motivates a person to come back? Better yet time to wipe on a boss all night.
---
This is the problem my guild had with SK, people just dont want to show up.  Personly I been in a top guild with LC never had a problem with it.  I could careless about loot and how it is handled.  I show up for the fun of the raid, loot is just a by product.  
---
That's on the priests.
---
Yeah, people keep talking about "farming all week" for consumables but in reality it was never needed. I'm having this issue with a few morons on my private server right now who think people should flask for BWL farm nights. 
---
What actually used to happen was you would attempt bosses and if it became clear that you did not have enough dps or healing to kill something, THEN you used consumables to push you over the line. Farm nights are supposed to help build up your materials and gold reserves not piss more money away so you can clear it 20 minutes faster.
---
Yeah and Death Knight class unlock should be dropping from 4.99$ lootboxes with 2% chance.
---
&gt; In vanilla, hearth points were spells that were cast on you and recorded your current position to the stone
---
Pretty sure it's still that way. In Retail my hearth always puts me on top of a lamp on top of a bar.
---
It should be a pitty timer, starting at a 0.1% chance and increasing, only getting to 2% after 100 lootboxes are opened.
---
Although those who pre-purchase the pandaran package with full T3 and level 60 boost should get a 10% chance to also get DK.
---
Only if you are specced into BM though, which most people won't be at 60. Very useful for WPvP while leveling however.
---
Nothing is necessary but it recommend and more efficient to wand mobs down while the target is dotted. You'll be using your wand all the way to 60 regardless.
---
In pvp wanding is the last ditch effort attack. Scaling with higher end wands is horrible. Most people will respec out of Imp wand at 60. 
---
Shadow priest in pvp is very powerful. The biggest issue is going OOM. You will find yourself drinking like half the time. 
---
you be a melee class. her a caster. 
---
Chtun is at the end of AQ 40? 
---
What's the last boss of AQ 20?
---
Full T3 for main and off spec (T3 equivalent for off at least) at a casual pace. I dont plan in being first in line to Naxx, but I wanna get there eventually.
---
The textures and models will probably will be the closest to vanilla, since those are the easiest to revert, if you have the assets.
---
These weird items and abilities are the hardest to properly replicate.
---
Ossirian the Unscarred, a falcon faced Anubis that's a fun fight. I will save mechanics for you to find out on your own because that's the fun of a lot of the game.
---
thanks for clearing that up, i remember reading somewhere that wanding was important for priest.
---
At what point though?
---
Is a single piece worth losing 2% crit?
---
Time will tell
---
As far as I can tell, the private servers where alot more accurate to vanilla then the demo. And I can't find any info or tested facts that the demo had more accurate xp then the most popular vanilla server atm. People have to stop pointing fingers at private servers for not being accurate. The Nost core used old videos to base there data on which is copying data basically and ever since then the newer servers have build upon that with the same mentality.
---
Any pet with 1.5 attack speed will have very good frenzy up-time.
---
Corporate white collar IT work, but we have roughly 30 days paid time off per year (they drastically cut our sick hours and combined what was left with vacation days into PTO days). 
---
Many players back in retail vanilla just account shared. 
---
Can we be friends?
---
Taming Ghost Saber in Ashenvale, getting exalted with Timbermaw, and getting Winterspring Frostsabre. I intend to do this on only one character. It's a long, grindy way ahead...
---
This, only I'll be in redridge.
---
Taming Ghost Saber in Darkshore, getting exalted with the Timbermaw, and getting Winterspring Frostsabre. It's a long, grindy way ahead...
---
I've been in "casual" retail guilds though. And if you are doing a guild run, then yeah, sure, you can bring a lot of shit, it's usually fine if the people are ok players. But when you have spots in a raid to fill and people wanting the spots, doesn't matter if you are a casual guild or not, then you will pick the players who are most useful. If you have a choice between a fury warr and a ret pala you will all other things being equal choose the warrior every time. Unless you want a healer, in which case you will make the ret pala go heals, but still. 
---
You guys are entirely correct about how it was back in vanilla WoW, my main point is that WoW classic is not the same as vanilla WoW, people will behave differently now, even casuals. 
---
Jesus Christ. Stonewatch Keep on a high pop server with dynamic spawn is hell on Azeroth. 
---
I nolife my job and save up lots of vacation so I can nolife wow classic on release. I should have just over 6 weeks saved up by release.
---
The sooner the better. If the guild is organized you can progress faster through content with team work. A lot of elite players have already formed guilds online.
---
But the reality is many new guilds will break up before you ever hit 60 and thus we call them leveling guilds. 
---
I love the armored ud mounts to death so as a human warlock stratholme will be my home
---
So i dont go for bestial wrath? I remember that being complete aids when i played a mage.
---
Also how does hunter pvp compare to my second choice which is a soul link warlock, i heard those were real spicy
---
Where in Greece? I really enjoyed my time on the islands (went to a few, really like Mykonos) but the mainland was kinda meh. Kefalonia was great as well.
---
I think the only thing I would be worried about is the shitty Greek Internet...
---
I'm gonna go with Salogel for my hunter...
---
Alright, so I'll provide my alternative perspective to OPs.  (I don't disagree with anything per se - just adding context mostly.)
---
I was in two different progression raiding guilds over the course of vanilla.  One was top tier - we were competing for server firsts.  The other was just a notch down - we were typically a few bosses behind the top tier guild(s).
---
**Top Tier Guild Experience** 
---
Generally 1-2 nights would be dedicated to our farm content, and then 1-2 nights for progression content.  For the farm content, there really weren't any requirements.  You could even bring alts and we didn't particularly care about the gear.  With that said, you weren't bringing in a brand-new 60 with green gear, unless we were just totally starved for players that night.  But if you were rocking a full set of blues, you're in.  No problem.  We also didn't use consumables these nights.
---
But then you had the progression nights.  These had tougher requirements.  Generally speaking, aside from the healer and the main tank, we weren't overly anal about specs.  As long as you were making a good faith effort to have a spec that could contribute, we didn't pay much attention to it.  We also didn't generally expect people to use flasks and such.  HOWEVER, this all changed once we got to the "new" bosses.  If we were going for a first-kill on a boss, we would get progressively more anal about these things depending on how much we struggled.  At first, perhaps only the tanks and key healers would be expected to flask.  But if we struggled and days or weeks on a certain boss, we'd starting having higher expectations.  Are we having DPS problems?  Lets start examining the damage charts and see if people are using optimal specs.  Are people dying to AOE/incidental damage?  Let's make sure the healers are spec'd properly, let's see if we need the DPS to start using more consumables to stay alive, food bonuses, etc.  This is the point where we might start making swaps too.  "We need more DPS, guys.  X class, we're gonna have to drop one or two of you to get Y class in here instead.  So sorry guys." 
---
Etc.  As you can see, it was a bit of a sliding scale.  If the content was easy, no one particularly cared.  For progression content, we amped it up, but it still wasn't overly anal -- unless we started struggling.  The longer we struggled with an encounter, the higher the scrutiny got and the more people would be expected to adjust/sacrifice/adapt/swap.
---
**"Secondary" Tier Guild Experience**
---
Similar schedule.  Ironically, sometimes Secondary Tier guilds might actually raid on *more* nights, because it would take them longer to clear content.  For instance, the Top Tier guild might clear all their farm content in one night - while the Secondary Tier guild might take 2-3 nights.  My experience in this guild is that there were very low expectations with regards to consumables, flasks, etc.  We might encourage them for critical players and/or some of those critical players might do it of their own volition, but it was rarely imposed on the entire raid.
---
Specs were rarely scrutinized.  If the guild started struggling on progression content, you generally didn't have the same "ramp up" that you had in the Top Tier guild.  You'd generally just keep going at it until your guild learned enough to down it -- which could often take weeks, or in some cases even months. 
---
With that said, there's a lot of variability in these types of guilds.  You could get a super anal raid leader that has dreams bigger than his guild is capable of, and so he starts imposing tough restrictions left and right, becomes a spec nazi, etc.  But I think those are mostly exceptions.  In general, these types of guilds are pretty chill.  But that comes at the expense of progress - you're going to move **significantly** slower, and you're also likely to lose your best players over time.
---
Isle of Dread also has the coolest cave in-game. The little 'hidden' area behind the water at the Nagas makes it stand out.
---
At some point you could stack over 100% armour penetration and then it would scale exponentially.
---
Shame there is no Tauren Monk

#Nochanges
---
I would be so down. Planning on raiding with a frost mage so i can pvp with elemental mage later on, but if I could just raid as ele that would be awesome. 
---
&gt;On my arms warrior for example I would go down a lot of item levels to get an item with haste and no mastery.
---
But add a socket to the shit item and it's suddenly better. Or titanforge it to 395 or something and it's probably better. There are no BiS items, you can get better gear from almost any content, you don't have to target specific items. 
---
I play mage, but have a warrior alt as well, although I haven't simmed him much (I think as arms crit is simming best on him though. but yeah, mastery is shit). 
---
On my fire mage Crit is really really valuable right now in Uldir for single target, but that is mostly so I can get over the reorigination stack threshold. And for AoE my current stats with high mastery is great. But either way, for all mage specs, going down 15 ilvls is I think never worth it just for better secondary stats, except maybe on rings where there are no primary stats. It can be worth it for good traits or trinkets though, which is why a BiS list is useful there. 
---
I think it's best to roleplay these lore wise "classes" that are not present in-game, because they have so much more RP potential. Instead, in-game classes are pretty boring to roleplay, because it gives you less room for innovation, you have to stick to certain tropes and stereotypes. So instead of a Tauren Shaman, for instance, I'd go for a Tauren Earth Mender (like that Tauren Druid guy in the Plaguelands): a Tauren whose sole purpose in life is to restore the balance in barrened and tainted lands. That's a way more interesting concept for a character than, say, a Tauren Shaman who just ventures out in the world.
---
There are so many classes like this, like, instead of a plain Mage, a retired war Conjurer, an apprentice Scribe or an old, sage Clairvoyant. It's all about being creative!
---
Weird Goal but I want to Reach Desolace and do the questline with the centaurs after that just mess about.
---
This

Who u callin horse, shrimp
---
Get lvl 60
---
Farm gold
---
Make lvl 49 Twinks. 
---
not sure if those are bugs or rather "clever use of game mechanics" :D
---
Catch-up items?
---
dont worry, priest isnt very fast to level, but very chill to do so and healing some dungeons is a nice break from the grinding (if you are not running for server first priest)
---
I wanna play warlock and summon my friends off of cliffs and deep underwater so they drown. 🤣
---
Mage. Easy
---
\&gt; How important or necessary is getting imp wand dmg for both leveling and PvP.
---
its a hige deal
---
\&gt; For leveling, should it be my first 5 talent points as priority?
---
those can be your first or second 5 points, but at level 19 you should have 5/5 latest
---
\&gt; For PvP, will I find myself wanding much, if ever?
---
The best use for a wand in pvp is getting rid of shaman totems, otherwise you will either be casting spells or running around
---
I'd like to get either Rhok'delar or Benediction, hunter and priest are my two mains in retail wow. I didn't start playing wow until Warlords came out, and looking back I missed some really cool stuff. Those two are the main two on my bucket list.
---
Yeah, or maybe don’t give advice on a game you’ve never played?
---
“A good 15+ minutes” running from the front gates of SW to the Westfall flight master? Won’t take even half that and you’ve no idea if there was a flight master in Westfall in vanilla anyway. /facepalm
---
Obtain Benediction/Anathema.
---
What kind of gf would leave a R14? I mea  you're a friggin' warlord! :)
---
straight up NO
---
FOR THE HORDE!
---
Do you know if all enemies have a default leash in retail? Or how long distance evade works?
---
That sounds like a good system.
---
Urgh so if i want to face all the iconic Hearthstone cards in Classic i have to to AQ40 too.
---
(Of course i would never dream to see KelThuzad)
---
If guilds don't assign healers for tanks and other raid groups that seems destined to fail. 
---
Other side is play a shaman healer and chain heal your way to victory.
---
Lgthis Hpoe Cehpal,  and I don't think there is a close 2nd.  (Re: Spelling - Stupid Auto Mod)
---
I just long to be able to play classic a while again. Hopefully a few months/years before it's destroyed. But fingers crossed it will not be tainted too much.
---
Played Horde in Vanilla and through the end of TBC. Currently playing Alliance on a pserver. The plan for Classic as of now is to roll Horde.
---
Well with this not having an expansion looming over it in 2 years you have plenty of time to find a group to be able to do all the content eventually. Just keep at it and I'm sure you can find a guild to do it with.
---
Short answer: IF all day
---
Detailed answer for a new alliance toon, I typically put mine in whatever quest hub until I hit a level where I'm swapping zones alot (usually mid-way through redridge).  Then I put it in Stormwind. Then around lvl 30ish I move it to IF and leave it there because that's typically the level I start traveling back and forth between continents regularly.
---
Most crafting professions are not overly important to any one character/class as most of the major key craft-able items are BoE. Meaning you can get the benefits of said crafting profession with out being one yourself. 
---
Salo-gel sounds like a material you'd need to build something in some kind of sci-fi game.
---
That's an awesome piece of insight. Thanks!
---
I can agree with that.
---
So what you also have to do if you're a meme spec is to be the guy or gal that everybody loves. The funny witty one that is always a boon in raids due to being incredibly nice.
---
Then they will not pick a fury warrior over your furry feral butt but you, because you're the cool guy that everyone says HIII!!!!! the moment you log on ;-)
---
Being a good community member really adds to your being picked for groups or raids or not. I carefully crafted that image (swallowing when drama broke out an always taking the high road no matter how I longed to be nasty) while being a so-so player (caused my fair share of wipes). But in the end... "Heyaaa! We need you uncle Bones! Get your ass to ZG!"
---
Hey there, I know it's a tad late for you on the east coast, but, we &lt;Requiem&gt; are a NA Horde guild recruiting mature players looking to progress/raid but without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing the game. Planning on Thursdays &amp; Sundays at 9:00 PM EST (possible 3rd raid day TBD based on when content is made available.) If any of this sounds appealing feel free to message me and I can share discord so we can talk more or answer any questions you have.
---
I wanna do all the unarmored saber mount combo as a night elf hunter.
---
Unarmored black saber with a black panther.
---
Unarmored white saber with a frostsaber.
---
And lastly, the winterspring exalted saber with a pride watcher.
---
I really want blizz to add those mounts for the first few months.
---
Rotting ftw
---
Yep. I'm by no means saying it's impossible to play as a "meme spec". But there's a ton of people in here saying people won't care, which I'm sure isn't true. The reason people didn't care in vanilla was because most people didn't really know much at all. Nowadays even casuals know what specs are good, how to play a spec "correctly" and all that shit. All that is not as important if you're just trying to clear MC or whatever, but people at least know about it now. 
---
This isn't true. Journey didn't benefit from dynamic respawns beyond the first few hours. TBC quest xp values were fixed before launch. Journey also didn't have the luxury of Tanaris pirate cove quests, additional Hinterlands/Silithus/Searing Gorge quests. Joana did.
---
Haha good one. 
---
But in the end, not that many people play meme specs since the 'good' specs tend to be fun to play too. 
---
Raid leaders in classic will probably go "ok, we've got our boomkin and retpally slots covered, we need real dps now"
---
White raptor.... 
---
lots of free time is obviously a big part but alot of people forget that being efficient with your playtime is key
---
Mooo! Are you happy now?
---
It’s a video game not a finals exam
---
If you're going to play a tauren, go for the rarest look:
---
\- white skin
---
\- short white/grey horns
---
\- no beard or body hair
---
\- most young looking face (with the red eyes and no wrinkles)
---
You will have a true albino look. Always pick this set and never seen a Tauren looking like me.
---
Lightinghoof server, Alliance guild, Awakening.
---
These guys really wanted to get The Sacarb Lord title for their Guild leader (and they did).
---
If you farmed up matts and consumables, you could go on BWL with promised 2-3 loot items depending on how much you brought.
---
As a casual Paladin, this got me my Ret weapon, a trinket and Neff's head.
---
After that, I never had issues getting in any non-progression raid on the server again.
---
But before that, went on lots of pickup raids of ZG and MC... Just not much luck on the rolls so very little to show for my time.  
---
Really wasn't much difference between the two raid groups, just that Awakening had minimum stats you had to clear to be in guild.  The pulls and raid leaders were pretty much identical, DBM and decurse needed for both, but metres were pretty much just the raid leaders.  They told you if you were not doing enough or not.
---
Clear MC on 1st week of classic launch
---
Obtain Sulfurus as a shaman.
---
Do you make fun of people in wheelchairs too?
---
Dude I think you missed his deliberate joke 😄
---
??
---
The only truly legit classic experience was nostalrius, which was amazing to play on,and got so big it was overshadowing retail. 
---
I played for a good 5 months before it got shutdown and the population was only rising, it overtook retail on twitch in terms of viewership. 
---
Dreadsteed of Xoroth quest. Nothing is as rewarding as collecting all of those mats and getting the coolest looking mount in classic
---
My husband and I have gamed together for more years than I'll admit, but we didn't get to level together in Vanilla the first time around. This time, we've got a killer duo planned and an Alterac Ram to get (again)!
---
Just saw this a little late.
---
I love that Xeno is dead in that Picture.  This is Sapho by the way, raidng Nax40 with Requiem has the most fun I had in WoW. 
---
To be fair that was /played, not worrying about being world first or anything. Take into account that people are trying to get to 60 ASAP and most likely sleep deprived, it will probably be slower than what the fastest /played could be
---
There are several other high elf npcs kicking around. Fiora Longears in Theramore, for example.
---
I bet you’re the guy who got the first mageblade then quit right after the raid because loot council isn’t fair. I’ve seen people get loot then quit because they hate loot council. For everyone who stays it works really well. 
---
Absolute nonsense, there are many servers like K3 that are as close to vanilla.
---
Used to do the same thing, shh dont ruin it 
---
 3 day work week with no wife/gf and no kids 👌
---
Ehhh, one could argue that the 1.13 survival guide has been being built for over a decade of private server experience. 
---
Which state? I'm a geologist in CA (mostly dealing with engineering geology, with the occasional environmental and groundwater project).
---
Only the hunters that have ambition for the 'active hunter' role. If you're one of the rest, it's not that active ;-)
---
That's a good idea.
---
Im one of the guys that Kargoz mentioned in his Priest Guide (my nick is Enslin)
---
Now to answer your questions, based on what we saw on demo:
---
\- /sit wont work.
---
\- quiver wont increase your wand speed.
---
\- weaving melee wont work.
---
\- moreover wand would spend full time GCD before shooting, which is terrible, it sure is.
---
\- Despite all those terrible differences from private servers, one thing could be very useful : increased mana regeneration rate. On demo it was shockingly good. But not sure if it persist on release.
---
Only good thing you could do to increase your leveling speed would be pre-planning your route. Actuall classic will be MUCH MUCH MUCH more different for a priest player than it was on private servers.
---
Lvl 60 Full Imperial Plate
---
I want to enjoy the looong ride to lvl 60. Just the way I did it almost 15 ? (omg) years ago. My journey ended in the face of Thaddius, so I think I did quite well. 
---
But raiding / endgame is by far not everything. You can twink, you can pvp, rp and so on. Wow was not a rushed experience, very different from today (Not sure, I quit years ago).
---
I'm sorry but all I can say is LOL
---
Making enough funds to support me and my two best friends who met through talking about wow in elementary school when I had just moved there :)
---
We’re already planning professions and stuff, just waiting on our friend to pick a class
---
No,  it isn’t.
---
One of my favorite memories was making twinks.   
---
Early in wow I had a lvl 40 Arms warrior running down mid 30s on my mount in WSG (which later changed to a lvl 49).  
---
My favorite one was my 29 rogue who got exalted with the Timbermaw faction, for some  45ish green mace with no level requirement, as well as the trinket that summoned a personal healer.
---
MI. I'm an environmental consultant for EPA region 5 and the MDEQ.

Have fun walking as fast as everyone else but feeling like your going. At half speed, 
---
So you have nothing to counter with, nice way to admit you can't keep up with discussion. Have a good day!

If you "bid one point under their max points" what is to say they bid all their points to get the items? You might just end up winning the bid in that case, thus wasting your points on something you didn't really want where you were just doing bid shenanigans.
---
Thus the value of anonymous bidding and second highest bid pay.
---
These are age old techniques used in different auctioneering formats.
---
Thanks so much for the feedback guys. Any thoughts on troll vs UD? Might be an entirely different thread..
---
&gt;The "inner circle" was sort of 5 people **including myself** 
---
9/10 people saying they like loot council were in the council themselves. Not saying you didn't have a good experience, just pointing out this pattern.
---
Sooooo a twink tauren?
---
There are SK variations just like DKP.
---
Often, the MT is still geared on a need basis. Typically the MT is the biggest no-life that is at every single raid, helping everyone run every dungeon etc. And often the GM. So no one has any issue having them geared ASAP as it also helps the entire raid immediately.
---
# Get my hands on a Whistle of the Ivory Raptor!
---
^(Assuming the unarmored versions of mounts are in the game and I can get to 60 fast and gather a 1000g fast.)
---
What are you basing your claims off of? It's not clear if you even understood the scenario.
---
Too many Lupos can *consume the ISB stacks,* meaning a shadow bolt will hit which would have had increased damage due to ISB debuff, but no longer will have that increased damage because ISB fell off. It fell off because Lupos attacks consumed the charges, and a 20% increase to a Lupos attack is less than 20% of a shadow bolt and thus it's a loss in raid DPS.
---
I'm an Electrical Engineer Monday-Friday and work my local bar most Friday/Saturday and Sunday nights.
---
Luckily my main job finishes around 4pm each day and I have a cool girlfriend who is happy to let me persue my WoW interests.
---
You WILL find that Classic takes up most of your time but try and get your partner/kids involved. Raid in the living room so they can laugh at your team chat when all goes wrong and adventure around Azeroth while chatting with them about it.
---
Take a few hours off at least 2 nights a week for dates and family time (bar Wednesdays of course) and you'll soon see that things don't have to be that bad.
---
Sure the grind to 60 may take longer but once there, your family around you will understand your passion for it and will most likely be the first to spur you on 🤗
---
How can you possibly try to defend Activision? You need to research that company. Yes, Blizzard makes mistakes too, but Activision can be blamed for the majority of them.
---
All these loot systems are open to modification. All rules are 100% transparent and non-arbitrary, that's what's so great about them.
---
In one SK style, if the whole list passes on an item, then you go down the entire list a second time and then "rolling" on the item makes you only go down a couple of spots on the list.
---
This way people can get stuff for their OS. Also, it discourages "hoarding" your spot because then people at the bottom can keep getting everything!
---
So it's just better to "need" on something you need and not try and game the system.
---
People don't agree about hunters getting Ashkandi either, but you can be sure I'll be all over it. 
---
SysAd. I've got 210 hours of PTO in the bank, might as well use it for a week. Maybe two.
---
Nothing gets scrapped if anyone needs it. It doesn't matter if you're on the absolute bottom of the list. If none of the 39 other people in the raid (who are above you) needed on the item, you can need on it.
---
This is the advantage over DKP, where often things get DEd that were upgrades because no one wants to waste points.
---
Usually things like no-shows lead to a -1. It's detailed in the video. Any guild can come up with their own rules.
---
&gt; I don't think people will make 60 much quicker than that.
---
Joana says he can likely knock his 116 hour run down to 96 during Classic. He thinks looting change alone will save 5 hours.
---
I did 120 recently with a Paladin on a blizzlike xp server and currently routing that down another five or six hours.
---
But only for Blood Elf and Draenei.
---
Join a bad guild and make it mediocre.
---
1.13?
---
If it works the same as Vanilla did - clever use.
---
If it is not Blizzlike - bug.
---
I think that’s what people are calling the classic WoW “patch”
---
For leveling or for 60 content?
---
If you don't have a sense of what your competition is planning then you have failed.  You wouldn't bid on something you didn't want anyways.  I've personally used this system before and I constantly would peg my competition down to 0 so I would get the items I really wanted first.  I felt bad about it but it was the best way to use the system for me.  We changed it to pay what you bid after people started gaming it so hard.
---
Age old auctioneering format has always been you pay what you bid.  There are various formats of 'max bid' but those only work on public bids.
---
Hunter.
---
Fwiw Mulgore is a top tier starting zone. Only Teldrassil competes with it!
---
Why are you birthing kobolds though?
---
Wow Classics officially patch on release will be 1.13.
---
Ok good:) p.s. They all dress up in game anyways, but a very competitive bunch lol
---
Then make do with second best:-D
---
I’m talking about if paul has to pass on loot because he signed up for raid but didn’t show. The negative that was mentioned in the video. I’m don’t care about sharded loot. This is about the negative on pauls name. If he takes loot that no one else needs does he stay negative? 
---
I saw the part about no shows in the video, that doesn't address partial attendance, which with 40 people in a raid happened all the time. I know guilds can make their own rules but what's the proposed standard approach? I don't see how you could run a system like this without running into the issue for more than 2 weeks
---
The cleanest solution would seem to be running this process on a per-boss basis, or re-building the list any time someone leaves or joins. That, however, seems incredibly time consuming without some sort of developed tool
---
I just don't feel like arguing with someone so fundamentally mistaken (I've quite had my fill of that on this subreddit), and the whole "agree to disagree" thing is far too courteous for my tastes.
---
People are so obsessed with retail in this sub that it's getting ridicoulous. Are you really so insecure about classic being good that you have to bash another game to justify your viewpoint?
---
Nah nah I'm not saying that. Joining wth Sauron represents giving in to fear and giving up hope.
---
Varies, based on your leveling speed, where you are, how long you are going to be questing there, where the village is, etc.
---
Like if I'm going to hillsbrad at 30? I'll be there for a hand full of quests and maybe a level, I'll set my hearth in org. But in desolace, I'll be there for 4-5 levels and the village is extremely out of the way. I'll set my hearth there. 
---
Or if you're in STV, no reason not to set it in Gromgol. You can head straight to UC/org from there, but you'd have to run back every time you want to hearth and turn in quests.
---
If you're leveling slowly, I'd probably move the hearth around with me more to get more use out of it. Dungeons I only do when I'm feeling like I can take a break, so usually when I'm heading back to a capital anyway, or I'm already near there (e.g. uld when I'm in badlands, or WC when I'm in barrens).
---
stack warrior gear and all the sudden you have no int or spell power. so yeah t2 isnt that bad. the blue pvp set also only has 1% crit. plus you dont have to go 8/8 tier 2. 
---
you get like 3-4% crit just from being naked from base agility. then you got 5% crit talent, and then you got 2 crit from each ring, 2 crit from trinket, and 2 crit from tuf. t2 has stength, spell power (increases healing and increases your soc seal and judgement damage) and int which is great to have. but with no t2 or r10 gear you are looking at warrior peices with no spell power or int. 
---
yes t2.5 is way better and maybe swap some peices out like gladiators chest with +4 stats enchant is 3% crit. but t2 is still good
---
a couple of years down the road "world of warcraft: classic (with pandas)" by activision
---
And then you just keep a bank alt in Org, and you'll basically never need to go there! 
---
Hitting someone who is sitting should cause a critical hit just as it did in vanilla. I don’t understand why people think that was just a private server thing.
---
I rarely set mine to a capital city unless its end game. Otherwise its where im questing or booty bay. 
---
Why not both? 
---
Lmao, pserver more stable than actual people who made the game? LOL
---
Corporate catering. Work 4am to 130pm. Gives me 8 hours to grind each day without hating myself in the morning.  Probably will push close to 10 hours a day. And weekends will be non stop no life.
---
Just let her try a few different classes out to see what she likes, or show yours if you have any alts and give her a run-down. It's pretty impossible to decide for someone else whether they'll enjoy casting or hitting things or playing a support role. 
---
Easiest isn't always the best fit either. The one friend I've introduced to the game tried hunter and rogue before she settled on warlock, which she loves even though she sucks at it and did much better with the other two. 
---
That's a really well laid-out answer.
---
pointless retail bashing..
---
It's like listening to the intro of a Drama Time story...
---
Very cool, thanks for doing that! I'll keep an eye on the reddit community and jump in on the discussion.
---
2 différent market... and both are correct for their audience...
---
I was outdpsing many people in my raid until half into AQ40. I didn't even use consumes except mana pots. Yes the skill of my guildmates was probably lower than mine, but the more important thing was that I can't remember once the raid leader talking shit to a DPS because he was at the bottom of the dps meter (not everyone had a dps meter btw), let alone removing someone of the raid/guild for that reason.
---
And I totally expect it to be like that in Classic. Not for every guilds of course, but as you will find people that fit you, we chill and casual will find people that fit us.
---
And you should not try to go against that.
---
you have seperate gear for pvp thats plate. and you dont need to respec unless you want to switch from holy and ret. the pvp spec and pve spec for holy can be the same 
---
Construction manager. Life is all about planning time and work/life balance. Classic will be an excellent test to prove to myself I can be successful both in WoW and irl. Superthick 
---
True, they didn't make the content irrelevant, just easier and shorter.
---
Who's defending Activision? Are you actually serious? I didn't say they're innocent. What I said is exactly what Blizzard community manager said, Activision doesn't have that huge influence on Blizzard as people like you think. 
---
Yes it's mostly Blizzard and only Blizzard doing all of those shitty decisions from the past few months. 
---
that bad huh?
---
Srsly, that is the rarest? I always picked dark brown with a beard. Never went with something else. Maybe I risk it this time.
---
&gt; But most people don't want to bother with that shit. 
---
Wrong. You and the people you played with don't want to bother with that. Everyone thinks and played the game differently. This thread is a good example of it.
---
Quiver only matters before you get 4 bags, so like 1-15? Plus you most likely won't find one before you get 4 bags without going out of your way to get it. 
---
Melee weaving is too much APM to be worth the small DPS increase. Again, could be kind of useful in the lower levels but very annoying to do consistently for little return. I'd rather wand alt tab for a few seconds. 
---
Martyrdom is a waste of talent points. Good for PvP, but leveling you'll have your shield to prevent pushback and wands don't get pushback. By the time the mob gets to you, you'll most likely be wanding already, so what's the point? 
---
TL;DR don't pay too much attention to those class guides, most of them include super weird playstyle that only serve to shave seconds of playtime per level at the cost of high maintenance, clunky mechanics. Priest leveling = 5/5 wand spec and 5/5 spirit tap. The rest doesn't matter until 40 shadowform (or 45 if you don't want to lose wand spec for 5 levels). 
---
Play mage, do both
---
Finish BWL. Never made it in vanilla (scrubby hunter lol) and while I was present for a Nefarian kill in 3, it’s not the same. 
---
Maybe have her play every class to like level 10 or something so she gets an idea of what the playstyle will be like? There's also retroWoW...it's an instant 60 PvP private server, but she can give every class a go on target dummies @ max level to see what the general feel of the class is like.
---
I was a warrior running UBRS, with another Top guild warrior that was tanking, he put on ML and that sword dropped....I didn't really want it or needed it but the hunter in the group rolled and I didn't, then all of a sudden it ends up in my bag. That warrior refused to give it to a hunter, I ended up disenchanting it.
---
Copy that Soldier, be safe now.
---
Doesn't work in PvE. 
---
Well if you don't explain with facts why I am wrong seeing as I can't find any proof of your claims myself then neither of us leave habing gained anything. Thanks for the waste of time I guess.
---
When I was a kid I thoroughly enjoyed having to tell my parents for the 300th time why you can't pause an online game.
---
Some various points are really great for horde vs alliance.  Ratchet can be a good spot for Horde in the 15-40 level range because you're always just a quick boat ride into STV / southern Eastern Kingdoms, accessible to Crossroads or anywhere else in Kalimdor via Ratchet flight path, and Zeppelins aren't too far away either based on either a flight to Org from Ratchet (super quick) or the boat to BB / -&gt; Flight to Gromgol.  
---
Also kind of depends on class.  If you are hunter or druid, you travel that much quicker so it's a bit less of a drag to run back and forth into the local quest hub.  On the other hand, warrior or rogue is tough especially pre-40 because you have less ways to run away from mobs while other classes have simple and easy disengage.  Rogues can vanish but then you're running at 50% speed. 
---
Alliance have some similar spots but they don't come til a bit later IMO.  Wetlands is a good one, very quick flight to IF and boat access to Darkshore/Theramore.  Vs Horde can get Ratchet realistically at level 10 if they want or even level 1 if they go straight from Orc starting area to Ratchet -&gt; XR -&gt; camp T -&gt; thunderbutt -&gt; rehearth to starting area
---
Yes,4k support,new graphics,battle net integration,player reporting and updated graphics.
---
Seeing as the company that made it is still carrying out QA on the 7.2 engine which should have a fairly good test coverage already, yes. 
---
Seeing as I do software testing as a part of my job in developement it's rather concerning to see a company that made the game seemingly struggle more than people reverse engineering the software.
---
You can definitely get a wand by the time you're 15-19 from quests. Either go enchanting, craft a wand at lvl 10 and go wand spec into spirit tap or don't craft/buy a wand and go 5/5 spirit tap into 5/5 wand spec. 
---
Those two talents are better than any other priest talent. 
---
It's more or less justified, though, and raises a valid point.
---
If you look at it at base level, Blizzard themselves, after many years of fan outcry, finally caved in and invested into bringing us Classic (Vanilla) once more. A non-biased person here would say: "But why are they bringing an old game back when the game has evolved so much and is being played by millions right now?". To them, our answer cannot be understood.
---
But the real answer is, no matter how you look at it, Classic is objectively better than Retail in almost any way imaginable. Blizzard finally understood that (of course after crunching the financial numbers no doubt), and will deliver. They know that retail is not going to last much longer, and that it's not really a *fun* game anymore.
---
Also having bashful banter is always good for small communities and it keeps us together, on the right path, and with high morale.
---
Yeah I wonder if any of these people saying their guilds didn't care about debuff limits were warlocks. Most likely their guild *did* care about them but because it didn't really apply to their class, they didn't notice or simply forgot.
---
My guild was very much a casual raiding guild and I was a warlock. As casual as we were, I was not allowed to spam dots.
---
Can we atleast get the ashenvale fire bear (Ursol'lok or something like that) then? (:
---
Trial and error, join em, see if they're a match, if not try another.
---
It's pretty inconsequential, they're all really good talents. I just prefer to stay questing and not really bother for gear til 20+. Basically I go spirit tap until a dope wand drops. Then I'll go wand when I get one.
---
Correct that Classic is objectively superior, as well as TBC &amp; WOTLK. The hope is that Blizzard returns to that pre-Cataclysm style - making the game easier and easier, burning people out with world quests, azerite, etc, has only costed them a massive amount of lost profit, despite every game decision being made solely to generate more revenue.
---
I see. 
---
How new is k3? Is it another iteration of Kronos? OK just checked and yes that's what you mean. At the time of nostalrius' popularity Kronos had features not included in retail wow, and nostalrius WAS considered the closest to retail vanilla possible. 
---
Regardless, Nostrius was the premier classic wow experience and it overtook retail in terms of popularity judged by viewership. This is not at all what your statement portrays. 
---
The idea that retail wow is just a game for a different generation and not superior or inferior in any way or ways is false. Vanilla wow had better progression, better immersion, and could be put down or picked up as people pleased the same as any other game. 
---
The idea that kids don't want to sit and play a good computer game for 7 hours straight is based on what? People do it with league, they do it with fortnite and so on and so on. The huge majority of vanilla wow players were not hard-core raiders but simply people who played here and there.
---
I played from vanilla into TBC. It took me like 6-8 months to get my first character to 60, I never joined a guild, and I maybe raided like twice.
---
I spent all my time dicking around trying to climb ontop of stuff/climb over the mountains between zones, world PvPing, collecting crafting materials, trying to make money on the AH, and yelling in cities to join a dungeon run.
---
I've played on private servers off and on since Nost. Still have never joined a guild, level capped only two different characters, and never have raided. When Classic comes around, I'll probably keep playing the same way.
---
Yeah, I was thinking 50% would be fair if you include the songflower buff I forgot. The stats from that and zg buff along with onyxia and dm north will give you what, like 450 total attack power? The extra agility along with crit will make that more like 11-12% extra crit.  Then you have the pure dmf damage buff along with attack speed, and all of the extra rage you'll get from doing all that damage.
---
And the difference in a raid is fucking HUGE. You can take Rag out before the sons come out before your guild has even stepped foot in bwl
---
depends on the spec, though, and weapons were better for basically anyone than what you could get without shitloads of effort.
---
[here's a pre-raid BiS slot](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1olXAtAugoQ4-Vb_e-jEH7NNe6eJBS93gMl10BaBRzeo/) and the last page contains pre-T5 and pre-T6 lists too.
---
the gap wasn't nearly as big as most people would imagine.

116 hours for my paladin on Nost PVE

Retail currently has under 1 million subscribers. BFA launched with 3.2 million then dropped to 1.7 million as of October 2018.
---
This post was removed for baiting/trolling.
---
That's how much skill you needed at the time. The only thing of note (if you can call it that) I did with that position was successfully organize tranq shot rotations on the bosses that required them. I considered that advanced at the time.
---
People on r/wow has been complaining a lot, I don't think bfa is right for anyone lol.
---
Get to 60, without a doubt. Highest I ever made during Vanilla was 40-45, can't remember exactly. I only made it to max level during TBC on a Blood Elf Paladin.
---
I sell crack hit me up
---
Good post, matches my casual vanilla raiding experience as well.
---
I would like to bring up another point - voice comms. For a lot of people vanilla WoW was the first time they ever did any gaming that required lots of interaction with other players, and using Teamspeak/Ventrillo was very new and alien to these people. My guild raided for months before we got a teamspeak server, and a lot of people were not comfortable speaking (this was EU and English was a second language for most of us). I know another casual guild on our server that made it to Twin Emps before TBC without ever using voice comms. Part of the reason it took us hours and hours to clear MC and other raids was that we had to spend 20 mins typing out boss tactics in raid chat...
---
Didn't mean that BFA is good. I just mean that it's ok to have a "theme park" wow and another one more "sandbox".
---
It's not really valid. You can make friends in retail. You can explore in retail. You have factions in retail. You do dungeons in retail. You craft and trade in retail. While retail has obnoxious time gating, vanilla still time gates gear.
---
Classic has better class mechanics. The talent system rework made a huge difference for a lot of people, it stripped away your identity. There's more than enough people playing retail to keep them from financial woes. It's not better, it's just a different game at this point. That's like saying Super Mario Bros is objectively better than Odyssey. 
---
had a friend who collected arena points from the beginning of TBC with his warrior alt, then at the start of season 3 bought almost every new and shiny piece he could get his hands on, instantly getting decked out with a character he played about an hour weekly... and went and fucked shit up in the arenas, quickly amassing enough rating for the shoulders and weapons too. iirc was like a few points short of glad at the end of S3.
---
TBC was a glorious time.
---
Great read, Taurens are such a great race, awesome background Story.
---
Glad to join you all in Mulgore.
---
Just having a hard time to decide which color I want. I always had like dark brown, because I thought the earth tone would fit a Druid. 
---
Where do you get the numbers of subscription ? Blizzard didn't give the sub number since many years now. I didn't even try BFA at all, Legion was enough boring to me...
---
not classic but ret paladin worked rly well for my so she could just mash buttons and do decent.  I could tell her when use cd's on me and she always had bubble as a get out of jail free card. 
---
so maybe hpala if your alli 
---
It was a joke hence the stupid moking video 
---
They're doing what others sites have done for years.
---
Where you quest. The capital city is the home of your bank alt. Your main doesn't need to be there. 
---
As a priest I want the biggest active friends list. My goal is to have as many people as possible asking me for groups and invites every time I log on.
---
&gt;Correct that Classic is objectively superior  
---
lol this phrase  
---
get to 60
---
professions to max
---
help people
---
gear up
---
get corrupted ashbringer
---
be happy
---
I don't like it. I probably have to play in the night, due to having a girlfriend and daughter  and I can't really focus in the game in daytime. Especially my daughter needs a lot of attention. It'd be nice if in the night time I can play a bit of WoW especially during weekdays. Some time for myself.
---
Raid as Shadow. Do Naxx
---
I want to play in that guild 
---
Do you have a different idea for how they should’ve done it? To max a brand new character in TBC took just as long as it did in Vanilla only difference was that you ended at 70 instead of 60. Slightly quicker 1-60 but 10 more lvls on top of that. 
---
If they don’t boost it a bit then we would be at BFA now with lvl 120 and an insane amount of level time. A new player interested in the new expansion could easily spend 6+ months just lvling before they even get to it. A lot of players might even give up since it would be incredibly long and the end game content would be lacking players due to some eventually leaving over time and new players having an incredible amount to get through to even get there and replenish that playerbase. 
---
I thought the time to lvl in Vanilla was perfect so I’m ok with the boost because it kept the leveling time the same for TBC. Blizzard has done the extreme though and just completely made everything prior skippable and irrelevant and basically only requires a weekend to max out now. 
---
Get myself and my wife into a Nax guild. 
---
Never got to Nax in Vanilla, although reading some of the posts on here my guild would've been more than ready to take down some of the bosses. Really want to right that "wrong" from before and give my wife and I a new and fun experience with each other. 
---
That was patched right?
---
Meanwhile, everyone is still trying to figure out what actually *is* the audience of the retail WoW.
---
Who would have thought. in (classic) WoW subreddit... people obsess about WoW. Remarkable.
---
That's interesting. That raises a lot of questions like how will they progress, but ill just wait and see what happens.
---
This is laughably disingenuous and I say that as someone who is unsubbed from retail until classic comes out. 
---

I always roll female tauren. Nothing better than kicking some ass as a female cow
---
Obtain the Lionheart Helm and down Onxyia as a Fury War.
---
Get 3 full Pre Raid BiS sets for Druid. Bear Cat and Resto. In that order.
---
Also Getting all the Blue PvP gear was something I wish I did back in the day, so maybe do that
---
As an added benefit it's easy to quickly gank lowbies at Nesingwary.
---
Where's this info from? I've heard it is speculated to be around 4 mil.

I've been a Tauren Druid since i started, in Wrath.  
---
I'm so stoked to get to my main's... ROOTS... when Classic comes out.  
---
The cliff thing was patched pretty early, but I don't remember when. Summoning underwater (Booty Bay was my favorite spot), was effective a lot longer. You'd put unending breath on your helpers and by the time people loaded in it would be too late to make it to the surface. 
---
This is what me and my IRL friends are looking for.
---
I'm thinking about rolling a Dwarf Holy Priest and would love to raid like this and the times work out perfect for me.
---
Absolutely going to be checking out the discord.
---
For me I just can't play as human just feels wrong to play one in a roleplaying game
---
Also Taurens as they feel so slow and clumbersome, also larger hit range and being a big beefy boi means everyones gonna target you in pvp
---
I posted this on a different post earlier.  This is my preference for an alliance toon:
---
I typically put mine in whatever quest hub until I hit a level where I'm swapping zones alot (usually mid-way through redridge). Then I put it in Stormwind. Then around lvl 30ish and after I've done Stockades I move it to IF and leave it there because that's typically the level I start traveling back and forth between continents regularly.  
---
Honestly,  I plan to make a shitload of gold through farming and grinding while I level. Once 60 I want to at least get around the tier 2 range of gear and then pvp casually. Help other guildys gear up etc etc.
---
Nothing I said in my post said anything about the accuracy of private servers. My post said this:
---
On private servers the fastest time to 60 had time to prepare, at launch everyone will be clean, no gear upgrades from other tools or ah, no consumables, no buying quest items for quicker turn ins.
---
On private servers they were playing against half a million people logging in and crashing the servers constantly.
---
On private servers they werent competing for mobs against a server full of new characters leveling.
---
WF time will always be slower than fastest leveled time due to these reasons, accuracy of the pserver is not relevant. 
---
Wasn’t really shortly after. Almost a year. And a year later wotlk was launched. So halfway through tbc little less, content was made easier.
---
There are things that worked in Vanilla that were later fixed in Vanilla patches.
---
This is 1.12 specifically we're talking about, right?
---
Well, in vanilla leveling WAS the game. As more and more expansions game, it was more about the end-game and gear-progression. So leveling for longer isn't really such a bad thing. 
---
But to be real frank here:
---
I wouldn't have raised the level-cap to begin with, nor would I've added separate continents with zones in the same level range to the game. Once you are in 60-70 range there is nothing for you in Azeroth, you are always in Outland because all the 60-70 zones are there. That separates the playerbase and turns the whole Azeroth, the whole bloody game into lowbie territory.
---
That was the biggest mistake they've made, right there.
---
If the new expansions would've always added more zones but always in the 1-60 level range, then you would have more options to level, instead of "before everyone did X (level in azeroth/Outland), now everyone does Y (level in Outland/Northrend)"
---
Then the next big misconception on Blizzard's part is that content = more levels and more raids.
---
You can just as easily add world PvP objectives to the old zones or add new features and call those an expansion. Maybe flesh out 2-3 already existing zones with new questlines. There are a lot of ways one can expand an MMO, creating more zones is just one of many.
---
But I agree with you. The way TBC content was made, making those changes to Vanilla questing (raising xp rate, etc.) was a logical move. I just believe the issue was deeper.
---
Shaman tank.
---
Just save up your vacation time at work. That’s the biggest thing. 
---
Agreed, good loot council is the way to go. 
---
I've played with 2 guilds who use it where I came in not knowing a single person in the guild and was treated fairly by both of them. 
---
A good guild WANTS all of its raiders to be happy and to be able to perform their role... sounds like everybody bitching about it was just playing with shit guilds. 
---
Private servers are not 100% blizzlike, and i don't remember these 2 things actually existing in 1.12 which is the client we'll be getting, so clever use or not Blizzard is very unlikely to have them in the game is my point
---
'You have no power here, retail!'
---
I don't remember mace rogues being a thing in Vanilla, mostly because there weren't as many good maces as there were swords and daggers unless you reached rank 14. In addition, PvE was one of the only ways to get gear back then and Mace spec was useless in PvE (can't stun a boss) and you'd be seriously sacrificing DPS via crit (not speccing daggers) or extra swings (swords). 
---
Now, TBC was a different story, everyone and their cousin, including myself, was Mace spec! I ran a hybrid hemo-mace spec and would walk through almost every other class like tissue paper. 
---
Laughs in mage
---
It does work, it even crits in PvP and pve. However by 1.12 I think it was around 1.10 it was changed to not proc any abilities that proc off a crit.
---
So yes you can still force a crit by sitting in pve, but you can’t force a proc of enrage or anything else by sitting.
---
How is it objectively superior? That's totally subjective. Shitting on retail is about making yourself feel superior, nothing else. And the game never got easier and easier; while some parts are harder in Vanilla, the endgame is a lot harder in BfA. They're diffeent games, but that doesn't mean one of them has to suck.
---
Of course there will always be people who deny raid spots based on not full BiS. If we are assuming pugs, I would imagine inspecting on IF bridge or ORC bank to confirm the potential invite has at least decent gear will be the most likely. 
---
To get an invite to a casual raid guild, I would think nearly full pre raid bis would be expected.
---
Assuming a hardcore guild. I would think Pre raid bis would be a bare minimum to get an invite. If not more gear as the game goes on.
---
Setting my hearth to Kargath was the best part about playing a horde mage.
---
I’m mostly just gonna go work on professions and try and stock pile gold in the first few weeks
---
When I played as alliance, it was always Menethil and as horde it was OG.
---
That’s right... to combat the paladins 1 shooting stuff. Thanks. You guys have a way better memory than I. 
---
Even though I don't think retail is worth subbing for now in its current state, I was very happy to learn Classic and current WoW will be on the same subscription. I'll be more that happy to do current content such as mount farming, pet battles, and just visiting my favorite zones whenever I feel like it.
---
Awesome! Glad to hear! Bring them all in! We'll get discord perms added and start getting to know each other in prep for classic! 
---
Idk man, if retail had Artorias, I might just resubscribe after all of these years.
---
Yeah but they dont obsess over how good classic is, they just obsess over how bad retail is.
---
But 40 man raids &gt; flex raiding, even if the 40 mans half a small fraction of the mechanics to learn.
---
This is what I do. I only go back to cities for quests located in the cities and training.
---
Bind shadowbolt to mouse wheel and be one of the top warlocks on my server.
---
#shamelessplug? Lol. Same boat, can't wait to play an undead rogue or a paladin!
---
That warrior was doing god's work
---
When Activision took over is when we saw the need to appeal to people who didn't like the game, over time its just been a snowball effect. I think by going back and creating a game for the sake of a 'cash grab' might work in our favor as its not something we're expecting them to build on or profit too much off of. It's separate from their 'we need to try to appeal to everyone'. It might be over for Blizzard at this point by looking at what's going on at other IPs and the company itself, but bringing pieces of the past can at least preserve times in their past when they were the 'it' company in gaming. 
---
At least Ashkandi has stats
---
Get Perdition's Blade
---
I was this wife in Vanilla. My ex-husband had me start as a mage. I found it pretty easy to learn the general game play, without a lot of the extra things and responsibilities of other classes ( I didn't need to heal anyone, didn't need to learn about pets, the specs were easy to choose from, and there was no confusion as to what my purpose was, just DPS and food). 
---
The mage was always my main, but I did make alts in other classes as they interested me. But I did find the mage the easiest to learn on. She can try anything really and then depending on what she enjoys about the game, after playing a while, she can always adjust to something else if whatever you chose doesn't work out for her. 
---
OP, your post is a great read, but more importantly it spawned so many informative comments. Great post, man. I've only been subbed here for like a week but this is exactly the kind of content I was hoping to see. 
---
Same, very much looking forward to reliving those glory days.  I played hunter from vanilla through BFA before coming to my senses realizing the dumpster fire WoW has become.  Play on private servers now just waiting for release.  
---
Side note, I’m a consultant and trainer for small/medium sized businesses specifically for prospecting and cold calling strategies.  15+ years in direct sales / business development.  Would love to connect and discuss if there are ways we could help drive stronger conversations and ultimately more business your way.  Feel free to PM me if you would interested in talking further. 
---
I have never complained anywhere about being ganked. I just put forth some rules that I hold myself to.
---
If the choice is between snowflake and asshole then I'm gladly on team snowflake.
---
eh idk about that  
---
in vanilla's case yea 40 is superior to flex but for newer expansions 40 would be impossible to do (massive fps drop, very easy to screw up mechanics with that many people) but flex is very convenient  
---
The dmg-buff from wolfs is actually very mediocre. So i doubts you would notice any difference at all. It adds about 50 dmg on the next attack and only group wide.
---
Not sure but I think it has a 10 sec cooldown. Thats about 25 dps more per Hunter per group, when there are all physical dps in the group.
---
Am I missing something? 
---
I want to enjoy parts of the game I didn't realize were important, or I skipped because I was only an early teenager. Honestly I am just excited to get that feeling again. Even the music in the starting zones doesn't feel the same on retail WoW. Feeling attached to your character because it took so much work to get to 60 is a wonderful thing. I miss it.
---
I'm amazed by not only your willingness to help others, but your real desire to do so. Props to you my friend
---
Then that wasn't actual loot council.
---
Loot councils I've been a part of (voting member or not) were about logic and facts. Each item objectively had a highest priority person it would go to based on how it would affect their performance in raid and the group talked until we agreed on where that went for each piece. 
---
Never had issues
---
This one resonates with me. Being an undead in vanilla and wanting a raptor so badly was a real struggle. SO. MUCH. RUNECLOTH.
---
Thank you! That was mostly my intention. I just wanted to bring a good discussion to the table, and hopefully provide encouragement to some people. 
---
You really can't compare what you did in classic to now. People know all the prebis gear and even casual players are going to be working to get it. Even a brain dead warrior in prebis is going to vastly outdps a ret.  
---
Yes, there will be casual guilds. My guild is actually on the casual side of things on the private server. But surely there will be even more casual guilds. But the thing with vanilla is, if you want to progress, you can't be THAT casual.  You need to be doing Ony, ZG, BWL, and AQ every week. Its a lot of raiding and progression.   
---
There will definitely be guilds that open their arms to meme specs. They can even progress through the content. I am not saying that won't be the case.  If we had a player who was good socially for the guild and maybe brought some good raid leading or something else to the table, we would let him ret dps probably. All I am saying is I think people have unreasonable expectations for the performance of their meme specs. As I said above, everyone knows what gear is good now, what consumables to bring,and  how to play their class. Even in a casual guild, I doubt you will be topping the meters as ret unless you are putting way more time in than your peers, and even then it won't last.
---
You could find some retired military/disabled vets in this group. Disability payments *can* be fairly substantial. 
---
This is the meta.
---
So many posts here are like this too.  I see so many incorrect comparisons that are just emotionally charged to the point of irrationality.  I'm not into BFA and I'm anxiously awaiting classic but give me a break.
---
It makes the game feel completely different on private servers.
---
I remember people used to run Scholomance and Stratholme all the time trying to get T.0 blue set pieces. Now on private servers people only run DM, UBRS, and BRD to get some BIS items and move straight into MC.
---
Except when you realize there is NO criteria to join... 100 people? What promised commitment can they give 100 people?
---
The way it was "Back in vanilla" just isn't that relevant sadly. You can't make people unlearn their knowledge. All I was trying to do was emphasize just how bad a ret pally is. There will still be guilds to play with, but you may find that you are unsatisfied with your chosen spec's performance, or all the work you have to put in to barely keep up in dps. 
---
No queues are that long, complaining about collectables being in the game is silly no ones making you get them and there's nothing wrong with a race being added later in the expansion when we got a new one on release. Its a different game, if it isn't for you I get it but don't bash it for those stupid reasons lmao. 
---
Bottom line is your hardcore players are the people that showup and preform every week. No you dont want your casuals to fall behind, but you dont want your raid falling behind because you're equipping casuals that show up once every 4 weeks or something. 
---
Big problem I see with this system. Week 1 of raids, Warrior A and Warrior B attend, but do not get anything. Warrior A is in spot 1, and warrior B is in slot 4. Two weeks go by, progression is complete and we're now clearing all of MC (Examples) and Warrior A went on vacation for those two weeks. Warrior B is still in spot say 2 with Warrior A in spot 1. Week 4 happens and pauldrons of might drop. Warrior A who skipped out on all the progression (yes good excuse for vacation with family or w/e) but he still hasn't put the time and effort into the guild as Warrior B who has been there every week.  
---
Don't get me wrong I completely agree finding a system that rewards casual players too. Without them you probably wouldn't fill raids. These convoluted systems are just hard to get behind. Awarding people points for showing up to raids and allowing them to spend their points on items they want is really the only "fair" loot system. Hardcores will want to save for bigger items so they wont spend as much on smaller items, and casuals will take whatever they can at whatever price point they can. ez pz
---
I'll try and tighten your sleep by telling you my opinion. I'd roll Dwarf, get a whole new experience while still achieving nostalgia by reliving classic.
---
Care to share the auditable source for those numbers? Or is this just that non verifyable api leak that was posted months ago? Not saying you can't be right, but calling numbers without a verifyable source doesn't really have a lot of weight in my opinion. 
---
It could be worthwhile to set your hearth to Booty Bay. You have a bank, a boat to travel between continents, and you have the potential to get the ZG buff while you’re in town which will give you +15% stats and a run speed increase. Both of these are pretty valuable for leveling and you don’t lose the ZG buff when you die. 
---
Let me guess, your uncle works at Blizzard.
---
&gt; This thread is a good example of it.
---
This thread is a good example of how people in vanilla played. It's not a good example of how people on private servers or retail play. And that is far more relevant to WoW classic than vanilla is. 
---
I can see how it comes across as contradictory but you have to see that we’re talking about an extreme case regarding SotSF. That is a monster item for every caster, and should definitely be dealt somewhere where it is deserved, not to who has the largest bank account.
---
I understand your arguments, I really do. I think gold systems have a place, and maybe they even have a place within some raiding guilds. I wouldn’t want to raid in a guild with that system. I’m sorry if I came across as if I was talking for the masses.
---
I’m lucky enough to already be part of a guild that was successful on multiple vanilla projects with an established loot system that works for us. Maybe I was speaking from a biased place, as a gold system is not something we would even consider. Sure there are flaws with every system, but a gold system feels way too impersonal as well as the flaws I pointed out. We run loot council, and as the core of the guild has remained intact across multiple projects over multiple years, it is something everyone is very comfortable running with.
---
I do, however, stand by my point that if the only reason you’re raiding is for loot and not getting loot one week while having spent the time raiding and farming consumables is “awful”, then you need to adjust your outlook on vanilla raiding. Maybe I’m too old school, who knows.
---
Dwarves and gnomes suck bro. They look and walk like shit. 
---
I like BFA. 
---
I wonder if female taurens will have their eyes shut in the portrait
---
I mean if they don't, it's not really vanilla, is it?
---
Don't think thats said in stone, the Demo was 1.13 iirc, a lot can change between the 1.13 Demo and launch in terms of version numbers. It could also be 1.13 though. 
---
RIP your karma :/
---
Ironically, my friend is going Mage and has his hearth in Org (because he's too cheap to pay for the reagents unless people pay him for a port).
---
I'm a hunter and my hearth is usually where I'm questing.
---
Lots of good points!
---
Remake me awesome troll hunter i had in vanilla 
---
Maybe a different spot for Alliance than Horde, but for Horde, Orgrimmar is a good travel hub.  Maybe Wetlands for Alliance like someone else said.
---
There are reasons to go back to the city or travel hub - quests that take you around the world, dungeons, moving to a new zone, or simply to go back and get your skills.  Can't do that on your bank.
---
Based on the way Classic is releasing, yes.
---
&gt; I bleed Horde red
---
You know what you must do, friend. Lok'tar ogar!
---
I can't wait either. In the meantime I'm playing guild wars 2
---
Pet will get to the mob and generate FAR more threat than the warrior on two mobs. The pet will have similar survivability BUT can be healed by the healer as well as the hunter. If the pet dies, the hunter can VERY quickly rez it. I know its counter intuitive, but the pet is a better tank... Goes against the holy trinity of healer/tank/dps but its the way it goes.
---
I once read a Forum post of someone complaining that retail has too much group content and that they were afraid of interacting with other people because they scare them. 
---
Think the mileage varied on classic for split runs. As a guild that camped world dragons and was trying to catch the top guilds on the server that already had MC/BWL on farm, we only did our first several kills with a full raid. After that we split into 2-3 runs a week to get as much as possible. This was roughly a year after release just before AQ40 came out.
---
Some of my (and from what I've seen here, quite a few other's) best memories of Vanilla were of high level players taking time to help lowbies or show them the ropes. Classic will never quite have the same feeling with how much information is out there &amp; accessible these days, but there will be plenty of players who weren't around for Vanilla and may still get that magical "OH SHIT" moment when they realize the Warlock in their Cathedral group is 60 &amp; wearing Felheart.   
---
That and I still have a debt to pay forward for all the people who trudged through getting the UBRS key/Mara Scepter/ZF mallet back in the day.
---
People use the word 'circlejerk' far too often for my taste, but if the OP is serious then I'd say this post definitely falls under that category. I suspect there's some tongue-in-cheek hyperbole going on, but maybe that's wishful thinking.     
---
        
---
In any case, Blizzard has been actively publishing guides for new patches ever since vanilla. For example, when Silithus got a revamp and the Cenarion Circle got some new reputation rewards and whatnot to go with it, they released a whole webpage with the vendor lists and whatnot for people to look up and plan around.
---
Unless you are playing a tank. Other then Naxx which is just plain hard core no matter how you cut it. I found classic to be the most open for casual raiders. When you need 45 people it becomes unrealistic to expect uniformity. Most guilds just wanted 45 people to be there with their boots on. So you could raid 1 time a week or 1 time a month. You'll get DKP and, obviously gear at a much slower rate if you show up less. That being said. You also have the privilege to show up way less without being hounded.
---
If you also watch Joana's stream of the run, he, as a hunter. Melee's mobs to death when t hey get close to him
---
So inefficient. Just kiting mobs instead of melee ing as a hunter will improve your kill times. His record will be destroyed. It doesn't matter about anything else that p servers have gotten wrong. The amount of people who can level to 60 without a single quest help indicator, just know literally all the routes and which quests to do, which to skip etc will make the new record a LOT faster. 
---
Neat. Don't worry about whether other people think it's worth the analysis or not as long as you enjoy doing it, and you may as well post the results when you're done for any who do care. I also do a lot of math and theorycraft over things that don't really matter because I enjoy the process so I can relate.
---
So, you're telling me it's not Lupus?
---
I think there are a couple things you can say about retail. Dailies/WQ are not fun. It’s literally seen as a chore by 99% of the community. In classic you still need/needed gold to raid but you could choose how you wanted to do it. 
---
Also, crafting was a lot different in classic. There was less competition and a feeling of accomplishment (albeit small feeling) when you got that rare recipe. Alts being more prevalent and professions being easier to level made every market saturated. Garrisons was the final knife in the back. 
---
When I first started playing WoW (during retail Lich King) I played on the Alliance side. Recently I started playing on a vanilla private server just to get used to things before Classic comes out. I leveled an Alliance character to about level 20 and got bored, because it felt like it was the same thing that I had done a thousand times in the past. So, I switched to Horde and it felt like an entirely new experience. New capital cities, new dungeons (ex: RFC vs Stockades), new lower level zones, new quests, etc.
---
My point is, if you feel like you have played one faction a lot, then it can be very refreshing to try to the other side.
---
i guess the math hinges on one thing here though, that you always exactly /camp where you need to be for the next session. Which in my experience hardly ever happens. Most players i know like "to finish up" before logging out so generally they either log out at the latest quest they delivered, in a inn close to the quest giver where they finished up or hearth after delivering the last quest. 
---
Also during travel to where you need to be from the inn after logging out you can also pull mobs and get xp. Which a lot of ppl actually do, motto "always be pulling while leveling". 
---
Yeah I would be interested if you started a guild at launch for this. I feel like a lot of Vanilla/Private server players would be willing to help people who never played. It would be fun to be "that guild," that has a reputation being helpful to newbies.
---
Getting an Ivory Raptor is my main goal. Raids and other shit will only be my main goal after getting that awesome mount.
---
See all raid content. Probably going Warlock but we'll see...
---
&gt;The problem is once you commit to it, you'd get 10x better performance from any other "real" spec.
---
I dont dispute that, but those other specs you can get decent performance out of even when half assing it. There's no such thing with feral. You either go all the way or you should not bother in the first place.
---
Same. Although I've tried many times to switch it up a bit and play Alliance, I just couldn't get into it. Guess I felt disloyal :p
---
If you want to raid tho, dwarf priest is the go-to race/class combination.
---
&gt; i guess the math hinges on one thing here though, that you always exactly /camp where you need to be for the next session.
---
True. But the math here gives a good idea of what one should do at any given point. I also like to wrap things up, and I'll stay up an extra few minutes, an hour, etc to finish and head back to turn in quests. If I'm there, might as well run into the inn.
---
But there are times where you don't have the luxury of "just a bit longer" - if I've got to go pick up my daughter from school, take her to ballet, and get some groceries, etc... I can play up to the minute I have to leave the house and know which scenario is better, camp or hearth to accommodate the 3 hour absence I'm about to face.
---
Fool, everyone knows the true strat is to just play for 6 days straight while mainlining coke and caffeine; rested XP is for the casuals.
---
The same as the slot machine crowd
---
I love reddit when things like this happen. Get those connections, make the world spin!
---
Also, very excited for classic. I played in Vanilla and quit just before Cataclysm, played on many private servers, dabbled in Pandaria and WoD, hated the direction it was going so much. Just waiting for the sweet nostalgia around the community and classic fun times!
---
I'll be pretty much no-lifing it, but like to cover all my bases to get the most out of it.
---
Lol yeah definitely didn't try to collect gear or mounts in classic... Oh wait.
---
The worst part about your post is now I can't stop thinking about how fucking excited I am. 
---
It really depends how far away your nearest capital city or inn is to your current questing area. If you're logging out for 4 hours, and you're in tanaris near the pirates, factor in the time it takes to walk there and back, and in that amount of time you probably could have grinded more experience than rested would have given you. It all depends on the location though.
---
To be fair, there are lots of things that are time-gated in retail.
---
I used to sneak into Hyjal and do this at the bottom of the well of eternity so they'd have to take rez sickness.
---
I'm not sure how I wasn't banned tbh.
---
"classic is objectively better"
---
Right there is when you became part of the circlejerk.
---
&gt; If you're logging out for 4 hours, and you're in tanaris near the pirates, factor in the time it takes to walk there and back, and in that amount of time you probably could have grinded more experience than rested would have given you.
---
At level 45 doing the pirates, hearthing to Gadgetzan and running back next time you log would require 7 hours of rested to beat out just sitting there. If you have to run back cause hearth isn't up, or not set to Gadget, 14 hours.
---
Math!
---
&gt;It really depends how far away your nearest capital city or inn is to your current questing area.
---
And with the spreadsheet, it's nice because I can plug in the time I expect it'd take to "get back to where I left off" at any given point, and it'll adjust the time estimate for how long rested breaks even.
---
It doesn't mean one has to suck, but one sadly does (for the past 9 years)
---
I started playing when I was super young, late wrath. I want to experience vanilla on blizz servers and make it to 60
---
Explore the world before Cata (when I started playing) and have fun.
---
I played a Tauren Shaman back in vanilla and wish I went Orc. 
---
Items that were changed to help gear you for Naxx quicker.
---
Absolutely agree. Once I'm 60 I don't think I'll be guilded or raiding so there's no reason not to help out the new people. I often forget there's tons of people who never experienced this so even though they know how to play, it'll still be a learning experience for them and I hope I can be part of it too
---
All my mains have been Alliance, so I'll be rolling a Horde char in classic.
---
Ok, so that would mean /sit macros are a bug and won't be in 1.12
---
the fact that lupos consumes improved shadow bolt procs in-lieu of harder hitting shadow spells is probably what you're missing
---
Too much cringy us vs. them mentality  for how little comedy is in this post. I give this submission 2 thumbs down. 
---
That's just your opinion, there's nothing objective about it. There are millions of people who say otherwise.
---
Carve out a little gold empire that doesn't require joining a "mafia".B
---
Because everyone just keeps on  jabbering allt he bs. people desperately want to be super duper vanilla wow players. Seen to many mistakes already, they didnt really play in 05.
---
I ended up farming AV but I don't remember if that worked in Classic
---
- Give wife unplugged controller.
---
- Pick Hunter or Warlock.
---
- Tell her she is controlling the pet.
---
Mages have so many perks its ridiculous tbh.
---
the nice thing about doing it this way is your mana stays high, so if you do get the occasional multi pull or bad pull or get ganked you have some mana to deal with it.
---
I'm not sure if pets like Brokentooth and The Rake will be nerfed though. If not then they are both fantastic pets though Brokentooth is slightly better. Both are known for their fast attack speeds, 1.0 for The Rake as an example!
---
If those are both nerfed then I know for a fact that the red Cloud Serpents from ZG are excellent pets since they have a special attack called Lightning Breath which is a ranged nuke that does 100-150 nature damage and as long as the pet has focus it can keep spamming it non-stop. So Hunters positioned the pet far enough from the boss to be in range of it's lightning breath but too far to be hit in melee and forced it to stay there, spamming it's ranged attack.
---
Its a bad simile lol, saruman is all about jealousy of power and if you cant beat them, join them.
---
Because it's fun and easy.
---
Definitely has been one of my thoughts for what to roll.  I’m still thinking Gnome warrior which I would think isn’t too high in population.
---
I’ll be eager to see server populations across the different realms.
---
Thematically, I think undercity is amazing.
---
Again, whatever floats your boat. It can just suck when a ranged class gets a (more or less) strictly melee weapon when a melee class rolls on it too.
---
I think the subscription drop in the recent 9 years is also subjective ? I guess the whole reason wow vanilla came back is also subjective? I guess all the videos on YouTube and forum post about " why I quite BFA  " is also subjective. Face it. It's a shadow of what it used to be.
---
"Milord who shall you choose to be your next advisor? The venerable Ceredras the Sage, long known to this lands, or this dour faced wanderer we discovered at the gates named GRIMA WORMTONGUE?"
---
"Hm. Yes indeed Ceredras was present at all the royals births. But I must say this GRIMA WORMTONGUE intrigues me greatly."
---
I leveled on pserver without utilizing any of those things and it was pretty painless
---
Join the Alliance. Our women actually look like something you'd want to fuck unlike the *creatures* Horde has.
---
Or maybe you... Tell me how is current retail better? Hate everything about it... RNG, no raid tier sets, timegating, stupid azerite grind, doing one stupid raid for 5 months on 3 different difficulties, sharding, no social between ppl, LFR/LFD etc etc...
---
Ive been a gm and yes it does lol, its human nature to reward yourself first.
---
I don't think that retail is better.
---
I just think it's stupid to say an opinion is objective.
---
But you read from left to right, doesn't it make sense to have a date as mm/dd/yyyy (left to right)? So when you read a date you read January 18th 2019. Not 18th January 2019.
---
It's funny' cause it's true
---
Flag running.  Druids were so good in wsg it's not even funny.  I remember running our premade and our druid could get in and out with the flag 1v10 most of the time.  He was fairly well geared but no other class could do that..
---
The grandma face is rare to see on a female human, too. Doesn't mean you should pick it. 
---
https://youtu.be/8DYje57V_BY
---
I don’t think the raiding scene is better in Vanilla at all. Was completely joking.
---
BT has 1.0 attack speed, the Rake is only 1.2 which is on-par with several other big cats (hillsbrad, 1k needles, SoS, wolves in SFK).

ZG bat is 1.0 attack speed as well, making it another very good PvP pet. However, these are only *really* good in pvp for pushback and high damage percentage (which is pretty minor). For raiding, yes the serpents are pretty good because of the ranged positioning and decent damage, however I think the positioning part comes down to some macros that may or may not work with the macro change? I've never used them so I'm not sure. At the same time, wolves are arguably better for raids because of furious howl.

I can’t speak for everyone, but I’ve been playing WoW since Vanilla. I grew up playing this game. I love it, and I want it to succeed. I criticise BfA because there’s some naive hope in the back of my mind that Blizzard will listen. It’s easier to make memes and laugh and hope for change than it is to accept that WoW is unsalvageable and move on.
---
The first two wands you get from Enchanting are very overpowered for their level (5 and 13) and the best thing you can spend your gold on at low level, even moreso than bags imo. After that, there's good wands at every point of leveling. What else would you spend your silvers on that's better than something that's doing half your damage?
---
Sometimes the posts on here devolve into an anti-retail circlejerk instead of being actual useful discussion about classic... It's kind of annoying to be honest and I kind of wish there was a rule against it.
---
Criticism is fine, but when it's the only thing people do it becomes an issue. Retail isn't at its best right now, nobody can deny that, but I still play actively and enjoy it.
---
I stopped playing regularly after Wrath and I still have a hard time wrapping my head around the fact that people play on Tuesdays now. It was a good time to get back to whatever rl stuff you'd been neglecting the rest of the week, and it built up more anticipation for when you'd get to play again.
---
I haven't seen this video, nor have I ever done Naxx, but word got around my server about how much the top guilds were struggling. Random story: I remember a former guild member (priest) got into one of the top guilds and they were having trouble with Patchwerk because he hit the off-tank so hard.  He was testing a strategy where he specced into Improved Prayer of Healing, which I think gave an armor buff if it crit. Then he equipped 8/8 Prophecy, which gave his PoH an extra 50% chance to crit. He used myself and another friend to see how long he could keep the armor buff on us while he used all of his consumables. It was fun to be a part of that. Not sure if they used the strategy or not. 
---
Millions of ppl? How many , maybe max 4mil. But there are/were 10 millions of ppl that could tell you how great vannila/tbc/wotlk was. And you can count on that. A lot of those ppl returned for WoD bcs Blizz was promising that WoD will be like TBC, which ended as fail and they lost half ppl after 1-2months in WoD. 
---
Play both?... Why is this a thing? I have NEVER played one faction or the other... Always juggled back and forth and had a great time on both. Unless youre some greasy sicko that "bleeds horde red" and indulges in the lore, just play both; its a video game after all. 
---
It wasn't a whole different game with pet battles and transmorg...
---
First 10 points into Spirit Tap and Wand spec. The rest goes wherever, but I would recommend Imp SW:P for 2 points. You have a lot of choice in specializing your priest while leveling because almost all of your damage is done by wand and SW:P, and your healing kit is good enough without talents
---
It's the same shit with Old School Runescape. More people poop all over Runescape 3 (the more modern version) as opposed to celebrating Old School Runescape. 
---
The only issue I have with this is that you lose a fulfilling sense of character progression past 60 (leveling up) and gain a slightly less fulfilling one (gearing up forever). 
---
It’s essentially stretching endgame progression into another expansion instead of adding a sense of character progression with new talents abilities etc.
---
On top of that, how will I know when I’m ready to quest in netherstorm? I sure as hell don’t want to see the words “you need a higher item level to do this” in classic. Just trial and error of getting one shot? It’s much more intuitive if you can see a level difference between you and what you’re trying to kill. 
---
The difference is RS3 is shit and OSRS is the only good version
---
Jokes aside, I totally agree, even though I prefer OSRS.
---
Yeah good luck with that...
---
Why does everyone on the internet live an hour away from me?
---
Lockdown someones character for more than 48 hours straight with friends. Corpsecamp them sooooo bad.
---
I don’t think it has quests that are race locked but rewards that are.
---
&gt; I think the subscription drop in the recent 9 years is also subjective
---
Yes. People who didn't like the game stopped playing.
---
&gt; I guess the whole reason wow vanilla came back is also subjective?
---
Yeah. There are people who prefer vanilla, so they're making vanilla servers. What you don't understand that there are people who prefer retail.
---
&gt; I guess all the videos on YouTube and forum post about " why I quite BFA " is also subjective
---
Those are literally just the opinions of those youtubers lol.
---
I don't have time so it'll be one main and that's it.
---
Being the only player on my server to have the UBRS key for the first few months (just like retail vanilla - ahhhh the goodness)
---
&gt;dont think raiding scene is better    
---
thought we just talked about preferred raid size in an mmo  
---
I think people should be allowed to do criticism, ridicule and satire to whatever subject or item. If you aren't able to do it or aren't allowed to do it you end up in a wierd place, some sort of 1984
---
A lot of the community found grinding mats/gold for raiding as a chore, too. Dailies/WQ can potentially be ignored if a player wishes to, and grind for money. 
---
Crafting WAS different, but there was less/slower end game content so dropped recipes helped fill the void. This falls into the "they're two different games" category, and why a lot of people who play retail will have no problem also playing classic. I'll admit that crafting had been shoved into the background, other than maybe enchanting and alchemy, but I see it as allowing a player to choose to heavily work a profession or ignore it without majorly hurting their income. If you want to make and sell stuff as a blacksmith, you can. If you want to grind dailies and wq, you can. You can strip-skin an entire zone for cash if that's your prerogative. Is it the most efficient? Probably not, but you can choose whichever you like the most. 
---
Yeah that iis true. There are ppl who like current state of retail and ppl that hate it. 
---
I never said you couldn't criticise? I just think it's dumb to do *nothing but* criticise.
---
&gt;I'm a tank and more often than not I'd pick a Warlock over a Mage for the last dps spot in 5mans.
---
Sorry but that's just idiotic.
---
Warlocks do stupid amounts of threat and have no threat drop like iceblock on top of it. Fear and seduce are both inferior to sheeping. And they can't aoe or kite like mages do. 
---
I'll take a warlock if they whisper me first but to say you would rather have one over a mage all else equal just means your bad.
---
once you get  toep or zhc  you can just use a succubus.  Especially if you find yourself in situations where you'll be fighting 1v1 or 1v2.. like going to stealth cap a node in ab or defending solo in wsg.  If a rogue stuns you, you just seduce them trinket shadowbolt, seduce while sb is in the air so it goes off right after sb hits, then repeat for all 3 seductions.  with  toep or zhc they will die in 3 shadowbolts.  Do not apply corruption or coa as it will break seduce.
---
Awww someone got hurt in his deepest feelings. If you cannot take ridicule or criticism or satire in a platform where freedom of speech should be too priority... Well then i'd say: "unsub from this, Reddit and the whole internet basically"
---
always hearth
---
the flightpaths and travelling gives you time to smoke a bowl before you start grinding yo
---
Same.

https://classicdb.ch/?quest=754
---
the item to cleanse is tauren only
---
Nah man I just want to talk about classic on here. If I wanted to talk about retail I'd be on r/wow. This post is just a low effort meme. No offense to OP though.
---
Rest xp. You will level 2 characters just as fast as 1. Works especially well if you dont have time.
---
How stupid are you that you can say those figures are subjective? More then 2/3 of the playersbase has gone ? XD
---
&gt; running back
---
*\*laughs in Warlock\**
---
Preferred size is all personal preference really.
---
For me I prefer and like open world non instanced dungeons and raids. Like UO has/had or ESO kinda has, even EQ/2 has some. In WoW it’s kinda like you said. Current raid mechanics fit better for flex would be insane having 40 people with the new mechanics. I imagine shit would go sideways far more often.
---
My original comment was a joke cause saying classic is objectively better is imo wrong and a lie. Some aspects are objectively better but not all (raiding being a big one).
---
Getting my Rogue to 60. Ganking the shit everyone in IF and SW.
---
Your secondary guild experience is most similar to mine. To your point regarding not bringing 3 ret pallies, etc. This was usually self-moderating in our guild. Most of the raiders were specced "properly", because a large part of the enjoyment was in making a positive contribution towards whatever we were doing. Maybe if we had too many people showing up in "meme specs" we would have encouraged more people to change. 
---
Sorry, but Blizzard started leaking its creativity and selling out and being wannabe Hollywood before Activision bought it (probably after WCIII and right before WOW).
---
It's a comparison between WoW vanilla and WoW retail. Aren't we in subreddit for WoW vanilla ?
---
I find it a good meme, it got a giggle out of me.
---
That doesn't answer the question at all.
---
Huh, I remember on a private server pretty much every single Hunter had a red serpent. Must mean the macro worked, this was last year too.
---
Private server and retail vanilla are wildly different from one another. The retail experience will not be replicated. Alot of obnoxious private server mannerisms will carry onto retail. Even though the raids are easy af, almost every babby guild will be on some prebis, minmax, full consume high horse. Funnily enough I expect the better guilds (though not full on speedrunners) will be more lax where consumables and gear are concerned than your average casual guild (because they are aware of the fact that these things aren’t necessary). Its really mindblowing how hard people expect you to minmax for such easy content, and I would count yourself lucky if you manage to get into a guild that doesnt expect you to be super tryhard.
---
Huh, I remember on private server pretty much every single Hunter had a red serpent. Must mean the macro worked, this was last year too.
---
I agree with your first point to some extent except for the rep grind for dailies. Not a huge point but if you want/need certain gear or recipes, you have to do dailies. Also as you mentioned, dailies are often the more efficient way to make money. Blizz nerfs other ways to farm like 2x4 farming. This is just as mindless as killing mobs one by one or circling the map herbing/mining/skinning. So is there really much choice? Not really, it’s dailies or bust. 
---
Crafting was so much more in-depth. Some would argue you NEED engineering for high-end pvp. The items from professions added depth overall as well. Classes could gain small advantages by picking a certain profession and have a chance against a counter class in WPVP. LW and more so skinning allowed for battles to be fought over certain spawn points. It was a different game because it brought some form of depth and figuring things out, rather than cookie cutter builds and professions. 
---
ok always hearth to the main city yo clearly you knew what i was talking about
---
it's like 10s. He can easily make 5x that much with the time he saves.
---
It's the first one I've seen today. And I am very active on the subreddit. You're exaggerating. And to be fair, I don't think there is a limit to criticism, ridicule or satire
---
That is great for you. Humor always comes down to personal preference. I just feel like I have seen it all. The memes on here comparing retail and classic are just so lazy and old to me. Got that samey feel you know. You have seen one you have seen em all. I like the memes that stick to classic themes. Comparisons between retail and classic always bring out the worst in people.
---
No I did not, because "hearth" applies to both, and "time flying" also applies to both.
---
What is r13 and r14 and r10? 
---
dwarfs are cute af
---
To be fair, though, there is a much higher range of what you can be ranked due to the much higher population.
---
I was able to get rank 10 with the same or less active pvping than I did in retail. 
---
Back in Vanilla I played an UD Mage (and through to Cata).
---
Right now on a pserver I'm playing a dwarf priest.
---
Seeing the other side was nice, I guess.    
---
But it just doesn't feel right.    
---
I have no connection with my priest or the Alliance.
---
When I enter IF or SW I feel nothing.    
---
But if I enter Org on an alt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.    
---
My heartrate increases.    
---
I feel alive!
---
I'll be switching back to the Horde for Classic.    
---
I should have never tried the Alliance.
---
Weekly maintenance is definitely needed!
---
The circlejerk is real with this one
---
Joana set the World Record during real vanilla something like 4.5 days /played. Assuming new routes have been made/polished up, lets assume the 100% fastest is 4 days played. Most people aren't going to hit that, lets assume the "average" no lifer is doing 60 in 5.5 days played. That gets us 132 hours needed. play for 18 hours and sleep for 6 gets us 7.3 days IRL. Or if sleeping for 8 and playing 16 gets us 8.25 days.
---
I guess if somebody takes a weekoff it's just about possible to lvl to 60 in a week
---
Though I cannot stress enough most people are not going to be hitting these kinds of numbers at all.
---
&gt;Preferred size is all personal preference really   
---
its not just down to preference. Newer expansions would lag too much for most people if it were 40man and would impact gameplay whereas for vanilla having 20 fps didn't impact that much because game is more about planning and preparing than reacting to things.  
---
I thought about alliance but then eating corpses after I kill them is too good to miss!
---
I really don't get the bottom left image in the Tides of Vengeance guide. Could anyone explain?
---
I just wanted to point out that not a lot of players saw Naxx content because of the release of TBC.  Had there been an infinite amount of time, which essentially is potentially what Classic provides, then someone who is interested in seeing all of the raiding content will likely be able to do so since they will eventually be able to gear up into those encounters.
---
Also, as per your "a boomkin was better in Ony than nothing" statement.  I would simply refute that.  My guild in Vanilla took partial raids in to clear content to ensure loot drops were given to guild members (at that point it was for off spec loot) but there was no way the guild was going to be giving loot out to randoms.
---
As the MT for my raiding guild, I did do a lot of Raid pickups on our "retired" content to help some "casual" guilds progress.
---
Every server is different.
---
Jesus dude, it's 2019.  Get a second monitor if you are going to play the game one handed.
---
The macro change will be when official servers come out, they are getting rid of the old style macros and implementing the same system retail uses. 
---
The macro (from my understanding) lets your pet cast lightning breath on auto, but not switch to AA when it runs out of focus. Again I'd need to do more research, it's just something I've heard off hand, really haven't looked into it.
---
I forget what I did while leveling.....
---
Top comment said it depends on your speed which IMO makes the most sense. If you're able to power level then it'll probably be wise to set it to the capital so you can go get new skills easier, class quests, things of that nature whereas if you're a slower leveler then it'd make sense to set it to the zone you're leveling in because you'll be there a while. 
---
For Horde, makes most sense to me to set it to grom'gol as you're on the eastern kingdoms continent and can easily access BWL/MC....but you also have immediate access to zeppelins to either UC or Org and the icing on the cake is being in STVietnam. 
---
Finally get those stupid drake talon pauldrons that never dropped for my orc warrior!! 
---
classic literally cannot launch soon enough
---
And Deep Wounds.
---
+1 for Artorias
---
**\[T]///**
---
So what are you saying? Because there are more people who liked the older versions of the game, that makes it *objectively* superior? Lol.
---
It's a picture from Dark Souls.  "Discover New Experience" is tongue-in-cheek saying "go play other games."
---
EU welfare queens
---
Why would I need a second monitor?
---
Agree, math is fun, also spreadsheets are fun (I have so many sheets for so many different things, my wife calls me a geek everytime I pull one out) (even tho she gets good info from them!)
---
I don't remember. I just know turning in runecloth in Org constantly turned my brain to mush lol
---
Hi, /u/Fattens
---
Kevin Bacon.
---
1. Actually have fun
---
2. Anathema
---
3. if possible full tier 1 or at least the pieces that you can see (chest, shoulders, head, belt, boots)
---
Because your opinion is this doesn't mean the whole subreddit should be shaped to your preference. 
---
I don't see what is not classic about comparing the old to the new.
---
When we compare between 100 years ago household and now we also do it. We don't stick with the old household and don't make any comparison.
---
And maybe you think it brings the worst out in people because you're offended ?
---
You are the one making a big deal out of it. I don't like this post all that much and thats my opinion. Thats about it. Didn't say more than that. You seem to be offended by my opinion though.
---
Why would we post those and increase the number of people trying to take them?
---
Subjective is an opinion without any data to support on. Here we have data to support us.
---
An opinion is, by definition, subjective. Regardless of how many people share that opinion.
---
It does when there is enough evidence. There are a ton of video and forum post about how bad BFA is and the numbers are what 3 million ? 4 million being generous ? That is more then 2/3 of people you use to have and it keeps declining.
---
All right. Look at it this way: one party wins in an election, does that mean that party is objectively better than the other one?
---
Zappyboi for my human female paladin. Or Bandage if that's taken.
---
Either works in spoken conversation.
---
I guess I'm just being picky as I spent 3 decades using dd/mm/yyyy so the last few years seeing mm/dd/yyyy is hella confusing to me still :p
---
If you are waiting for Classic WoW like I am, you should check out Phoenix Dark Age of Camelot. Its similar to Classic WoW. It is more heavily World PvP focused though  It just launched so there are tons of leveling groups and the server peaks at close to 4k population.
---
If you enjoyed the world pvp and socializing in classic wow, then Phoenix DAOC might interest you. WoW classic was heavily influenced by this game.
---
Probably Leroy, or anything with Jenkins in....
---
Glad I wasn’t the only one who felt this way. Tried alliance a couple of times in retail and I never experienced the ‘high’ that people always talk about when entering SW/IF. 
---
When I walk into org and I hear that background music, instant nut
---
No amount of subjective opinions is going to make something objective.
---
&gt; Seeing as the company that made it is still carrying out QA on the 7.2 engine which should have a fairly good test coverage already, yes.
---
Are you talking about them doing QA on Classic? It only stands to reason they would need to test a lot of things, as Classic has a lot of "new" feature development in it. They need to reimplement tons of mechanics that have been removed or changed over the years. Their existing tests won't cover any of that.
---
Why would anyone set their hearth to a capital city?
---
*Makes portal to Org*
---
The formula you’re using for xp/hour is definitely off and will fluctuate depending on efficiency. Basically every person would have to calculate their own, using their own formula, for every level for it to be accurate.
---
Make life long friends :D
---
I reserved "Fred" "Marvin" and "Brown" when a big private server launched in 2017.
---
Idk it seems pretty funny to be questing along then seeing some dude with a generic first name like "Bob" or "Herman" walk by.
---
During leveling and while low geared is great, but it gets the strongest point  as u reach lvl 60. 
---
After people start getting geared the pet's power starts dwindling , since aside some item bonuses (like the 4/5 piece bonuses from all tier sets, AQ20 set bonus, D2 pieces) or the BM talents there is no scaling with gear.
---
Monkeynews still did it in 5 days /played on fresh server on a warrior.....
---
nah for real RS3 is actual dogshit that got made to leech cash from the players and nothing more. it is dogshit.
---
And where is ZappyBoi?
---
Kill C'thun. Get full tier 2.5 on my shadow priest. Melt faces.
---
Warrior B would have gotten loot multiple times by the time Warrior A came back from vacation.
---
Keep in mind you don't have to be in spot #1 to get loot. You skip all the clothies, all the geared warriors, everyone who doesn't want the item, all the way to the bottom of the list if need be.
---
If there are no warriors above Warrior B that want an item, he will still get the next item. If there are 2 warriors above him, they'll get the next 2 items they want, then he'll get one.
---
You're underestimating how easy it is for everyone to get loot in SK. By the time Warrior A is back, yes he will have his old spot (assuming the guild doesn't use a decay system) 
---
but the hardcore warriors that raid a lot would have gotten items many times over by the time he comes back. And when he comes back and gets an item, he's at the bottom of the list.
---
SK absolutely rewards hardcore raiders.
---
He’s not exaggerating. If there’s no news the only time classic sub pops up is when people try to shot on retail without knowing what’s actually going on.
---
So here's my dilemma. Hotw + NS druid vs. 30/0/21 shaman.
---
Mained a deal druid through vanilla and TBC. Was the main off tank for my guild. Fun stuff. I've always wanted to play shaman though and never really played one seriously.
---
I however will not be able to devote the same amount of time I used to to raid. Rank 10 will be the absolute highest pvp rank I can reasonably expect to achieve. As far as raids, I might be able to eek out a single consistent night every week to raid casually. Simply to many other things that are important in my life at this point. Maintaining my home, my GF, my band, and the business I'm starting. 
---
Druid pros:
---
Easily obtainable pre-bis and even mostly BIS tanking gear pre aq.
---
Super survivable in pve and pvp
---
Flexible and versatile playstyle
---
Nearly unkillable 1v1
---
Fast leveling
---
Stealth runs
---
Combat ress
---
I feel a strong connection to the class fantasy
---
Druid cons:
---
Few real feral upgrades after assuming pre-bis, and most of those will be heavily contested by more conventional  characters
---
Get tired if looking at feral forms and not being able to see my gear
---
Combating incorrect presumptions about feral tank effectiveness
---
Low dps in pvp and pve
---
No out of combat ress
---
Probably the weakest of all healers
---
Shaman pros: 
---
30/0/21 is incredibly versatile in pve and pvp
---
LB + NS + CL is insane fun
---
Great 1v1 potential
---
Awesome armor sets
---
Everyone wants a shaman in their group
---
Ress not on 30 min CD
---
Shaman cons: 
---
Too many binds needed to play at a high level
---
Combating ineffectiveness as ele in pve
---
Not much experience with the class so I'm not sure if I'll enjoy it endgame
---
So there we have it, off the top of my head. Help me decide, PLEASE!
---
ISB makes the next 4 non-DoT shadow damage effects do 20% more damage. Each instance of non-DoT shadow damage consumes a stack.
---
If you have one or more Lupos in the raid, they're going to be consuming the stacks all the time getting 20% more attack damage for that attack, **instead of shadow bolts which would have gotten buffed by 20%.**
---
A shadow bolt does *significantly* more damage than a single Lupos attack.
---
Bringing Lupos to a raid will cripple your Warlock's damage, especially early on when they have low crit gear. If your Raid Leader is not a total noob, he will give you some constructive feedback about not bringing Lupos to the raid.
---
I find grinding for an excessive amount of consumables not to mention world buffs before raid in classic way more of a chore than world quests in retail that I largely ignore after I hit exalted anyway. Maybe I'll do a emissary if it's a good one, that's about it.
---
For me it's lvl 39 Encha Shaman with Pendulum of Doom
---
This post reaffirmed that Horde is the right choice, despite how much I love Ironforge. 
---
They do. They stopped letting players kite mobs across infinite distances after one-too-many demon invasions in Stormwind required the whole realm to be restarted. 
---
Legoas, nelf hunter xD
---
I'm defending the fact you didn't want it anymore on this subreddit and told you that criticism, ridicule and satire should be allowed and is a key to freedom of speech.
---
I 100% disagree that Vanilla is better than modern WoW. Ignoring QoL and graphics changes they are two completely different games with different play styles and goals in mind.
---
This isn't really even criticism, it's just shitting on retail for shitting's sake.
---
Does the leash apply to all enemies or case by case?
---
First time playing classic so the first goal is to get to lvl 60.
---
DAE HATE RETAIL??/
---
Level a class i never really played. Probably mage, priest or warrior 
---
Artorias would take months to clear. Only melee weapons are good against him and you have to deal enough damage to stagger him mind buff after he leaps away. I could see him flipping away after melees blow CDs and buffing himself then flipping around 1 snorting healers. 
---
Distances might vary but all enemies have a leash range.
---
I've got a fairly obscure real name and have never had trouble with it. I had it on Xbox Live, I had it on pretty much every server on retail WoW. Hope to have it again. 
---
And shower every day. It’s a required daily that gives +10 spirit 
---
A lot more, but player turnover is nothing new to WoW, it was already there in Vanilla and in TBC and in Wrath. However back then there was more influx of new players compared to ppl leaving, but Wrath already pretty much flatlined. In 2013 they had a infographic whowing that WoW had more than 120 million accounts created and at the time i think 7.5 million were playing or something halfway into MoP. So even back then the game had already churned trough +- 92.5% of its player base and only +-7.5% of the players that ever played WoW were still playing back in 2013. 
---
Soup
---
I won't be posting them here, but my priority for new server/mmo launches is always to get my three most important core names first.  Then I try to get my IRL name, then I fill out the rest of the roster with the rest of my preferred names depending on how many slots I have.  For games with first and last name, I also typically try to reserve a joke name like Award BIOS.
---
Lmao freedom of speech has absolutely nothing to do with that though.
---
I think this post does just that. Highlights the good, going and creating an adventure vs having everything handed to you and just sitting AFK in the city most days because you can que for everything.
---
The last meme about anything compared to old and new was the one of LoTR (between blizzard then and activision now), 22 hours ago. Between that time and now there have been 14 new post. The meme about LoTR has 1.2 k upvotes, maybe people like the humor, maybe because its kinda true ? Recent articles have shown that Activision is a corporate busniss with only money as end goal.
---
I get it that you want to defend the current game and the business supporting it, i get it. If classic is any good BFA will even have less subscribers, alot of focus will be shifted to classic and all what you done in past expansions will be nullified because nobody will be there to see it. Its only logical that people want to protect it
---
While I think this post is stupid and agree with a lot you said, about allied race, there is an issue with it currently. Zandalari were advertised as a playable race before BFA came out. We’ve been waiting forever for something on the box that was advertised and a selling point to come out. Zandalari and Kultirans long delay has killed so much hype that I’m pretty sure they are making those OP racials go to live to get mass KT race changes for PVP and Zandalari for everything else to artificial regenerate hype.
---
This is the problem. They cater too much to people that "have jobs and cant sit at a game all day". I work full time. I will still dive into classic hard when it comes out. I lost the fire for retail a long time ago because of what they did to it. 
---
He'll still suicide to the bottom of the list, and still have the negative. The negative has nothing to do with whether or not he gets loot. It just means you get bumped down one spot.
---
If you're at the absolute bottom of the list, and no one wants any items, and you can use it, you still get loot! That's the beauty. Only if absolutely no one can use an item does it ever get DEd.
---
That's the biggest strength of SK.
---
If you're the only person that bid, you still pay top bid.
---
How about you stop assuming.

I’m hyped for classic and asking my GM to make a classic branch of our Guild when it comes out. But literally EVERY TIME this sub hits my feed it’s someone shitting on live, comparing them or bitching about live.
---
If I wanted that I’d go to the Mother Sub where they bitch about BFA 24/7.
---
Lets see, if you have 75 people out of 100 saying they stopped playing BFA because its shit and don't like it anymore and prefer the old game to the new then you still gonna say that the old is better then the new if you look at the 100 people ?
---
Yup I’ve decided to do the same thing. Played horde exclusively since vanilla and have decided to go ally in classic after playing horde again on a p server. Looking forward to some new experiences!
---
The Zandalari regenration racial and the bleed from Kimbul's have already been nerfed at least that's what the dataminers from simc said. Honestly ongoing content releases are what keep a game like wow going. The lich king was on the box of wrath but you didn't get to kill him until the very end of the expansion. You worked towards it, gaining a stronghold in Northrend, fighting with the Argent Crusade, and working towards raiding Icecrown Citadel just like we landed on Zandalar earn the trust of the Zandalari and recruit them to the Horde. I know thats a stretch but ongoing content releases are an important part of an mmo, the lack of them is why wod was so terrible. 
---
It doesn't just reduce crit. It increases dodge/parry/block by 0.04% each and also increases the mob's miss chance by 0.04% for every point. At 440, you'll have 5.6% crit reduction, 5.6% chance to dodge, 5.6% chance to parry, 5.6% chance to block, and 5.6% chance for the mob to miss you without talents/stats/abilities modifying those chances. I figured I'd add this since people only bring up the crit reduction for defense. If you stack defense gear, dungeons will be quicker because you'll take less damage overall, which means less down time.
---
Um when did you start playing? Warrior is like the hardest class to level and to solo especially without gear from dungeons and raids (which you hate).  
---
People freak out about pulling 2 mobs on a warrior in vanilla..
---
Hey everyone! Hope you enjoy this new episode in my ScoreCraft series - really enjoyed making it for you all!

Back in 2005/2006 there werent a lot of video's ofc, but the WoW forums weren't that different from now. This movie gives a funny insight. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdaDYe0OA0w TLDW: WoW was already dieing in 2006 according to players, game was shit, game was inbalanced, ppl where whining, blaming Blizz, other defended Blizz.

Yep, it's better for those 25 people.
---
It’s not a nerf it’s a bug fix. They were supposed to break on damage.  Also Zandalari isn’t really content release. It’s a new race with 1 small quest line where in previous expansions it would be a whole starting zone and available out the gate. Everyone will do the 5 minute unlock quest and then race change or boost which will put them back to square one. Also Arthas wasn’t just in ICC he was everywhere. 
---
I doubt a company like Blizzard given its development history would have discarded their test cases. It would go against the fundamentals of test techniques new and old. They don't have tests for Classic elements on the 7.2 engine however they should be able to modify tests in relation to the 7.2 tests. 
---
Unless like I said they discarded that information which would be worrying considering WoW is an ongoing project. There shouldn't be a need if they have prior documentation. It's actually embaressing for them how long it is taking.
---
Which begs the question, how comes QA is taking so long when everything is a known quantity. Keeping in mind people managed to reverse engineer and release stable versions of Classic long before Blizz ever did? 
---
If it stays in the context of WoW classic (and it is) and you saying you want a rule against it. Against have an opinion about the corporate business that is running the recent  game then yeah...it limits our way of criticising.
---
Pretty common rule is to spend first 10 talent points alternating between wand spec and spirit tap. Since both of these are extremely important talents for more fluid leveling experience. It will not help you in PVP but when fighting mobs a lot of the damage come with wand while regenerating mana with spirit tap. Basically you can kill mobs non stop this way.  
---
At 40 respec for shadowform and put next 5 points back into wand spec since you still have 20 levels of killing mobs.
---
BFA is certainly not the best expansion around. But imho its also not that bad as ppl make it out to be. Uldir is a good raid, M+ with longtime Friends is still fun. Upcoming raid looks promising. Sure WQ's arent all that fun, so just a tip, don't like em? Don't do them, they are not needed in any way shape or form. Same for ppl complaining about queue'd content, just don't do it if you don't like it, play with your longtime friends. I hardly ever do queue'd content with randoms, i play with friends. And that is still fun even in BFA.    
---
You may think your analysis is 'stupid' but I legit have panic attacks if I /camp and I'm not getting rested xp for a certain period of time.  It would be most useful to see the math charted out with various 'return times' so if you know it will take 10 minutes to get back or you want to take a long flight route and that saves you time or w/e it would be good to maybe see the actual 'amount of return time' at each level and hours away that make hearthing worth it..
---
I started playing in Fall 2006. For me, it was then and is now still the easiest to solo and level. I never freaked out about pulling multiples; sometimes you die, sometimes you survive, but it's always fun. I don't have the gear but I always have a good time, and to me, that's the most important part.
---
You open the wrong posts. This post is about satire and ridicule of the current game. If you don't want to see it then don't open this post.
---
but he could save like 10s come on
---
Yeah, you stay in that desert where you belong, green skin motherfucker.
---
Ahh the classic, I can’t counter your argument so I’ll say the stupid “Don’t like it don’t X it” line.
---
Rank 12
---
&gt; my wife calls me a geek everytime I pull one out - even tho she gets good info from them!
---
Are we still doing phrasing?
---
I'd recommend _not_ playing on private servers. Vanilla leveling is a bit of a chore, and Classic is theoretically only another 5-8 months away. If you start on a private server now, you might make 60 and then a month later Classic is released, and then what? Immediately abandon the character you invested several months into just to start the level grind all over again? Do you really want to do that?
---
I recommend you decide on a faction for sure, and then narrow the field down to 2 maybe 3 classes you might want to play. No need to settle for sure on just one, you can create a couple characters in your first week or so and then try them out to see which you prefer. But narrow it down to just a few choices. Understand the tank/heal/dps trinity and have a sense for what you probably want to play, and choose classes accordingly.
---
Then decide what type of server to play on, pve or pvp.
---
Next, make sure you're aware of the situation regarding physical location of servers and how it affects lag. For example, if you're on the US east coast, you don't want to play on a server thats datacenter is on the west coast. We don't even have server names yet, we don't know where they'll be, but understand that this is a thing that you should be aware of when you choose which server to play on. Don't just pick the first one on the list and end up stuck with lag forever.
---
Next, give some thought to server populations. Do you want to play on a heavily populated server with a famous youtube streamer? Do you want to play on a smaller server? Again, we don't know yet which servers will be which, and maybe we won't even be _able_ to know because these things won't settle down until months after release. But give some thought to your preferences so that if more information becomes available you'll be able to make good decisions based on what we do know when we know.
---
That's all the prep that's really needed.
---
_If_, after all of that you _want_ to do more because you're bored or anxious or whatever...then it's not a terrible idea to look up the best in slot gear lists for whichever class you think you want to play, and make lists of stuff you definitely want to get. It's not actually _useful_ to do this, because the reality is that you'll just play and when it comes time to go hunting down gear you'll just look stuff up and it's completely trivial. But it's an entertaining thing to do if you're bored and like doing research.
---
Otherwise, that's it. Just figure out what you want to play and be aware of the significance of server choice.
---
You motherfucker, I too have this dream. 
---
there will be zero exploration in classic tho and you know it
---
Its satire
---
What kind of an idiot pays for a name?
---
I like to set it where I'm leveling, so when I can buy new skills it's like a quest back to the main city to get them and then I can Hearth right back instantly and use the new skills :) 
---
Cocksucker
---
What do you mean by line of sight a HS spell? I've never had HS not go off.
---
Yeah but just getting to turn up means you won't get gear. Who cares about killing bosses if you don't get gear? 
---
To have my first epic be Sul'thraze on a warrior, just like my first time on vanilla.
---
It's also showing a dlc boss that requires a guide to even know how to find. That's probe what they mean by "never knew existed". 
---
Same. Maybe throw in some bloodfang while we're at it.
---
Except this post is in-genuine and unfair. Its a bad comparison. Retail has a shitload of problems and such but this post is just pretty bad. I don't want decent discussion to be gone but this post doesn't incite any proper discussion. Its just bashing retail in a sub par way. Vanilla was time gated too. Vanity was a thing in vanilla too. Its just a bad comparison. There are posts that make good points without being low effort attempts at bashing retail. 
---
Took me second to get that - ROFL :)
---
What classes will you play?
---
I was thinking of using a private server to lvl 3 classes I'm thinking of playing to about 20
---
I know 20 isn't huge but it'll give me a somewhat decent idea of how those classes will be. 
---
Also thank you for the detailed reply :) 
---
Hopefully Frank, Dave, and Bob
---
I've heard some people use private servers to prepare... Some of them have said its within 95-98% of blizz accuracy and that they have been playing Classic already for years... I wouldnt know but thats what some people say.
---
It's just a baseline. It'll fluctuate, but likely by a pretty regular percentage range. If you're 20% faster at 10, you'll likely be 20% faster at 30.
---
For example. Joana was 38% faster overall than this baseline, and every level had a pretty evenly distribution of 38% ±10
---
So if person A is 20% lower than the baseline in general, they can just change that column to account for that. Joana would *.38 the column for his own fairly accurate return on if time spent getting rested is worth it.
---
hahaha No, some of you weirdos think this way.
---
I think its a fair point to say that the original playerbase gets older and has other things to worry about in there life so they leave. Although i do get that certain genre hypes generate an influx of people, more people and more kids have access to the internet and gaming in general so there should be a stream of new people coming in who like MMORPG's. Also alot more people in general play videogames compared to 10 years ago. If the expansions after WoTLK was as good as it precursors then you should see a stability in old peaple leaving and new people coming in. But has been a steady decline and i wish i could see the numbers now.
---
Couldnt submit my response because it didnt allow me to choose hardcore pvp and pve. Ehhh oh well.
---
maxing out Alchemy
---
the thing i miss most is professions being relevant at all.
---
I’m in on this one too,  but going for a lot more than 1k. During vanilla I cleared all the raid content but never really cared too much for PvP. Now that I have full time responsibilities I plan to raid casually and just gank the ever living hell out of people since I can do that for a few minutes and log out. 
---
LOL yes I recall if you Q'd for a bg as 29 and then dinged while in Q, you could still enter the 20-29 bracket.  I remember I prepared for one 'ding game' at level 40 by getting the next tier talent point and making sure to get my mount really quick and yeah it was a total laugher.

I think the avg wow retail player want high rewards for minimum effort. They want the gear that make them feel like a good raider / pvp, while playing wow as a casual game that only require a good investment of time on release and barely nothing for the next few month.  To be honest, ActivisionBlizz actually manage to do it well and once again, I think it's fine as long as it reach the audiance ActivisionB really want to reach. 
---
It's about time you're back Josh.
---
It’s great to be back!
---
I'd say it depends on percentage of votes if its 45 % to 55 % i'd say no. If it's 75% to 25% i'd say, well they must be doing something right. In the case of WoW we have figures as well 12 Million people during WoTLK and now 3-4 Million during BFA. They probably have more statistics like, time logged in, time afk, consecutively subbing etc. We can draw conclusions from that, and the general census would probably (although i might be wrong) be in favor of WoW vanilla-WotLK. If you look at the general phrase this all started with "Classic is objectively superior" all figures show in favor of that.
---
I want to get atleast one raid epic.
---
Wow! this is a little surreal. That was a fast response! I'm listening to your voice as we speak. Wish I could have had the chance to bump into you at Blizcon! Hope you enjoyed your Holiday! Heaven knows you deserve a break especially after no-lifeing the podcast for a good chunk of 2018!
---
"The use of humour, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and OTHER TOPICAL ISSUES."
---
I'm not discrediting wand spec whatsoever, I just don't bother with enchanting or with finding a good wand pre dungeon wands.  
---
If I land a decent wand pre-lvl14, then I build out my wand spec
---
Even if we assume they had unit tests for the original vanilla game *and* those unit tests still exist today, they'd likely be all but useless for Classic given how much the codebase has changed since then. Modifying whatever unit tests they may or may not use for the modern game to work on the things they have to change for Classic, on the other hand, is basically analogous to just writing new ones from scratch.
---
Your assumption that Classic release hangs on testing is also completely absurd. The sheer amount of changes required is so large that much more development effort will be spent on actually discovering those changes and implementing them than is spent on testing the implementation.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
&gt;Keeping in mind people managed to reverse engineer and release stable versions of Classic long before Blizz ever did?
---
If by "stable" you mean "kinda works somewhat right", and by "long before Blizz ever did" you mean "in development since the beta of WoW and *still* in ongoing development with lots of features missing", I guess you're right.
---
First aid, cooking, and skinning should be on everyone's list "to-do".. it's free money people!  Leatherworking will be extremely popular for the first 6 months or so because of the thick leather recipes.
---
I won’t dispute gnome, but he’s contemplating playing a priest. Fear Ward is one of the strongest racials in the game. 
---
do you ever check the subreddit itself and sort by new, or do you just wait untill it comes on your feed with "hot". Most posts are about guides, specs, this or that,... 
---
The topics become hot and show on your feed because people are for and against it. You only see one post of many, and you assume that this sub is only such post.
---
There argument
---
Lol man in vanilla I had 6/8 NS and 6/8 BF. Still used lobotomizer and glacial blade lmao
---
Have you actually played on any of he several pservers around now?
---
Never said that. Infact I said when it hits my feed.
---
And I never sort by new on any sub regardless of what the sub is about.
---
Activision and blizzard merged... they are the same company now..
---
can someone plz tell me how do i absolutely win at this game?
---
i demand nothing less but immediate perfection. 
---
TBH I feel a little bit bad for streamers that so many people will try to log in asap and steal their names.  It happened in the Classic demo too!  Rough stuff.  
---
I’ve played both Alliance and Horde.  The Horde community seems to take itself more seriously, Alliance seems more friendly. 
---
Both factions have their share of toxic losers. 
---
Play whatever your friends are playing. 
---
The hearth back FROM the city is a valuable point!
---
You’re not joking! Oh well, it’s just my opinion. 
---
Baby steps. After 1000 we will see.
---
But yes, i killed most bosses in actual vanilla, and rarely wpvped since it was pointless. 
---
This time around red is dead.
---
Took me over a year to reach 60, I got so distracted by PvP. 
---
I didnt play during retail launch (though I did start during BWL) but I’m guessing there were not 1000s of lowbies competing and grouping up the second the game launched. Vanilla didnt have everyones attention then like it will, now.
---
I played Uthgard, is Phoenix like that? DAoC was such a great, underrated game. 
---
I get where you are coming from, but honestly there is more to it. 2H weapon for a warrior is a PvP weapon, not a raiding weapon. If it still counts it should count for hunters too, since having a strong 2H melee weapon can be extremely strong in PvP. With SV talents to improve your Raptor Strike it is deadly to cloth trying to abuse the dead zone and it gives you a chance vs a rogue that got the opener on you.
---
Just saying, if a melee weapon is strong for raiding, sure it goes to melee as first priority, but if it is won by a warrior that is still going to use DW for raiding and just want a PvP weapon then a hunter should be on equal foot.
---
I'm opposite, I always kept mine set to TB because I love that city and it was hardly ever crazy crowded. To me being able to instantly go to a city for spell training, BG queing or AH stuff far outweighed having to walk 5 minutes to a settlement to sell or repair.
---
Same here when I was 60, everything in the city was close together. 
---
No
---
He's playing a (primarily Ret) Paladin, I'm playing a (primarily Arms) Warrior for leveling/PvP.
---
In vanilla time is literally money...friend.
---
Most of the time you are playing is really just travel time. Just Hs to the zone you are currenrly leveling.
---
Also thats the main reason your top priority as a 60 is to buy the epic mount.
---
Classic pvp ranks. They were notoriously hard to achieve after 10/11. Took immense amounts of playtime and dedication. There could only be one r14 per week on either faction. 
---
Dude, just take the L. You’re getting blown the fuck out. 
---
Vanity vanilla is nothing compared to BFA, but anyway i had a giggle out of it (because its true what he compares). Low effort because its copy past + some text? Sometimes low effort can hit the nail on the head i'd say. I think we're just at the opposite side of this spectrum.
---
Gwt scarab lord.
---
Thats a damn high unrealistic goal foe someone that havent even made to 60 during vanilla, vut fuck realistic goals, bring in on!!!!
---
my vanilla era bank alt is 'Bagspace'
---
Haha would have loved to have had a chat! I’m always free on the discord so don’t feel like you can’t ever say hi. Of all the things to no life, podcasting was a funny choice haha I honestly don’t know what was going through my head but it’s paid off! :P
---
Why not make a bank alt to list your stuff on the AH? Saves a lot of time.
---
I mained a Tauren Druid all through Vanilla, I loved it. End game is where you might catch flak but honestly to me it was worth it. I want a new experience this time so i'm going to main a Warrior but dont let people give you shit, it's a fantastic class.            
---
wasnt 1.12 the version that all private servers worked off of?
---
In their defense, retail is _really_ bad.
---
You definitely don't need to be enchanting... In starting zones enchanters will be selling those wands for a few silver. And the level 5 and 13 wands are so much better than anything you could randomly land that it's a no brainier, you don't need to wait to land it. Look into it, it's very easy and makes a huge difference. Besides, you likely don't need that extra duration on SW:P at that level much
---
It deserves to be bashed IMO.  Blizzard needs to wake the f**k up.
---
As far as i know, no. No matter where u look people have mistakes. How i find/found my BIS for my class/lvl is going threw ALL the items on databases. So i click "Neck" and then i check all quests near my lvl/above my lvl (sometimes in questlines u can get a lvl 28 green item for lvl 19 twink etc). So if u do this you can find every BIS for your class. Regarding enchants, it should be pretty easy to figure out since "BIS" for each enchant is bassicly the game no matter what lvl. So if u find "BIS 19 hunter enchants" its also BIS for 29 hunter etc (Usally atleast)
---
I GM and RL during Vanilla and we were doing /rand based on attendances and previous loots during early MC. 
---
Untill the 1st binding dropped !
---
Like all others raiding guilds our MT was geared in priority and we didn't know the game very well (aggro from the proc of TF) . That's the reasons leading to the binding going to an Hun.. Rogue !
---
Very bad call indeed, made just after the kill and the infos provided by the MT were not enought to give it to him.
---
We wanted to be fair with everyone and we failed.
---
That leads us to do more research , understanding every class , what was BiS etc etc and setting up a Loot Council (GM, Both RL, officers and later Class Officers)
---
The guild was about getting the 1st kill, progressing to higher raids, so every members knew that every decision we made was to make the guild move forward. Even giving an item to a member that didn't wanted it just to be sure he will be able to do a specific task (like tanking).
---
I feel like back in the day that any DKP, SKP or else were going to slow down a guild where not all players knew what they should do to improve or they didn't wanted to tank so they will not need a tank item. And if an off tank or MT is not there we cannot raid ?? no way, no f.. way !
---
I see some are afraid that the new guy don't get anything, that's just plain wrong they will get geared in no time since all thoses items are not needed by the older members.
---
Not all servers had a big population / possibility to migrate was not in the game / good recruit was hard to find etc..
---
So like someone already said , find good guys, if they are not, change guild ;)
---
I remember a conversation I had with a friend in LBRS

"What is that, an addon?"

---
***"Yes dude! it helps you find what drops are an upgrade for you so you dont waste your time tanking stupid pointless dungeons!"***

"Wheres the fun in that?"                
---

---
You don't actually need 440 defense.  You can push crushing blows and critical strikes off the attack table just by increasing dodge/parry/block.  You just need mob's miss chance + dodge chance + parry chance + block chance to be &gt;= 100%
---
Some zones I bet the numbers would be even more impressive. If your alliance deep in the middle of Feralas, or south Desolace, Felwood, etc....to get back there would take 10-15m+ 
---
Ding 300 fishing! 
---
For some amount of time (not sure what patch fixed it) WSG was bracketed 1-10,11-20,21-30, etc, allowing a lvl 40 a ridiculous advantage (31 point talent, mount, better armor tier). They later changed the brackets to the 9's.
---
&gt;DPS warriors are many in a raid
---
Right... but your competition as a warrior is VERY dependent on faction. For example if you choose a Human Warrior, you will contend with rogues and other warriors for 1 hand swords and paladins for 2 hand swords and dps plate pieces. If you choose an Orc, you wont have any competition for axes (enhancement doesnt exist in real raids) and instead of paladins you have shamans, and very few shamans will be rolling enhance. The quality of life and competition for an Orc is ENTIRELY different than that of a Human.
---
Orc warrior - monopoly on axes, only plate class.
---
Human warrior - fight for ALL swords with both rogues and paladins and share plate gear with paladins. Granted ret is meme and you wont run into very many, but you WILL run into more rets than you will enhance shamans because Elemental is SO dominant in pvp.
---
Thanks for the heads up!  
---
I've done a bunch of research, and i'm generally aware of the Classic Druid Perception.  
---
I'm a pretty reliable and relaxed dude, and i also enjoy playing a Healer. I'll just be realistic about what i can/can't do with my time. I'm all for trying to Tank dungeons, and am a-ok playing Resto in Raids. So I'll just walk with the Earth Mother,  and hopefully i'll find my niche at endgame with a welcoming guild :) 
---
he can litterly be like "i would leave now, but instead ill kill 10 mobs and get the 10 extra silver" that way he gets free exp + saves time + saves money (he will get more then 10 silver for 10 mobs).
---
But personally i almost always set hearth to where i level and then if i have to fly from tanaris to org or something like that i will take a break and go eat etc.
---
Well my first experience playing WoW was actually playing on my best friends's brother's account. We didn't have our own computers so we ended up playing on his level \~10 Orc hunter. We got it to mid 20's taking turns until we both got our own accounts. We also spent a bunch of time watching my friend's brother play his NE rogue. If I remember correctly he was fully geared in T2 and was working through Naxx. Got to watch him take down Maexxna before I had a single clue what that meant.
---
After that though I rolled a Human Warrior. Sadly I got him to \~54 before TBC came out and never actually made it to max level in Vanilla. 
---
Damn kids these days and their computers that can load zones fast enough not to drown!
---
Leeroy will most likely be taken very fast and then class names ofc.
---
The game is a chore simulator. You'll have fun with friends in any game.
---
to watch porn while u play? thats what hes getting at
---
Got to factor in the loss of bag space. Think of all the money youll lose having 1 thing less to vendor when turning in quests.
---
woah mr trump calm down 
---
Yeah, that's the obstacle. Eventually you should be able to get those pieces and start replacing the r10 gear, just takes a lil time.
---
Yeah I agree with your point about human warriors and swords but the rest is somewhat disingenuous. If you’re a horde raid, you have wf and want more melee dps. The best melee dps the horde has is usually orc warriors. So if you’re in a progression guild, there are gonna be 4-5 dps warriors. (I guess from that viewpoint, go Troll 2h fury for the least competition for weapons?). Axes will still be tough to come by (every horde warrior has their dick hard for the ony axe).
---
Also, the contention for armor is entirely equivalent. If your alliance guild is giving dps plate to a pally over a warrior who needs it and is showing up to raid, I’d leave that guild as the warrior. That’s a waste of gear. Much the same if a horde guild gave some mail item to an enh over a warrior (if the warrior needed it). 
---
As horde, set your hearth to wherever you're questing. Then when you're 60 set it to KARGATH. Big rookie mistake to set it to Org or UC. For the better part of a year most of the things you want are inside blackrock mountain. When the raid or dungeon is over, the mage can port everyone to Org, then when your business is done you can hearth back to Kargath and be ready to go.
---
Yeah that's busted, oof.  Level 40 warr with mortal strike and some plate armor cruising around decapitating poor level 31 priest yowza.
---
Yup. Updating the sheet to have custom entry "X minutes to recover" and mathed based on that.
---
For example, Felwood at 48:
---
|Level|48|
---
:--|--:|
---
|Xp Needed|105800|
---
|XPH|25500|
---
|Rest Rate|0.0001041|
---
|Time X minutes|10|
---
|XP in X min|**4,250.0**|
---
|XP in 1 hour|660.8|
---
|XP in 2 hours|1,321.7|
---
|XP in 3 hours|1,982.5|
---
|XP in 4 hours|2,643.3|
---
|XP in 5 hours|3,304.1|
---
|XP in 6 hours|3,965.0|
---
|XP in 7 hours|**4,625.8**|
---
|xp in 8 hours|**5,286.6**|
---
So for 10 minutes to get back into things, rest is useless for anything less than ~6.5 hours - and updating the "Time X minutes" for any given moment gives you an overview on what you can expect at that time.
---
You know what? You're right. It's high time that I join the discord. I'm not sure I'll have too much to contribute, but It will be fun to hang out. 
---
P.S. (Your Dancing Queen cover was amazing!)
---
Or two thing if you dare carry some Runes of Portals.
---
Might as well kiss your bag space goodbye!
---
Dont. That combination is as ugly as female dwarves.
---
Furry warrior? 
---
I always go brown/black and go with scottish/gaelic names because of the Scottish Highland Cattle. 
---
Named my characters such as Dubhlanaiche, Eilthireach, Ghaidhealach etc.
---
Always thought it's fitted it very well.
---
If you're mostly white geared lvl 15 who havent bought all your core skills then any asspull is an instant wipe.
---
If you're mostly green geared lvl 20+ who has all his core skills then any asspull is a slog.
---
&gt;Furthermore they shouldn't even be doing much unit/component tests at this stage. It would more than likely be systems and integration tests. The 7.2 engine will already be component tested and the classic system is a known tested quantity. Not sure why you specified unit testing.
---
Look at you, using the big boy words. Given how much has changed with the game since vanilla, the classic system is far from "a known tested quantity". Many fundamental systems are different now, and the Classic data needs to be ported to work on the new systems which is prone to errors. A couple of examples they've mentioned in dev updates on Classic are how the spell effect framework used to be much more limited than it is now, and how their scripting tools (for RP events, certain boss encounters etc.)  are quite different from what they were during vanilla.
---
I'm not sure how you think the game works, but Classic involves far more than just restoring old database values and assets. Much of the game's inner workings (things like energy regeneration, combat mechanics, and many other basic elements of the game) are quite evidently implemented on a lower level than that (which should not come as a surprise to anyone). Given that there has been like 15 years of development on top of that, they obviously can't just copy and paste those mechanics from the old vanilla client into Classic.
---
Rogue energy regeneration, for instance, could well be tied to the game ticks, which were completely overhauled sometime in WoD to function dynamically (as fast as possible) rather than statically (every 400ms, plus some extra weirdness caused by the fact that this 400ms delay only applied to effects not local to your character). I digress but there's a great example of how private servers fundamentally fail at emulating the authentic experience: the game tick system on private servers is completely different (ManGOS ticks every 200ms IIRC and this applies to *all* effects), because at the time those emulators were made, this detail was not even known.
---
&gt; Lastly a blue post got put up the other day about how they are pretty much just doing QA right now.
---
Haha, that blue post was talking about Q&amp;A, not QA.
---
yeah, I'm terrible with bag space management. Somehow, I always have 2-3 items lying around and I have no idea what they're for but too afraid to delete them.
---
This for days.
---
People dont really understand that we're just dealing with pixels here. None of the achievements actually matter.
---
Its a game. Have fun. 
---
Jut in case someone reads this as satire it actually holds a lot of truth.  There was a rat warrior on my server who never got above 1500 rating until he got shadowmourne and deathbringers...  Him and his terrible partners ran double healer warrior and triple healer warrior dk in 5s and ended up getting gladiator.  I was a little upset that season...
---
Really don't understand the anti-collectibles circlejerk perpetuated by the elitist vanilla playerbase, and the example in OP is actually an extremely stupid one on top of that. 
---
Grove Warden was a limited time available mount from Heroic difficulty of then-current endgame raid. It pushed a lot of people to do more raiding than they otherwise would have in order to get it, sell it, or give it away, and this is supposed to be a *bad* thing? Because it's 'vain'? I'm sure it wasn't vain at all to afk in orgrimmar/stormwind in your full raiding gear, sitting on your epic mount either.
---
Nah, you can say it. This sub is a massive circlejerk.
---
Ye a lot of quest givers like to hand out random items for a quest but never bother to take them back in the end. I end up filling my bank with junk until im 60.
---
Create a dwarf and call him : Gimli
---
Create an elf and call him : Legolas
---
Create a human warrior and call him : Aragorn
---
Create a human mage and call him : Gandalf 
---
delet this
---
You mean the high level Cataclysm dungeons. Not the ones from old continents that were remastered, right ?
---
There was a lot of simplification for 0-60 leveling dungeons.
---
Gnomage
---
Pretty sure I would never fuck a gnome xD
---
I want to join an active guild and have WoW friends again.
---
I was referring to our human and night elf females. Nobody wants to fuck dwarves and gnomes.
---
what you say at the end their is true, as the top guild on our server, we could poach anyone from any guild, one of our paladins has to go away for a while or has to quit due to family reasons? oh look the second best guild has a well enough equipped paladin lets just recruit them isntead, this would set the other guild back as they then lost there best equipped paladin because they would not be able to resist playing for the top guild.  
---
when cross realm transfers came along though you had a much bigger pick and could recruit people from anywhere which made it easier.
---
Right now there aren't many good item data bases for classic so I don't blame him for looking for a guide 
---
Actually that might work decently. I think I'd miss like 3 raids per month if that is cool. If not, that's cool too and I wish you guys the best.
---
Your examples are even more in line with systems and integration tests. Not unit tests the fuck are you talking about?
---
I'll give you that I got the blue post wrong, they can't even give a basic Q&amp;A yet about the game. Summer release in 2019 looking unlikely if they can't even do that.  
---
My intricate knowledge of blue posts is lacking but you're grasping at straws about the backend of the game that very few actually know about. It should be highly unlikely that given Blizzards experience with developing games like SC and WC3 with online capabilities they would know something about archiving tests. 
---
Thanks for the correction on the blue post but your knowledge clearly comes from a developers perspective and not a testers. Also your knowledge doesn't scream that you have much experience with large scale commercial projects. That's fine but please don't waste any more time with your surface level knowledge. Have a good weekend.
---
It could be done... I did it on the N PvE server in less than 2 weeks real time but I know other people do it much faster than me. Since he says "\~1 week" could be interpreted as slightly more than 1 week. 
---
Haha thank you and look forward to seeing you there!
---
True that. I remember I got the wooly white rhino (I think that was what it was called) as a kid, and I used it immediately.
---

Now it goes for $489...
---
The competition for 1 hand axes, is on an entirely different level than the competition for swords on alliance.
---
&gt; i'd say
---
Yeah.
---
\&gt; Reach lvl 5.
---
\&gt; Get Lesser Magic Wand.
---
\&gt; You're Welcome.
---
Corrupted Ashbringer
---
Legolul
---
Legololz
---
Legolawl
---
Fair. It is 4-5 people for axes instead of 12 people for swords. That’s why I’m rolling orc warrior :)
---
If it actually hit the nail on the head that would be true. It's a garbage meme with what looks like zero effort put into making it. 
---
The only thing i liked from retail was transmog hunting if you can call it that and to some extend doing old wow content but at the end its just plain stupid and pointless because who even cares how you look in retail everyone has super godlike looking armor and again nobody cares 
---
It is not a distraction, just another route.
---
Thanks for the input. As we get closer to release, I think I'm going to have a vote to determine best start time.
---
Why shit on retail? It's an entirely different game, and we are getting classic. Why even give a shit what retail is like?
---
I’m not telling!!!
---
Wait does that mean that you have to pay for retail if you want to just play classic?
---
Don't even bother with this joke, he's a hardcore classic fanboy and nothing you say will mean anything to him. You can't say anything negative about this sub's intense circlejerk or he'll come to their defense. 
---
BIS was definitely a term in Vanilla. Specifically I remember people talking about trinkets being BIS for different activities, and Rogue weapons being BIS for different builds (high backstab etc).
---
This place is basically even WORSE than the main WoW sub.
---
Part of why I'm NOT excited for Classic, is because the community latching itself too it is becoming smug, arrogant and toxic as all hell.
---
"BFA BABIES COULDNT HANDLE TRUE WOW" &lt; probably said by someone who never even played until Wrath
---
"No more LFD and LFG to ruin the experience" &lt; Literally a system millions of people use daily and has been a boon to the community as a whole but "because **I** don't like it, it sucks"
---
"Classic will bring back a sense of exploration unlike retail where you just get old where to go" Really? You mean we DON'T know every single aspect of Vanilla already? Considering we...already lived through it?
---
We know what the best stats are, talent trees are, gear is, where to go, what to do...we know all this, NOTHING IS NEW.
---
Feel free to make a copy of [the spreadheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uKoDsBcJQ_N-rbT-zcnLPz7sfVTZoTy5gpQCLviK2Vw/edit?usp=sharing) and modify as you see fit.
---
If you're doing better on average as far as XPH goes, change that column. Then put in "how long it'll take to get back here" into column E and it'll do the rest.
---
Look at the column for how long you anticipate being out. White? /camp --- Green? Inn for rested XP.
---
Slamsandwich, Orhime.
---
He has a point, low effort or not. And making that clear through a meme is good satire to me
---
The actual content is better now, raids are legitimately challenging, pvp is much better, and the many difficulties for dungeons and the dungeons themselves trump anything from vanilla. The difference is the community and the access to the content, there was no queuing and you had to work together to get what would normally be a soloable quest today.
---
Googling "Vanilla wow database" would give you at least 4 different databeses with each and every single of them being legit to find the items you might want to pick as a twink. 
---
It's not rocket science to pick some good items for your twink and do a bit of thinking by yourself.
---
**BREAKING NEWS:** There is nothing new to report.
---
Morhaime 
---
Brack
---
Hazzikostas 
---
&gt; It's a comparison between WoW vanilla and WoW retail.
---
Yes, because NOBODY in classic gathered mounts or gear for looks, sat afk in the city for hours, had guides or were timegated *because timegates are part of MMOs*
---
No siree, never. Classic was never like that and never contained these things, no sir.
---
That's interesting. 
---
I am a classic fanboy, true! But when people can't take humor or satire and start to complain on why every post is about how shitty BFA looks like compared to Vanilla, then i point out that its not every post. And that the reason people make post like this is to ridicule something that used to be good. Which is why we want vanilla how it used to be. I'll defend it, and i feel alot of new subscribers don't know what they're talking about and are not the ones who made all of this happen.

This warrior does not get into combat before he auto attacks.
---
Priest are one of the fastest levelers. Wands used right makes it OP
---
agreed, mobs were beast, any more than 1 mob and you usually died unless you had heals or some escape
---
levelling takes soo long and your toolkit grows so slowly it works great. you eventually get so many skills that you need to fill up 3-4 bars worth, but it takes 50 levels 
---
Grove warden isn't even one of the shop mounts. It was a reward from getting AOTC during hellfire citadel and is no longer obtainable.  [https://www.wowhead.com/item=128422/reins-of-the-grove-warden#reward-from-q](https://www.wowhead.com/item=128422/reins-of-the-grove-warden#reward-from-q)
---
You should change your resolution it looks like you're stretching 4:3 to 16:9 screen. Unless you like it for some reason.
---
Yes, but people who want to play retail have to pay for classic as well.
---
&gt; Its a good theory but doesnt work in reality and will slow down progression.
---
Worked in my time in Vanilla. 
---
&gt;DKP is like communism. 
---
I think you mean loot councils.  DKP is capitalism, you get to spend what you earned.
---
&gt;Should dps bid on loot that is an upgrade for tank
---
MT got first dibs on all tanking gear with the DK system my guild ran.   He put in the time and effort and was there every raid. No one complained about it.  
---
&gt;when someone want loot for pvp should they have it when a dps need for pve just because they have more dkp? Who makes those decitions?
---
They earned the DKP and they could spend any which they wanted to.  WOW is a role-playing game how fast the raid progresses isn't the most important thing in the world.  All super fast progression does is leave people with nothing to do after everything is on farm.
---
Oh nice dude. Yeah I passed my FG+PG exams in October, but CA has their own specific exam I have to pass so I'm not quite fully legit here.
---
Quick look at a spreadsheet using pserver values shows along the lines of 312 having roughly about .45 more hit and .25 more crit. Additionally, 312 skill causes glancing blows to do 97.42% vs 307 skill having them deal 89.84%
---
You should ask a gm in retail for that matter. 
---
The point is moot. Everything aside from talents trees are still doable today. Raids are actually hard, not bugged to oblivion as they were in vanilla, dungeons are better and provide higher difficulties allowing players to compete at the highest possible level of play, and contrary to popular belief pvp is so much more balanced and offers rated content for players who wish to prove their mettle through skill rather than /played.
---
The only thing Vanilla did better than retail is the beautiful talent tree which allowed you to personalize your toons skills and create something unique. One other big thing was the community, each realm was like its own little world and many of us knew everyone else, especially if the pop was low. 
---
Other than that, the differences end up being similarities, some of the retail differences I actually prefer. World Quests and dailies are better than the mind numbing grind that was vanilla reputations. Content might be time gated today, but content was gated by korean mmo like grinds in vanilla.
---
Again, if the meme was good, people wouldn't complain about it. It was low effort garbage from someone who obviously doesn't play wow. 
---
Most of us were young. We have a better understanding all around. It will be easier in a way but still take a lot more time compared to retail. I can't wait for the challenge
---
Yep. I just assumed it was known and accepted like in all other subreddits
---
19 rogue in full tuxedo, defias mask, DWing heavy copper longswords. style points.
---
too hard to level multiple factions because you cant share any gold or resources between characters. Most people are gonna stick with one faction and go multiple characters on the single faction
---
The difference will be more apparent once you get C’Thun gloves and are a human with weapon skill vs a night elf with none. Also depending on how accurate pserver math is on some of the better ones I’ve played on, Edgemasters are not as good as other options even in MC with short fights. 
---
Have you tried searching these data bases extensively? They are missing key functions as well as filters to aid in searching. Many of them are also missing loats of information 
---
Well this is some stupid bullshit right here
---
How much time in Vanilla was spent standing around in the city looking for a healer in /2...?
---
That was really nice, even though I know nothing of music theory. Definitely watching the rest of them!
---
it's just not though
---
fck off dude lol
---
I hope you were able to get some idea of the theory through my diagrams! It's hard to explain it in an accessible way, but I do try! 
---
damn that a long reaD
---
My goal is go from 1-60 with best friend of 20 plus years. We are going Horde because last time we did Alliance. He'll go warrior again. I was originally going to go priest but I've never tried a Shaman and it's really tempting.
---
Name, ilvl, level required to equip, stat value filter - what else do you need?
---
You'll often be selling a bunch of crap to unload your backpacks and backing stuff as  well,even if you weren't completely  full up, iit will save you some more time.
---
I think BfA is no longer a "theme park" and is now more of a "casino" game.
---
I definitely agree that loads of people here and within the classic community at-large use disingenuous representations of what retail is actually like. But you're doing the same thing right back now my dude. 
---
The fact that LFD/LFR is widely used and how that has changed the social cohesion of the game is why most people, including myself are against it. Obviously it's a boon if you see it as simply means to and end of getting groups quicker and more efficient, but that's not the argument against it.
---
And while arguing against "BFA babies" piss me off as well, claiming someone's experience isn't real is just as much of a strawman. 
---
It's just as impossible to argue against any of your claims since you're being both disingenuous and use as many strawman-arguments as the people you're representing here. Sure, circlejerking sucks and the OP is laughably bad. But you're not being any better. 
---
What a photoshop, lmao.
---
We are so desperate for dirt on "Activision."
---
Alright, this is a new low for the WoW community.
---
The only reason WoW felt like we were "living our own journey" was because it was a new game, and we were new players. Anyone who picks up WoW today with absolutely no prior knowledge of it would feel the exact same ambition. Us long-time players just long for those days.
---
When Classic launches, many pairs of rose-tinted glasses will finally come off. It took *much* longer to get things done in Classic than in BfA. And with no constant updates and support from Blizzard, it will be stuck like that.
---
the people who picked a server 2 weeks early are more than likely not checking how their server population changed from when the picked to launch day and then day 1 or whenever they start they will just repick a better server or one where a buddy signed up
---
Collectible games and RPGs are by their very nature opposites. The more a collect-athon a game is, the less of an RPG.
---
Flight paths and auto runs are my chance to make coffee and browse this subreddit. Also no harm in taking time to make such spreadsheets before the game is out. Once it releases though you might as well spend that time leveling!
---
Gr8 b8 m8! I r8 8/8
---
[Here's the TL;DR image.](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/803853.jpg)
---
It's essentially timegated, but in the same order as it was in the Classic era. They'll likely do it at a similar pace.
---
Whines about others not taking criticism... cries "muh freedom of speech" when criticised... LUL. 
---
"Pet" would be awesome
---
Not really. 
---
I personally always did a bunch of /who on classes that could heal/tank generally to find people.
---
they enjoy watching X streamer, seeing them do a World boss could be enjoyable cause Boss fights are cool the first few times and potential Wpvp or them using items from it to do other interesting stuff, World Boss respawn timers can vary by days so it would be hard for someone who wants to entertain a stream to camp it themselves, it's not hard for a fan to have a toon afk watching a spawn while they watch the stream or videos, and if they help the streamer get the Boss kill they could get recognition without donating money. 
---
idk i would prefer the server to be a discussion on classic rather than a discussion on how shit retail is. it saddens me that the sub has turned out to be the latter. especially when it ends up resulting in gatekeeping and shitting on peoples interests.
---
I really like the horde lore/flavor wise, but I played alliance vanilla-cata, and my friend irl is gonna play alliance. I don’t think I’ve ever gotten a horde char above 20 pre cata. 
---
My plan is to main on the alliance, for nostalgia and friends, and have a casual alt I level on the horde for fun and to get the other half of the experience(I’m thinking Tauren hunter or shaman). 
---
TLDR if you’re indecisive play with friends, alt on the other faction.
---
Don’t *EVER* consider rolling Night Elf. You will be relentlessly made fun of for not knowing how to play and barred from all good guilds. 
---
Seriously, what kind of answer did you expect. And btw: no need to be rude...
---
Goals.
---
&gt; Classic is objectively better than Retail in almost any way imaginable
---
No, it's a matter of opinion. Just to name the most obvious thing: top tier hardcore raiders enjoy retail more because it has the better designed encounters and more challenging fights.
---
We know the real answer to why they're bringing Classic back: profit. They finally came to the conclusion that there's an audience willing to resubscribe to WoW (for Classic) that's big enough to warrant the costs of recreating and maintaining Classic. 
---
my main purpose is to level each class to 60 and collect every single set piece for each class. so i plan to be around awhile.

I cannot agree more, chore simulator! Playing BfA is exactly that, gotta do the weekly this and the weekly that. Fun, exploration, huge relevant content is a thing of the past, release classic just tells us that they cannot make genuinely great content anymore, they have to release the old ones. 
---
I gotta say pservers are where it’s at now, play TBC with legion textures and graphics, brand new game with “G”old values.
---
This post has taken an interesting turn
---
No one’s paying for those names, though. 😂😂
---
Yeah, I figured i would have to do a lot of manual legwork. I actually already have experienced doing this. 
---
Fun story: In retail I leveled a hunter from level 10-61 exclusively and only through battlegrounds, until they made some change that homogenized stats and made it lame. 
---
I went through the tireless effort of finding and documenting every minute upgrade for every single level, and going out and getting it. This meant every few levels I would embark on some quest I was way under leveled for or had some other guy run me through a dungeon. It was lots of fun. My hunter was constantly 100% bis (as far as I could tell) and consistently melting people.
---
Boy, that was a fun, fun time.
---
As far as everyone having mistakes: I agree. I read some site that said it had 100% bis list, but it was missing obvious stuff like fishing boots. Terrible!
---
&gt;I think you mean loot councils.  DKP is capitalism, you get to spend what you earned.
---
No I really mean communism where a doctor earns as much as a cleaner... Both work just as hard, right? The cleaner even works harder....
---
In addition to this, try to plan around what levels you need to train. If you can skip training and won't need to buy anything at level 42, then you know you don't need your hearth at a major city from level 40-44. Just an additional decision making factor, basically
---
&gt; Tell me how is current retail better?
---
people just like different things. I prefer classic right now, but i also have friends that i have tried to get into classic via private servers and they out right tell me they prefer bfa, usually saying they prefer how their favorite classes play, prefer being able to be XYZ spec viably ETC. Classic isnt perfect, just like retail isnt, I wont deny prefering classing by any stretch, but i also wont try to claim that NO ONE is ever going to consider BFA better. Because people do, and they are allowed to hold that opinion
---
You seem convinced so I won't try and argue with you. 
---
"Fuck the red team" basically.

Don’t even consider R13/R14, it’s way more of an embarrassment than an accomplishment. If you don’t get skill rating like Arena, or you’re not having fun, then it’s not worth it. 
---
SWEET ANOTHER ONE OF THESE!
---
MANY THANKS!
---
Lol @ this being downvoted, every single R13+ on a private server is on welfare or account sharing. 😂😂😂
---
I disagree. It isn't it's peak by a long shot, but I still enjoy it. Hell, I renewed my sub this morning.

I'll tip my hat in salute for Blizzards history of great games. Classic is the last serenade, asking us to remember what they once were, and not what they have become. At the end of the day B, you did good. 
---
I don't think it's "toxic" to call retail "trash", in many ways it is, its diverted so far away from the original fun of the game that you can't expect people to be over the moon about retail here on the classic sub...
---
How has no one mentioned the fact that this system doesn't really differentiate between items?
---
Stuff like Weapons/Trinkets/Rings are highly valued and they distort systems like these.
---
what do you expect? this is a classic sub because they trashed retail.... honestly what do you expect, if anywhere deserves to be toxic about retail.. its here
---
It's not so much that anyone is shitting _on_ retail so much as it is that retail _itself_ is shit.
---
How's that for some philosophizing?
---

That's what happens when its a bunch of people sitting around waiting to hear something about a game they've already played. Like there's nothing to talk about after a certain point. And that point was like 6 months ago. 
---
Oh, it's even worse there.
---
My friend was straight up denied from many guilds because his priest in vanilla wasn't a dwarf.
---
&gt; but to each his own.
---
Did you miss that part?  Do whatever you like.  Even if it does indicate to me, at least, that you have more disposable income than sense.
---
you're half right. 
---
That too. People completely forgot that the game is about more than just end-game content. Leveling has become a tedious chore that needs to be done before you can enjoy the game. Even Blizzard acknowledges this behavior and makes leveling as short and streamlined as possible. The game starts at level 1, not at cap.
---
Nice try my friend but, I think I'll be playing that close to the vest sir.
---
Environmental consulting in CA must be a nightmare. 
---
Yeah it does lessen the damage from glancing blows however the 5 weapon skill difference is still high on warrior because the dps lost comes mainly from rage generation not so much the actual glancing blow.

I've played retail ongoing all the way leading to BFA and I can stand by most of the toxic posts, even if some of them are slightly disingenuous ... who cares? The point is we all prefer classic
---
It's a bullshit ridiculous completely insane 'comparison'
---
&gt; passive aggressive
---
Doing a full BRD run in one go with my friends
---
Not necessarily agreeing on the classic part but the retail part is so true it hurts. Obviously its a hyperbole thats why its classified as humor but people in the comments defending retail and bashing vanilla seem to think that every vanilla hype guy never played bfa and didnt play vanilla during the last 4 months. I was super hyped for bfa but during september I installed vanilla wow and started raid logging for uldir. I have zero motivation left for retail except for those raids and am enjoying vanilla now for like 2 years on some private servers.

Sure, but I don't see why it should be at all triggering that some people prefer a style of game different than the rest of us. We're getting classic. I don't see the need for the toxicity.
---
First thing I'm gonna' do when my hunter hits level 10 is corpse-run her up Teldrassil and into Shadowglen to tame a level 1 young nightsaber, for no other reason than it's the single least accessible pet for a fresh-faced Horde hunter to acquire. I'll then level that little bastard all the way to 60 with her.
---
I'm gonna' have at least one tauren character of each class available to the race. Possibly multiples. I want to start a guild with a punny name playing on the similarities between Horde and herd. The dream is to become KoS to Alliance solely on the basis of its being so groan-inducing.
---
Whenever I encounter a low-level Ally doing a particularly obnoxious quest, I'll stop and help 'em finish it out. Then I'll murder the crap out of them and dance on their corpse. Help in the spirit of community, gank in the spirit of PvP.
---
At some point I want to take out all 5 Alliance leaders (Staghelm, Whisperwind, Fordragon, Bronzebeard and Mekkatorque) back to back in a single day. I'd like to add Wrynn to that list, but something tells me Blizzard isn't going to make children killable this time around either, even if they're royalty.
---
Richard III will remember that.
---
People seem to think once vanilla rolls around there will only be pugs, hardcore raiding guilds and people that do not raid at all. The terms casual and semi-progress seem to never show up and therefore I'm happy for this post. I always raided semi-progress only done a little mythic raiding in legion which was actually terrible. I will min-max but Im not expecting anybody in my guild to do the same. As long as people care to play good and we get 40 people in the discord every week Im happy. Optimal raid setup, full bis gear or mandatory consumables shouldnt be necessary to somewhat progress.
---
The shading in the 1.13 demo looks really, really bad. Hope it's fixed by release.
---
EVE is a sandbox. Vanilla is a theme park.
