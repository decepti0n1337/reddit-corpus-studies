Winter spring. I love the snow so much

---
marvellous, thanks
---
No he didn't. The blizzard debuff batch and the CoC batch were the same (obviously).
---
Smiley face under karazhan!
---
True, but the calculations are also bonus damage per rage spent, and HS is very expensive (it effectively costs more because it turns your white hit yellow so you don't get rage for it). Sunder is almost never a bad option, whereas HS can leave you rage starved for not much gain.  
---

---
My rotation by default is charge-&gt;demo shout-&gt;rend-&gt;sunder armor, then I either switch to berserk stance and whirlwind-&gt;berserker rage-&gt;mortal strike (and then continue alternating ww and ms) or wait for 1 ms to fire off before I switch (depending on if it will cost me rage to switch). If the mob is a runner I try to throw a hamstring somewhere in there because it lasts longer than the mob does almost always and saves me a ton of time chasing shit around and fighting their friends.  
---
With this rotation I basically have no or limited downtime unless I am fighting mobs who are +1 level and higher. But I also keep my gear leveled in all slots and try to keep my weapon within 4-5 levels of me if blue or 1-2 levels of me if green.
---
Also it's an intro level job (not in this case, but as someone applying to jobs, every intro level job requires 3-5 years of experience in the field somehow.)
---
#nochanges
---
Yeah, I definitely will. I picked up Ench/Tailoring, but not nearly as fun. :(   
---
Might ditch for mining/engineering because I'm planning on pvping exclusively, especially once BGs come out. Can we use engineering things in BGs? I don't remember, it's been so long...

Running SM Cath and healing an aoe run. Green hat with +33 healing drops so i obviously roll need. Later on, the blue hat, Whitemane’s Chapeau, drops and I need and win it. Mage instantly flames and accuses me of ninjaing saying that i don’t need it since the +healing hat was bis for me. I responded saying one’s for healing dungeons and one’s for levelling. Proceeds to kick me and says “I know a lot of people on this server, good luck” and ignores me. 
---
End up in a party with him again later on at ZF. Didn’t really care since i had them on ignore too at this point, and just wanted to get some runs done and level. Vexing cane drops and he wins it. Next run it drops again, needs and wins again and then leaves the party. Amazing.
---
I didnt mean actual druid resto tree form. It was an item earned through your garrisons lumber yard. You could only use it in wod expansion areas. It would turn you into a tree literally taken from the game assets to match whatever zone your in with NO name plate. The only thing that would give you away is if you pivoyed your character in a different direction then the tree would turn too.
---
Whatever. Someone should burn that whole city down some day.
---
Surprisingly, the most addicting drug is one most people aren't even aware of. 
---
95% of all people on earth consume some form of processed sugar daily, it is literally in most things we eat.
---
Lemme tell you, if you ever feel like putting this to the test and laying off processed sugar COMPLETELY ( you'd have to avoid most processed products, white bread , all sauces, obviously sweets etc), you can try and you shift your entire diet to pure non processed sugar and see how long u can last, sugar withdrawal has one of the craziest impacts on the human body, some have said the craving frenzies after the first week can get to near insanity level, akin to starvation, it's obviously not as physically violent as some of the other mainstream drugs but instead has some of the longest withdrawal periods out of any drugs.
---
Dunno why I'm telling you all this, just food for thought I guess. \^\^
---
Yeah I usually do only 1 sunder, unless they are immune to bleeds, in which case I know the fight will last longer and the benefit of more sunders stacks up.
---
No, it's fantastic, I do it all the time.

---
They explicitly said you don’t need tank spec. So it’s 100% not scholo or strat. Also, those complaints you listed about tanking aren’t related to the mechanical difficulty of tanking. They are related to the baddies in the tank’s group.
---
redridge!

*Never* stop jumping.
---
Yup, absolutely.

Take the 2 points in dirty deeds and put them in remorseless attacks
---
Where do you farm both black lotus and arcane crystals? Winterspring?
---
Barrens
---
You just listed rigns, trinket, chest, boots, and mainhand then said it's not significant. That's almost half of the total items you can wear lol.
---
Why would you not call that significant? It's quite significant.
---
Don't bother arguing with these people dude. Don't you know they pay $15 a month for the right to play two characters? Theirs and yours.
---
Seriously though, I have a number of friends playing Classic who have never played Wow before. One of them is a priest and he doesn't enjoy healing (but will if need be), however he absolutely LOVES shadow. The theme, the damage while levelling, all of it. I sincerely hope he never runs into some of these people who will no doubt tell him "Um wow, if you're playing a priest you are literally only allowed to heal"
---
Also keep in mind that if you're in berserker stance and don't have a lot of rage and your enemy dodges, you can dance to battle stance and throw an overpower, then swap right back to berserker stance. As long as it isn't eating rage to change stances this is something  you should when possible.
---
WHy you hating?
---
I lol'd
---
Mulgore is the best!
---
Not druid free form. It was from the wod garrison lumber yard.
---
Out if the loop what's the reference?
---
WoW is a drug I still cannot flush out.
---
I started playing in 2005, when I was still a student in Russia and was lucky to make $100 a month. When I moved to the US, WoW helped me go through the toughest times in graduate school as I was working on my PhD. I quit WoW when I graduated and started working. 
---
Fast forward eight years, I have a family and children, great job that pays very well and allows me to see other countries when I go on work trips, nice house, a BMW in the garage (sorry if it sounds like bragging, but it took soo much work to get all that). 
---
Still, I so desperately miss the times when I logged in and saw all the guild mates online, spend time running dungeons and raids or just goofing off in one of the cities. I want to try Classic WoW so much, make a warrior again and become a tank, but I’m afraid the old time is gone, and besides I’m lucky to get half and hour a day to play.
---
99.99% of the time hamstring kiting isn't needed, and if it is you're probably better off spending your time skipping that mob and fighting something else.
---
You should consider adding the level range for the instances.
---
EX: Deadmines (18-23)
---
Deadmines. My Vanilla Wow experience usually topped out around lvl 20 so Deadmines was my endgame.
---
Honestly I'm glad they never changed it.  I like having all the statues of Kael'thas still there.  \#merelyasetback

Onyxia buff
---
10% spell crit 5% melee crit *
---
Anecdotally, since I play both factions, alliance players do what you say in my experience. They run if they're at level, but always gank if they have a significant level advantage.
---
Horde tend to gank in packs though, so I dont really know which is worse
---
yes, 8% the maximum for passive unmounted speed boost. This comes from the enchant or specific items.
---
Too much ketamine not enough vitamin
---
F to pay respects
---
very true.  I can only imagine lol.
---
30-50g tip server. This will decrease as more people acquire the formula in mc.
---
This wowhead post should be taken down.  It is spreading so much miss information.
---
Do I need anything special to start tanking BRD / LBRS? Or just throw on a shield? Level 58 and ran out of quests, figured I'd head into dungeons but would have an easier time tanking. Or should I look for more tank gear beyond a sword and board somewhere first?
---
&gt;Idk what fantasy land you live in
---
Azeroth, obviously.
---
Alliance split IF and SW, Horde seem to all be in Org. This explains a lot really.
---
YAH THATLL SHOW EM
---
-you, probably
---
Hey guys, its built in the neatplates addon! One of the themes i think its called quadra.  It's very neat indeed
---
Darn has always sucked and been a ghost town.
---
Depends on the server, Arugal is arguably 70H:30A and BRM is always a pain in the ass to get in as ally aside from the rare occasion a MC raid is making their way over and clearing out the few horde parties camping the door, chain, drop, balcony, etc.
---
Nop. Did plenty of runs today and it was the same.
---
gotta be careful with sparks
---
It does feel that less enemies are spawning, but I dunno if it's just RNG. I'll need to run more to find out.
---
And thus batching fucked him, like title says

Thats a huge gold boost for you! Congrats
---
keep farming! there are alot of rare BOE blue drops from sfk. 3 of them are worth BANK. dont just sell one without researching
---
Nah. Paladins mostly for healing in raids, and you will never be top tier DPS, but it's a fun class and you can crush certain 5 mans for tanking using consecration (especially vs undead).
---
I personally am going after a few of my fury warrior pre-raid bis items before my epic mount. Specifically the devilsaur leather items and at least a flurry axe for consistent rage generation from my offhand weapon.
---
Westfall has always held a magical place in my heart. The farms, the scarecrows, the music and ambiance of the land, the defias and all the events leading to the first Alliance instance in the Dead Mines.
---
Completely dependent upon what you plan on doing.
---
You’ll want epic mount if you plan on ranking phase 2 on a PvP server, but there’s still probably 2 months until that.
---
If you do lots of open world farming get epic mount. If you’re a real efficient person, get epic mount. Epic mount is also a one time buy and will be used forever.
---
Really just gauge what you do and if it’s worth it. How much time will you save? Would you rather save that time or get some BoEs
---
Im on ally and cbf with wPVP. Hadnt played they game in years and didnt know about the whole horde dominating pvp realms
---
I've been playing since vanilla, a good chunk of that with my boyfriend (we started in vanilla together but we took a break from the game around cata and he never resubbed the times when I did until classic came out), but I still think it is important to try and keep a good balance. Some games are too easy to sink too much of your free time and mental energy into while neglecting other friends and hobbies, and WoW is likely the worst offender out there.
---
If you're big into videogames it's probably wisest to get a partner who also loves videogames, but that's not a replacement for still nurturing a relationship, which I'm sure you know since you've made it work for a good long while, but many people think 'well my partner plays games too so that means it's all good!' is the answer, but naw dog. There's more to it than that. Your partner can play videogames too and you can \*still\* have a gaming addiction that is a serious problem.
---
The Hinterlands! It's just beautiful and full of "kill X many of this quests", which are my favorite type.
---
I usually tell me group to wait with AoE until I get a WW in, so that TC is just extra threat until they start blasting. Also I just generally like to have most of my debuffs running :P
---
yep, just hop in your local LookingForGroup channel and ask for DM: E (Deadmines expansion)
---
Wwdfdf.   C c. D🤣😊😁😁guwg z
---
Could see niche situations for PvP groups for this more than anything. Priest and war vs physical? Pup amp. 
---
Big spell coming toward your tank? Quickly magically dampen him which he can remove himself if a heal is inc . 
---
Certainly would require coordination tho
---
Why do people hate this way of leveling so much? If you're not a mage or a healer its not even available to you. I see tons of groups offering to do dungeons the normal way.
---
Back in Vanilla there was a bit of unspoken rule of no druid on druid violence.  While I still follow this in Classic, I do still mess with other druids.  Most recently, while herbing, a lower level druid was racing me from node to node.  I just started sleeping him at every node...after the 5th or 6th time, he went away.
---
It takes a lot of shots for you to "one-shot" these people.
---
Do you know what one-shot means?
---
I would personally go mount. It will make farming slightly more efficient and its a one time purchase.
---
Wowhead is spreading so much miss information with this post.  None of this info is accurate.  Back when they were releasing this info, horde and alliance on my server were running pop checks on their side and posting them in discord.  Pop was a 60 40 split where this wowhead data suggests 52 48 split.  Now the pop addons are broken and we all have no clue exactly other than what you experience in the open world.
---
Racism. Definitely racism.
---
I mean mustaches are something night elves definitely don't lack. Now giant beards...
---
Ddzdddzddf______*_*__zddddddddddddddzdddddddd
---
Man this is super cool! I really envy you dude. If only cross faction chat was a thing in classic i'd consider transferring my orc warlock over to your realm just to hang out with you guys! Could be fun having an orcish drinking buddy while his demon kinda just sits there mildly annoyed in the corner :P.
---
Oh fuck double dank
---
Pretty sure that can just be 1 line . It assumes spell A is not mod spell b is mod
---
Maybe retail, but Classic has an utter lack of tanks.
---
Ty very much, sry for the late answere, now I started again with bfa and a new 110 rogue on a new server. Mby some general Tipps for me? Got some good guides for rouge but in general? Looks like many things have changed ^^
---
Shoulda sued. That could be considered a verbal contract, doesn't seem like it would have been too hard to get it back if he entered a legal process.
---
He means of their current age
---
If anything last night I noticed more mobs spawn from the graves. 
---
It will take more then 3 runs to get a solid data set. 
---
The grave spawns are random as you’d well know and there is every chance you just got unlucky. If blizzard was going to ninja nerf ZF they’d likely take an approach that would get you killed. Like make agro range larger of the trash that on the way there and fix the evade exploits. 
---
Also they could just make the boss agro you as soon as you walk into his little room. Or even just reduce the chance for loot from the zombies themselves.
---
Gold farmers wet dream.
---
Brilliant, thanks for that.
---
Boe prices will only go up the older the server gets.  Epic mount price stays the same.
---
How can you possibly have such strong feeling towards everyone that plays a specific class in a fucking video game lol?
---
I wish every mage were like you. I normally pay 1g for 6 stacks of the lvl 45 water or 1.5g for 6 stacks of the lvl 55 water.
---
This is probably it.
---
Nugenergy, bar for the energy ticks count
---
Neatplates, show stun durations and combopoints.
---
Spy, to keep track of kill on sight allies
---
Classic castbar? Although neatplates comes with it too.
---
Weaponswing timer the bluebar underneath my nugenergy bar.
---
Are you horde or Alliance? And what guild?
---
Yes, there are bots for WoW.
---
It's only a "problem" in that when you have bots on your team they're absolutely worthless.. They just queue and hang out in a corner and don't generate any honor beyond just taking part in matches, they're too garbage to actually PvP so they really just help the enemy team.
---
How am I diverting the conversation? I'm directly referencing points you yourself have made. You're playing a strange victim card here.
---
You're at least admitting it wasn't a fact, and hypocritically diverting the 'fact' to be something else entirely, even though you attempted to call me out for diverting the conversation, you've now done so yourself. Rather ironic.
---
I've said before, but I agreed with you that layering was meant to make playing the game easier, rather than increasing the population cap. The difference is that I'm not dying on the hill that says that is a fact, rather it is a strong possibility. What a GM says has little bearing on what is correct. 
---
I'm seeing both sides, and acknowledging both sides could be correct. You're grounding yourself down to one single option and presenting it as fact. You've biased yourself so far in to a corner just to be correct that you've blinded yourself to any other possibilities.
---
True for any game. Retail died for me early in BFA when I realized how much I hated logging in on a day to day basis to do daily chores. I never even finished the rep for Honorbound. Now I log in to Classic daily, because I want to.
---
If you've got all plate, a decent sword and a decent shield, you'll be fine in BRD/LBRS.
---
Any encounter where you're within 3~ levels of the final boss should be very doable for you.
---
Fortunately not too horrible, but while buying some mats to leveling cooking, i misread the stack as being 2.5g for the stack rather than individual item, and ended up dropping 25g on 10 wolf flanks.
---
Defense isn’t the biggest deal while tanking five mans. I’d say not having to drink every pull is better than blocking a few more times.
---
The fact they didn't give the city a mailbox near the AH is so dumb. It's such an easy fix.
---
I can't wrap my head around why you would think some random mage telling some random warrior he doesn't need to be prot, 100% rules out it being Strath or Scholo.
---
Winterspring, because it's the only snowy high-level area.
---
Ya 10 min debuff + repairs all day on that one. 
---
But that's coming from me the retard shaman than instantly self rezzed when I got ganked. God I'm dumb
---
Horde. &lt;Casual Encounters&gt;
---
SW has both Stormwind and Darn aligned druid trainers.
---
Earthshaker represent!
---
Oh also Trinketmenu
---
I mean you act like ally are the only ones that dont engage 1v1, but horde dont do it either... Its all based on personal bias.
---
At least right now in classic the flips aren't synched. I did some flips and looked over at my gfs screen and they were just regular jumps. Same with the Halloween skeleton idle animation where he flips his head.
---
They decided to synch them for wotlk?
---
I've got a carreer now, long term commitments, hobbies that take me outside the house... theres no way WoW can ruin my life again... no way... im an adult now not an idiot kid that doesnt give a shit about the present or the future...
---
On an unrelated note I just finished an 8 hour stretch to finally hit 40 and get my mount! So damn happy! Off to level up herbalism tomorrow. Cant wait!
---
I tend to use it as a general term for "killing with an unfair advantage" like if you have a group or are a much higher level
---
Warlock doesn’t really need to worry too much about gear while leveling since you got a pet to help out along the way. Dungeon quests usually give nice blues so keep up on those, don’t waste money on the AH. Make sure you do all the chain quests in the world that give trinkets and other gadgets like Skull of Impending Doom.
---
You don't tell them you don't have experience, to start. Just do it.
---
Probably. They knew that they were going to make battlegrounds and they knew that they were going to separate them into level brackets, even though the battlegrounds themselves weren't actually in the game at launch. There are also a ton of very rare low level items that fit perfectly into each bracket.
---
Stranglethorn Vale
---
&gt;	We bang the rocks 
---
Is that where Dwarves come from?
---
Vanish get rid of the mark
---
Doesn't help that there's zero endgame dungeons in northern Kalimdor. Literally if they'd put one end game dungeon in Azshara, Felwood or Winterspring, it'd have made Darn infinitely more attractive.
---
I've not heard this before and I can't find anything about it - got a link? I'm not at all doubting you because there's TONS of that kinda thing.
---
Work is big hinderance, I dont even have an epic yet! We lost a big customer at work and if they need to put someone on leave I will be mad if thats not me.

Temple of moon lake counts as a moonwell.
---
That was an issue with private servers where he’d start to blow them up when he reached 50% hp. It’s actually a 6 minute soft enrage on live servers I believe.
---
Dm wasn’t nerfed this time round, private servers got it wrong. It was nerfed in 1.9 or something you can see the complain comments on wowhead classic. 
---
If you’re talking about groups of mobs evading when you mention group mob resets, this happens because another mob has pathed somewhere it shouldn’t be and is continually trying to evade, which in turn creates like an evade aura around it making all mobs reset that are in range. 
---
As for devilsaur spawns. I guess with layering gone blizzard decided they need twice the devilsaurs to cater to the servers having twice as many people trying to farm them.
---
I mean jump horde 1v1 all the time. I pvp a ton. But there are significantly more horde than alliance on most servers so if you try to get a 1v1 fight more often then not a random person walking by is horde. (There are more horde on every server than alliance so yes, any random passerby is more likely to be horde) which then turns into a 2v1.
---
Man enchanting takes so much investment I'd hate to lvl it then drop it lol
---
I guess that’s a possibility. My faith in others must be a little too high, I thought my assumption was common knowledge. But alas, we are on a thread regarding bad players. What do I know.
---
I disagree. TB is an insanely efficient city compared to the others. Bank, AH, anvils forges etc all in the same rise. Even in fucking ORG I have to haul ass to get to the forges and back to the bank/AH. In fact  I'm fairly certain that Org is the worst Horde capital.
---
Breathing is also an addiction. Sorry too dark.
---
You can give someone gold in classic. They can choose to complete the "trade" by giving you gold in retail (or vice versa), or they can simply keep your gold and tell you to fuck off. Blizzard will take no action.
---
I would just prefer people say exactly what they mean. Tell me your gonna play wow and do your own thing. I'm an adult if you communicate to me what you want I'll be able to act the way you want. Tell me you want to be left alone its that simple...
---
Had a group take me as a level 59 warrior. We wiped twice on trash mobs (silencing ghosts) and no one said anything bad. At least the graveyard is close. Rogue marked skulls on targets to give me a general idea where to go. Los'ed most pulls. Took a little more then an hour. Fuck scholo though. I won't be going back lol.
---
Ironforge looked a bit like this earlier -highly populated
---
WTF no way
---
There's no strict definition for "significant" as it pertains to percentages, but the pertinent point is that it's *not* significant in comparison to the fury overlap with rogues, and of the items that Fury and Prot both need, a majority will also be sought after by rogues.
---
Let's say Prot/Fury compete on Gladiator Chain, HoJ, Rings, Boots, and Ranged Wep.
---
That's 6/17 slots, or \~35%.
---
Of those 6 items in contention, rogues will want 4/6, or \~66%.
---
Rogues and Fury compete on Helm, Shoulders, Back, Rings, HoJ, MH, OH, and Ranged.
---
That's 9/17, or \~53%.
---
Most Fury will ignore the grind for Gladiator Chain and go for Cadaverous, in which case they now overlap with 5/17 (\~29%) slots for tanks, and 10/17 (\~59%) slots for rogues.
---
Obviously the exact numbers depend on the exact pre-BIS/BIS list you're adhering to, but my primary point still stands.
---
I hate drugs
---
I can confirm, worked as a scamming salesman
---
If you want to focus on pvp as a mage definitely don’t waste your gold on freezing band. It may be BiS for PvE (until you go fire) but it’s not good in PvP. Here’s wy:
---
* 1% proc rate to help you in matchups that you already should win (melee) isnt something to rely on. 
---
* the only spell which has good frost spell damage coefficients is Frostbolt which you’re not going to be spamming in PvP unlike PvE where it’s 90% of your DPS. In PvP you’ll get much more damage from instant casts like FireBlast and Arcane Explosion neither of which benefit from frost damage. FB actually has great spell damage coefficients for an instant cast so you really want generic spell damage in PvP not frost. 
---
* No int 
---
* No Stam. 
---
In PvP straight up int/Stam is especially useful for staying alive and having enough mana to survive longer fights (since you’re not going to have mana efficiency talents in arcane except maybe clearcasting)
---
Compare that to Cyclopean Band for example https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11824/cyclopean-band
---
* int - check 
---
* Stam - check 
---
* generic spell damage - check 
---
Expecting a 1% rng proc to help you out in PvP isn’t a good idea since it only happen 1% of the time. The loss in frost spell damage is a easily made up by doing more damage on all your non frost spells and you’ll get some int and Stam to boot. 
---
Get the mount. Mount is forever.
---
I sold 3 devilsaur leggings before realizing I was putting them up for 1g85s instead of 185g

Huh. Never heard of the IKEA effect. I wouldn't link it to WoW, totally a sunk cost fallacy though.

Be careful, I read that these free-transfer Servers tend to be extremely low pop. 
---
Friends of mine transfered to judgement and they already regret it.
---
first time I've seen this item posted since launch
---
It’s incredibly difficult to pull and survive below level 33-35 and you’ll find yourself only able to pull 3-4 mobs max until you get your mount and Ice Barrier. 
---
If you accidentally pull a caster the safest thing to do is just run and reset to pull because if you don’t play it perfectly you will mostly likely run out of mana and die. Way note efficient to just abort the pull.
---
Satisfying, truly, satisfying.
---
Piss easy for people who know the fights and know how to itemize, which isn't saying much.  Mythic raids in retail are also piss easy if everybody knows the fights.
---
Average groups struggle in MC today, average groups will also struggle in BWL.  Trust me, you'd be surprised how bad many MC groups are today.
---
That's funny. God I bet they were annoyed though.
---
Dungeon has like zero tank mechanics lol
---
Oh no!!! I feel your pain brother 😭
---
If you accidentally pull a caster the safest thing to do is just run and reset the pull because if you don’t play it perfectly you will mostly likely run out of mana and die. Way more efficient to just abort the pull.
---
Same mechanic which lets you execute shatter combo. Next time wait a half a second longer or go 2/3 improved blizzard.

Originally Jasperlode was supposed to be like the Alliance's RFC from what I understand. But they just made it a questing location rather than fully fleshing it out.

80% of tanking is knowing the fights and pulls, the other 20% is gear and spec.  BRD is pretty easy to tank, I did it as arms up until 58.  There are a couple tough pulls, the trash to Bael'gar is pretty nasty, and the fire elementals as well.  Small tip that the fire elementals use pure fire damage, so just 2h tank them to kill them faster.
---
Seriously? Actually amazing. I never knew this
---
Ah, gotcha. Guess you had to be there!
---
Way more satisfying than distracting them off of the loading ramp of the boats lol
---
Heh, 
---
Funny to think about the random stuff that might've influenced WoW classic devs.
---
As a shaman healer I waited until 52, and would spam the first half. Even at 52 you tend to proximity pull a lot and it’s tough if the tank isn’t keeping an eye on you at all times. Id do Mara/ST for two more levels if I were you
---
World bosses make layering weird
---
I do the red about 20% of the time. I'm told I'm pretty much a meme on my server because I level so fucking slow compared to everyone else when in reality what they don't know is that I'm AFK about 70-80% of the time (slowly moving into a new house over the course of the next couple weeks and constantly dealing with people I sell jailbroken devices to which is legal) and the rest of the time I'm just having fun. If I'm fishing, I make it fun by watching something on my other monitor and using an addon to turn my sound all the way up when I equip my fishing pole so I can listen for the drop from a hooked fish. If I'm questing, I make it fun by seeing how many times I can jump without stopping to run. Don't get me started on going into Orgrimmar near the First Aid trainer....those damned rocks and I are mortal enemies because I have been trying to play a little mini game by jumping from atop the hut near the First Aid trainer (I think they're the Portal trainers, at least they were in retail, I don't pay attention) and then I jump onto the rocks trying to keep jumping from rock to rock nonstop without touching the water or touching one of the rocks more than once - if I fail I have to start over again. I literally spent an hour doing this one night because I got bored.

Feralas because there are so many barren, desolate, desert-esque places in this world, especially Kalimdor, and Feralas reminds me that there are more colors than gray and brown.

Ashenvale

If You want character transfers go to retail
---
How’s the balance there for faction?
---
Maraudon
---
Refusing to interact at all is certainly bad, but not the same thing as being silent when there's no obvious need to talk.
---
I know the feel. I have real trouble getting myself to grind. I am at lvl 48 right now and I am running back amd forth between kalimdor and the eastern kingdoms finishing up quests, hoping there's a bit of a hub somewhere. I think the searing gorge is a good place for me now, but I first have to do Maraudon to open up some room in my Q log.
---
I started doing this like a week ago. Id have to vendor every 3 runs and id have about 8-12 greens and an equal number of greys. Im farming right now and after 3 runs i have 8 greens, but 3 are from the boss which means only 5 from zombies and graves. Also less grays and more cloth drops. Its a small sample size but its pointing to a nerf
---
Your lack of self control has nothing to do with what game it was. If it wasn’t wow it would be Madden, or Call of Duty, Skyrim, fallout, or a plethora of other 100+ hour games. I have played off and on since launch, mostly coming back more for the people I met along the way than actual game play tho I have done hardcore raiding from time to time, and only put in about 3-5 hours a week. Have not touched retail since classic came out, tho will likely go back and hit the major story points when next expac is announced, and even there I am taking my time and only a level 45 warrior. Maybe you should look inward for a reason your relationship went to shit rather than blaming a video game for all your problems.
---
On whitemane a stack vendors for 2g 50s and AHs for 2g 70s. But deposit costs 1g so if you fail to sell it you lose any profit you would have made throughout 5 whole stacks. I end up just vendoring it which is sad.
---
&gt;In the top 150 guilds US there are equally 7 guilds on both horde and alliance on Skeram.
---
This is by definition moving the goal post. You went from competitive to top 150 US guilds. Any guild clearing all the content currently is competitive enough or the first 2 phases of the game.
---
&gt;If someone is trying to play classic wow for the long haul they need to find a guild that helps them save money for consumes by not wiping and clearing fast. 
---
This might be true to you as a individual, but is far from a factual statement. It’s very likely the majority of players that raid for the long term aren’t that concerned about clear speeds. It’s only the top 1% like me and presumably you that will have concerns for such things. 
---
&gt;Being on a shit server with inexperienced leadership like heartseeker is just a slow sinking ship.
---
Oh your agenda is showing. Imagine thinking that there isn’t experienced or competent enough raid leaders accross every server to handle the very simple raiding that is classic wow.
---
its a version of DM where you skip bosses in order to get better loot near the end of the instance
---
Seems fine if you ask me.
---
We’re a bit past the point of putting quotes around the words climate change now aren’t we? I mean let’s be real. You can not like Greta, but straight up ignoring science is something else.
---
lol wow, you human trafficked your sister in law's wow character.
---
Ive been in countless groups where the leader doesnt even seem to know the LFG channel exists, and is solely LFM in trade chat. By posting "Warlock LFG XYZ" ive received invites because another member of the party tells the leader to invite. If i see "LFM scholo" of course i will whisper the leader myself, but it would be foolish to sit around hoping for someone to post the exact thing im looking for rather than post a quick message stating what im looking to run.
---
Try seeing how long it takes a lvl 1 gnome to get from Gnomergan to IF lol

Upvote for one piece

You get more xp if theres more lower lvls, you lets say lvl30, your carry lvl60. And 5 other lvl 30's, basically more your lvl people compensate for the 60 carrying you, and you get more xp rather than you and the 60 doing it
---
Wow is not even a grind
---
They keep going up each time you respec just like in p1

Climate change is real but not the types of 10 year armageddon nonsense these people spew forth.

Useful in duels vs other casters. Also more trash buffs to purge if playing against a class with dispels.

FYI when you relearn Engineering, you don't have to actually do the Goblin Engineering quest. You just interact with the book in Tanaris.

Wait a second...Half Life 3, Warcraft 3: Reforged - there's a conspiracy going on here. Both of them have 2 words and the number 3. Something is fishy here and it's not the fish tacos.

Noob question: I have mysteriously lost Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer twice right after getting it, and I don't know how :( Both times, I saw the buff appear on me in Orgrimmar, thought DAMN, time to go mob grind!! and went to the wind rider master to fly somewhere, and noticed only a few minutes later the buff was mysteriously gone. How am I losing this buff? Can you not fly with it? did I accidentally replace or cancel it somehow? Feelsbadman.jpg
---
Fun to do for some sure, it's not fun to watch. Nor particularly impressive.
---
Dampen magic has some uses solo and in PvP. Amplify is much more niche and if you’re saving for mount it’s an easy spell to cut.
---
Banishes
---
Yeah but I don't consider 1 year "long term" for a baby that lives to 5 years.
---
lol, a shaman did this to my warrior the other day. He was grinding near where I was and I think he was just trying to help me finish a mob (I was at low health) and he zapped me instead. He apologized and didn't seem to want to fight after that so I let it go.
---
Semi-common scam in OSRS is to give a medium level player the login for a high level player. If the victim transfers wealth over, the account owner recovers the account and the victim is SOL.
---
Wailing Caverns. Thank you
---
The heroes seem a lot rarer now too. Used to get 5+ per clear, now it's 1-2 tops. They dropped tons of the greens.
---
Precisely. All the shitposters and doomsayers kept proclaiming that the game would be "dead" just a couple weeks in....nope, still very much alive.
---
2 DOLLARS TO REGISTER IS NOT FRAUD !! Pay by Daily Paypal REGISTER AND TRY IT: https://rr.lovevova.com/NDUzOTE1MzI=
---
I hearth from ZF to gadget pretty regularly, yea
---
Yeah it happens, I wouldn't worry about it too much because it might have been something else. 
---
There's sometimes mobs that can purge a random buff from you and you might have aggro'd them, sometimes the opposing faction throws a random dispel/purge on you too so you never know what happened.
---
 
---
That being said, I've accidentally removed the wrong buff trying to dismount at least a few times.

I am a bit of a min maxer, and I love playing the auction house. So I literally view BoE's as a bag of money that can be equally used by any member of the party. I feel that everyone put in equal time to earn that item, and it can be sold and used by any member, for equal advancement as the person who can equip it right then and there. I really do not feel I'm selfish or being greedy. I just feel like not everyone plays that way or views items like that. It really doesn't feel right to just give 500g to one person that worked for it the same as everyone else. For some reason, people on the other side refuse to make the connection that a BoE like that can be turned into one for them. I truly cannot understand why that is. Its not a matter of me being greedy, its just how I view the situation. And if an item I truly desired dropped, yeah I'd be thrilled if everyone just gave it to me like that, but I don't think it'd be the right thing to do. I'm sure I'd still accept it, but everyone deserves a chance at it. It is equal progression for all in the end.
---
In 2019 we do.

Pre-flying I straight up couldn't stand Org.

It blows me away how anyone argues against IF being clearly the best city.

I've swam that way more than once for fishing and managed to miss them every time! Gotta keep an eye out the next time I pass there.

they def did a little ninja buff to dm:e satyr boss.
---
about 3 or 5 days ago 2 manned it religiously and my grounding totem every run had a huge window of time left to spare in between his sacrifices. Current runs his sacrifice sometimes barely starts casting by the time my grounding totem comes off of CD. 
---
Caught me by surprise when I went in the the other day expecting the usual sacrifice cd and nearly wiped to it lol. Had to start paying attention
---
Do 5 or 6 man runs just to rend/Jed. 
---
1 healer, 1 tank, 4 DPS, get at least 2 mages and it's a cakewalk you also get a freeroll on the truestrike shoulders if you need them. 
---
I have killed Baron near 60 times and have not gotten the cape yet as a rogue. I have spent over 30 hours in UD runs. I am also at 40 rend kills now also for the main hand. 15% drop on the cape supposedly. 3% on the MH. I'll be running these dungeons when Naxx is out at this rate. I feel like a GM is just hovering above me trolling the shit out of me it's nauseating how frustrating it is to have killed it 60 times and still not gotten it. Its approaching unbelievable territory.
---
The removal of layers has been the best thing to happen to Classic.
---
IF got raided twice, both times massive amounts of dead NPC's including the poor inkeeper.
---
Dozens of duelers always ready outside of main faction towns.
---
Banks are a massive hub, and you don't need to party with someone for a quick trade.

As a horde on Faerlina I'd have to help in some way after they helped me.
---
Zul Farak. Even though I was a Wraith baby, ZF was the first dungeon I ever did before LFD was a thing so finding a group in chat and going there on foot was fun. It was also the first time I tanked content in a group setting thankfully they were patient with me. ZF will always have they special feeling for me.
---
Nut unless you have a mount though
---
Yeah, when leveling BS TB is where it's at. Oh I need 1 more Solid Stone, good thing the AH is so close I don't even need to mount up...
---
I did it on nost all the way to 60. It was easy as shit. Just having the slightest bit of awareness of the state of your party and the positioning of the mobs is all you really need. But I’m not a smooth brain so maybe it’s harder for other people?
---
I’d keep tailoring because of bloodvine dropping in zg.
---
They are probably just going to assume you paid real money for it and ban you anyway.
---
144 runs tracked for my rogue friend i helped with roughly half of them. I had other guildies and we got in less than 12 runs uaually. Rng is rng
---
Farming GY and resetting is the fastest exp. People do not realize that to do this efficiently it requires a specific group comp and coordination.
---
But everyone watched a video or a steamer do it and think they are an expert because of so. This leads to a bunch of annoying people with superiority complexes arguing about who is more stupid when in reality they all are.
---
Half the groups I join that do this don't even explain what's going on. They just expect everyone to know and if they don't they'll just rage at them. There are multiple ways to do GY runs.
---
Or tradeskillmaster
---
Ah, chicken - truly the fish of the coop.
---
But how? Do you not put the chest in the not to be traded bit and they put the unlock on it? Like with enchanting gear, etc.? I've never actually had a rogue open anything, I just use blacksmith keys.
---
Any rogue player here that can give me some input is greatly appreciated.  
---
I am sword spec and wielding Vis'kag and Mirah's song. Yesterday I got Core Hound Tooth since there was no dagger rogues in the raid.   
---
Is Mirah's song or CHT better for sword spec? Is the sword 5% extra swing chance worth more then 11dps , faster attack speed for poisons and better stats? Also I am a human so sword skill comes into the mix.  
---
Might be a dumb question but dident find a good answer anywhere.
---
Think you're looking for /r/wow
---
Nope, sadly I wonder about holy nova tho
---
Get some other hit gear (tribute ring x2 or mara ring) and use BHB and HOJ
---
if pally is doing &gt;300 dps and regular features in the top five, don't see why they shouldn't roll
---
You know, I made a thread about this early on and got a lot of mixed feedback about it. Now I'm level 37 and still feel the same. Like I'm just grinding out to 60. Pretty tempted to just start doing some dungeon cleave to spice it up since that's quick xp and I feel like 38 to 40 is gonna take a long ass time
---
I actually did get help with my WoW addiction; some of those elite quests are pretty rough.
---
No, he fucked himself. This is 100% within OP's control. You know spell batching exists, you can play around it. If you don't, that's entirely your fault.
---
And by your own self admission, neither do you
---
I’m also curious about this. And I’m also wondering if just outright grinding mobs is quicker and more economically sound than questing since it cuts out the running.
---
I remember my first wife.
---
I started an escort quest without her, and received the divorce papers in the in-game mail an hour later. Married in SW cath and everything. Can't level a priest or pally anymore due to the pain of seeing where we became one.
---
I'm married to an orc now, things are way better.
---
Nobody I believe. Itemization gone wild

I grind mobs 1-2 levels above me and skin them. 37 now and hitting 38 gators in Swamp of Sorrows.

Very true. Ran some Jed runs and everything went so smooth it was a big guild on our realm and they were trying to get guys to come to mc

kinda new to auctioneer so maybe im misreading this

edit: wrong link

Double edit: so, I was dropped three times as a child. Don’t mind me.
---
The most optimal is grinding while you run, and only picking more optimal quests. Some aren't worth their XP, but most are.
---
Never heard the term jump shot in all the time I have played WoW. What does it refer to exactly?
---
It has to be more technical than just jump spinning and shooting when kiting I am assuming.
---
Mind if I ask, how old are you and your siblings?
---
I've killed at least a couple dozen players doing this in the mountain while waiting for my BRD instance reset timer.  So satisfyingly hilarious!
---
Tooth is definitely better than Mirah’s for off hand. With that kind of upgrade it is worth it.

That's a bolt of runecloth, the tailoring item. People buying at 1.2g want the raw runecloth, probably for reputation turn ins.
---
10 bolts of runecloth = 50 runecloth, or 2.5 stacks.
---
I have to admit that I was one that thought the game would die very rapidly. I was very wrong and now classic is the only game I've played in over a month. However it's still only been less than 2 months so I guess we will have to see how many people stay. I'm sure it will be fine.
---
Fake it til you make it?

looks rad - for the horde!

Teldrassil and Darnassus, it's just a really beautiful place. Its too bad that its so out of the way people don't have a reason to be there.

1 lvl lower = 20% less xp
---
1 lvl higher = 20% higher xp
---
I believe this is how it works or atleast how ive seen it explained. I believe it goes an additional 20% either way per lvl. But also take into account what you can grind efficiently. My pally can kill 4-5 mobs two lvls lower reasonably fast without much resources so when i grind thats how I go about it. The xp is important but so is down time
---
I think the entire dungeon is an homage to Goonies.

Thanks. I’ll try it after work.

"More Guildies" oof.

I was determined to have a Chill Kill Guild this time round. Been good.

After all these years I still have to ask a guard to find everything but the bank and the druid trainer.

Life tap should cause less damage with dampen but also return less mana.

As for amplify magic, I don't know.

Pretty easy for druids.

what happened to devilsaur spawns?
---
because one just ran up from the other side of the mountain and target it, and the other, i asked if they were waiting for it, they said no, and then tagged it anyway and then refused an invite.

For the fishing pole? It took me about 120 ha.
---
The Barrens!  I survived Barrens chat and lived to tell the tale!  ❤️

You mean levelling right?
---
Damn I hate the leveling on classic so bad, can't wait to be 60
---
You sure about that? The druid pvp set bonus would be pointless, and i dont remember that being a thing?
---
Tank that I ran scholo with wouldn’t use battle shout because it was a waste of his rage. He couldn’t hold aggro at all and kept blaming other people for pulling off him. What should’ve been a easy run with the group we had became a long session of wiping and replacing people every so often. The guy thinks he can tank which is funny because he think he’ll main tank for his guild which I know he won’t because he’s not a good player.
---
wow
---
Sweet thanks! I kinda thought that but I seem to always get stuck spending 85% traveling for quests that at my level 46 give around 3 to 4 k xp. That’s around 15 kills worth of xp at the most and I can kill 15 mobs in under 2 minutes.

That's because AH's weren't initially implemented in every city. Though in fairness they're in a pretty sizable building and there are four of them

What do people in a raid look at more? Overall damage done or Overall DPS?

Back in Vanilla I personally knew at least half a dozen people that had their WoW lives directly ruined because of Naxx.  Raid guilds with 100+ members online most of the time becoming casual guilds with 10 active players, guilds disbanding in heated, profanity filled screaming matches, people cancelling that never came back, it was fucked.  I’m 99% sure that I remember reading for a LONG time after launch something like 2% of the player base had cleared Naxx.
---
They have druidic magic tho
---
I prefer the female undead rogue backflips
---
I get what you're saying, but with the problem with Darnassus is that it just stands in sharp contrast to Ironforge and Stormwind. I actually quite dislike the layout of Stormwind in some ways, but at the very least equipment repair, basic trade goods, a bank, a mailbox, an inn, and the auction house are all very close to each other. Ironforge is maximum convenience and ease in layout basically, minus me often forgetting the specifics of what shop is where in the center. Darnassus by contrast has almost nothing easy about its navigation. I do in fact like the sort of semi-circle district split it has going on, but I'd be hard pressed to tell you any of the stores in order, I just would run in the general area til I see the right sign. Oh, and of course the ramps into stores aren't logically organized, they're all over the place always causing me to circle around even if I've been there 100+ times. The inconvenient water is a major drawback but the city has far more problems than just that.
---
Scarlet Monastery, ever since vanilla. First dungeon that i ran over and over and over.
---
BFD is not super far from the Ashenvale flight point. The biggest issue is most alliance players haven't gotten that flight point unless they leveled in Darkshore.
---
Hinterlands. :)
---
Improved Firestone best talent in the game - change my mind.

Coffee is gross

That's one of the perks I have with being absolutely brand new to WoW...I am having a blast, level 16 night elf druid and every drop I get im excited about even when an experienced player wouldn't bat an eye im sitting here like "look at it... just look at it!"... not knowing when what it is most of the time lol
---
Un'goro crater. It's like a hidden world that is filled with life above and below the surface. I also love that there is king mosh patrolling around.
---
Was polymorph healing in STV, but it only took polymorphing a warlock that was out of mana, out of health, and full of "kill-them-all" to stop me from doing it.
---
Unfortunate they wasted 45min+ to kill me once.
---
Rut'theran Village holds a special place.
---
Yeah I read that only 12 guilds cleared all of Naxx before tbc came out. It will be much different for Classic though. Since most of the guilds that plan on progressing already know what to expect.
---
Yeah that part was a joke. I’m lucky to get 16 truthfully.
---
Reminds me of my last Dead Mines broken run where the dwarf hunt lost his crab pet. It was a struggle but we made it and made fun of his crab the whole time.
---
Random affix is random.
---
This. I got ganked by 2 people in the yeti cave yesterday on my hunter while I was fighting a mob. They were both low when I came back and I killed the both of them. I dont think they were grouped since they respawned at staggered times and they took turns dying every time they respawned for like an hour until that stupid rod dropped for me from a yeti
---
And then I told the other guys in the cave that those two were hostile so they continued killing them after I left
---
If you act like a bitch, you die like a bitch. Several times.
---
Teldrasil, first zone I ever saw and the magic of it really drew me into the game.
---
I think Stormwind is the best city for medieval RP. Ironforge is cozy. Darnassus is beautiful but I mostly only go there as a mage or druid to escape the heat (druids can also get there easily via moonglade teleport). I love Thunder Bluff. Orgrimmar is ehh, and Undercity, although efficient, is just fugly, but that's zombies for you.

I had a shaman in my guild who would always spam LFM (DUNGEON) in gchat. I did some RFK runs with him for Corpsemaker and I was tank. He kept pulling ahead and pulling extras then yelled at a dps who accidentally pulled and told me that I should pull less (???)
---
That damn Druid

Meanwhile horde druids have a 9 minute flight back to Thunder Bluff. It would probably be 4 minutes if the fucking Windrider didn't swerve all over Kalimdor like a drunk 17 year old. Almost rerolled to Nelf just for this. Though it gives a good opportunity to take a quick shower, grab food, do laundry or other productive things so I guess it's alright
---
Well, Warriors are, anyway. But that's not the point. Tanks are not healers. Feral druids are not Resto druids. There's no crossover there. At early levels druid can play all roles, but later on, druid has to specialize. Same with Warrior. Dps builds are not tank builds. You cannot switch between the two except at extreme expense. There's no reason to expect one to do the other.

Hello, I had this happen to me and resolved it by right clicking my portrait and resetting instances. It dropped my raid ID as no bosses were dead.
---
This is 100% true
---
Most people grew up, man. If Blizzard wanted the game to be hard, they should have put harder monsters in the game.
---
I agree with you. I am a leather warrior and my only gameplay option outside of raids is to tank. Even with guildies ppl hate on dps war.
---
As a lvl 51 elemental shaman, which one is better?
---
Dreamweave circlet or eye of theradas?
---
Eye of theradas give me a bunch more int and stamina, but dreamweave is +22 spell dmg.
---
Kurinnaxx (pvp west coast) is pretty chill. Good population, good people.
---
It's gotta be Westfall, was and still is my favourite zone. I think due to the combination of quests leading up to The Deadmines and the feeling of fleshing out your character in the early levels with your first bits of gear and learning your primary spells/abilities.
---
What's a good populated server for alliance players that will likely last long compared to other servers? Gonna reroll since my current server doesn't have enough alliance for my taste. Was thinking Fairbanks or Incendius but I'm not sure.
---
This is resolvable by resetting your current instances by right clicking your portrait. It drops your raid ID if no bosses are dead :)
---
How do people take these 2004 style screenshots?
---
Yes wow is kinda bugged atm low levels will hit everything on skull players  ,npcs also.Not how it worked in vanilla
---
1.  Loot the chest.
---
2. Go to step 1.
---
Nah theres one in AB too

Why would people be there? They know it’s gonna burn down eventually. Terrible real estate.

---
It was good, it removed the thrill of getting gear though, but it's better than not ever getting gear. Getting a drop in classic was only good because how terribly sucky it was to miss out so many times.
---
I’m sorry. But why are we pretending there are any retail players that would have an excess of Classic gold to trade, for retail gold? 
---
Any half decent retail player doesn’t need gold in retail. Any self respecting classic player doesn’t either. Why would these trades even happen?
---
If you need a guide for this you probably have bigger problems
---
The southern side of Loch Modan. Green all around and an awesome backdrop of the lake behind you! Great spot for screenshots :)
---
So why would that have even been relevant here?
---
River below - Billy Talent or Satin in a Coffin - Modest Mouse
---
What about the first non realm only implementation around AQ times? It was just a glorified LFG chat with no teleport board but it was better than spamming chat.
---
Thanks for the heads up, I honestly didn't know that.
---
Teldrassil. I remember staying up all night leveling through that zone when I was a kid. The music is so peaceful and I feel it's one of the prettiest places on the map. Pure nostalgia for me.
---
I've had a warlock who was angry at me for healing him. (And no, I wasn't wasting mana while the tank was dying or something, I tossed some renews when I had mana to spare and I healed him when he was helfiring in the middle of a pack and was getting aggro. And he was so mad, like "priest wtf don't heal me I'm warlock, stop healing me u idiot" etc. Well, I stopped and he died within next ten seconds. Some people are just so fun to party with.)
---
But my experience as a noob tank was surprisingly good. I've always warned people that I've never been in the dungeon before because I hate it when people expect tank to lead the way, while I have no clue where to go. And I don't think I've ever met a group who've had problems with that. Maybe the reason was that I got to 60 pretty early and there were a lot of people who haven't seen these dungeons for 15 years or just like me started to play to late visit them. And now everyone is going there for 100th time and want fast run with an experienced tank in epic gear. 
---
But mages... Tank can't hold aggro? Let's pull more and aoe! Heal can barely handle one pack without going oom? Tank, stop being pussy and pull more! There're caster packs with heals and hexes with no good corner to LoS pull... tank, gather them all and let's aoe! What do you mean it takes longer to aoe 3 packs while they heal, you just noob, aoe is always faster! There are just two mobs and nothing else to gather for aoe... well, apparently some mages just don't put anything but blizzard on their action bars. I'm just trying not to be mad at people who obviously suffered some severe brain injury.
---
Kurinaxx has like 3x that at peak times
---
LOL your comment is frankly idiotic
---
After reading a lot of material on the subject I've been convinced that the best method for farming gold is to simply kill &amp; loot everything in an area while picking a set number of flowers. Then crafting potions to sell at peak raid times. With this strategy you will make a lot more steady gold than by grinding on mobs and selling lucrative items. If you don't have alchemy or herbalism, another way to make steady gold is by using Wowhead to figure out what items you can craft, from your professions, that are used in quests. Then build up a cache of those items to just keep reposting on the AH.
---
Meanwhile everytime i run dungeons as a tank there's one little shit making "zzz"s in chat and yawn emotes.
---
Like how if you didn't have Wrath of the Lich King and tried to get their via zeppelin it would just teleport you back to Orgrimmar instead of Northrend.

I was under the impression that Classic was released without API’s for auction house so the data wasn’t able to update independently? Essentially you’d need to do a scan every time you login for it to be accurate. I’ve noticed that even after doing a full scan with TSM next time I login it it tells me it hasn’t done a full scan and has no data.
---
I'm a level 54 Mage with Tailoring at 275 and enchanting around 255. I love tailoring, provided me with many gear upgrades and bags over the time and I just started producing mooncloth. It's fun. 
---
  Enchanting however isn't worth it I feel, sure I get some good stamina/int here and there and the speed bonus for the boots is awesome, but I feel like that's not nearly enough for what it costed me (and will cost). The amount of +dmg+agi+str enchants for weapons/gloves/boots/bracer really makes me wonder why I chose this profession as a mage. My warrior buddy is enjoying it more than I do! 
---
 I'm not 100% sold on dropping enchanting yet, but I wonder what would be the best alternative to it for me? Powerlevel engineering? Alchemy? Is there a silver lining for me to keep enchanting? At this point I am really tempted to just dump all my hodled dusts and essences in the AH and start something new.
---
 E: my current enchants are: 50 armor(back), +3 all stats(chest), +7 sta (bracer), +3 int (2h staff), +speed boots and that's it. That seems like really underwhelming value to me for a level 250 profession all things considered. Am I missing some usefull enchants I don't know of aside of riding skill for gloves?
---
This is why you play a mage, and set your hearthstone to feather moon.
---
Zul'farrak. Best dungeon in my opinion
---
Battlegrounds aren't in game for a long time unless I'm mistaken.
---
Why would you take hemmo or blade furry as PVP daggers... Thats just a huge waste of your energy, and points
---
Also never go hemmo, AND imp SS
---
If you take out blade furry, hemmo, and serrated you could get imp kick, for deathcoil blocking, and probably more useful talents unless you want to keep serrated for ARP
---
But honestly you're losing a lot to do this
---
Lethality to make your BS crits actually do more damage,
---
Relentless attacks for that big energy return after kidney/evis
---
And the obvious cold blood finisher
---
If you can counterapell real quick you may be able to keep the pack, put it on a mouseover macro. You can save your poly for a Nova resist. Still a little tough without ice barrier though.
---
No shit, but that post is still more credible than OPs which doesn’t even have a doctored GM’s name in it. The point is OP refuses to disclose the GM’s name that supposedly gave him this info. He’s obviously full of shit.
---
1 piece of leather 2% hit gear is acceptable and helps make sure you can hold threat better and generate more rage.
---
Why would I pay you to play your class? Pay me for heals, itll lower your repair bill.
---
Battlegrounds once they are released
---
Pretty sure they're client side in retail, or at least they're random between players. I've multi boxed with mages in Legion and I'd flip on one and they wouldn't on the other screen, but then they would flip on screen 2 on a normal jump on the main client.

---
So much this!  When I got the Feralas one I knew I shouldn't do it, because once I have done one of them I was going to want to finish them all for the pet.  I had done them all in Vanilla but on a PvE server and even then they were awful.  Now being on a PvP server I was pretty worried, so I figured I would try Feralas once, if it failed that would be the end.  When I got to the pack just before the ramp down to the water towards the end a pally comes running up to me and my first thought was "here it is, this is where the quest ends" turns out he was prot and was just being a bro and tanked the mobs for me while I killed them.  Then he escorted me the rest of the way in, and I am pretty sure he talked a group of alliance that just got off the boat out of killing me right before the end.  
---
I have made every effort to pay that act of kindness forward, I always help alliance that are struggling with some quests as I run by them now.  Unless they have done something to make my KoS list, then they must die.
---
I'm with this guy. I noticed that too. I deleted add-on after that

I'm sure you could make a weakaura that checks A: missing mana and B: the cooldown of potions being up.

I was in MC at 58 with my Pally and I got like 1% XP through it at best.

The 2h axe with shadow damage is worth ~50g on my server and the dagger is 100g+! Sorry don't remember the item names off the top of my head but they come from the trash mobs
---
Ok got ya so I should do swords if I get hemo?
---
No, you can absolutely solo this. It just requires a clever use of game mechanics.
---
TellmeWhen
---
Hey what server are you on? I'll start a toon. You just have to come play with me. I was thinking druid. Let me know the time and we can hang out in mulgore for an hour or two. You can kill mobs while I watch. Once you catch me up to your level we can enjoy the game and play together.
---
Me not that kind of genocidal orc
---
I think world first 60 hunter didn't buy his mount until 47. I'm guessing that it's still most optimal to walk/kill in a lot of areas given that.
---
It just feels like massive lag. That's my main issue with it. There's a few new people in my guild and I hear them complain about server lag when stuff like this happened. Not exactly great visuals on the leeway/spellbatching.
---
I just target the boss and heal with mouseovers
---
This happened to me... I messaged the buyer and said it was mistake. He kindly returned the item. 
---
I also suspect he didn't want attention brought to his sniper mod.
---
&gt; If you have high damage dealt but low DPS

Other way around?

It can go down like that for sure.

it's just part of how the game rewards networking.

Any quest in duskwood. The god dang low tree ceiling drives me nuts.
---
Every escort quest
---
Except it WAS a fucking private server thing, and the bads from there rolled it over to retail and are try Harding to get it accepted in classic.
---
Fuck that noise and all the scumbag bars that do it.
---
Agility&gt;intellect=stamina———&gt;strength&gt;spirit. 
---
- 1 agility = 2 ranged attack power
---
- 1 stamina= 10HP
---
- 1 intellect= 15 mana
---
As a hunter you should only look for those 3 stats. An easy way to do it while leveling up is to Add up the total values and pick the highest one (eg. Item X is +3 intellect +2 agility, item Y is +4 stamina +3 intellect). If you already have a lot of agility, item Y is the better choice.
---
The correct answer.
---
Layering lowered/removed
---
Nope, it's BoP. So you need to be a mage, and a tailor, and get the recipe.
---
Fuck em.  There’s still good tanks and I don’t need bad ones.

I've seen judgement of command used as a taunt, double damage when hoj helps.

As someone that couldnt sleep last night and tanked a smooth strat UD at 2am i can really relate to this comment haha

You dismount by right clicking off your buff? I wouldn't think anyone would choose that way to do it. Even if you're a clicker why wouldn't you just click your mount button again.

Stranglethorn Vale. It's where PvP'rs are forged.

Hey we had this issue yesterday evening did a trash mc farm with our guild and all 32 ppl got an id just for farming trash has anyone gotten some info? ticket still sits on 3 days wait time -.-

FYI, if you have the macro editor open, you can shift-click an item or ability in your spellbook, and it will paste the correct name at the current cursor position in the macro editor.

Lmao I literally came here to post the same thing

FYI how you counter this is to hold both mouse buttons at the same time - you'll move forward and can't be distracted by rogues.

---
Honestly pretty disappointed I picked hunter. Volley is buggy. Pet is buggy. Dps is solid now but falls off hard and people know it so like 3 hunters are being brought per raid. Good luck if you're a hunter and not buddies with anyone in a guild.
---
One thing I found joy in was soloing tribute runs. Got to go have some fun on my own for something that felt challenging and rewarding to me. Then they went and made that worse after already had in the first place, making it obvious they don't want us to do it.
---
No changes is already tossed out the window. Instead of Blizzard helping hunters out when they know they fall off they've been making us worse on top of already being buggy.
---
Layering has nothing to do with queues.
---
Grob has always been a full server.
---
What tools did you use?
---
Yeah you appear to be correct. So in order to make it work, the player selling the token would have to have enough retail gold to trade to the player buying it to make it work. Either way, it's definitely not at all in the spirit of classic, where earning gold meant more than you had more irl money than the next person.
---
Snipers aren't against the rules.
---
I started doing Emberseer 4 man runs (it’s smoother/quick with 5 — but, more comp).
---
I tank as feral, and bring 2 players that need Truestrike. If they drop, whoever wins the roll pays the healer 30g. Can clear and reset in just under 20min. With 5 you can ride the reset timer — but it’s more competition.
---
I’ve still only seen one pair in about 30 runs. Yet it seemed like everyfuckingone and their alt in IF are wearing them. I don’t get it.
---
&gt; Anyone that thinks charging into mobs around other mobs is a bad player.
---
Holy crap, I cannot stress this enough. I have always played a healer in every MMO I've ever played, and every bad tank I've ever met has a mentality problem, not a skill problem.
---
Even the worst tanks usually only have trouble controlling multiple targets. Maybe the LoS me by accident. Sometimes they don't notice that a mob has escaped or spawned on the mage, but gosh dang they've got great threat on that one guy they're focused on.
---
All of that is fine.
---
But when the healer says "stop charging and pull them with your bow", and you charge them anyway, you're a shit player.
---
Got lucky
---
They finally catered to the asshat no layer players and were stuck with overpopulated bullshit now.
---
Levels 30, 24, 23, 22, 15, 10, and 8 checking in!
---
That seems like something to do when I'm bored and level 60 :)
---
I dismount using a macro, the icon, the hotbar or a hotkey.
---
Just depends on how distracted I am, and what I'm doing or whatever.
---
Walking never feels slower than at lvl 39
---
Duskwood, one of the greatest quests hubs in classic/vanilla WoW that I could do over and over again
---
not feeling like it often entails not getting a dungeon because tanks dont want to tank pugs.
---
Why would you raid until 1am? You can easily clear the content on 2 raid days with 3 hours per day.
---
sure it's always been a full server, but like I said, I haven't seen a queue since launch. Theres no way enough people are on to fill the server. Out of my guild of 80 people only me and one other person still play. Seems like they must have lowered server size to save cost once people stopped playing. Just a guess though.
---
STOLEN: Smithing Tuyere and Lookout's Spyglass
---
This one, easily hands down. It's like a 5% drop rate, on a specific mob that only 5 of them spawn, on a long respawn timer. And it's for both factions making it hell on a pvp server. Only quest that's taken me multiple hours to do.
---
It's a reference to stranger things season 1
---
Sounds like they WILL take action VS the scammer, but you will NOT get that gold back.
---
Often isn't always, I've had plenty of successful pugs. Not always, but plenty of times. Sometimes you just don't feel like not playing main spec. And that is FINE.
---
Lesser healing potion
---
Get as many crafts as you can while few people have the recipe. 100-200 will sell alot.
---
but why would layering effect queue? same amount of people on the server.. .just all on one layer.
---
yes immersion is good but that's just too anoying because of the soul shard cost
---
it sure is, as long as you understand sometimes its your fault the group doesnt happen.
---
Stonetalon, burnt area that leads to desolace

Been doing this on an alt while i watch tv/twitch/etc...i do mobs that are -2 to -4 off. I find easier is faster. 28 hours level 25 so far minimal rested and this is very very few quests.

Hi dasGimmick, let me bring this up with the developer and get back to you.

Edit: This is the reply from Cixi (developer):

The addon works on events from any eligible channel indeed. mostly the global channels (general/lfg etc) and also custom channels (/join blah).
---
Hope this answers your question!
---
Sitting on Lv 70 maxed out AZ is such a relief now I just log in for a plus 10 for the week
---
Hopefully he does the same thing one day and the cycle continues.
---
He got red pilled and it caused internal bleeding.
---
Feralas - the music, atmosphere and art are all wonderful.
---
You’ll basically have to play mornings to have a shot, imo.
---
But once they are implemented, have a macro that is /who blasted lands and another that is /who azshara. Click them as much as you care to and when you still the zone pop spike...get moving.
---
If your engi, tell the raid lead that when you ask for the invite and say you’re bringing sapper charges to help contest.
---
Looks like a collectors item to me

This is braindead easy. Picked up tailoring on my mage because tele darn makes this less then 5 minutes for easyyy gold.

The Legend of Fucking Stalvan.

Talk to 10 fucking people across 4 different zones who all spawn a stupid ghost, just so you can kill the creepy pedo next door neighbor.

At one point the clerk in Darkshire literally asks you to talk to someone 10 feet away who you can see while he gives you the quest. Fucking shout it out the door bro, I’m sick of talking to you assholes.
---
Only totems I have on my actionbar are Grounding, Mana spring, tremor, earthbind, str of earth. searing, magma, and fire nova.
---
Those are the ones I use for questing/pvp, then i have healing stream/stoneclaw in a corner for when i want to mine or heal.
---
None of these are ofc keybound as im too lazy and already have the reflex down to klick on them.
---
Yo! I might be your dude. I'm on bigglesworth ally, but tbh it depends on how much you're looking for.
---
Yeah I see posts from rogues that are on like 50-100+ runs to get their dalrends or hoj etc, and I just think how much time they've wasted. Rogues can make pretty good money doing pickpocket runs, then just buy the drop for yourself. Gives you a flat number to work towards, so you actually feel like you make progress too, rather than just running in and hoping for rng to be nice to you, titanforging style. Gold is the most consistent thing to farm in the game, might as well put it to use right? 
---
It is unfortunate for some classes and specs that can't farm gold, but even then it would quickly get to the point where levelling a mage, using it to farm gold then buying drops for your main is faster overall.
---
Yeah, the other way around works so much better, especially if you’re pretty good at healing (understanding 5sr etc). I love healing too but the worst part has been waiting for tanks. It takes longer than some of these dungeons...
---
that looks legit though, but its hard to get those item. Well done man
---
And this is why I want to eventually role alliance, and this only.
---
Well tbf hunters have some of the best pre40 mobility in the game.
---
Every single undead rogue I've joined a dungeon party with will jump alliance at the instance entrance. Every. Single. One.
---
At what level should I be able to comfortably start dpsing dungeons instead of healing? I'm noticing that now, around lvl 54, people are straight up ignoring me when I offer to heal a dungeon because I'm shadow spec and not holy, but I'm not confident enough to offer myself as a DPS because I'm worried about my damage output
---
Nice job homie, keep at it and do a redrawing for us next year to show off your progress.

Yeah, not only does he do podcast, his pod is consistently top 10 in the US.
---
That's not genre-specific top 10. That's all -around, competing with things that aren't remotely the same genre. He does almost exclusively long-form interviews (1-3+ hours).
---
I skip a lot of them (comedians I don't know/don't like and his UFC stuff), but try to catch all the social/political/scientific/etc ones. He really does try to be... non-partisan, though he doesn't really pretend to be non-biased, which means he catches flak from both sides for giving "the bad people" a platform, or being a "commie" or whatever.
---
He's also into bow hunting, the keto diet, hallucinogens, and UFOs. The amount of ground that podcast covers is insane.

Try running only 1 monitor to test that. Also look info your graphics card app (geforce or radeon) a setting in there may limit it
---
Oh, this brings me back. Thank you for reminding me of this gem!
---
Damn. And I thought I was pissed when I put a lvl 25ish Something of the Eagle belt on the AH for 70s buyout. But the bid was auto-populated to like 10s.
---
So someone bid on it and got the belt for 10s instead of what I was hoping for.
---
I was pissed at myself.
---
But I now have a clearer perspective after reading your mistake. Suddenly my little low level problems dont seem so bad.
---
Not buying that for a second sorry man.  Let’s just say you made *half* that money on bandages.  And let’s say best case scenario everyone lost money by selling them for vendor price.  You would have had to buy 20,000 silk cloth or about 300g worth of cloth pre level 40 to turn over 100g.  Also, this would take about 8 hours of crafting.  
---
Calling bs.  Nothing more to add
---
I have been tanking since BC, the one thing that make me lost faith in a group in classic: tank(me) charge, demo, sunder "skull", tab sunder "x", then third mobs and fourth mobs just running to range cuz they have to dots everything first... I once ask a warlock not to dots the third mobs on pull, his response is "if you can't hold aggro on dots, you bad tank".
---
I’ve been listening to it while I drive around town. It is very well done.
---
You use heroic strike on the offhand swing. So mainhand swings white, queue HS for the offhand swing. This gives the offhand a higher chance to hit since it’s a “yellow hit” and negates much of the miss penalty of dual wielding.
---
And yet here they are, members of the alliance...
---
At first I 100% thought for sure that what it could be til I remembered nothing else is acting this way. I want to say it's an issue with classic I'm not seeing but could also because just the perfect horrible mixture to.
---
Been tanking through all the Star Trek shows, myself. I'm nearing halfway through DS9.
---
and Exodar
---
But he still answers the question.
---
You see, you have these things called shouts....
---
Unless you use agi gear.
---
Because it's harder.  More pressure, mistakes cause deaths, all the responsibility and no extra reward.  
---
I'll always dps instead if I can, because it's more fun. 
---
Lots of warriors are sick to death of dragging pugs thru 5 mans by the time they are 60.
---
&gt;We could kill Sylvanas in the same place that Arthas did.
---
Dude, I love that idea.
---
Oh yeah I like when I'm on my warr. I'm just grinding a little camp of maybe 15 mobs but with a fast enough spawntimr the pulls are nonstop.
---
Then comes Mr mage. He pulls all the mobs and aoes them. Sits down to drink for a second Then mounts up and runs away.
---
So I'm just left sitting there for 5minutes waiting for respawns. Real nice.
---
I just transitioned into killing camps with casters since pummel makes short work of them.
---
Bear and bird for druid of the talon and druid of the claw from wc3
---
Don't mind those fools. Tanks are unappreciated yet everybody needs them, yet barely anybody wants to let you learn and of course the only way to learn is through experience. It's a vicious cycle. Keep up the good work.
---
🤔 I can’t think of anything other than potions. It said immune or what when you attacked?
---
I've come to the conclusion that warlocks are basically a support class like the shaman. Except you aren't frowned upon for wanting to dps instead of healing. If you want to be an Elemental shaman, roll warlock.
---
Looks to be a fun fake type of ad to be a real ad for the Midsommar film?
---
That's like saying "I drink alcohol and I'm fine so alcoholics aren't a thing".
---
If you've ever seen someone deep in the grip of gambling addiction.. well yeah. People rob their workplaces, steal from loved ones, *sell their children*. Gambling is horrible when the claws sink in, even if most of us don't have that problem.
---
I have a bartender bar that is just 4 rows of 5 (or 6 don't remember). Each row for one totem category. So i have like: fire totems on the upper bar, below it is the earth bar, then water and lastly air. I dont even know where I would store 20 totems spells else.
---
Yeah but they don't have Engineering trainers either so are we REALLY basing anything on the stuff a Tauren doesn't understand
---
I just don't get trolls at all.  What are they even good for.  My distate for their asthetics aside,
---
Mage or rogue?  UD
---
Hunter or Shaman?  Orc
---
Warrior?  Anyone else
---
Getting ganked doesnt bother me.
---
Even so, there's many areas where you can be fighting mobs while moving/regenerating resources pretty consistently.
---
Warlocks in particular can dot kite.
---
Immune, and it resembles the pally bubble. but I can still blind or sap
---
It's look like without the mirror it works fine in full screen, still odd that a lot of other games including retail function no different after some tweaks. Hopefully I can find a way to get this to function with the cloned monitor for stream/recording, using the alternative of having the capture card capture an obs preview looks cruddy and choppy.
---
The difference is heart surgery is something that cannot be allowed to go wrong. So you definitely don't want someone who doesn't know what they're doing. But obviously, even surgeons still at some point had to do their first surgery.
---
There's no problem with someone saying "well, this is my first time" when it comes to something that isn't a big deal if it goes wrong.
---
Exactly what I was looking for thanks!
---
When your partner wants to do something to the exclusion of all else, including spending time with you, that sucks. A lot. Doesn't matter what it is, or even if you enjoy that thing as well.
---
I'm surprized how many people dont explore the actual WORLD of warcraft :0
---
Have you seen how the average mage plays? You got 2 seconds to grab the pack before they start to aoe.   It is by far the harder role in a dungeon.  I've played them all extensively and you clearly have not
---
our productivity software alerted is that you take 10 minutes in breaks every day. you're not allowed to spend so much time in the bathroom. better wear a diaper.
---
Depends on your class, killing time, and time to heal back up. Ideally you want fast kills, and only losing a little HP per kill so that you don’t need to wait to eat or even bandage. Realistically you’ll need to factor bandages in. For a warrior this might be -2, for a mage or hunter even levels.
---
If you have a slow enough MH, aka.. dal  rend.. you can usually que Heroic strike and instead of unqueing it, use rage for blood thirst or WW to invalidate the Heroic strike que. 
---
If you have a swing timer you just need to be slightly more on the ball about cancelling it if you're going to clip into a BT or WW. Otherwise you can just build rage and use 40rage as your zero point instead of zero and have room to fail.
---
Teleport to Moonglade and it's a short, free flight to Darnassus.
---
I find my bag always 60% full as tank warrior(threat set/fr set), so I rarely have bag space while dungeon tanking to keep food. I always ask for food if we have mage, but toss it before over cuz bag space. I do bandage/eat after a rough pull, but most healer will bring my hp to almost max before drinking.
---
Your ex wanting a kid in her early 20s is ouch. You’re lucky you can waste your life on wow with us losers now too

Some guild raids start at 9-10 PM est.

If they plan to keep it WoW Classic they arent ever adding race changes.

Warriors are arguably the best dps in the game so...

The park in Stormwind. I had never seen it before.

I've only ever read about people bothering to do that haha

Underrated comment. This mindset is boggling.

Yeah I said if it fails to sell

Classic was a cold war. It wasn't really until wrath when things escalated because of the wrathgate.
---
Embrace the gnome
---
6 is my all times best. Congratulations.
---
Winterspring. It's so bright and calm. Wraps up the journey of leveling, you have to really earn your way in due to the tunnels being hostile by default.
---
if you can keep your group from getting threat with just demo and challenging shout every 10 min, then something is wrong.
---
this may happen at low levels, but not at 60
---
Fiery is way cheaper.
---
I believe at the time (2 weeks ago-ish) I paid 50g in mats, and 15g for tip, so about 65g-ish.
---
I was around level 30 and had built myself quite a little stash (maybe 30g) just from playing the ah here and there. I was stock piling cloth for when it eventually was needed and one day with only a handful of auctions for it I decided to make my move.
---
I put on 30 stacks of silk cloth for 44s each (which was the cheapest). But not even 30 minutes later someone was already lowballing me. I was under the impression you got the deposit back even if it didn't sell.
---
When my auctions expired i had sold one stack.
---
That really bothered me for a few days lol but lesson learned.
---
Now I don't list more then 2 stacks of ANYTHING.
---
What addon is that for the bar on the top of your screen? The one that shows the gold? Also, just wondering why you didn’t do the last part, where you pull the final boss, iceblock and let all the enemies come to you?
---
Enchanting is more about making money than improving your own character. Most people don't want to sacrifice a profession for a costly profession, so they have to pay those that are willing to.
---
Because trinkets make mages slightly weaker. Was that not implied in my posts?
---
Oh, well it seems I need to visit the opticians to get an eye exam.

\*Imagine the lag\*

Most of the time more poeple in og on zt anyway!

The spider venom quest in LBRS.

I mean 5 weapon skill is pretty huge pve wise
---
I go to Valley of Trials on my alli lock and cast max rank CoR on low level mobs that are just being engaged by a horde player.
---
&gt;can you imagine the shit show if they tried to have racial classes? My God. There would be some not played at all classes (unless they were all the same thing, but just named differently).
---
I wish they had done this from the start. Give alliance dwarf shaman and the horde tauren sunwalkers to counter the paladins. Before someone says something dumb like "tauren paladins are sunwalkers you R tard" what I mean is they should have been to the paladin what allied races are. Same spells and mechanics and talents but different names and skins on spells and stuff.
---
Maybe if we get a classic+ they'll do something like that.
---
Sounds like the retail people has reached 60.
---
My favourite place in classic is Blackrock Depths.
---
It's a huge sprawling city and it FEELS like it. You can actually get very lost in there, and everything interacts with other things in fun ways. I love how there's a sense of mystery even now -- I often have to look up how the bar works and I have completely forgotten how to get to the Emperor and how to get access to princess' loot table. It's a wonderful place, and I adore it.
---
Don't let him learn about questie.

It should say absorb though, not immune.

Man I gotta get in on that...will report any findings

This is why all rogues are kos

sorry, im tired and at work and im still confused.

Rogue unlocks it

Whoever wins, gets whatever is in the chest. Those items are all covered by the pre-roll.

No compensation for the rogue.

Honestly idgaf what rule you use, as long as it's clear and everyone in the group agrees. That's the main thing.
---
West fall. It’s where I started to really understand what the game was about.
---
Tbh it’s a boring af dungeon and I’ve never been able to pinpoint why. The long pauses during the rend event maybe? As a healer the whole run feels like a chore but I love dungeons like scholo
---
Rank doesn't affect mana cost of the spell, try again sweetie
---
Bob.
---
Ahh just like classic.
---
So your saying basic PVE world of Warcraft roles are difficult...
---
He doesn't play WoW, and he underestimated just how into this game I get.
---
I love the unique priest racial spells. More classes need that. Hex from retail could have been a troll exclusive shaman spell for example.
---
I believe you are looking for r/wow
---
Rez has the same mana cost for every rank.
---
Grinding the harpies in NW feralas was excellent XP for me. Easy to kill mobs, high density, and dropped cloth to make bandages for healing
---
Probably did I'm just used to pally bubbles saying immune so guess its planted in my head.
---
Now I know to break the shield instead of running around like an idiot lol
---
I heard every time you flex that you are horde your dick shrinks by 1inch. So I guess you got what 2feet inverted now?
---
The addon name is called Titan panel, also the reasons I didn't kill mobs in boss's room are:
---
1. Room is too small to kite mobs
---
2. The last time of iceblock cannot afford gathering all the mobs together
---
3. Alts cannot take exp/loot in that position if u wanna carry them.
---
With a 60 second cooldown (45 second talented halfway in Prot).  
---
Any class with any amount of hard-cast cc can pretty much control a paladin long enough to just right click a node--since Paladins don't have an interrupt in Classic, all they have is the long stun and grenades.
---
again, the amount generated is nothing compared to consq. the actual aoe tanking tool.
---
and if anything, you do one BS, then spam demo

Yeah once I got my prebis, it was nice to just log off and play something else and basically raid log for a few weeks after the big grind. Was actually super refreshing to log off and feel like I genuinely wasn't in any worse off of a spot if I just didn't log until for 5 more days until raid

Alliance does have this Light of Elune,[Light of Elune](https://classicdb.ch/?item=5816)  consumable, only one per char, quest reward in Ashenvale.

Did the barber shop include facial changes or was it strictly hairstyle? I feel like hairstyle changes don’t damage the guidelines you mention
---
I'd rather them make a necromancer spec for death knights instead of making a brand new class for it. In fact instead of a new class or race I'd rather them add a 4th spec for each class. Except druids they don't need a 5th spec. Give me shaman earthwarder tank spec. Death knight necromancer caster spec. Battle mage melee spec. Ect.

PVP or PVE? Do you care about RP servers?

He has sullied the HONOR of the HORDE!

I have sent a tell to Thrall reporting this behavior. In the meantime Kierwybn1990, noble defender of the Horde, you avenge this betrayal.

Un'goro Crater!

But blizzard like money so maybe it will still happen :p
---
Nah.  Meters keep ticking while dead or doing no damage so your DPS plummets if you die unless it's at the end of a fight.
---
Just pug the other dps or join a guild to run with cool people. If you did do ,just 3 I'd have druid tank, pally heal, and you fury dps.
---
were all drones on stims anyway, without any pylons

Heh heh, you've never been more wrong in your life, now get downvoted noob!

I read this in an orcish voice
---
Well, it's more lively than retail Darnassus.
---
Grats! Now you will have some time to clean up your frames
---
Originally just hair. Now everything. Barbershop is against the core design of classic wow though.
---
imagine not selling all that for real money
---
People say this, but the real problem is usually gear. Take two gathering professions (suggest mining and skinning or herbing and skinning) so you can have some money and then buy same level weapons on the AH. Keeping your gear up to date makes warriors able to fight same level and +1 mobs easily all through leveling (source: am level 53 warrior). Open with charge, throw on a rend at the start, and then sunder armor to 50%. You can heroic strike as a finisher if you want but don't spam it unless you have a lot of rage to blow, it's an expensive ability. Keep battle shout up and drop a demo shout on a mob to reduce the damage they do and thus decreasing your downtime.

Holy cow is it actually still good early 50s? I figured it’d drop off. Pyramid fight is a nice continuous stream though

Can Mature Blue Dragon Sinew drop even if you don't have leaf yet? I'm thinking of farming blue dragons in Winterspring for the Sinew until I get leaf if that's possible.

Thanks for the info, about number 3 though, I’m curious why alts or carries can’t get xp/loot?

Ive only done this at SM and BRD \*sweats profusly\*

Its from one piece
---
I think it's because the first half does not need 10 people, but the second half kinda does.
---
I know this is kinda poking fun but here's a serious answer:
---
The problem is they don't know what that is. Even if you say "Corporate Manager for the Finance Department Account's Receivable team" they have a GUESS of what you do. 
---
If your job interviewer was a hard core raider and had context for what you're talking about this 100% could help you. It's just most job interviewer's have no idea what you're talking about when you say those words.

Server transefers are only available from certain high-pop servers to certain low-pop servers. Go through the process [here](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-free-character-migrations/285602) to see if they're available for your realm, but they don't let you switch from PVP to PVE or vice versa, the paired servers they let you transfer to are all of matching types.
---
This reminds me of that post I saw on reddit. It was a picture of a phone wall jack and someone was asking why the ethernet port was so small.
---
Hinterlands.  Regardless of how empty the zone is, my fondest memories of early wow were questing in that zone.  So pretty.
---
idk man. wow graphics are kind of unique and I think they are really nice. if it becomes like this it would be feel so weird
---
My first time tanking was rather different, I thought I was doing quite badly, kept losing aggro to the warlock, I kept apologising for doing smaller pulls because I wasn't comfortable with large ones, everyone was telling me how great I was doing lol, probably because it would have taken so long to replace me. We completed the dungeon with no wipes, just probably took nearly twice as long as experienced tanks.
---
This sort of attitude is what drives classic wow to become retail.
---
It's pretty sweet when they get desperate and try inviting you again.
---
I never had to kill them. There were tons of scorpions all around the zone.
---
Can't get the shield to drop for the life of me but I don't hate.  It's a pretty fast dungeon at least, 45 min or so if your group is solid.  There isn't really anything fun about it though and the event definitely takes too long, playing with your guild good time to joke around though.  Probably just depends who you run with I guess.  Get organized guild runs in discord you'll probably hate it a little less.
---
Dun Morogh - I fell in love with the zone when I first created a character in vanilla. Beautiful scenery, interesting quests and it's quite large.
---
At least technically strength increases attack power for clothies.  This is literally unusable.
---
One of the videos on YouTube about scrapped Vanilla content I think.

I don't remember which one.

Looks like David Ortiz.

The edge of the middle tooth for the entrance to Onyxia. Its a fun challenge to see who can get the closest to the edge without falling and dying.

I logged on to retail, flew as high into the air as possible and uncounted. Then I got back on classic and felt better.

Anyone have any information on what percent of spellpower/healingpower moonfire, rejuv, and other druid primary spells use?

Best I can do is equal 9

I had a friend back during the days of vanilla wow that had a Murlaco's tacos t-shirt, with the menu on the back of the shirt. I think most of them were fish tacos so that's why I think they taste fishy.

I fucking lost it holy shit that was beautiful.
---
Would you say that you can do this as any warlock? I'm trying to be lazy and just play as raid spec, but if going for affliction or even sl sl you could ostensibly steal aggro back and forth because of how OP the elite demon is. Would be interested to watch another video if you compared different common builds to see if it's worth the cost of changing specs. Missing the 4th dot as destro could make this more painful, maybe limit you to 5 runs.
---
Have you used \`/fl ah\` with AH window open to scan all prices?

Try to test this with a clean log and one item that has a higher AH value, see if AH profit changes accordingly.

Power of the horde.

Do the flight master. Also possible with a warlock's voidwalker.

At least as the tank when it eventually does, its yours. But yeah it doesnt help that drak has a huge loot table. I think the harder item to farm is the brigam girdle which you have to compete with dps wars for

The difference between a yellow and a green is something around 40-60 mobs at level 20.
---
It's not so much the level as it is the mob. You want the squishiest mob possible.
---
Interesting. I could see this showing the mana and  hp pot range (Light opacity next to lost hope/mana) to show where it would fill of specific potion
---
Best combo is Viper MH and Tail spike oh.
---
The vast majority of your damage is your MH attacks and your abilities...which are based on your MH. Viper is going to out perform Wingblade by a sizable margin.
---
You can't use Wingblade in your OH so tailspike it is. The dps difference between it and wingblade will not really be noticeable.
---
You either can play ball or you do something that matters = WoW
---
Tradeskillmaster. Auctioneer on steroids.
---
Agreed. Leveling is my favorite part of WoW and I love Classic WoW because the leveling experience feels like a real-world journey.
---
It’s getting to 60 and grinding rep for some obscure faction I don’t care about, or running MC over and over to be one of eight people rolling on an item that has a 10% chance of dropping I don’t care about. Your chances of getting that are 1.25%. You could easily run MC 100 times and never get the one item you’re there for. 
---
Some of the leveling dungeons are the coolest too. Deadmines, Shadowfang Keep, Uldaman, Zul’Farrak, Maraudon, Sunken Temple, BRD, all super cool
---
This was my thinking exactly and if it were ever implemented this should be the only thing available
---
You should only be focusing on Agility.
---
Yeah. I hate how some people claim that leveling will make or break you.
---
Like, nah. Farming a dungeon for one item 100+ times, that's the shit that will get to you.
---
And you're right, the early days of being a 60 suck. You have trash gear, and you have most of your bis list to go. It's just so much easier when you've gotten some of those items.
---
Congratulations! That’s really cool.
---
We have since wiped on trash back to back, because we can no longer concentrate haha
---
My only experience with it was in wrath which is what I was thinking
---
WoW, Thank you for your answer. 
---
In the meantime, I had a complete different Problem. The Addon keeps disappearing each time I restart the game. Its like its completely deleted from the addon folder.

It has that early acces indie pixel art roguelike vibe

Niiiice

Bro, are you me?

Not if the server collapses first
---
Make another one called 'Alarmsystem' and shadow in front of the bank goblins.
---
It is, especially because it is half of us and half pugs and they are as excited about being a part of it as we are. Which is something I never saw in retail. Incredibly awesome moment.
---
retail REEEEEE
---
So hurry up with the damn croissants
---
Have they changed the behavior of the demons for Rhok'delar within the last few days? Tried to follow several guides but for example Simone's pet no longer resets and Soleno keeps evading the moment you try to kite him around a corner.
---
That would make sense. If you take 10 to do a full run the first half is boring and by the time rend is over everyone just wants to get out
---
WoW is a reskin of Everquest.  Change my mind.

You did not break a rule. You were provoked.  You just took time taking your revenge

Scarlet Monastery. So many runs through all the wings of that wonderful dungeon.

"The one in the duskwood area" could be any of 4 of the Green Dragons: Lethon, Taerar, Emeriss, and Ysondre.

The other green dragon spawn locations are Hinterlands, Ashenvale, and Feralas.

If it can be bought and sold for X amount it has a value of X amount.

To note: If you're going to pick me up on a simple typo I'm guessing you have nothing else to add.

Played with a guy who said he was DPSing at a lvl 32+....he was at most mid 20s in lvl...he was also a mage LOL.
---
oh shit i never realized the bank was a bear. nice.
---
My friend and I leveled together at launch, hit 40 a few days in. We both managed to make around 100 raw gold each by just doing quests and every dungeon along the way. It is honestly not too hard to make money leveling if you don't buy anything.

It's not broken, mine works fine.

Out in The Barrens, the music and the atmosphere are amazing!
---
BoE-s are not worth more than you can sell them for. That's the point. They are completely subject to market demand. There is no price ceiling for BoE-s as there is for BoP-s. 
---
If BoE are truly more valuable to people than the market price, then why isn't everyone buying BoE-s once they have the money? Why are there so many people, who would never buy a BoE from the AH, but should it drop, then they frantically scream that it's an upgrade they're entitled to roll on and that every non-user should pass/greed it.

Yeah I had a dream where I was trying to get through those doors from the outside, we managed and there was a weapon rack for us to gear up in the storage room where we got in.

Yeah that looks about how I remember it from vanilla
---
Excellent.
---
Fuck them for? People not wanting to visit darnassus ? Blizzard has nothing to do with this

Shadowfang Keep!

I've saved people's lives and had them heal up and and kill me. In fact I rarely come across people who don't immediately try to kill me. I've never opened up on a single person unless it's revenge. Leveling a warrior has been hell.
---
Un'Goro Crater
---
It's a window into the past, a rare place where evolution stopped and you can encounter ancient dinosaurs.
---
I think the core issue you don't get is that the item does not have intrinsic immutable value (or at least, you pretend like it does only when its convenient). It is purely situational: either it holds the AH value, or the combat utility value + vendor value - both are mutually exclusive
---
You should attempt to apply your logic to things outside the game world. You would lose half your assets very very quickly.
---
&gt; If you ninja it from them, you have +200g, they will have to buy it for 200g. That makes you a 200g richer and them 200g poorer,
---
&gt; and they actually have that item worth 200g.
---
So have they gotten poorer by your estimation or not?
---
&gt; Imagine if your very rare bop bis item dropped and the hunter in your group demands you pay them 200g or they roll need on your item, would you say that makes the hunter greedy or does he equally deserve something from your drop?
---
It would make him stupid.
---
In purely fair loot system, indeed he would deserve something from a drop. This is in fact what all groups are constructed on - the premise of mutual benefit. Instead of gold, this "something" consists of the form of assistance in completing the dungeon and obtaining his own drops that he values above vendor price, which is presumably something he cannot do alone, or at least not without significant time loss. 
---
Indeed, since its pretty impractical to implement an auction system for drops, we rely on other things to ensure rational loot allocation. Such as an implicit contract to mutually maximize the value of our drops. In general, breaking this contract for short term gain is not generally considered a long-term good idea, and honoring this contract leads to mutually beneficial arrangements down the road.
---
Grats!!!
---
... no?
---
Just take the max time waiting for the tram and the minimum time waiting for the tram (it leaves immediately) and take the middle.
---
Dalaran in wotlk. The music was my favorite and the sewers were also cool.
---
Is it bad I know 90% of your gear just by looking at this?
---
Just play the game? It's right in front of your eyes.
---
&gt; I got defensive and angry at her.I told her that if she wanted me to quit WoW then I wanted her to give up visiting her friends; that she had to stop reading books, stop her painting, stop playing piano, stop shopping for boots she never wore, stop going to the movies, stop watching TV, stop having any fun outside of seeing me.
---
Uhh, I know what sub this is and that this comment isn’t going to go over well, but that’s six hobbies, two of them creative, that she had that stood in for one of yours (seven if she was playing Maple Story during this time). It sounds like she was well rounded and for you it was just WoW. It’s great that you found a solution that works for you, but the advice that WoW (or any game) is a healthy stand-in for all of that is not good advice.

Undercity
---
Dun Morogh. Most peaceful place in WoW
---
I feel that way about Guilds who insist upon you logging in every week to do a raid that usually ends up as a fail. And a waste of 4 hours of my life. I enjoy playing at my own pace.
---
For me it's Ironforge, I love this city, the way it's designed, the music, everything!
---
As an undead warrior I deeply relate to this post.
---
Still gonna burn your tree tho
---
It's BIS for a warrior...
---
Going to provide your server details? I want to avoid your preachy sanctimonious bullshit too... you seem unpleasant to interact with. Purely based on your replies that is.
---
Despite how much you are crowing about the virtues of socializing, you don't really sell the idea with your conduct here. 
---
My main is Aregin on the only PvE oceanic server, I forgot  the name. Please add to ignore if you see the need.
---
Im all for players actually interacting, but there's no need to be a sanctimonious prick.
---
The game needs a tidy LFD UI, not that Retail global shit show but I reckon it needs one. Maybe even guilds too as large guilds can be difficult to muster people up for groups if a lot of actual socializing is going on.
---
So much more satisfying to do it to people jumping XD quality stuff
---
That's an easy quest when it's green though...
---
I was doing a maraudon quest run and suddenly got this message half way through the dungeon.
---
I panicked for a couple of seconds until I realised the spelling of the name "Blizzard", the crappy domain name, and the name "CyVex" which didn't show relevant results.
---
I was actually literally laughing out loud on discord at that point and shaking my head.
---
Out of curiosity I tried going to the URL in incognito mode because I assumed that the only part where I would get scammed is when I would have to enter in my details ( I shouldn't have even visited the site and I DO NOT recommend anyone else to ).
---
I was preemptively blocked by google chrome with a red screen "deceptive site ahead" warning.
---
I didn't proceed past that point but I just found this hilarious and wanted to share it.
---
PS. This was on Arugal realm
---
Actually, in this case, the biggest streamers announced it well before the game came out. They were originally going on Herod, but a decent amount of the community had already designated Herod as the "authentic experience" realm so a group of the biggest streamers announced they would be rolling on Faerlina instead.

No

He should just leave.
---
Darkshore - mostly for the nostalgia. When I played through the zone this time around I found myself remembering the area from the first time I played through it, circa 12 years ago.
---
This is racist.
---
Dalaran is the best.
---
There is the exact same amount of leather. The spawn timers were cut in half because now there is only one layer instead of two.
---
No one seems to be able to understand this.
---
Listen Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call "love" is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it. Your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above.
---
Yeah, like the other guy said it’s 6 seconds. I’m prot spec so that’d buy me one tap of the node, so I’ll gamble that and try to fight them off to take it all. I won’t die as prot to melee, but unfortunately neither will they....
---
"I wonder if I too can farm some karma with a post about the amount of people in org.."
---
&gt; To not know about pacing to account for resources means they have never run an instance before
---
Say that to the tank, and warlock, that kept blaming me the other day while I was healing strat. Kept pulling while I was less than 30% mana... The best bit was when he charged more than 60 yards away while I was sat down drinking. By the time he hit Timmy I am 40% mana, Im sitting here thinking he learned the first time, he won't be doing it again and am checking my phone a second while drinking. 
---
The SECOND I hear the charge I BOLT for him. 
---
But cause, yknow, he is way out of my range it doesnt matter. 
---
They had the fucking nerve to link my "healing done" after that fight and say I needed to improve it, even though only the tank died. 
---
I reminded them charging a boss when I dont even have half mana and I am out of range is bad. 
---
We had 3 more engagements where we pulled while I was less than 20%...
---
I stuck it out cause the hunter needed the painting for his necklace quest. 
---
But it was hell. They dont learn, even if you wipe.
---
Then it's engineering for sure, and maybe alchemy after you get your tailored items, make potions at a discount and regardless of availability and engineering is self-explanatory as it is the profession that benefits your level of capability the most. 
---
You can grab alchemy on a 35+ alt though and can always throw money at getting potions instead
---
I’ve power leveled my warrior to 41 so far through instances non stop since about lvl 25. 
---
It’s seemed very fast so far. I think after I max out in ZF I’ll quest for abit to mix it up. 
---
Maybe mid 50s dungeons grind to 60. And hopefully have most ore raid bis at 60 from instances.  
---
I’ve been tanking the entire way as arms.  I think it really depends on your class. I’ve almost exclusively looked for 3 Mages and a priest and we AOE everything down in record times.
---
Joe Rogan is definitely a hunter, no way he plays any other class. And he's probably an alchemist too
---
There is no 2g.
---
Runescape 3 is definitely involved. Is it a brainwashing techno-society?
---
The only reason I went here in Legion... rip my internet
---
Scarlet Monastery, because of the architecture and the story.
---
I’m sure what was left of that undead sphincter was clenched harder than the density of Sagittarius A
---
Yeah if i recall correctly if you killed a grey you get a dishonorable kill, what that did idk or remember
---
Caps lock is cruise control for AWESOME
---
Such an underrated city. The only one where you can talk to the banker while still mounted.
---
Deadwind pass, porting people there with an aetish before TBC comes out is an instant death for them, as a troll I love this zone.
---
I looked at a resume one time that was along similar lines for a lab management position at a university. The entirety of his experience was volunteer—organizing D&amp;D and MTG tournaments at the local game store. He did a pretty great job making himself sound important though. We didn’t call him, but it did give the whole lab a good chuckle.
---
the point of it is that you spec one time into it, and pretty much never need to respec again.
---
you can tank or heal any 5 man in the game and put out perfectly good raid heals with decent gear.
---
there are better specs for BGs, but HotW allows you to have NS and a 20% larger health/int pool. (which is crucial when flag carrying)
---
it also gives 0.5s off HT and 10% cheaper heals which pretty much all you need to heal 97% of the games content.
---
and assuming you pick the bear talents on your way to HotW, you get everything needed to tank. OoC and Natural Weapons are nice, but not even close to necessary for tanking.
---
Azshara - torn apart by disaster
---
Lol those scams started up again? That takes me way back.
---
fyi you can change the color for any chat, and for blizzard whispers too, so you can notice these asshats even more easier.
---
not that it aint easy enough already
---
When the runs get smoother, your used to your class your surviving without the aid of the healer, that's the classic experience, there's no mana for you. Only the tank. So learn to SURVIVE.
---
And yeah if y'all wanna be broken, farm a hand of justice more than once. I won't be able to look at BRD ever again without flashbacks.
---
I haven’t got command, so unfortunately that’s not an option for me. I went 11/31/9 since consecration and holy shield are must-haves. 
---
On top of that, I can’t get the double damage on the targets I’m having difficulty with since it’s really just stun-immune bosses. I could see that being to benefit if I were ret and filling an OT role in a pinch, but as MT I can get the threat I need on stub able targets with my usual tools.
---
just join a guild and get a bunch of friends 4Head
---
I thought we were talking about crafting fees... what?
---
you can quite easily LOS the sacrifice and dont need to use grounding totem at all.
---
No. Next?
---
Announced where though? I am one of those social hermits that don't follow streamers. Don't even have a Twitter or facebook.
---
So the streamers just announced it? So they like just pointed and made their claim? So they are not like some sort of officially sanctioned stream server? I kinda had images of Blizzard approved servers beefed up that streamers are invited to use.
---
Bear in mind, some of us live under pretty thicc granite rocks, not even the din created by your celebrity streamers and their followers can penetrate.
---
I guess maybe we should just get a clue... but yeah, if you are out of the loop then how can you know to avoid a "Stream server". It's not officially listed, youve gotta be following the trends to know. You only find out by witnessing hoards of players babbling about the streamers in question.
---
Well, now you're farming Healers, DPS and other players that will get you further in to the content that you need.   
---
Tanks should be more than willing to run attunements and important DPS farms or you'll eventually be held back because you don't have enough support to keep up a raid.
---
The only thing I want is dual spec
---
Auto crit holy shock
---
Was this confirmed? This has been a debate between friends for ages.
---
The "size increase of hunter pets each level"-debate was settled tho!
---
/cancelform

/cast [noform:0,3] Cat Form
---
This should do what you ask although I'm not sure why you'd want it
---
stalagtites hold tight to the ceiling, stalagmites mite reach it one day
---
Cheap shot, backstab, gouge, kidney, backstab, dead.
---
Indeed very hard.
---
Ofc it takes longer than swords to kill mobs if you don't crit but its indefinitely more fun, at least for me.
---
I ran MC with him the other week.
---
Not gonna lie they had us in the first half
---
Of all the fond memories I have of raiding as holy spec, DF holy shock killing someone on the way in to Blackwing Lair was one of the highlights.
---
They may aswell sell classic gold if thats the case, this will ruin the game.
---
Funny thing is it's not a bad thing to talk about. It shows leadership, planning, scheduling etc. It's how you go about explaining it.
---
The second mountaineer needs to work on his grammar
---
Had an PvP event last night and got ported into MC by falling into lava, And I got a raid ID da fak is this. anyone an confirm how to fix this? GM wont reset the ID.
---
FT is pretty garboshit except for the rare occasions where you're fighting something that has big armor but no spell resist. It's alright for PvP but you're almost always better off using FB instead.
---
There will be a trinket later.
---
I’m excited for BWL my guildies are excited for my first time in BWL bring on phase 3
---
It's Free Action Potion.
---
Other option is spam gouge or blind and hope they leave a gap.
---
+shadow damage shields, and other things like that that litterally nobody benefits from...unless you have some sort of on hit weapon proc that does that damage.
---
And of course, things like +agility or strength cloth gear and the like.
---
Wailing Cavers. The memories I have of missing that damn little jump every time!
---
The longer it takes you to finally raid, the more people have gear to make it easier and not compete on every drop
---
I think Living Action Potions are released with Zul'Gurub. For now Free Action Potions will do, I guess. The latter are not usable during stuns, but prevent incoming slows for 30 seconds.
---
Roll orc or dwarf. You can also use Skull of Impending Doom. LAP's won't be available until ZG phase.
---
I haven't played in a while and I'm not caught up with recent meta so it's probably best to ask in r/wow. For the start you probably want to level through Kul Tiras or Zandalar depending on your faction. There you need to complete every zone story line and war campaign and after that the game should open up a bit more.
---
Which is why I hate when people compare playing video games to literally everything you just mentioned.
---
I no lifed a fuck load as a kid and a fuck load as an adult and the addiction never even remotely touch any of the real terrible consequences you listed.
---
And all against afk people. Not in duels or anything. This dude trash
---
Thanks for the Night Warrior transformation, I guess?
---
Y'know the thing about a Night Elf?  He's got... lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a doll's eyes. When he comes at ya, doesn't seem to be livin'... until he bites ya.
---
You are fucking cancer.
---
BWL was wild. I loved the whole Blackrock Mountain theme, and BWL was such an amazing capstone to it for me.
---
Fishing competition isn't out yet.
---
Vanilla wow is back to its fullest
---
Blaumeux is solid. Around 50/50 horde vs alliance
---
Being a bad tank means you're a bad warrior. Stance dancing isn't that hard, fight me. (Theres not a single spec on classic that's remotely complicated compared to retail either) games really, really, really not remotely complicated.
---
Couldn't you also sell lvl boost while doing this to get even more gold?
---
When I heal I always have the boss or tank targeted, and use target of target.
---
no doesnt work... when i am in cat form i stay in catform like that
---
On Grobbulus the price of gathering mats are going up. That includes Arcane Crystals.
---
Trying to understand Raid Lockouts. Say I'm in a group that clears half of the MC bosses, then we call it quits. If I join a different raid with 39 other people that are on a fresh run, will I be able to enter the instance with them? Or am I outright ineligible to join the raid?
---
Always wondered why horde constantly shits on Alliance.. its because instead of mounting an offensive they go to reddit and post.
---
Qwer bound? How do you move
---
I misunderstood how the selling part of auctionator worked and sold leather and cloth for waaaay less than they are worth.
---
I basically thought it shows you the stack price and not the price of a single item, which made me sell stacks for the price of a single item.
---
And i was wondering why my auctions got sold so fast.
---
That was in the beginning of classic.
---
I'll win nothing for my music taste back then, but anything from Bullet for my Valentine's The Poison album. Anything from Meteora by Linkin Park too, but that album still slaps.
---
Buffing someone back is just another expression of thanks. When I play on my paladin I'll throw them a Blessing of Wisdom back, knowing full well that if you're in Stormwind now you won't get anywhere usefull in 5 minutes.
---
These really are not that good of parses tbh. Get rank 1s as a night elf then I’ll be impressed
---
Ya, that's a good way for making extra gold for sure.
---
Wow that takes me back :)
---
Where would they get the fuel for it?
---
Sorry replace the 1 with 0
---
Most of the EU servers still have layering tho. Even at 10 am in the morning there are way more servers that say layered than ones who dont

Beautifull, UE4 is amazing. And the folks at Megascans are amazing too.

Give me WoW or give me death!

&gt;This was to try and get the mainhand from Dal Rend to avoid spending over 300G on a Krol Blade
---
I will never ever understand this, go do pickpocket runs for a day and buy the sword. Why sink so much time into something rng when you can do something that will slowly but surely work towards a goal where you know exactly how close to getting it you are?
---
Focus on science.. I mean Warcraft..
---
Yeah, I'll make sure I AI every priest and druid who walks by if my buffs are running out.
---
Downvoted for:
---
1. “Dankest”
---
2. Stripping the toon naked
---
3. And posting a video that has already been posted 1000 times before.
---
Good to know, I didn't know that. Haven't played since like 2007, where I was raiding with fire. I imagine you need one person to apply winter's chill, maybe he can be that guy :p
---
Honestly I don't think it's possible without having it on your main bar.  You can't cast cat form in any form except normal human form so there's no way to make it go from bear to cat and also not shift back into cat when you're in human form.
---
The only way to do it is to have it on your main bar so in bear form you have a regular shift to cat macro then in cat form in the same slot on your main bar you have a cancelform macro.
---
&gt; my Paladin 
---
That's why she left you. Horde FTW.
---
You're doing it wrong
---
&gt; incognito
---
The correct way is a sandbox/VM.
---
Nah warriors are more common
---
Yes
---
I hit 40 with 290 gold.
---
Granted I was boosting my warrior on my mage, but hey. You never know.
---
No add-on, I just entered them in separately like a dumb ass
---
Careful what you wish for. 'Cause then Basic Campfire will turn evil and be a raid boss.
---
To be fair I would argue that you are wrong on the numbers. Why do you need to go higher than 240 in gnomish? Which items do you want? Also you choose specialization at 200 (Tanaris book) and not 225.
---
Mulgore - because it feels like home to go there!
---
It always did? Or was that just when you had retail selected?
---
Why? Why would you care about some store mounts and pets. Wow has never been p2w
---
The ventrilo harassment videos were fucking GEMS for their time!! I still remember this one so promtply and not to mention the duke nukem ones, especially the one where he actually manages to get the dude he is talking to to wake up his mom and come talk to him. Like shit!

Stranglethorn Vale and booty bay, I love the pirate/ jungle theme that is there. Very magical gaming experience for me.
---
arathi basin is released in phase 4
---
It is confirmed, have been doing it myself
---
I'm gonna camp alliance scum until they quit.  I'm going to win world of warcraft by making it so no alliance are left.
---
Yep it's VC
---
It's not that far. Alliance usually does the same swim but the other direction  to get the ZG buff. Granted you got mounts so the land part is quite a bit faster.
---
I've never had a significant number of whelps spawned by a knockback, and I've seen many knockbacks. They don't even aggro onto you after hatching if you run away from them.
---
The most whelps I've ever seen was a group that insisted on standing up on the ramp for the event, and every time the hatchers ran to the eggs they would just wait for them to come back.
---
PVE: Most of the times working fine if done properly  
---
PVP: Most of the times not working. Only works with scatter shot and pet not being struck to any cc/dot etc.
---
We all know that in the world of RPG, less armour means more protection, but only for females!
---
I just got another Viper. Would wielding two of them be better than the other options?
---
Lol. Incognito.
---
Looks just like it did back then.
---
Raiding guilds are just coordinating the ony head buff.  Happens every Friday and Saturday night.  
---
When we had two layers it still happened, layer collapse has nothing to do with this at all
---
Surprised a rogue got the first one

Blackrock Mountain
---
...What’s the difference?
---
Well said.
---
There is no rhyme or reason to my killings. Sometimes you get a MC buff and sometimes you get melted.

For the Horde!

You can not apply posions to thrown weapons, that wasn't added until patch 4.0

This part of FFVI was fun but I always got lost.
---
I wouldn't want to be there either. Place is a fire hazard.
---
Retard.
---
Not in Searing Gorge
---
I’m in the central US and an Oceanic server (actually located in Australia), isn’t even dogshit for me.
---
I'm near 60 and I'm afraid being level capped will be less fun than leveling tbh. I guess it just depends on what aspect of the game you enjoy
---
I suppose one could say life is a Skinner box by the same metrics that WoW is, or you know it's just a game where you work towards reaching goals and get satisfaction.
---
If you don't enjoy it do something else that you find more entertaining but dont kid yourself, nothing you do in life is any more(or less) important.
---
it’s basically how most grind games work
---
Not this guy, I charge 1g 6 stacks of water/food

Duskwood!

Yes but I was hoping for something new! Still a good video.

Oh. Yeah I was so confused. You're right. It was petty and immature. 
---
However, conning me into SWATing her mom was actually pretty serious, and the police for about a week were contemplating pressing charges against her for filing a false report. Sadly, they dropped it.
---
Good thing though, her bed is made and she gets to sleep in the pile of shit life she brought on herself.
---
Users are Coocookachu and Carbon. They rotate around gadgetzan on top of buildings and abusing terrain to avoid gaurds. At least carbon has been up there the lat 4 days from reports from other Alli
---
Raid drops are for 2 hours I believe
---
Holy shit, that's pretty messed up :p  
---
    
---
Also not to be a stickler, but rule #4 xD
---
Just report it it’s  a ban reason
---
Or wasted your money on consumables rather than picking up herb/alch
---
Well. This is interesting.
---
Ah, was just trying to make awareness of the bug, but I'll remove it.
---
She watched Teen mom...
---
This is good advice. I get constant messages when I log in for dungeons from ppl I’ve friended or they added me. They generally let me roll on things I need and have no complaints.
---
Rep seems to be good to build.
---
I want to play a warrior and tank but am afraid of things like this when I get to end game and I do not know the 60’s dungeons.   Plus there’s a bazillion warriors out there anyway.
---
Its clearly in the hands of a warrior and he was putting it in trade window for the sceenshot.
---
You broke the truce and now you have to life with the consequences.
---
This is why I dont kill alliance when I am farming or questing. Because I know I have to stay and the person I killed will come back (and also I am a warrior and can be kited easy AF).
---
DME jump runs with a war?
---
Farm dungeons?
---
and yet you can't point to anything
---
Ahhh I thought they were all coming together, that's a shame.
---
Everyone there right now has reported and people in lfg said they have reported both of them over the last four days
---
get yourself a warrior with mining and do DM:E 2 Man Jump runs ... 50/60g per hour
---
My favorite is still NE guard thinking you're hitting on her when you ask about enchanting trainer.
---
Yeah I mean I would definitely be petty and immature to, that girl deserved it.
---
how does that work? we split gold or?
---
care to explain a bit more? thanks
---
Works on gouge and blind though.
---
WOW.
---
there dozens of us!
---
A bear is, probably, a better tank for 5mans.
---
Free action potions are different from Living action potions. Free actions make you immune to stuns for 30 seconds but does not remove any effects. Living action potions remove stuns and makes you immune to them but only for 5 seconds.
---
Un'Goro Crater, it's just very serene (also devilsaur)
---
Spec don't matter for low level play. but get Silent resolve and healing focus. Inner focus is neat too. I have mixed feelings about spirit of redemption but it's deep in Holy.
---
The healing aggro is for real in Classic, especially when tanks can't really AOE facroll like in Retail. So silent resolve is your friend. Anything that preserves your fade CD is good. 
---
Healing focus prevents casting pushback, letts you heal when being beat on. Ideally you shouldn't be, getting beat on but you are talking about leveling, it's gonna happen.
---
Also inner focus is your break in the case of a real reisty fuck hole of a situation when your mana bar is hurting as much as your tank. Gives you a free cast with a high chance to crit. Manage to crit a heal or greater heal and your tank will hopefully be good for at least 10 seconds. Can also be good if the whole party is hurting and you crit a prayer of healing... but doing that will inevitably lead to you getting aggro. Shouldn't be nessesary in high end play as you will likely be ranking down your heals and shouldn't really be going OOM.
---
Spirit of redemption is kinda usefull... one could rightly argue that it's wasted point in high end play. You really shouldn't be dieing at all for this to be useful. But if you are pugging a lot, this talent can seal a kill in an otherwise shit situation. It essentially makes you Jesus after being killed you spawn as an immortal with unlimited mana, but lasts 10 seconds. If you end up dieing at 10% on the boss you can spam heal the entire group to full saving the group. Although you'll have to run back... unless you got a druid, sham or pally.
---
Those are by no means the best talents though, if you are selective and smart with your heals you can heal in any spec. The only true value Holy spec has is faster and beefier heals.
---
I normally start off with "experienced in strategic and numerical analysis for marginal gains" (aka theorycrafting), then depending on the reaction I do link it to gaming, and then on to guild and raid leading.
---
For the interviewers that have no clue, a brief explanation seems to help.
---
I also find that being up front about it is best anyways.
---
There have been times in my current job where I've been asked to stay late to resolve a situation, and sometimes I have done just that, but others I've said "sorry, I can't tonight as I'm raiding in an hour and need to get home to prepare".
---
Understanding bosses are great. Just been given a promotion too!
---
im retard. sorry
---

I kind of cheered when I got to the dolls eyes part and realised
---
Meh, if you red you ded. Do not care your level. Happened to me while leveling, and I didn't quit. If you can't take some ganking now and then, then why join pvp? Those are the dangers and playing carebear is for pussies.
---
Mulgore. I just love the green fields and TB. Extra points for /moo
---
I wish there were more like him.
---
well if you're dual wielding you'd probably want to go fury, especially once you hit 40 and get bloodthirst since ms with a 1hand is pretty pointless.
---
In the past, Dual Wield wasn't really viable for leveling because the miss penalty is massive, somewhere around ~25% (I forget the exact number) and you don't get +hit on gear until you're basically 60. Now that the Heroic Strike bug/feature was discovered, dual wield is likely viable and possibly better than 2hand.
---

---
to me it depends on the circumstances. higher level player kills you? that's a gank. group kills you? thats a gank? they attack while you are low on mana / health? gank. they attack while you're attack mobs? gank. they a rogue? definitely gank? 
---
they similar level, solo, not a rogue and you're both on full health / mana &amp; not fighting mobs? thats just you losing pvp.
---
that's really not relevant to what he said
---
Mythic +10
---
Haha I’ve seen Onyxia be dual sword ranked without issue.
---
My rule is for leveling 1 intellect is = 2 spell power. So if a item has 10 int or 22 spell power I would choose the SP. However SP is only for dungeons and raids. Only time I've seen spell power usefully outside a instance is with fire spec in pvp achieving very high crits 2 hitting people like nothing, but your cc abilities are lacking. I recommend keeping 2 sets. One for raids, and one for openworld/pvp
---
Ironforge, It gives me so much nostalgia as I spent hundreds of hours there making friends during vanilla-TBC-WotLK.
---
I'm 35, and I haven't noticed that time speeds up all that much.  The last few years having fucking crawled by.

There is no need for this, no need at all.
---
Your levelling BiS is what ever you have looted from mobs and/or quests.
---
Winterspring! :)
---
Shimmering Flats! I love this place for the quests. Also Tanaris!
---
That’s 1v1 where that works but how many quests and zones will allow just 1v1 combat? That and you have to be stealthier to CS and that takes up a lot more time.
---
Ah well it wasn't about being trash or anything, more like no time to nolife grind consumables and work on progression.
---
Good for falling asleep
---
well yeah... i mean here is the thing, im a fury warrior. 
---
i dont want to tank, but because id rather not wait for hours, i have to tank.
---
so fuck it, i am going to tank and just do guild groups / find healers who will put up with me (which in this current time, it seems to be more than nothing), and make sure that if I am doing this I am at least going to make it faster than normal tanking in fury with as much plate gear as I can get.
---
there is a reason why tanks were and are super rare in vanilla, and why they made tanking, esp aoe tanking, progressively easier come TBC. and why things like dual spec came into play.
---
It's still a fact that the horde fp is closer... Same a lot of dungeons that give both factions a flight point nearby: rfk/rfd is closer to taurajo than ratchet/theramore. Maraudon is closer to the horde fp than alliance. Even gnomeregan is easier for horde to access because of a teleporter in booty bay... Why do they get a telly to gnomeregan when we have to walk all the way to fucking wailing caverns van ourselves (which is imo the best comparison dungeon in terms of location)
---
This is one of the reasons I switched my main from a rogue to a warlock when TBC came out.
---
Ashenvale because of the night elf music
---
Sideways arrow shooting hooked me in
---
Most fights don't last longer than a Major Mana/Dark Rune if you're actually trying to maximize DPS/throughput as a guild/raid. If not, tapping on down-time is the most efficient way.
---
As priest i farm as holy/disc in Dm the lashers. Its chilling it gives like 25-45g / hour. Very easy farm, doesnt effect layering. If you have a manapool like 6.4k you dont need cooldowns for it (PI or inner focus). You can do it with 26/25 talent which is good for raids or instances aswell. So far i farmed it for like 15 hours. Found around 35 living essences, 3 world boe epics, 4x 16 slot bag. The grey things you find have high vendor value (this is the main income).
---
Oh god, I just tamed Lupos tonight (yes, I know he's nerfed). I'm level 27, he's 23, so I don't have any food for him do I??! That was a nervous hs to quickly buy some meat.
---
I followed a guy though the woods to his house and killed him as soon as he opened the door. I looted the house and made copies of the key and handed them out to random people in town. That was in Ultima Online but it's probably the worst thing I've ever done in an MMO.
---
Sorry, the guy took the flight before I could close the windows and this is the only screenshot I have of him along with the tooltip.
---
My target's name is Trifling and he is a gnome. In Wotlk, [Trial of the Crusader](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Trial_of_the_Crusader), there is this voice dialog where [Wilfred\_Fizzlebang](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Wilfred_Fizzlebang) says this line.

For nostalgic reasons, Dun Morogh. It is the first place me and my best friend explored as dwarves in closed beta mid 2004. It was an unforgettable experience to look at the world of Warcraft from a new perspective.

Honestly "growing my gear score" is all I needed to read to know what kind of person you are. That is one of the most hilariously pathetic things I've read this year. Of all the things you want to brag about you choose one of the most useless indicators of skill/knowledge about the game. 
---
Maybe its because during my time from Vanilla through TBC and through WotLK I always found myself in good guilds where  no one actually cared about gear scores or item levels. Do you know what one of best melee trinkets was in WotLK until nearly the end of the expansion was? It was the Darkmoon Card Greatness deck. And having one would absolutely tank any sort of gear tracking nonsense. I didn't replace mine until I had both Deaths Verdict and Deathbringers Will. So really good job on focusing on something so absolutely useless. 
---
Other than reaching rank 10 on my Warrior in vanilla and 2k with my friends on my Holy Paladin in TBC I never really cared for PvP. So it never really impresses me much when i see people trying to brag about their past ranks. 
---
Raid leading to me is like being a DM for your friends D&amp;D group. People make it sound a lot harder than it really is to make themselves sound impressive or something. When in fact its one of the easiest things to do. So like grats I guess? 
---
Cool man we both stopped playing WoW around the same time. I quit early in Cata because raiding was broken. 10mans were significantly harder than 25mans, fights were bugged, and a couple of fights could be easily exploited to avoid mechanics entirely. I mean I've come back and done some raids with some old friends here and there through the years, but on average I'd say I've played maybe 3 or 4 months of each expansion and not nearly for as long as I did from Vanilla through WotLK.
---
I'll go check.

I would be a happy camper if enhancers wouldn't play so badly way too often. They dont know their role, therefore they dont play support, but think their damage matters. Always oom, never drinking. Hunters and enhancers are the two classes I have to micromanage into drinking a good 80%. 
---
I have to trade a mage for water to then trade the water to them and tell them to drink, not to shock as much and preserve mana, so they arent oom when the priest is at 80% mana and the mage is still at 50%.
---
*The* enhancement shaman DPS spell is windfury and way too many start the fight with earth shock and not with windfury, strength, mana totem which cuts the dungeon run shorter than any pitiful shock could ever do.

The beginning of the Burning Legion expansion has you trapped in Exodar for about 40 minutes killing demons and trying to save Valen. Portals are opening everywhere with demons pouring out, and you have to scourge the whole place. It feels pretty shitty all around. I would say it's worse than the Attack on Undercity.
---
Burn it down!
---
Tanking with people who are good is like a dream. Tanking with a pug is miserable. Either they all pick a target to focus and you are juggling 3 targets running around everywhere. Or there is so little dps happening that you wonder if tanking is even worth it. The worst part is they are not mutually exclusive.
---
&gt;complicated, high focus situations
---
&gt;classic wow raids

Ya that's fair... Then why don't we get teleporter over there? We have to either make a suicide run over through the plaguelands and hope you won't die to the ?? Mobs, or you can walk all the fucking way around undercity...
---
Jintha'alor (elite quest area in hinterlands).  It's like an open world dungeon.  I love how it's outdoors, generally requires 5 players, and still gives great rewards via quests.  All that and still susceptible to open work PvP.  I really wish there were more areas like it, and I hope for more of the same if Classic+ becomes a reality.
---
It’s all about the BiS and Dungeon cleaves my dude get with the times.
---
Just join their twink runs and if you bring couple consumes, enchant your gear and show you are not there to be carried, chances improve they want to cut some slacker in their main raid who is resting on his lorrels too much.
---
A lot of people stay at 19, 29 etc to do Pvp, there would be lists around for the best gear at those levels.
---
You could do a google image search for twink and see what shows up.
---
yes
---
Just more people raiding than back in the days.
---
Just play rogue or warrior, they use they're entire rotation, same with hunter
---
Nah, I’m undead so wouldn’t feel as good anyways. Gotta pass it onto a tauren if it dropped 😉
---
Are nelfs good as tank warrior? Got that 1% dodge baby
---
Im 50 now and it hasn't been a problem so far, either sap one, ranged pull one or pop evasion.
---
What’s your rotation for questing with this build?
---
Think you screwed yourself a little here. Blacksmith is only good for enhancement and even then just for weapons.
---
If "playing with other people" is what you want, you got a problem though. Then doing what you want requires standing around for 1-2 hours before you get to go, which is killing my fun at the moment. I love playing as heal in a dungeon, but absolutely dread the waiting time which is often as long as the fun afterwards.
---
I just click my totems lol
---
You should probably stop playing if this is how you see the game dude
---
I've had this happen l, we where like, if it happens again we are in the matrix for sure
---
But you don't *need* to. In most guilds there are various gnomish engineers, therefore if you don't feel like making these items just yet, you don't really lose anything doing them later as they are all BoE and any gnomish engineer can build and trade them.
---
Only chicken and death ray have to be made before ditching gnomish.
---
Mankrik has been great. It’s est but a lot of late night people. I’m pst and never had issues finding groups outside the normal tank stuff
---
Serious question: do you legitimately enjoy farming up consumables? I thought everyone just saw that sort of stuff as a necessary chore if you want to compete (especially in PvP).
---
Atiesh seems fine - always plenty of groups and people questing and in cities. More populated than Myzrael. I don’t know about the others. Look for bloodbath &amp; beyond guild
---
I was thinking about breaking up with the girl I'm seeing, 2 weeks into  classic launch just so I could play more. Currently level 52, I made the wrong decision.

You can't use a shapeshift ability while you are shapeshifted, so a macro is needed.

you hurt my feelings but you took the time to build a clear structure and numbering system so I also feel safe. It's hard to process ambivalent emotions , could it be love ?
---
There is a meat vendor in the Goldshire Inn.
---
This is the only answer, there is no need to be prot for any 5 man dungeons. + UBRS.
---
Just make sure you start farming a tank set around 55-60 and you'll be golden.
---
Spam many, many dungeons during this level bracket and not only will you have a DPS and tank set, but you'll also have a ton of quests left to do at 60 for decent gold income.
---
I was thinking the same thing haha

Brahh? why aint you normal brah?

As people have said, go for Mirah's Song.
---
If your group is cool you can get it in one Scholo run.
---
You need to run outside and hand in the quest every time you get an objective complete and the run will take a bit longer so let people know you are doing the quest chain before hand.
---
You have never had someone confront you in something where you just fundamentally suck at it? In my career field I feel like the only time we actually criticize people is when we pull them behind closed doors and tell them they are completely shit. You can coast in life and in this game being kinda meh at whatever role you play. You just won't get invited back or any recognition. I am honestly surprised at how heated I get when I am doing more damage than the other 2 dps combined in a 5 man. Like the lack of effort that I would have to put in to be that terrible, I would have to be literally tabbed out for 5 seconds at a time during fights just not casting. 
---
It's getting to the point where I won't play with ret paladins, and pretty much any druid because every single one I have played with just is that bad. If I can put up dots and wand to do more dps than you, one of us is leaving this group.
---
How?
---
APES is no issue for horde. They just squad up with their lapdogs salad bakers to ocasionally fight certain guilds on horde side and thats it
---
Teldrasil starting zone.  Started my very first WoW toon there and nothing has ever really lived up to that first couple hours in WoW all those years ago.

well done
---
How has that been a debate when it's so easy to test?
---
I would run Brutatlity MH with DR OH
---
Obviously you have Unbridled Wrath, which would generate marginally more rage with Assassination Blade in OH, but DR deals more damage (2.8 vs. 2.7 speed).

Stranglethorn, for that sense of fear to get ganked you get every time you're pulling a mob.

And the hours lost tracking that one guy that killed you instead of questing like a sane human would do
---
Depends, are you the sm/ruin lock that is allowed to use corruption? If so after casting it (12s Duration) you get a 1s global cd means 11s left to dps with 4 shadowbolts (4*2,5s) well and that leaves you with exactly 1s downtime for your next corruption-&gt; perfekt time for a life tap.
---
Iam not a fan of tapping back to Full cos that leaves you at low hp for a moment and if it overlaps with raid damage you are at risk to die
---
Phase 4. It couldnt possibly be that OP didnt know when they would be available?

https://classic.wowhead.com/item=20008/living-action-potion
---
TIL vanilla raiding is complicated.
---
I found leveling almost entirely in dungeons between 52-60 is the best way to go. (as a healing priest)  
---
The xp is not that great, but by the time you get to 60 you'll have most if not all your BIS items ;)
---
I get people complimenting me on my damage all the time. I don't do anything special I just actually push buttons one after another. If you are dpsing, especially as a caster, you should always be casting or waiting on a global. Anytime you are not you are doing it wrong. Vanilla rotations are so simple it literally is how much uptime you have pressing buttons. Hell, if all I did was spam shadowbolt and literally nothing else, I would top damage in every group I have ever been in. The fact that I throw in dots is just overkill for some people.
---
This would be the perfect place for a raid entrance in either 9.0 or Classic+

Or just take the 15% ah cut and send over your gold with neutral AH.

Living action potions wont be available until phase 4.

I always give free water in raid/party. My time playing is pretty limited, so i wont spend 2-3 min for each person asking me to give them water, beeing asked more then 10 times each day+portals, thats some nasty 30min of my playtime. Some of them dont even wanna tip, they are shocked i was asking for 1G for few stacks, so i rather prefer to dont do it anymore. Maybe you need gold so its worth it for you, i have plenty so i really cba taking my time to conjure to every random asking me for water. Some even open trade window without even saying anything.
---
You can downvote how much you like, but some encounters with some people really made me dont wanna spend time to conjure anymore.
---
When you say 'use target of target' could you explain exactly what you mean and how that works. Seen a lot of people write that and not sure if it a display option, or macro command or what.

We're talking in circles here. I've heard these justifications a thousand times now and it's usually from min-maxers and elitists who think it'd be the end of the world to do something nice for someone in a game (like allowing them to have an item that they really need and want to use). The only indisputable fact remains that anything that you "need" because you "need" gold is not need but greed, by definition. No matter how much you calculate it and convert it and justify it in your head.

Wait, what? Who was paying for your original account? Who was paying for HIS when you had 'traded' them?

Should have PMed them back and asked them when the next raid is because you want to try for Illidan's weapons XD
---
The one and only. Get some much needed RP in your life.
---
You hit stuff to generate threat and taunt stuff that other people take aggro from. There is some more to it like positioning and pulling but really if all you did was hold threat and let me hold your hand on where to go and what to pull, I would be thrilled. No tank has held threat off me in a dungeon yet. It's even worse if i land a crit. Makes me want to level a hunter, just so I can ignore threat entirely as a mechanic.
---
Tap as long as you feel like it's reasonably safe and you're not stressing the healers.
---
If you are raiding you should go for 310 dagger skill. Its reduces the glancing blows dmg penalty like 30-40%. But  for higher then that i wouldnt recommended cause its gonna worth like few % dmg reduc.

---
Honestly might roll Enhance for the meme + Elemental.
---
most of european server empty like that in europe.. hours in classiclfg to get tank. time for crossrealms.
---
Well here's what I do. I'm the one with the corruption slot and CoS assigned, I open with corr into CoS  (No need to apply first, no direct shadow spells striking the target that early), throw a shadow bolt and then life tap right away. You never wanna have full hp as a lock as that makes hp regen useless (primarily demon armor). 
---
I keep bolting until corr needs to be refreshed, I refresh it and tap twice, one tap is usually 2.3 shadow bolts for me. If it's a fight I know well and there's no damage coming in for some time, I tap to about 40% hp and bandage. 
---
Otherwise I tap once and use demonic/dark rune, It doesn't waste a gcd and is more potent than a life tap. I tend to have two healthstones, one improved and one non improved, I use these to life tap and quickly heal up as major mana pots are so expensive, Major healing pots are a better alternative for us. This works very well for ragnaros for instance which is a pretty long fight.
---
It kills me because the weapon model is SO cool. Maybe I'll run a meme-y melee survival spec and find some use for it...

Just using it as an example of something you don't want to do that has a payoff involved my guy

When I got back home I sent him the money that he paid for me, but man the american banking system is so damn complicated. There's so many different terms for everything and a lot of archaic systems that nobody should be using anymore... Had to try 3 times and ask him for a bunch of different bank numbers that he has and I had to combine before I finally managed to successfully send him the money.

&gt; i dont want to tank, but because id rather not wait for hours, i have to tank.
---
That sounds like a you problem. All I ask is you not make it my problem.
---
Would've made more sense making the Night Elf capital in Hyjal with the burning World Tree as an instance and Teldrassil being a high level questing area.
---
Standing in a major city waiting for a full group. For me, its more 50:50, but still enough to think about rerolling (52 resto shaman atm).
---
You’re right. I thought for sure there was a lawful chaotic. Thanks for the catch
---
Orc racials means axes are better, you’ll need more hit% to not miss with your wizard stick. If you have the gear to get more hit without making losing your dps increase from the cane then probably do it.
---
Also easy farming and easy PvP.
---
Dreadmist ! If u are horde ill  try help u boost tho low level dungeons. Helping all lows who are first time here just msg me ingame Evin
---
Oh, I tend to quest, farm or play the AH while the group is forming.
---
&gt;It's almost exactly the same time when flying from UC to Stranglethorn.
---
why on earth would you ever fly from uc to stv, unless you were planning on a 15min afk lol
---
Learned this last year and was mind blown.
---
Yep!
---
Horde = kids, and kids have no boundary. If unsure about age, verification: spawn camping Undead.
---
Probably not. The main activity of WoW is grinding. If you want to raid successfully you need to grind to prepare for it. If you want to do PvP it's the same as well. If you don't enjoy grinding you will have a bad time.
---
Fuuuuuck that!  Skull Ally ganked me while I was leveling up so I go out of my way to ensure their brothers in arms feel my wrath. Red is dead. I don't care what level you are if I see you I'm fucking gaming you. Of you're the same level as me, I'll play nice until you pull more mobs than you mean to and I'll charge you.  Just like you fucks do to me. 
---
Fuck you.
---
More likely, yeah! My bad
---
I don't really see how this is possible. I want to tank on my warrior, but I also want to do it as prot. If I am prot, leveling is slow and extremely unfun. If I am fury/arms, I don't enjoy tanking. Same goes for healing. To level you absolutely have to play a dps spec, because of how bad the healing or tanking specs are at soloing. Also who enjoys doing a dungeon potentially hundreds of times because one item is your BiS until Naxx? There are only so many times your friends/guildies will run a certain dungeon spam before you have to pug. And that is a whole new fresh hell.
---
Took me 100 runs to get it. Then i DId another run after that and ofc it droppes again lol.....
---
Imagine rolling a gnome not because it looks dumb.
---
Lol, right
---
You’ll need more hit% work out of the dps increase from axe to staff is worth it after getting hit cap for staves.
---
Waaaaaaah
---
I want to craft all the engineering items availible, do i get gnomish or goblin engi first?
---
Also, how high to i have to get engi the first time? Does anyone have a list of all the engi items availible for each spec?
---
probably thousand needles, the shimmering flats is beautiful and i have some great memories from throughout the zone like the buff you get from the air totem quest. just a very nice and cozy place all around
---
Swamp of sorrows; I love the sub-zone names, the atmosphere, ambience, the density of monsters, perfect for farming

Gildan was a warlock.

Warlocks are the reason why orcs entered azeroth and why everything happend how it happend

Cg on that :) We had a hunter ding 60 on our first (and Golemagg realm second) Ragnaros kill. Sauce:  [https://www.twitch.tv/addnye/clip/PoliteRelievedNarwhalBrokeBack](https://www.twitch.tv/addnye/clip/PoliteRelievedNarwhalBrokeBack)
---
STV, even after getting ganked countless times it still holds a special place in my heart
---
Just tell him to fuck off?
---
Which is exactly the opposite of the top comment. I absolutely don't enjoy grinding mats for my BiS, but I know that once I make and equip it, it will feel amazing. I buy gear and keep it in my bags, so each couple levels I get to equip that really sick blue/purple I have been holding onto for a while. Keeps me motivated to keep leveling. Especially once you already have your mount and big talents.
---
Dwarf is shit. They can't shadowmeld into mind control people off cliffs... Worthless :D
---
first question, the combat Icon is like a little red crossed swords, by default is should be in center of health bar near the bottom.
---
second, Im sure you can edit with custom texts, but by default, 'rare' only shows up in the tooltip section. Elite is after the level value, elites will be like lvl40+, this should be in the name plates too.

Black lotus has almost doubled in price from 25g to 45g a piece on my server within a day of the layer being removed. Could just be a few people trying to cash in could be the new normal to soon to tell yet

Yup :)

lol at competing in MC :D :D :D :D :D :D people these days have no limits.

If u are on dreadmist ill pay anyone 5gold for that gnome kill screenshot over corpses
---
Wisp stance is overpowered for warrior leveling
---
From a experienced player; this guy is a beginner do not listen to this.
---
Any half decent warrior will already be using their abilities. Its a gearing issue, if your threat is bad drop defense gear for hit/crit pieces. This is the only way to improve your threat unless you're just auto attacking and shield blocking. 
---
(Sorry if I came off rude but come on, dont advice others if you barely know your class yet)
---
Agree with above comment
---
Maybe, I've always played rogue and it was natural for me. Plus, combat feels like a gimmick. 100% agree on the group style thingy, its way more fun with a buddy.
---
Hotel?

I for one absolutely do. It's just so relaxing to ride around and gather my herbs. I love it.

That and no job, family or social life.
---
Good lord this was like a trip back to 2005. If you'd said Ocarina of Time instead of BoTW, it'd have been perfect.
---
They probably get pissy because they spend money on water and want to get the full effect.
---
Without any rhyme or reason to be in that area beyond basic leveling, Silvermoon will remain irrelevant. It’s like Darnassus, nothing remotely important was close to it so unless one is an Elf superfan, no one is going to see a point in hanging out there.
---
Reminds me of why I like playing a lower tier character in a fighting game or something of the like.
---
Lost or didn't do too well? It was expected, playing a bottom tier character.
---
Won and surprised everyone? Ayy, you overcame the odds and won with a "bad" character.

Was it like this in original vanilla?

Waga.io

I have a custom made one but its for ability cd's only (if not on cd assume ready) and I play with hidden bars so not exactly beginner friendly. The ones on waga probably are.

To clarify what he is saying. You want a weapon with a low swing time (i.e. a FAST weapon)  1.6s weapon speed is ideal. With a slow weapon (2.7s swing time) you won't have rage as quick.

The reward is that you can influence the environment when you're in a position of power. If you refuse to be a leader yourself, then you can't really complain when a toxic loot council screws you out of loot.

Is there an addon which shows me which quest items I can destroy without ruining an ongoing quest? I have quite a few questitems in my inventory which I forgot to delete, they take a lot of space.
---
ShadowUnitFrames!

Bloodfang is pretty good. Medium pop most of the time, pops to high on occasion during peak hours on weekends - never had to que to get in.

Seems to be fairly even distribution between H &amp; A, too.

In Norway they advice you to put down gaming experience on your resume. So being a guild leader would actually help, and show that you have some leadership experience.

Nobody cares

Great logic.

Mess with the trees and we will break your knees.

no but they are near the elves and 1 felcloth is worth as much as at least 2 stacks of runecloth
---
It massively increase the gold gained from quests yes. If you have a quest in your inventory that gives 1g at level 59 it will most likely give over 5g when you hit 60.
---
Yeah, the #1 rule in sales is know your audience. If someone told me this I would 100% respect it because I know what goes into it. 
---
But if the guy you're interviewing doesn't know anything about WoW? Or maybe he knows a little but, but only because his 15 year old son is missing school to play games and spends too much time on the computer? He's going to think even less of you than if you just said nothing at all.
---
I went deep down the rabbit hole. In patch 1.3 the mailbox in front of the inn was moved to be in front of the bank!
---
Not a real solution. You can do that only so many times until it will be considered quitting the game completely.
---
I personally enjoy shitting on hordes that have so much false sense of security that they don't even check the level difference before trying to gank me.
---
Never happened to me. Then again i usually dont bother with fire totems on that boss. Maybe it can only happen to searing because its on the bosses aggrolist.
---
They are BIS for priests as well which are definitely up there with rogues and hunters in the 19 bracket.
---
No, its only this addon. I have also never ever seen this happening with other addons. 
---
But I think this specific problem must be on my side. I will test ist even further at home
---
What addon u using for health bars and minimap?
---
How do Blizzard catch Real-Money gold buyers?
---
And how would their methods be able to know if someone bought gold for real money or for retail-gold?

Read the post, it says raiding is complicated.

It lwill be based on when they log out not you.

Yeah swim through the lake and run in between the the zeppelin tower and UC, or get murdered in the Western Plaguelands. Then if on a PVP server get murdered at the Monastery.
---
I believe in this instance he means bottoming out on mana. Although a non max rejuvenation or FoL would usually be best if they start tapping. Imo just make a macro to notify party when you tap

Depends how many people can make them and if you'd rather make more at a lower price or make fewer at a higher price. 100g is usually the low end 300g is the highest I've seen someone actually pay.

The Un'goro crater. I took a trip down the memory lane as I rode into Un'goro. I  recoginzed the Raptors and Slimes from my early-morning before-the-shift mining-farm-trips a decade ago. In Retail I played as Paladin and now I am a proud member of the Horde so the paths of my chars haven't crossed their roads very often. But that crater has a special place in my heard for that special feeling.

I was pissed back in cata when they made tol barad the battle pvp zone instead of gilneas city, sure it’s a battleground, but I thought the idea of worgen and undead constantly fighting for control, and populating the city with the winning factions NPCs would’ve been SICK!
---
Dailies are there specifically to manipulate people into addiction. They force you to build a daily habit centered on WoW (or whatever game with dailies you're playing). Attempting to stop playing the game then leaves people with a gap in their routine, in which they have an easy time justifying playing the game during "free time".
---
You need a remote desktop not an app
---
Just position him in the back, kicked to other adds has never happened to me. Easy 30 sec saved on hydro
---
Well, just like it is in retail then, only with less flames
---
Gotta say 500-600 DPS is pretty high in crappy gear :p
---
Not unless you're 200 Eng or Blacksmith, which I'm not.

Brutality MH Miras OH
---
well you know what they say
---
Girlfriends come and go, epics are soulbound.

Oh my friends if you feel this way about wow then never even attempt to fathom an inkling of an imagination of a dream of trying Oldschool Runescape.
---
Nice.
---
Did you update it yet?
---
This guy gets a good phase2.
---
Same, but if you attack me, i dont have a problem wasting hours of your and my time.
---
Funniest shit this week, me 5-man multiboxing on my L30 team. A L60 shadowpriest tried to gank me twice. He corpserunned twice. Sure, i lost 1-2 guys, but not my own priest so res and back to questing. (This was in yeti caves, so he was there to kill lowbies).
---
The real troll of night elves was putting zero end game content near their capital. Imagine a end game instance or raid in Hyjal, Moonglade, Felwood, Winterspring or Ashenvale, suddenly Darnassus is relevant!
---
That can still be fun, if you fire up a podcast or an audiobook and then just immerse yourself in some repetitive, braindead activity, like said archaeology, or leveling a character in Classic. I've been doing the latter since Classic released, and I'm having great time (thus far I've got a lock at 57, druid at 38, shaman at 25ish and pally at 22ish).
---
I enjoy levelling to a point. Somewhere between 30-40 I feel that it slows down significantly and the fun stops dropping. Was the same back in Vanills where I had an alt of most classes at around lvl 30.
---
50-60 felt like torture. Trying to quest in zones where 60's can farm was hell on a faction-skewed server. Few mobs and kept dying to people I had no chance of beating.
---
Then at 57-60 the quest amount I had was so scarce that I had to run all over both continents which made my xp/hour go way down. Tried to grind it out but couldn't bear the thought of killing 600 more mobs of the same type. Went dungeons instead which was way better.
---
Well, Mulgore is where I started back in Vanilla. I was only 11, but I remember being transported to the very home of Cairne BloodHoof (who I had helped in War3 !) and it made me so hapoy. Then the first time you see Thunder Bluff coming out of the fog...
---
Also most people’s career life plan.
---
Classicwow.live/leveling or Joana's for paid. Both are very good.
---
You buy boots in WoW and never wear them? Dude that's sick, you need help.
---
Thats wrong. The 19% added miss chance for dw is applied to both weapons. But you want a caster offhand for more procs and crits
---
Wailing Caverns would like to have a word with you.
---
It’s hard to say, it depends on entirely up to the group that takes those dungeons on. Unless it’s the same group spamming it over and over with efficiently, it’s hard to give a time frame with pug groups.
---
I was thinking of the DR MH in OH - Doh...
---
Then I would use DR MH and BB OH
---
To be fair, they put out horrible amounts of single target damage when leveling. Really hard to not get aggro. As long as they are hitting the focus I am fine with this.
---
But you take your time to write a detailed answer to the comment? You could have written 7 bug reports by that time.
---
Guessing its been just "luck" so far. Need more runs.
---
Barrens, you gotta love that chat.

Duskwood

I have one lvl 44 druid. All I need!

I thought so. Tried getting mine set up similar to this and failed miserably, I’ll give it another go!
---
Honestly if you fall for this you kinda deserve it, and you probably will learn your lesson for good.
---
And this is why you autorun folk 🤥
---
That's actually not that easy as warlock because of spell push back. We don't have an instant AE and no freeze or slow. Using holy water would be easier.
---
47, 43, 18, 12, 10 and 9 here. 
---
For me you're mostly right. The main driver is fear of commitment. Every class in this game have strengths and weaknesses and it's difficult to decide which is optimal for me. I love the min-max thought process / analysis in games, so I want the optimal. But I also love leveling and I love all the classes. I doubt I would be an alt-o-holic if it was otherwise. The commitment issue is only there because the game is so good.
---
But I would never jump between these characters unless I loved leveling as well. Combined with the fact that I love all the classes and want to experience them all.
---
Macros
---
Retail for sure, but classic? Not even close!
---
I think they were only put in trade to take a screenshot (according to chat)
---
I believe it's available as an option in the basic wow UI, but not 100% sure. I'm using Shadowed Unit frames (SUF) for displaying my party, me, my target and target-of-target as it's a very neat and customizable addon. I highly recommend it. 
---
Target of target is just what it sounds like; another health/power bar will appear on your screen whenever the mob or player you are targeting has selected something as its target. Basically, if you target the boss in a boss fight and have it enabled, that health/power bar will be the one of whomever the boss is targeting at any given time; most of the time it's the tank, but can be useful if the boss for instance casts some Fireball or other spell on a random player. As an example, that way you can start casting a heal on your target-of-target when he starts casting the Fireball, and your heal, if well-timed, will land just after the Fireball has hit.
---
By applying HS before every OH hit, you can kick off the miss chance making the fast OH even better as you are more likely to fish for dodges which then get triggered by the MH.
---
Wiley the Black mentioned this in the letter to Gryan "defias are building a weapon of mass destruction and they have tunnels that goes under strangletorn Vale."
---
Did he make it to the water? :(
---
it's available only for limited time, although nobody can see it except you, but it certainly nice feeling to have such items. You know in mobile games and free-to-play games people pay real money to get something like this, limited Halloween themed items.
---
Nice onehanded axe there good sir, what is its name?
---
Would imagine that it's the same rule as for mages and warlocks, which is spell power &gt;other stats. Although with less Stam and int, you have smaller margin for error (if you pull more mobs or some of your spells get resisted etc.)
---
Put them on a keybind, put them on a mouse button, put them on a shift modifier, so many options.
---
this works perfect, thank you
---
Try on troll voice
---
Wailing helped me get off WoW as a teenager. I think I spend weeks trying to get through it, but we always wiped or the group fell apart or both.
---
You had him in the first half.
---
Maybe flip the page ?
---
You have tanking and healing covered, so one option is to fill the last 2 DPS spots with randoms.
---
As for 3-manning ... well, your class combination is lacking in crowd control, which sets limits as you can't temporarily reduce the number of active mobs per pull (in most instances). Sunken temple could be a good place for you (druid can CC the dragonkin - I think?), but that's a level 50ish dungeon.
---
Paladin healer, bear druid tank, warrior DPS would be one option. But as you said, that's not much damage.
---
Paladin healer with warrior and druids both going DPS is another option. Let the warrior get the aggro for lots of rage, druid deals damage in catform. This way your damage output is pretty good - but the paladin's manapool will set the limit. You can probably do ok in some parts of BRD.
---
I get your point but IMHO that's what single player games are made for...  I hope you'll find just others with the same attitude so there is no issue at all...  Seeing the downvotes and comments chances are good.
---
I tried, but I really didn't like the melee animation of male trolls. Maybe female would be better, but the walk like they swallowed a stick.
---
Plus I don't like the mount, the 60% is ok, but the fast up and down of the epic mount gives me headaches.
---
I interpreted it as leading 40 people is complicated at a high level, not that each individuals job is complicated
---
Stormwind
---
no... just no.
---
Why would you think it's an attempt at comedy? It came to me in a dream.
---
But it is funny that your only argument is whataboutism and that failed. Better luck next time. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism
---
I think that, at least for some quest items, there is a different pop up that shows up when you try to delete them saying that the quest will also be abandoned
---
This is me.
---
Why don't you do a 360 and walk away?
---
It's a rather uncommon point of view I guess but I tend to see the loot/roll system as the best. It's a bit like playing DnD if you're familiar with it, it's all about who has the "luck" to roll the item. If someone has crap gear, and one fully equipped wins the item then this is not unfair. It's just bad luck, it happens. 
---
I had a shaman on a RFD run with me who quit after I won the swine fists, he was constantly stress pulling aswell. He landed on ignore and we cleared the dungeon with 4-man we were all level 42-44 except the shaman who was lv 36.
---
This kind of behaviour imo comes from nowadays fast paced "get what you want whenever you want" mentality, happens IRL often enough that I see kids in the grocey store going bonkers when they don't get what they want the second they spotted it. I 'd like to imagine the shaman rolling on the floor yelling at the rogue for havine SwInE FiStS.
---
For what it's worth, I saw a screenshot of it posted on here. I realize that it's extremely poor evidence, though.
---
The reason being that there are only 4 ranks of Hunter's mark.
---
Well he said its good for "any class" which is wrong because the shield is unimportant. Its only good for mana users, specifically those for which resource management is more or equally important than raw power, which are pretty much just healers excluding holy paladins since those can probably get better sustain with spellcrit. 
---
Priority on this ring should always go to (heal) priests, shamans &amp; druids, and then maybe questionable second prio for caster dps, excluding warlocks.
---
I was a wod-legion raid leader &amp; a active raider in mop.
---
The fuck is a dkp system, loot goes to whoever can use loot the most, taking into account your input to the guild and what you've been given before, before every raid tier you give me a spreadsheet or a paper or something with the items you consider to be best in slot for you and where they come from, they're on your "need" list, everything else is on the "off spec/something else".
---
We also had a gearing priority of getting healers gear first if the item was needed between healer and dps, between dps/tank both on their need list it was a roll.
---
Trials had a 3 reset trial period, when the trial was passed they'd be on top of the list of people who needed loot &amp; be almost litterally showered in it, but for those 3 weeks there be no loot as your status and staying-power was not cemented
---
This story is basically every interaction I've ever had as an alliance player on a pvp server...
---
You're solo and encounter another horde solo and everything is fine. In every situation. Then they get 1 friend and out of the blue they will camp the shit out of you.
---
Learned my lesson, pvp servers ain't really for me because that kind of playstyle pisses me off.
---
Yeah I quit classic
---
Exactly Thx for sharing. Hope you'll find some more talkative group next time.  Seeing the reactions to my post I am curious how easy it is.
---
From my experience it still isn't worth it. You can make yourself invaluable and respected in the guild without having to do 10-30h of extra work per week organising/meeting/discussing whatever vacuous bullshit is causing drama this week.
---
Warrior tanks ftw, why didn't you choose rogue if you want to do dmg?
---
A make believe point system needed to purchase the loot after a boss kill. 
---
You gain it from showing up on time, showing up early, being part of the kill. 
---
Then you whisper the Loot Master and tell them how many of your points you are willing to spend on the loot.  The person willing to spend the highest amount wins, aside from times when there is a loot council involved.
---
It's not going to matter because battlegrounds are cross realm bruh.
---
Winterspring &lt;3
---
Don't know what your problem with 2h tanking is. Up to ZF this is ok im my book. The difference in damage is not much when you are not tanking more than 3 or 4 mobs.
---
I got one LOVE grinding and grinding and working hard just to get that 1 Upgrade or level.
---
Can confirm. I'm full Fury DPS and I spend about 95% of my time in dungeons as DW Fury tank in mostly DPS gear. Seems to work just fine, too. Healers tell me it's easy to heal me, and I'm often top DPS to boot.
---
Mind you, to be fairly easy to heal you gotta use mostly plate in 5mans (4-5% hit is plenty for most 5mans) and use Thunderclap, Demo Shout and know when you can let ranged keep aggro on mobs to reduce damage taken.
---
For instance, when doing Tribute runs and frost mage pulls aggro on a Reaver, let them have it and just go to town on it. It'll walk slowly over and die before reaching the mage, causing 0 damage to anyone.
---
Assistant to the general manager
---
I just took a minute or two to go through my quest log, moved all items from on-going quests to one bag, double checked any of the remaining items that I wasn't sure I could get rid of via wowhead and then went on a deletion spree. Felt pretty happy afterwards.
---
Who got them??
---
I run everything with our best dps war, he got me all my healing gear and I ran angerforge like 50 times getting him his hoj
---
Sac void walker for 3%hp/4sec, pretty stable regen in ds/ruin
---
I mean just in MC there are so many scenarios where you may need an extra off tank for a pack or a fury needs to pick up a loose mob. Ofc fury is best dps, but any warrior who's not willing to tank ever is not just hurting themselves but their entire raid.
---
Won't OP get a lot less waiting time in BG as there's a lot of hordes in queue?
---
Flamelash EU if you want to play alliance. There is way too much horde as it is.
---
Still have 1-3h every night.

If you're speed clearing, having a healer top you up then drink as everyone starts next pull is a good idea. If you're doing a dungeon on level or not in great gear, please do not do that.
---
Thank you for actually answering my question while everyone just comments on gnomes. I can see that looking wierd what about the tusks?
---
How long did it take you?  
---
While leveling I did it a 3 hour run - have never gone back there again..
---
Not sure for casters but for melee it's 0.04% crit chance for every 1 AGI. So 1% crit would take 25 AGI.
---
So flat 1% crit chance is surely better than a mere 5 AGI.
---
And since there is no stormwind harbour they're sort of just left hanging
---
Eeww. Man I'd have changed servers soooo long ago.
---
No underwear?? 🤔🤔
---
What's that addon that makes your unit frames have a Black border?
---
I'm no theorycrafter. Better go to the Fightclub warrior discord for that really. However you want 100% flurry uptime without overpower and too much rage gen that you can not dump it all below 40rage at all times except execute phase obviously, because this is roughly the cutoff rage, that switching from zerker to bstance makes overpower not worth it anymore. 
---
As long as you don't have these numbers achieved, overpower stays important to keep 100% flurry up at all times.
---
As the pthe of the guy said, your goal is to polymorph them, wait a second, get out of combat and drink and eat up. Then you have them. Don't let them stealth and vanish, so keep fireball dot on them, and just slow to oblivion.

Recently hit 60 on my mage, and I'm planning to respec as I'm very heavy frost, like 10/0/41. I'm trying to decide exactly how far into arcane I should go. It looks like the general consensus for optimal DPS is [this arcane/frost build](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#of0ycocquZVA0c0s), but that generally at least one mage per raid should be using [this heavier frost build](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#of0yc0cZZVA0coszAo) for winter's chill. I'm in a small guild and will be pugging for raids for now, so there's no way to coordinate with a group to determine who will be bringing the frost buff, so is it better to just go with the former arcane/frost build? I think I'd miss some of the survivability talents but think it might be more useful in most situations. Thoughts?
---
Tanaris. The best place to level!
---
A hobby is a hobby.
---
I love to play hockey as well, but none of my previous girlfriends have had issues with me spending 2-3 hours a night on playing hockey when I still did that.
---
They do however have an issue with me playing WoW. Or any game at all for that matter. And since I still work out and stay in shape, you cant really press the health difference between the two, its just a hobby I enjoy doing, let me do it.
---
and more people share sshots

DM is deadmines. Dire Maul is DME, DMW or DMN, depending on the wing you run.
---
I don't think touting illidan as a positive example is fitting unless there was an implied /s in there.  He ended up succumbing to the demonic influence of the powers he attained and pledged his service to the very same demon as the orcs after being banished by his people
---
It depends on the class. I think rogues needs more agi than warriors
---
Is this on Mirage Raceway EU ?
---
is still working or they remove it?
---
I had my Windfury totem sacrificed during a regular 5 man run after my ES was just too late. 
---
Needless to say the Rogue and Warrior were infuriated and smote the Satyr scum down with fearsome ferocity and speed after this insult.
---
That’s backwards for me. I never get anything done because I’m having way too much fun lol it’s also why I’m completely broke at level 60 and nowhere near getting my mount 🤣
---
True, I think rogues get more crit out of 1 agi than a warrior.
---
Basically the reason for me to hang out there sometimes because you have a private city for your own 😂😂
---
Never liked this dungeon. Its like a maze. Although Gnomeregan is the worst imo.
---
Yes I can confirm previous comments.  
---
I'd say usually around 1 hour, but depending on wipes etc. up to 2 or 3.  
---
If you lack time for that I can recommend Arena runs in BRD.  
---
Its more or less 8-10 minutes for one run and can be done by 3 people.
---
Death to all alliance.
---
I dont go to low level zones. so if i see an alliance, ill kill you.
---
Because you hate yourself. If you want an easier time just go balls deep into arms while levelling; it's way better solo, you can still tank everything fine, and prot only makes a noticeable difference in the 50-60 dungeons from what I've heard.
---
Okay 500-600 is probably as you said generous. I can also have 250-300 fights in dungeons which are more common. I put 500-600 because I have seen myself do this on meters in dungeons sometimes, a number which I was never getting anywhere near with affliction lvling spec. But overall my dps is vastly better as ds ruin. I'm definitely competing for top of the meter in dungeons sometimes even against mages. My gear isn't 'too' terrible I have a few preraid bis but no epics.
---
Wait the pets actually die?
---
One of these again huh?
---
Dude I just started leveling an alt and went to see how much feathers were selling for and sold them for 10s each instantly, people had them up for as much as 15-20s each. Wild
---
Yes, they seem to enjoy them at level 43 still, 35 happiness a tick.
---
That is a tasty profit you'll have eventually!
---
"no tank has held threat off me in a dungeon yet"
---
That's your fault, lol. If you're over treating the tank and getting hit, the healer has to waste extra mana healing you and stop to drink more often.
---
By trying to top the dps charts and taking aggro every fight, you're probably slowing the dungeons down quite a bit.
---
Don't click it until everybody accept!
---
*clicks*
---
Oh sorry guys I didn't know the quest would start if I just mindlesly click everything like the fucking mouthbreather I am.
---
Cue group panic and people telling the mouthbreather to try and abandon the quest only for everybody to slowly accept their fate and help the idiot on his quest.
---
He's talking about dodging trash in MC.
---
Unless it's a short fight requiring burst damage, in which case don't tap and just spam shadowbolt, use your brain and best judgement. Cast a few shadowbolts, use demonic rune, cast a few more shadowbolts, use mana potion, cast a few shadowbolts, use 2x lifetap. Don't life tap too many times in a row as it redirects the healers' attention to you instead of where it's actually needed (people in danger). Also, never go oom and lifetap to full, that's just nuts. Another note is to always have mana for at least 5 shadowbolts as you don't want to waste the debuff after a crit because you had to lifetap or have enough mana for an unpredicted "oh shit" scenario (to banish, reapply curse, deathcoil etc.).
---
im not saying it's impossible, im saying that ppl see it on youtube and they think that they can do it despite not having the gear/skill
---
Both DPS on bossfights and overall damage are important.
---
A good DPS will avoid unnecessary damage / overaggro while staying on top of fight mechanics and maintaining good overall DPS because they don't die to unnecessary crap. With focus on the "don't die" part. Only done MC/Ony with pugs so far (as healer), and it's quite easy to spot the difference between good DPS and morons who only tunnel vision the boss and DPS meter.
---
Was about to down vote this video, but then I turned on the sound and wasn't disapoint.

S is not needed. stop backpedalling.

For me it has to be The crater of Un'Goro. Not only is it the best quest zone, but it is also the first place I experienced horde and alliance working together to reach a greater goal.

Mages can do a DMN hyena clear, zone out, zone into DME, do a lasher clear then reset and repeat 5 times, because they are 1 instance so you only contribute once to instance cap

Layering definitely not off since 3rd of October. Just a few days ago a friend of mine got layered into a few hordes camping the Runecloth Bag pattern after joining my party.

Done Uldaman? Plenty of quests there, pretty good amount of mobs (XP) and some upgrades. Also, do Badlands.

---
Un'goro I walked from one side to the other killing everything in sight and loved every minute of it. It seemed every mob was a quest mob.
---
In your chest aka heart?
---
Lol exactly
---
Yes and no. Some guides are written by people who just want views / subs / ad money, while not actually knowing what they are talking about.
---
You end up gimping your character following those guides, and when you realize it's a pretty sour taste
---
That is normal. Spell resistance is not dependent on level that much but on actual resistance stats.
---
It's the same reason why I often can fear someone 20+ levels me and escape from potential ganking.
---
It really is what you make out of it. Obviously running dungeons without getting your drops over and over again can be a chore, but if you keep your head held high, use dicords and listen to podcasts/music meanwhile, I dont think it’s as bad as some people make it out to be.
---
Anything is an addiction if you let it.
---
I'm not really confident about explaining it in a way you can easily understand.    
---
But basically: create a icon weakaura, make the trigger (aura &gt; buff &gt; player &gt; "name of aura" &gt; trigger on aura not found) and then tweak the display of the aura until you are happy with the result.
---
I know this is an old thread, but I just realized this same thing today and there's so little discussion on this. I think it's something that blizzard borked and hasn't realized it yet.

it's killtrack

You are right
---
Ashenvale, still the most beautiful zone in the game!
---
I've the idea that a 19 druid with +arcane dam gear and talent into grasp and +10% moon fire damage, then stack intellect enchants and just constantly dance at the max distance spamming moon fire and rejuvenate, do you think this would be effective. I think moon fire coefficient is like 0.33 so even stacking 30 +arcane on like 6 pieces of cloth and leather only give 10 extra damage. So enemy twink with max Stam gear are gunna have 1000+ hp, so that little damage is worth nothing?
---
ngl, I sometimes forget my buffs. Stupid 5 minute timer.. other than that, the dude you ran with was a straight up asshole.
---
The gnoll tents found commonly in Westfall and Redridge are made of human skins. You can see facial features sewn in them.
---
Yes, we know. Yes, we're salty.
---
Checkout hydramist on twitch, he also soloed them as a shadow. It's pretty easy, tbh.
---
Do not forget adding DM to that list. LOTS of good healing gear.
---
Just make sure to mention your intentions to your group and, above all, your healer beforehand.
---
You should come to some form of agreement with your healer, since more often than not they are running any given dungeon for 1-3 pieces of gear. Snatching those would be really bad wuju unless you rolling is OKd - any other pieces should not be an issue.
---
wuut XD I need to get to your level, tanking is using 100% of my focus so far

Thanks ! :)

Fun fact, this entire area was supposed to be outside in a cove, but A. it ran badly and B. they couldn't figure out how to stop players leaving without putting up invisible walls. So they just stuck it in a cave with a big door.

They announced it on social media and the news ended up on this subreddit too. In any case, what else could they do? That's the best way to announce it and make sure the information is out there for those who want to avoid streamers.

I'm aware of this, but I don't remember vanilla casters having such consistently high chances to land spells on people dozens of levels higher than them.
---
can you post you actually specc?
---
Thanks, I might give that one a try later :)
---
I was expecting this to look like those other UE4 videos where they just rip assets from WoW or whatever, but this is a whole other level.
---
I'm fishing sometimes, can't really do quests or farm stuff in the world heal specced, its just to tedious.
---
Can you ambush - vanish - ambush before the target is considered as standing up?
---
Player spell miss is low. Level doesn't matter.
---
Also..can't wait when a few lvl 30 players band together to gank you to death.
---
Not that weird actually. Since rogues also get attack power from agility a higher crit chance per point + ap would be very powerful
---
Lol. I have like 6 of those. And I dont even need it on my main, I've got the +25 one.
---
Spoken like a true rogue right here.
---
What did you use?
---
Trying being level 60 on korean servers. The use gold dkp. It’s a bidding system with a gold pot evenly distributed at end of raids. ALL guilds do that. Most t1 pieces go for 600g while weapons like mage blade or perditions go for 2,000g. Basically everyone is just grinding gold all day everyday. As a rogue I live naked in brd like Gollum longing for my precious (perditions blade)
---
I dont have any debuff icons on my screen but on the character panel my stamina stat is in red and I have a minus 5 to it, can someone please tell me what this is?
---
thanks i’ll give it a shot
---
unfortunately that's a deeply ingrained social conditioning that's at the root of this.
---
If you come in looking confident, and do some stupid shit, people will still think you're great but yeah, fuck ups happen.
---
If you tell or show people you're not confident in your skill (for whatever, not only tanking wow), and then you do a little mistake, they'll think, and often express, that yeah indeed, you are shit
---
Early bloomers

This just isn’t true, these bugs are well known and have blue posts about them.

Oh man yea... :/

Elwynn Forst probably comes to mind.

Thanks for this

My guess is that you're remembering it wrong. I have memories of kiting high level allies on my mage back in the day.

Imagine this ankle biter running at you at full speed... terrifying... now imagine an army of them running at you at full speed...

The debuff is shared for all locks so having mana for 5 shouldnt make much difference
---
Pretty lame. I am Horde on Kurinnaxx and I usually whisper or yell or mock other Horde who  kill Alliance totally unfairly.

My thoughts to my follow Horde: have some honor, let the Alliance wuss live to another day, let them reach level 60 so we can crush them at raid entrances. For the Horde.

The scarlet enclave. I used to farm that place for chests and loot, and had a lot of great pvp times there too. When I think of wow, I think of that place.

We dont need more rage rogues. Its like 80% server pop.
---
Theres a reason crystals are 60+ gold on AH
---
While I 100% agree with this, the average horde member can't see further than their nose rather than months or years into the future so I feel like Blizzard should have also stepped in to remedy the balance situation but they also DGAF. When phase 3 hits, you will feel the queues for BGs.

it can check if its active, and if its not it will light up

"i am alliance and have only ever been ganked by horde, so they must be worse"
---
Fury warrior is one of, if not the best dps class in the game. To say warriors need to learn to tank is stupid.
---
That said, the warrior should have said "no, sorry, I'm not very good" or "no, I don't know how" or even "I don't have a shield" if it's high enough level that you need one. It's my go to when I can't be fucked tanking.
---
Imagine if Mandokir level-ups didn't reset on wipe...

You're missing out over call of duty annual turd right now.

Tribal has the most wanted set, being Devilsaur. Hide of the wild is bonus.
---
Its also the most chosen specialization, and the competition for Devilsaurs is fierce...
---
Id get an annihilator, to increase the raid dps.
---
Now if only it'd open with the version of the game I played last, I would be so happy.
---
Dark/Demon Runes and Mana Pots.
---
jeez thats a hell of an effort gratz
---
so you’re saying do winter’s chill for all-around utility? would the arcane be much worse? frost barrier and ice block would be missed but i generally prefer single target over aoe farming (i just suck at aoe farming)
---
If the party/raid leader was locked in an ID and you just enter you get saved instantly, not like in retail when you get that popup "2/10 bosses killed, you will get saved to this instance bla bla"
---
But if nobody had an ID before you jumped in, thats not right
---
Annihilator???
---
best gph in the game for druid that doesn't require that much gear
---
I just enjoy riding around collecting herbs or grinding some mob while listening to a good audiobook.
---
Where have they advised this haha. My boss would look so funny at me if I told him about my wow leading experience.
---
Tanks are actually extremely useful in pvp even if they arent great duelers nor dish out insane damage. But once we get bgs in p3 (where it really counts), they are excellent flag carriers with a premade team (second only to druids) and they are pretty much mandatory to win av. Once both sides start to rush bases instead of zerging in av, its usually the side with the better tank &amp; more healers that wins.
---
Either way, you should never decide something like this based on whats better, easier or "needed", just what you find more fun and what feels right for you.
---
Showed the video to my friend and all he could say was "That looks easier than the normal way."
---
Uh, yeah, sure. You're a real winner. lol
---
That is, under the assumption that there are multiple warlocks in the raid (which is not always the case as so far there are very few warlocks in raids) and not accounting for RNG and warlocks simply being far from hit cap at this point of the game. As I said, always use best judgement in the given situation.
---
It was a long way up to 42 and from there it was grinding ZF to 49. After that I did Sunken Temple and got half a level each run at 3 hours and in 52 I went to BRD and farmed that to 56. Now I'm trying to do LBRS to hit lvl 60. It gets easier and more fun when you get 52. That's what I think. And I used longer time on 30 to 40 than 40 to 50. Will probably hit 50 to 60 fastest of all.
---
Yeah dot and run. There are some YouTube videos about it.

Teebus Blazing Longsword for your first and last question

Yepp, i found 0 while leveling / grinding, but these little bastartds were kind to me. 2 is not the best (destiny, hammer os the northern wind), 3rd was the plate shoulder, that is a nice catch. Although there are some groups with zero loot.
---
My guild has this shit on farm.  There's 4 tanks and they don't need help.  Anything I do that reduces my dps is hurting the guild.
---
I mean I'm willing, but required not to respect.
---
Winterspring, it’s soothing, beautiful and the place where I like to ding lvl 60
---
I’d like to hear another one. A N O T H E R   O N E!!!
---
The rarest bop epic and rarest mount are the same most likely. Deathcharger's reigns is i think a 0.01% drop chance. You could clear strat UD 1000s of times and never see it.
---
BUT THE BUTTSTABS!
---
What the Ironforge guard in the top left said is probably the most boomer thing in the game
---
Which there's nothing wrong with wanting to experience all the classes. They all have unique play styles, lore, and overall experiences. I just call a duck a duck and the typical "alt-o-holic" has many characters that are never level capped. Logic dictates if you truly wanted to experience all the classes you'd be pushing all those characters to max level to experience what can only be experienced at max level (or slightly under if carried) which is raiding. I have nothing against anyone playing the game any way they choose I would just hope however they play they truly enjoy the experience. To each their own.
---
Orgrimmar
---
Unless you'll just be casually pugging or find a raid that doesnt mind the wasted debuff slot from mortal strike, I doubt you'll be raiding as arms. Because without MS you'll be competing with the full prot tanks on the dps charts.
---
Yes. Twinking was very common in other MMOs at the time. And they didn't always have the concept of soulbound gear, so if your twink had the proper armor proficiency it could wear hand-me-down raid gear...
---
wtf?  where do you ever need skinning for?   herbalism will give 300% of the income skinning would give, so ust buy those few skins you will ever need.   (or take skinning on an alt)
---
Wo wo wo wo wooooo, I can out a poison on my throw weapon!!? How did I not know this! Thank you
---
I actually did just that. Had "WoW Officer &amp; Raid Leader" or something like that in my resumee when I applied for my current job about 7 years ago. The interviewer asked my about that of course, so I explained to them what that includes, basically the text from OP, and it looks like they liked it since I got that job.
---
Note that I applied as a Software Developer, so even if they didn't play WoW themselves, using something like this in your resumee is probably safer in a nerd environment \^\^
---
Leading a raiding guild really does teach you some soft skills that are valuable irl
---
hell man, that's a lot worse..

Just look at the shape of the different letters:
---
The *M* Stalag*M*ites points upward, just like the object.
---
The *T* in Stalac*T*ite points downward.

On a more serious counterpoint, none of the feats mentioned by OP happened face to face, or had real life consequences to failure.
---
What level are these mobs?
---
Personally I enjoy farming consumables, but only late at night where I can relax a bit and there's only a few others around.
---
My favorite place is Undercity.
---
It really gives the vibe of a hidden city for the forsaken, under the core of the old human capital, a place where you would not look for them. The whole sewer thing fits right in to the undead aspect. To add to that, the apothecary really completes the vibe.
---
Yes.
---
Aren't those the mages?
---
this is nuts, congrats bro
---
&gt; Problem is, even in those cases, it’s 50/50 shot.
---
Absolutely not. Ever since they addressed the order of events FD+trap is reliable as long as you avoid moving/dots(?)/pet attacking. A macro can cover a lot of this.
---
Or just on follow.
---
There is, *faerie* fire
---
Fair enough, thought it was epic like bought mount. I was wrong. Possibly fits under rarest item in the game though.
---
Yeah, it's some pretty solid proof to throw em both in trade. Good thinking from them. A practically unique screenshot.
---
Nice
---
Im playing but only rarely at the moment, I'm waiting for the BGs because my character lived in them and it took me close to 6 months of uni playing to get to 70. First epic mount was the frostwolf howler and remained My primary mount until flying took over. Absolutely stoked for some classic PvP.
---
Little dude was just flying along the ground
---
I am burned out of classic personally. It's just not fun to me and the time it takes to do anything means I barely get anything done.

So tuesday and wednesday last week I was averaging 1 crystal per run, through about 20 runs. Thursday friday I did 38 runs and got 1 crystal just after midnight on wednesday. Needless to say I don't run it anymore.

I asked a lot of people who had been farming it and they reported similar things. I believe it was stealth nerfed.

I think with the new aggro mechanic the caster heals less. I dont even bother ooming him
---
Ha, be prepared for comments where people assume literally every guild is corrupt and unfit for master loot.

buying comparable water from the argent dawn vendor would cost way more, feel free to buy your own water.
---
**Now kith.**

I’d say the exception to this can be PVP. Yes it’s a grind if you want it to be, but can also be a competitive pvp’er in classic with a basic pvp set, a good spec, and the right enchants, that is a relatively short grind. This may not hold true now that everyone is much more hardcore and likely to be raid geared but that was my experience from vanilla.
---
This can also be true for twinks. You have to grind to get the gear but since there ends up being mostly twinks it can become pretty fun to just fight. My main gripe with this is that it’s poorly balanced and there are usually one or two OP classes at any bracket. 
---
Okay I admit as I am writing this I am seeing a lot of grinding in the subtext but anyway, I like the feeling of an end goal that isn’t a constant carrot on a stick!
---
Yeah it’s called fuck off
---
There's few items that have minus stats.  
---
IIRC -5 stamina/+15 spirit is reward from one quest in Darkshore.
---
Sounds like we're out to fight against Classic, rather than play it.
---
I was about to raise the point about jumping in water.
---
On my screen I'm standing jumping, everyone else who jumps in water is doing a horizontal almost breaststroke style jump, like a floundering fish.
---
I wish it was reversed, it's hilarious to watch
---
"there's a mafia on my server so it's the same on all of them"
---
If I were you;
---
Get herbalism &amp; mining on a gatherer char. Possibly druid. You can't activate mines and herbs in same time but you can easily see mines on rocks.
---
Skinning &amp; tailor for a farmer. This could be your main because of skinning. Mooncloth is the 1st item that will people always need because of bags.
---
LW &amp; alch on a level 35 unused char sitting in capital city to open mails &amp; AH them. Also login to refine salt &amp; transmute.
---
do you have kids? You probably wouldn't say that if you have 'young' kids
---
dampen magic helped me a few times while solo questing/griding.
---
Bloodfang seems good. Medium pop most of the time, inching into High on weekend peak times but never had to que. H:A ratio seems pretty balanced, but I'm Horde so that might mean there's a slight edge to Horde and I'm just biased - hard to tell. But no distinctly noticeable power shift IMO, at least. 
---
Have a look!
---
Thank you. This neatly addresses the confusion between the two while simultaneously ensuring you spell them correctly. This is how I learned it back in grade school.
---
It's 2019 dude you don't have fackbook?
---
I didn’t event mention the hunter who didn’t send his pet in except on bosses
---
Loch Modan by far
---
Cheers! I’ll look into Booodfang as well, appreciate it :)
---
Players everywhere making cancelaura macros.
---
At level 50 you should have enough points to take both DPS and tanking talents.  
---
Just skip "Improved Shred" and "Feral aggression".  
---
Something [like this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/-5050520303222151-05)
---
How much is the Undeath to water on your server?
---
Oh lol, what’s going on there! Haha. Yeah I know what it is now. I’ll fix it for next version but also te-comment here with a temp fix you can use straight away. Brb.
---
The Hinterlands have such a great atmosphere to be in. Also, I really enjoy the troll stuff
---
News radio was the shit
---
Sounds the talk of a no lifer.
---
the only reason would be if you plan to farm devilsaur otherwise why drop herb?
---
heavy leather cheap af
---
You can also just do like me and fail because you where not prepared at all but got far enough that another priest finished the event for me while i laid there dead on the floor!
---
does she go catform on you?
---
Similar experience. I started with a warlock got him to 20. Then made a warrior and got him to 54 but finally decided I’d had enough lol. Currently have my rogue at 35 and loving it. I’m easily moving through quests that my warrior had a very hard time with. I know they are overpopulated and will prob have trouble finding dungeon groups but I’m having a great time and plan on taking him to 60
---
That is fair. Tell that to the skull-rogues on duskwood graveyard.
---
Im not gonna lie you had me in the first half, For Azeroth brother.
---
Da horde bee familiah wit em doors mon. If we be wantin' to do da dead mines we musta' entah tru Stv coast swehm by em.
---
Ive leveled a human warrior to 40, decided I want a orc warrior so rerolled and now im 43.
---
That stuff happens to both sides. And as you're clearly displaying it feeds into a cycle of killing people who can't fight back. You are part of the issue you are describing!
---
That is a huge waste of time, but if it makes you happy do it!
---
I'm gonna wait till the competition. Hopefully they will go up in price.
---
slightly false, there is always 2-3 rich thorium veins, not stable 3
---
When it rains it pours lol. That sucks man but at least you know who to avoid now
---
You pay, you play.
---
There is a harbour?
---

---
I had to slow down from 55-60 because I was levelling too fast for my taste. Restricted myself to about half a level a day because I thought I'd lose interest as soon as I dinged 60.
---
Turns out I was completely wrong, still having fun. Also levelling an alt now for professions.
---
Ah, alright. Thanks
---
I just rolled night elf for this reason, while I enjoy PvP a lot I like choosing when I want to participate lol. Sure, I still get ganked here and there but shadowmeld saves me most of the time.
---
I don't hide when it's only 1 person at equal level but if they pick a fight it's on. (I am not one of those attack on sight maniacs)
---
Currently at lvl 42 tho, I assume everyone in my range will have it worse when honor rolls out and the bored 60s will grind lowbies.
---
Reminds me of an old animated movie where the main character (in fantasy middle ages) was blind and there was a chicken that was fused with an axe. So an axehead chicken.
---
You have time, just uses a lot of water as you cancel so many of them
---
It's like 4 g max a piece
---
I upvoted you , what now 😘
---
Are you sure no xp is needed?
---
&gt;She would watch Teen mom

&gt;  
---
&gt;and eventually had a kid with him 
---
you instantly get locked to an ID when you enter the raid and a boss has been killed in it
---
STVietnam.
---
There are 16 debuff slots, so why not fill them all up before making a choice to not apply a slow because a more powerfull slow debuff is up already, makes little sense to me.
---
But isn't Bloodvine like phase 4 or 5? It's ZG pattern right?
---
https://media.tenor.com/images/1693287d8ab01005e1eaa8dd6d628426/tenor.gif
---
I almost immediately equipped it. My main is a lock so mount money isn’t too tight, and the style points!
---
Sepulcher or Silverpine Forest in general. I really liked the questing in this area and as I play a forsaken I feel the most affinity for this area.
---
I've never played Vanilla, started somewhere around WotLK, and boy do I have a blast in Classic. Clearing MC and Ony for a while now while levelling an alt.
---
Okay, guys. Is a group seen as a unit, like, they spawn together. Or is a group like a group of gnolls just camping together?
---
Can i still pull one gnoll, get aggro from 4, but then they reset if i dont hit them?
---
Approx. salt and mooncloth was 20g a piece. Strangely cured rugged hide was 4-5g.
---
Dailies were ok for me as an alternative from dungeons to grind rep. You get exalted, your're done.
---
Now it's for a low chance gear upgrade, resources for a mission board that I barely touched for 3 expansions because it's not meant to end, or for a neck piece we'll throw away at launch for next expansion.
---
The solo grind alone per day can take a couple of hours before you even think about group content. More so if you fell behind in previous expansions and just want the completions.
---
Yeah it is, that's why it's funny
---
I am, but being heal specced means questing or farming for relevant mats is really tedious, so I got not a lot of stuff to do besides group content. I'm fishing from time to time, but otherwise I am dependant on groups. And with the abundance of healers this time around, thats the worst role to get a group, I could have easily created a sunken temple group out of the 3 healers that were looking for one in lfg yesterday, four if I include the group that apparently had some dps and was just looking for more dps and of course a tank.
---
Well that's retail for you.
---
Elwynn Forest. The music gives me goosebumps and I immediately feel like a 14 year old boy again.
---
Yeah. Whenever i hey hardcore camped at red sickness spot by skulls, I always tell myself I actually chose a pvp server and I deserved to get camped for 30 minutes.
---
Imagine opening 5x clams and finding nothing but pearls
---
Youre complaining about people complaining now?
---
On a lower level, i tried to tank WC as a lvl 18 druid, with a mix of leather and cloth armor, thinking it would be fine.
---
Fucking raptors kept calling for reinforcments from miles away, i actually saw some of them run through the whole starting area and gather a whole army of raptors right off the bat (weird that it actually called them from that far but oh well).
---
Wiped twice because i could not tank more than 3 mobs, and we couldn't finish the dungeon due to one person having to leave. Pretty bitter taste.
---
While i might have been a tad low level, sometimes not knowing what you're capable of tanking sucks. And yes, i was a shit tank that run. I pulled carefully but sometimes it's not enough.
---
2005 WoW players: stop backpedalling you nub
---
2019 WoW players: imagine using W to move forward
---
It's weird cause you can't really craft anything great from it
---
*laughs in eve online*
---
Yeah it's easier to just macro all the stances, my taunt button puts me in def stance, charge/op/execute battle stance, and ww/intercept zerker stance, no need to use different buttons to swap.
---
Tanris. It is both peaceful and dangerous, there is mistery (Uldum), one of my favorites dungeons (Zul'Farrak) and of course, there are pirates. I also loved Gadgetzan when I first visited the town all those years ago. The parked mounts outside, the goblin machinery, the Armorsmith quests. The whole zone brings back so many great childhood memories.
---
Shit. You actually dont have a life do you. Sorry didnt mean to poke a nerve there.
---
Ok awesome, this gives me a lot to work from, thank you.
---
Brill because of the atmosphere.
---
As a warrior is there any addon that will tell me in a very obvious way when to use overpower and when to refresh battle shout?
---
What’s better while levelling - spell/healing power or raw  attributes like Spi/int? I’m a level 42 priest if that’s any indication.
---
Also does spell power boost healing? If not I take it something like the shadoweave set would be poor for healing dungeons?
---
**Why** did Blizzard reduce the spawn time on Devilsaurs?
---
ikr? why tf kill lowbies, i will never understand
---
just kill ppl around your level if you want revenge, unless you are so bad that you cant
---
Nope! but its a lot more common than you would hope to think
---
Yea, like thousands of players worldwide.
---
Find yourself a social guild. We tend to fish or grind while we talk about anything and everything while we get a group put together. The thing that makes me love the game the most is the social aspect.
---
Being within the rules and shitty behaviour are not mutually exclusive concepts
---
lucky safari!  we've spotted the elusive pvp cringelord, ladies and gentlemen!  soon to be followed by aimless rage and full on keyboard warrior anger about a 15 year old pixie elf simulator!

Tauren make druids in T1, with the t2 helmet, as they really lack leaves on the set and the helmet is ugly as F on a Tauren...

thats not a lot of players

Reagent for priest and mage slow fall.
---
I literally took a two week break and just came back tonight and my guild cleared MC and Onyxia in under 3 hrs and I got t2 pants from rag. I thought I was so behind but now I’m almost ahead lol. In bfa the thought of HAVING to do my island expeditions or leveling my neck was so annoying after the 3rd week. Classic is here to stay and these pants will prob last me one whole year lol.
---
Open up this file  
---
C:\\Program Files (x86)\\World of Warcraft\\\_classic\_\\Interface\\AddOns\\SlashFour\\Events.lua  
---
and change line number 79 from this:
---
`if GetNumSubgroupMembers() == 4 then`
---
to this:
---
`if GetNumSubgroupMembers() == 4 and LFGFrameNotifyToggleFrameCheckButton:GetChecked() then`
---
Sorry about that. I'll put the same fix in the next version.
---
You did yes (pick the server)
---
Opt in servers however don’t have this problem
---
Attacking oposing faction (or other wipe methods) engaged in a world boss fight is bannable.
---
Mages and priests need to use them for their slow fall / levitate spells.
---
They may be used in some alchemy recipes too but I'm not certain on that.
---
Oh No.... The casual scrubs has invaded ubrs. Good Thing i havent been needing stuff from there in a month or so
---
Worst part that flips is calculated on client side, so other peeps can't see your flips in a rows. 
---
Worst part of the classic.
---
Take into account classic is 15 more people, and even less loot than that compared to later expacs. If the loot process is a black box of loot going out to seemingly random people based on the guild leaders own opinions on which of 40 people contribute to the guild and who can use it best, people will always complain, with a dkp system its a clearly gameified system designed to make it completely transparent why someone got the loot (because they saved all their dkp for the last 3 weeks).
---
It is cross realm pvp anyway. So it will most likely be instant Pop for alliance no matter how the Server Balance is
---
My first 11 DM E jumpruns resulted in 7 crystals. Which was pretty lucky. Have had a bit less luck after that but i've atleast had 1 every 5-8th run.
---
This happened in one of my raids too. ML opened a ticket about it the GM just said “No, reading that it is a hunter item is part of the game.”
---
Not that big of a deal but on the same note... it’s not that big of a deal for you to just transfer it eh mr asshole GM?
---
There's a timer for battleshout on the regular UI and overpower lights up when you can use it
---
Who said anything about “mutually”.
---
Made the best of date night with the wife?  The way that's worded makes it sound like you'd rather play wow then have date night with your wife.  I could be totally off base here but that sounds like a recipe for disaster.
---
Bags. I was spam selling level 40 arrow quiver for 3g a piece. Maraudon quest bow is kinda bis in those levels, that's why it was 4 times expensive than ammo pouch. Week later quiver price went down to 30-40s because everybody started crafting bags instead of gear.
---
excuse me cow person is absolutely a pro
---
The 2h axe from BRD is also quite good, 
---
I would think the staf is the better of the to eaven tho you are far from hit cap with it. Getting a better axe shops be a big prio, and try and find one more hit so you are caped with axes
---
The guild final chapter on Lucifron also has both bindings + the 100% drop from Ragi. Desperately waiting for p3 now
---
wipes though...
---
Yeah economy changes fast as said by frostadamus
---
Incoming walloftext about our...difficult spec choice.
---
First off: The Details addon now lets you see people's talents when you inspect them, with no option to disable that feature. Downgrade your Details addon; I installed a version from early september to get rid of this shit.
---
Then get as many of your BIS BoEs as you can; felcloth pieces and the robe of winter night. I hope you've been smart and have been collecting pieces with spirit&amp;int on them, because mixing those with your statless +shadow gear lets you overcome the "shadow has no mana" stigma during chainpulling in dungeons.
---
When you want to run something, either start your own group or whisper the person you wanna join something friendly that clearly states that you're a geared shadow priest. If you get any doubt or shit thrown at you, try to disarm in a friendly jokey manner. Like when they say shadow doesn't have AoE I reply "No but I can apply SwP really fast :)".
---
Mage water is life, but keep 2 stacks of water on you. During AoE pulls you SwP the elites and mindflay, keep rank 1 MF keybound for when you're going OOM and find a SwP rank with a good balance between dmg and mana cost for your gear level. I like spamming rank 4 or 5.
---
When a healing piece drops and the healer doesn't need, grab it. A shadow priest can easily heal any dungeon if they spend the time getting gear and heal efficiently with properly downranked spells.
---
More like playing 30 min between long ass AH sessions.
---
Scarlet Monastery - the whole complex is just so beautiful and the dingeons are amazing as well. And tue best thing is - the best warrior set drops there, the scarlet/Herod helm and shoulder set!
---
Also if you damage mibs on the way you increase the distance that they will go after you. So sounds like its fine without any more detail sounds ok because thats how you get dragons raiding sw and orgrimar. Also thorium point has a gy so i see no big loss of spending 5 extra seconds to ress
---
that was sick
---
At least we know exactly what to expect now that there won't be class changes. Want to raid as a ranged dps class? Don't play a druid. Want to tank? Don't play a paladin.
---
Winterspring.
---
In Germany it almost never snows to Christmas and farming there herbs and mining is just super smooth and gives me good vibes.
---
What does more DPS if both rogues are equally geared in MC/Ony(Full BIS Gear) Combat swords or combat daggers?
---
Only if you are standing back to back.
---
Red means dead. Don't matter u 20 or 40 or 60

I am rather goal-oriented person and I raided with likeminded people for 8 years or so (tbc - warlords).
---
Each raid patch from cata to warlords was -&gt; gear up main with 2-3 farmraids -&gt; get main bis list -&gt; have 1-2 rads to rank up wol for lulz -&gt; sell achievements, mounts, gear to buyers.
---
So first you gear up your main, then you rank wol in ranking raid, then you either continue raiding for profit or relax and enjoy what's left of your life for free. 
---
Trust me, on 7/7 7hours raid schedule raiding stops being fun rather quickly.
---
Here in classic I can't imagine a convo between 2 raiders of the same class
---
-hey you already have X, please bench yourself for this boss so I can bid dkp if it drops
---
-no, because raiding is fun for me
---
If this is the case, that's fine. However, this seems like very important information to include if you are giving tips to OP on how to handle tapping since it changes the variables to consider by a whole lot.
---
People playing a warrior in a nutshell: LFM TANK, XXX RESEVED.
---
Literally nobody wants to tank even if it got them instant invites to any group. Fuck I hate it. Don't roll the fucking tank class if you have no intention of learning how to tank.
---
Whats the spec u running? Dps/heal or deep resto?
---
It's a chat scanner, doesn't matter if others use it or not it will read LFG/LFM spam in all your channels.
---
Hi fellow warrior, I just found this yesterday. It's actually built into the client, you can enable it by going to main menu-&gt;interface options-&gt;combat and then check the Enable Floating Combat Text option.
---
Then you can enable fading auras, I think, for finding out whenever the battle shout fades. There is also an option for reactive spells and abilities, which tells you whenever you can use overpower and execution.
---
Battle for classicroth
---
Decent Mage =\= Magetard. Funny you assume every Mage is a Magetard just because you are one
---
Priests who have like 1 patch between BC and WotLK where your unique damage ability is OP?
---
i play horde on a pvp server (eu Morgaine), and get ganked by alliance much more then i see horde jumping alliance players. most time when im in a group or in a questing zone with alot of horde around and a single or few alliance, the alliance are left alone and everyone is chill, if the senario is reversed alliance usually always attack.

- The mounts from the TCG but assuming they're not going to be available possibly the mount from Baron or the epic parrot pet is quite scarce

- Again if there's no TCG spectral tiger then the at mounts or Deathchargers Reigns. Excluding the obvious black qiraji mount from the AQ event.

They uh.. burned it down a little.

Dungeons are decent gold, and it helps gearing your guildies (assuming you raid with them).

Thanks! Too many realms to choose now haha. I like that it’s good to hear it wasn’t a complete wipeout in stormwind with the horde pushing their way through.
---
Be Orc. Orc Skull Thick. Stun Short!
---
Hold/disc is actually pretty good DPS. Don't underestimate priest leveling. It's one of the fastest classes to level because there isn't any downtime.
---
mc is more like 2-2,5 hours for most guilds tho
---
ony can be 10 minutes if shes on farm, 20-30 most of the time
---
You can go hybrid feral/resto, I'm not sure the exact spec but you can tank and heal with the same talents - not as good as dedicated feral spec or dedicated resto, but probably the best for dungeons and raids if you don't want to constantly throw gold at the trainer.
---
Well thats what addons are for, convenience. Having a full questlog and 10 questitems can get tiring.
---
Not to get too serious, but it doesn't work like this because when you screw up hard and 'wipe' in work, there's generally not the chance to simply res and keep trying again and again.
---
I rarley attack anyone from the opposing faction (except if I can mind control them from the boat or lava in brd) but if someone tries to harm me while I'm farming, I'll make it my mission to harass that dude as long as I'm bothered to.
---
Ashbringer, bc it has best balance between horde and ally (~50:50)
---
which shouldn't be the case since this was a new raid, right after instances were reset. there's literally no way to have killed a boss inside
---
Yeah...can't you stop playing for a day?
---
So it's very likely ElvUI. It did already have some significant issues in the classic version, and it takes them a while to fix. It's just a minor inconvenience though, nothing major.
---
The Ironforge Airport, I had my first truly memorable RP experience there back when I was a babby in Vanilla. I had no idea what was happening at first, we were roleplaying a group of Dwarven Mountaineers on patrol. It felt like they were leading me to some super secret area that we weren't supposed to be in. It sparked my game-long obsession with exploration. Good times.
---
Give more love to Thunderbluff
---
Somehow i only see the data of consumables used while infight with a boss. I cant see anything that happens the seconds before the fight begins or am i just blind?
---
Lmao ya one of the big reasons was i was tricked into a pirate gnome...was so cute seeing Tauren horde running from me
---
Having a kid at 24, yeah, *totally* a teen mom.
---
Wait, the horde can sell the +25 fishing pole through the xfaction ah?
---
No API that has been implemented for this kind of task so to anwser your question in short, no, no there is not. ^^
---
I didnt even know gts250 was a thing
---
My guild does bosses extremely fast with no problems, but dealing out the loot and people fucking up on trash is the main time consument
---
Do you realize that asking for no changes would mean that this wasn’t a thing?
---
if you are putting points into frost and can grab them, ice block and frost barrier are must-haves. You don't do any dps when you are dead. Mages who don't have these talents generally are the ones who care about maximum raid dps over everything else, including survivability and any sort of pvp or solo play potential.
---
Fun is the reward. Just because there isn't any honor doesn't mean they isn't a reward. This is coming from an alliance holy priest on a pvp server.
---
First time player too. I got a lock to 46 hated it. Got a druid to 50, still play him, and now I'm working on a rogue which is 26 atm.
---
it saves 250 gold if I am correct (a 150g item and two 50g items)  bell, chisel and something else)
---
the second warlock has to join your 5 man party in DM.  Usually you tip that warlock 50-75g for the service
---
Looks dead to me. /s
---
We literally just declared that we'd be doing loot council in my guild. I'm an officer but the other votes overruled me. I'm kinda worried about it.
---
Yup.
---
Undercity. The nostalgia from the very first time I entered there still hits me every time.
---
The dbm giving you notifications about when bosses are engaged on is just because you are in the same guild and the dbm announces this. My guild has 2 raid groups and dbm will always tell when the other groups engages/kills/wipes on a boss.
---
Even if just a lone dude is pugging some raid, dbm will announce it to you if you're in the same guild.
---
How can they tell if you will be polite or one of the hundreds of people who gank on sight?
---
Can confirm. Sometimes stopped my fellow horde from murdering alliance by telling them "yo that guy is a chill fella"
---
Im gona organise my life around ppl camping me in video game
---
sounds legit

do you pay for that?

I did that ! Double HoT on every pull. Not enough for big packs though :(

Thats really cool, sharing leveling memories with randoms that wind up being guildies and u meet again!

Spirit is very important due to spirit tap. For dungeons you want more int since max mana helps for big pulls. Don't worry about spell/healing power until a bit later when you can stack more of it, something like +9 alone wouldn't do much.
---
Spell power does boost healing (it's usually worded as such), but things like shadow damage/frost damage etc do not.
---
In mind 40s you can stack shadoweave and dreamweave set for good damage, though of course shadoweave doesn't help you heal at all.
---
Not true at all. I got rid of retail and only had Classic - it never showed up. In fact this was something that people have been bringing up since the start of Classic, that they wanted to see their subscription time left on the classic client launcher.
---
That's no excuse. Here's a simple scenario, one or two of the tanks can't raid this reset. Do you not raid because your fury warriors are morons?
---
Just describe it as you was managing a club or ESport team. That is much easier for most people to understand. If they ask more to it. Then just talk about the skills and challenges you have encountered and overcome. It is those skills an employer are interested in.
---
Or duelling outside of IF. Breaks my heart that they removed the possibility to duel inside IF. :(
---
Exactly. Neither side is more honorable than the other. Wpvp is rarely fair.
---
Woa well i was slow to 60. Pvped alot so had 10days played at ding!
---
I’m a new player and I can’t see what’s not legit about it
---
As a rogue it's a rogue...he might be the first cheap shot of 2 or 3...kill him/her
---
Ofc every guild has designated tanks. However you need backups since they're never gonna be available 100% of the time and every pull isn't gonna be perfect 100% of the time. It's just common sense.
---
The Fargodeep Mine.
---
Exactly what I was thinking I’d love to see some info on gear and spec
---
Lol, obviously you've never seen some of this skimpy gear transferred to a male toon, especially a male gnome, or else you'd be asking for eye bleach. 
---
Also, I guess you've never heard of a little class that's a staple of fantasy RPGs known as barbarians? You know,... large, hulking, muscly, manly men in a fur loincloth that wade into battle in a blood frenzy. Conan the Barbarian? Oh, ...ok, it's just females.
---
Imo it is the opposite currently. The risk of being killed by a random from another faction is really low (maybe 5-10% of other faction people I was near while we were killing mobs attacked me) whereas the risk of retaliation from killing the other faction is extremely high. 
---
Half the time I killed an ally, I was killed by him or other alliance later.
---
Stormwind. It made the game feel HUUUGE when I first stepped in
---
I don’t think you can turn in cloth for this rep
---
Ah yes.
---
"THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A MAGE WEAPON, SCREW ALL WARLOCKS ROLLING ON IT."
---
What does it matter? Waving will cause only the gankers to kill them, stealthing will cause both the gankers and polite passerbys to kill them.
---
Basically a mage with more raid utility.  Thankfully you are one of the classes that can do real damage without having to use up debuff slots.  That is kind of the problem a lot of the other hybrid classes fall into.   Enhancement shaman?  Can't use their stormstrike because it leaves a crappy debuff.  They are just a windfury bitch.   Druids?  Can't rip/moonfire/insect swarm to have any kind of uptime on their damage.
---
tough deal, this aint bfa =p
---
No turtles made it to the water
---
and still only 63g...   poor druids....   
---
(don't trust that bank alt, one day they become alcoholic and all your gold is gone)
---
The funny thing is though, this is exactly the behaviour Thrall hopes for. I mean the reason we fight the Blackrock and Onyxia is to help the alliance. Because aside from minor skirmishes we live in peace with them.
---
Classic is dead
---
Unlearn tailoring. It's a useless profession once you made your truefaith vestments. Pickup alchemy for gold making (it's not a useful profession on alts since too many recipes drop in high-level instances). Or engineering for PvP.
---
Last night Azure mageblade dropped and the loot council used like 15min to give it out. Then the person who got it hadn't learned swords and instead of waiting until after Ragnaros he HSed to sw to learn it and we had to wait another 10min for him to get back.
---
It does damage, but afaik weapon proc debuffs are low prio and will fall off before anything else.
---
IF auction house bridge. Because I love to feel the crowd :)
---
Thank you for posting this! Quick question, I notice you don't kill the third boss,  Zevrim Thornhoof. Any reason why? You can dot him and drop down to line of sight his sacrifice behind the pillar at Hydrospawn. There is also a Hellcaller pack and a book spawn up there as well. Do you think it would be worth it kill him as well?
---
You mean.. from one of the most popular addons in WoW?
---
There is a comand you can run to increase screenshot quality in game:
---
 /console *screenshotQuality* 10  
---
\*i think
---
I chose pvp as it is just a cycle of life and death. I love engaging horde in endless combat, it’s exciting when I down one a couple levels above me and it’s fun mind controlling noobs into their own demise. Every time a skull begins to gank me I yell ead myass which was translated from a website as such and /spitting on them before I die. It is why I signed up, and I form a raid group from /who and destroy them accordingly. be smart, be tough, be with the alliance or with your maker. end
---
You can very easily kill the fourth boss as well, if you kill one more hellcaller pack and one sneaky satyr, she's just up the ramp. When at her if you have a ranged with lots of threat gain they can basically kite her up/down the ramp and not take any damage from her casts. And the imp is easy! If you have a warlock, just snatch the sneaky satyr and put him on the imp while dotting
---
I imagined they would have the load balancer after the login server, not before it, which also requires two login servers.
---
Yikes. Imagine treating a 15 year old video game like an actual job.
---
OP you couldn’t have spent all that time working part time somewhere. You would have made actual money + met cool people along the way.
---
E
---
Imagine rolling alliance in pvp server.
---
When I build my 5 combo points and I'm ready to unleash my fat eviscerate crit and I get a huge PARRY, i truly go insane.
---
Swords.
---
Goldshire
---
Been a while since I played a hunter, but wouldn't you just dismiss your pet and don't recall it until you've got his food ready?
---
swords
---
but here, you can check for yourself: https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/
---
deep balance, VERY deep balance
---
BRD, easily the best designed dungeon in all of WoW history.
---
&gt; Mc is like 90 minutes
---
I am sure some guilds can do it that fast 100% of the time, but I think 3-4 hours is a more reasonable estimate at this stage of the game for semi-casual guilds.
---
the layering issue is different! yeah, the trade window will close if you accept an invite and get layered. but what happens to me (and to OP I guess) is the window is open, there aren't any invites or layering going on, it just closes on its own with the Trade Cancelled message.
---
You only have yourselves to blame for faction imbalance when you gank lowbies or corpse-camp as a 5man group.
---
PvP is only sustainable when both sides have fun. The fairer it is, the more likely the under-numbered faction will stay. The more you gank lvl 40s in STV, the less lvl 60s you'll have to world PvP with in 2 weeks.
---
Of course. But HealComm isn't available through Twitch, so if he wanted that specific Addon he needed to know how to do it without using the Twitch client.
---
Lol wtf get the hell out of here xD
---
If he wants to spend his time like that it is his own decision. Are you his mother or who are you to tell him how to spend his time?
---
honestly
---
When our priest got the MC drop we went to Winterspring as mage/lock/priest group and farmed demons quickly. As a solo mage I can farm the melee ones but not "easily". Problem is also they hit hard so you can't get hit.
---
Probably because the people getting camped endlessly just quit the server/game lol
---
Dunno guess what makes sense to me is to drive and steer with the mouse, then your whole left hand is free to cast spells
---
I'm n the flip side. If I was interviewing you and you told me that I would be impressed, but I would also expect you would resign from that "job" for this one.
---
Its annoying that people choose their faction simply because of racials, thats how we get the imbalance on servers =/ i personally have played horde since vanilla and never changed because i think they look cooler and are more intresting :D
---
well to be honest, i leveled my warrior to 30, then switched to mage up to 21, then my hunter to 33 and now i'm somehow leveling a warlock which is 12 now.
---
wow, nice, I wonder, is this doable on ally side?
---
How are you teleporting pet back to hunter? Some advanced moves!
---
there is no book spawn and it costs too much time for a 2g itemdrop per hour.You need 18-20 Minutes for a run with this Boss.
---
With my route you can kill Hydro 5 times in one hour for the Essence of Water.
---
Essence of Water 15g-20g on my Server.
---
Booty bay
---
No shit! You remember what happend last time they brought any fire into darnassus?!
---
Sure, but it can't go down while it's dismissed and it doesn't run away either. So as long as you're quick on feeding immediately after, should be fine? I remember doing that when desperate in vanilla.
---
The best press Blizz has received all month lol
---
Druids, hunters and locks have no downtime with proper resource management when farming, so for them there's no real reason to downrank mobs. They won't be stopping to eat anyway.
---
Awesome, thanks dude. Great mod otherwise!
---
WC barely takes an hour. I powerleveled from 17 to 22 in half a day by just doing WC.
---
Yea because that never happens the other way around. Comments like these are useless.
---
&gt;Deviate Delight
---
Lol, there's actually a server named like that ? That's awesome.
---
Nah, I like long dungeons as well - I just hate WC. Uldaman is... quite alright.
---
tbh you sound like you dont follow your own advices so why even give them
---
How can I make it work with a target as well, and not only mouseover?
---
60, 29, 14 here.
---
But you can try to sell your pass for the bow.
---
if you dont have access to MC recipes, there is no reason for you to take enchanting at this point. Keep Tailoring until you've made your Truefaith vestments, then drop it and pick up engineering. Get a gathering profession of your choice to get some money, and once you've got enough drop that gathering profession for Blacksmithing to make your anti-fear trinket if you are really serious about pvp, otherwise never drop it.
---
Comments like these shows the stupidity of who ever wrote it. We are all humans playing an MMORPG, alliance and horde both play the same, there is nothing in a faction that changes your playstyle one way or another..
---
Definitely definitely get the epic mount. So much faster and will make life so much better. Sure it’s less important for pve, but if you do most any kind of farming -it’ll save you time.
---
My absolute favorite place in Classic WoW has to be Azshara for grinding and ambiance as well as easy herbs and chests. With a close contender being Gadgetzan for fishing.
---
This is why I break my fall with a charge on one of the mobs below on my warrior. Takes a couple of seconds to get out of combat and mount up, but no troll will get me killed with a buff.
---
Huh.  Massive necroing just to be a douche!  Get a life, loser.
---
what
---
I just log in to check my auctions and raid :D
---
https://imgur.com/a/fQ720pE All book spawns
---
Makes sense about the essence of water. I am seeing a book spawn up there on this guide, maybe it is incorrect? https://imgur.com/1r1Ux7F
---
thank you very much!
---
sure, with time.
---
but if you read the article (a lot to ask for a redditor, I know), it doesn't mention having to pay money (hence it listing social media (free) as examples)
---
Uh, okay? Weirdo.
---
Gnomes need to embrace death
---
Its lame to kill low level players, no matter how you try to twist it.
---
crude, but much easier to remember: tits hang.
---
DM tribute was definitely nerfed. I'm not talking about lashers. More packs, king unkiteable, etc. Of course we found ways to make it work still but it's no longer the old version.
---
Duskwood gave me the most fond memories of being a noob back in the day. I have to admit I still get excited when I see Stitches!
---
So many people in comments have legit never tried tanking before lmao go give that shit a try with some monkey ass mage dps and come back, it's legitimately a joke even trying. Best results I get is as arms or fury with a 2h just trying to outdps the dps to keep threat.
---
thank you!
---
its probably duoable on ally side with a warrior/priest or warrior/druid combo, but for that you would need to find a boomkin :D
---
also im not sure if priest as enough range to reach the last trash pack before angerforge
---
Good idea selling the bow, what would you sell that for?
---
He is doing a little too good job, except for how long it takes :P Imo he deserved the sword but instead he choose two guys to roll for it.
---
I am doing it the hard way, BS + Engi lol. So far I haven't spent much on them though, they are at 156 and 157 respectively. I can feel the prices ramping up tho but I will be at 300 eventually.
---
when i was in WF i fed my boar shit-tons of boar meat.  he loved it
---
this is exactly why vanilla pvp is a joke. The recent pvp dueling tournament proves this.
---
99% of players have engineering. Some classes/specs are so badly designed that the duels would look like shit if players were not allowed to use engi
---
And in Classic, the grind is actually rewarding. Yeah you killed that boss 30 times just to get 1 specific item, but that item is best-in-slot and you won't get anything better (at least until the next raid is out).
---
In Retail, you'll continue killing the boss because there is no real BiS anymore. You might get the same item again with a higher titanforge, or better azerite traits, or better secondary stats, or more gem sockets...
---
In Classic, you grind reputation so you're able to ride a cool mount you want, or so you can buy an important recipe that allows you to make equipment that you can actually wear (or sell).
---
In Retail, you grind rep for... what exactly? So you can buy items that you'll replace after 2 weeks of raiding? But more importantly, you grind useless levels for a non-unique artifact, and you absolutely have to do it if you want to be able to use the traits on your azerite gear so you can do 0.5% more dps. (At least Legion's artifact weapons looked cool and a lot of them had important lore behind them. The Heart of Azeroth just... exists.)
---
!eciN
---
Akama, Archimond, Kil'Jaeden were some major encounters or leading the players though long chain quest. I wouldn't say they were irrelevant.
---
Some minor guy were also draenei, like malchezaar as last boss of Karazhan, the reputation of the Aldor and such.
---
Is that even worth it for a shadow priest. true faith vestments.
---
No, but I mostly go with my guild, a guild we sometimes work with, or people on my friends list
---
I give this story 5/5 /laugh/spit’s.
---
Oh don't get me wrong I main a mage, and I agree the other 7-10 mages I am forced to raid with are garbage and I'm really not sure why.
---
Do you have 3/3 Imp. Blizzard? If that's the case your CoC was cast a second too early and didn't apply his slow effect as the Blizzard slow (65%)  was still effective and couldn't be overwrite by CoC slow (60%)
---
&gt;SomeRogue, you're too close to the tail move towards the front please.

&gt;SomeRogue, the tail, dude, move to the middle.

I’ve actually came across an applicant that put “Guild Manager” on his resume.

This is a bit silly, but when you right click their portrait, do you get an option to add them as friends? I'm not sure if it's specific to some addons, but I was added this way once, and added another player too, but I know some people don't have this option in the menu. You can basically chat with the opposite faction without ever leaving the game.
---
Don't you always get the meat regardless ?
---
How were you able to use Mana pots and still use immo potion? I had used 2 and then noticed my Mana was at the point where even if I got the upper limit if the potion I wouldn't waste any Mana but then wasn't able to use immo potion for the full 2 minutes which was like 3 spawns of skeletons.
---
and all the centar skins...everywhere
---
"that means you could be WORLD first to get thunderfury"
---
Sorry to break your bubble, but I had both bindings 3 weeks ago :)
---
I think he means the rep you need exalted with Darnassus to get Tiger Riding Skill.
---
I despise every single warrior that's exclusively dps. "nah bro, im dps spec i can't tank" christ.
---
 Level is gray? Just stay away. 
---
Level is green? Man, don't be mean. 
---
Level is yellow? You murder that fellow. 
---
Level is red? OMAI WA SHINDERU.
---
Levels a skull? Prepare butthole.
---
Yeah that was at the end of vanilla and early BC. Most lvl 60's were geared to the teeth for PvP and I remember we were a handful of twinks 59 having a lot of fun in Alterac.
---
I've killed Voon 12 times. He just refuses to drop his neck. My guild has started a weekly ony run and I've started joking I'll get the Ony Tooth or Eskandarr Choker before the Talisman of Evasion drops
---
Woven Ivy Necklace is an exceptional leveling quest item btw
---
A DKP system can be setup so that only contested items alter DKP. Not only that, the guild can set their own rules on specific items so that a hunter wouldn't have priority over a tank getting Thunderfury.
---
DKP is not a strict system and each guild can have their own rules on how to use DKP. DKP is just an easy to grasp system that makes loot more fair than random rolls.
---
Scarlet Monastery. I spent most of my 30s here back in the day, still have so much fun running the wings.
---
I pay blizzard an extra 20% on my monthly subscription, its not much and it gives me better odds on the dice rolls, plus I get to win all draws.
---
I have a much more difficult decision to do. Herb/Alchi at 300, but I would drop Herb for Engi (mainly for PvP) .. 
---
However I can´t get myself to remove Herb xD .. it makes good money
---
You're welcome, im an officer in one of the guilds that ran through at 9:30 server time. We wiped whatever pathetic attempt that was at brm camping and did two mc raids in about an hour each. The went to ony and did 3 19-20 many people onys. The server might be imbalanced but that's something you really only notice Solo or small group.
---
Fuck those elementals. There are not even enough elementals for one player, but there are always 2 or 3 from each faction. Plus some high level undead/gnome rogue who has his way with the lowbies. Droprate is listed as 1/3 but if those fucks are not even alone there and share a respawn with the normal elementals...fuck that quest.
---
Hell, I was a Vanilla guild master.
---
Of my solo one man guild.  Doesn't mean I wasn't a total noob.
---
Lmao what? I tested with farming herbs In both classic and retail and from my experience 100g=100k. But maybe it depends on server and so forth. Getting 15g from farming herbs takes 20 minutes on my server farming ghost mushrooms so I doubt that will be 100k in retail.
---
I really enjoy MOBA's but it's true. They breed toxicity due to the mechanics currently employed.
---
Mulgore and Thunder Bluff. Most beautiful looking zones that I never visit because they are so badly located.
---
That's completely inefficient and will slow down the run. Siphon life is pretty bad and drain life is just straight up terrible dps.
---
Spot on nailed it
---
Question concerning dagger twink weapons
---
So low level dagger "Bite of Serra'kis" sounds like perfect OH untill 40+ (untill "Black Menace" i guess?). Is there a better easy to get dagger early which Im missing?
---
rank1 corruption lasts 12 seconds
---
not sure if it's worth it though
---
Yeah, he fail-clicked, as you pick between 1 out of 5 rewards (int, spir, str, agi, stam). 
---
He also doubled down on the fail by using it on his helm instead of enchanting someone elses gear with it (which he could've done to recouperate most of the cost).
---
Maybe on private Servers.
---
But i am not sure.
---
After ~30 Kills i can say there was no book but on all other spawns i find a book.
---
Dont roll a pvp realm if you dont want to pvp.
---
The Barrens, because it really takes me back to the good old days 😁
---
Another rogue that cant vanish, dodge or open lockboxes
---
I do not own any expansion nor whatsoever World of Warcraft besides of classic and I guarantee my time left is displayed, actually it was already displayed during the beta back in may / June. I'm playing EU but beta was global.
---
They were singular characters correlated to the draenei race, but they also weren't the draenei playable race - they were eredar and brokens, with affiliations and storied and places of their own, and while they are relevant to the draenei history they aren't for their spotlight or development. Totally different thing than Kael for example.
---
It's like saying that tbc had a strong night elven focus because of Illidan and the blood elves - they were related, but the correlation is terribly weak compared to raidin quel'thalas itself.
---
I was victim of this once, I laughed all the way down when my dumbass realised what he'd done.
---
Well played rogues.. well played
---
Prayer of Healing only heals the group where your target is in.
---
I love that mount. Congratulations!
---
In our guild, we clear mc in under an hour with less than 40 people, 1 phase rag since week 3 of classic. Our locks don't life tap in raids, they use dark runes and major Mana pots. This combo pretty much restores 75+% of your Mana without any wasted gcd.
---
Well first and foremost Blizzard doesn't send messages like this forcing people to visit a site or they'll be suspended.
---
Second of all, look at the spelling of Blizzard. And the accented i character.
---
Elwynn Forest

It’s so peaceful and has this beautiful vibe.

Two boats. One to Auberdine in Darkshore and the other to Valiance Keep in Borean Tundra.
---
Exactly. That's why a fun guild and some guildies and friends to chill and mess around and quest with was so important to me. We also had a fun server.
---
This \*is\* how life works. If you want it to, you can make even the most mundane things you do on a daily basis sound good on a CV. 
---
Being a guild leader in WoW is no easy feat. To avoid bias, one might avoid saying "Oh, I was a guild leader in Classic", just like said person managed to explain all of his management skills without mentioning WoW in it. 
---
You climb the ranks by selling yourself. This guy does it right.
---
References that can be followed up only matter if someone actually does so. For an entry level management position almost nobody does. 
---
To be honest I used my raid management experience to qualify for my first management position. Yes it took some explaining and if you pull this you should be able to explain to someone who never touched a mmorpg before what a raid is and how it requires management of people in 2 minutes or less.
---
Everyone needs to start somewhere and yes in most cases a raid leader will have more management experiences then someone who organized a 2-3 person team in a job environment before. And that is the usual start for management.
---
Some very interesting and useful addons in here that I didn’t know I needed. Thank you!
---
Also looks beautifully classic and minimal, I like it ^^
---
Would you mind giving me the addon names? I can't do it but I know an alliance that added me before. It must be an addon that allows them to add me.
---
Sucks the talent tree pictures no longer work.
---
Outside the instance portal i sheeped one and frost nova’d the other. I ran allllll the way up the chain, out the door, and they popped up behind me chasing. I spammed blink on cooldown until I gave up at thorium point. Does that sound like normal leashing to you?
---
you change your route for this item, 40g is a good price i think.
---
First off: Blizzard would **never** contact you with a serious topic through a whisper, they send it to your email.
---
Secondly: It might be hard to notice at first but the name of the scammer is "Blizzarrd" with two 'r's.
---
You could alter the name slightly
---

You need exalted with darnassus and winterspring Sabres for this?
---
&gt; Whenever I fight hunters their Feign death causes me to drop target immediately.
---
Not the point. The issue is you can't instantly trap after.
---
&gt; "Crippling" feels like a huge exaggeration
---
It's literally the only way to get away from a melee that's on top of you. It -is- crippling.
---
I'm war tank, I remember a hunter from ZF, he was body pulling adds while we were already on difficult packs, caused 2 whipes like this.
---
Second corpse run, he just stays in the entrance, not follow us the rest of the group. We wait 5 minutes, still no response and not moving. I /say the others should we kick him ?
---
Unfortunately, one of the other guys was his friend apparently, says "no"
---
I say ok, and we wait another 5 minutes until mister hunter finally wakes up and joins us.
---
First pull, I open a pack, he stills agro constantly, his pet agro a pat, it's "only" almost a whipe this time, 2 dead.
---
Suddenly mister hunter tells me, in group chat "so, you wanted to kick me, boy ??? you're trash tank anyway"
---
I said sure, thank you for your feedback, love you all. Quit group, went out, picked another group and this time did a fast and clean ZF run, not even had to wait 2 minutes to find another group.
---
Currently you get locked, even with all bosses alive.
---
Gadgetzan 
---
Because of the weather
---
duoed it as 2 rogues, 4m per run
---
How do you figure? 
---
The proc rate is insane and with little to no ICD, yielding it insane mp5 during combat.
---
How long does it take for the body of a dungeon boss to despawn if not looted? Is it possible to clear a lowbie dungeon and then log into the alt and loot things from a certain mob/boss? They'd be in the same group of course.
---
You mean queue times right?
---
"Layering"?
---
Currently you get locked just for entering a fresh instance.
---
Five curses and spite live in each gnome this truth can't be ignored
---
&gt; You’re breaking out of FD early because you’re using the “camera look” 
---
That's not the issue. The issue is the delay between FD and being able to trap.
---
If I didn't know who started it I'd probably just kill the Alliance.
---
My alt mage just hit 54. Is farming DM aoe pulls for exp dead?
---
Most BoE's from AH arent all that spectacular, hence why the arcanist belt shows up on AH in the first place  its not all that great, i think epic mount takes prio here, as it helps our in both pvp AND pve, faster farming, more speed to get away from or get close to the enemy faction ect!
---
\&gt; With that out of the way, there is  still no easy answer to if or when you should use either of these buffs.  That decision is up to you to figure out, but before you can do that  you obviously must know how the spells work. I hope this helped with  that.
---
There is a very easy way to understand whether you're supposed to use it or not.
---
1. If the tank is tanking MELEE mobs mostly, cast amplify magic on him.
---
2. If the tank is tanking caster mobs mostly that do damage similar to the reduction applied by dampen magic, use dampen magic on him (this doesn't happen often, but it CAN happen). However, it is usually easier to deal with this by using interrupts (shield bash from the war, mage counterspell, rogue kick etc).

It's that simple. It's situational and its effects can be IMPRESSIVE when it's used right. Take your typical strat undead trash pull, where you've normally got like 8 mobs, 2 out of which are casters. You can amplify magic on the tank, thus giving the healer a very easy time - as long as you also interrupt the casters (counterspell at the very least), it should make healing trivial.

&lt;- Manowar, mage :)

Engineering for pvp is realistically a ”must have” 
---
So couple Engi with with either herb for gold or mining to gather your own mats.
---
laughed irl after reading the title
---
Berry nice. Very ok!
---
This is not “playing warrior in a nutshell”. This sounds more like being bad at the game in a nutshell.
---
If I'm not mistaken, I believe one of the class leads or the actual GM of Death and Taxes got some crazy 6 figure supervisory job just from his leadership experience in the guild sometime after Vanilla or BC.

Feathermoon would make a way better night elf capital imo.

---
I've spent some gold on big buys/upgrades
---
Got the devilsaur set near the end of leveling. It's amazing for cat leveling and threat as a bear
---
Bought wardens staff when a great deal fell into my lap. Bis mitigation, even if its replaced by the AQ hammer+spell hit offhand for most fights later
---
Made Cloak of Warding right after DM dropped, as I'll be wearing it a while
---
Also spent much smaller chunks for upgrades along the way, but generally I'd focus on epic mount, enchants, and consumables, try to farm out your prebis where you can
---
Story adds up.
---
I have a character that is saved for Onyxia's Lair (Onyxia is still alive)
---
I also have a save to MC with all bosses alive.
---
Wow thats cool, gz!  :)  
---
I'll start doing lasher runs as soon as I reach the required 5.700 mana.  
---
Already looking forward to it.  
---
Do you have any special tips? Or just follow the general youtube guides?
---
Soooo, what I always wondered, how do you MC and bud someone, MC is a channel, so how would you cast someone during it, a buff let's say.
---
Damn, ok.
---
\^this guy gets it, i'd also take good people no matter what they wanna come as every day of the week. Who gives a fuck about 10 mins if you aren enjoying it with people you can talk some shit with.
---
Westfall. Simply because it’s my earliest memory of WoW. I was a Paladin and I was struggling with a quest to kill a mob in a barn, someone offered help and asked if I wanted to tank or heal, in which I replied, ‘I don’t know what you mean?’. A lot was learnt that day.
---
I think MS boost stacks with travel form but I could be wromg
---
Why would you use rank 1 over 6, though?
---
yea and the quests award less rep on pservers, so if you did dungeon leveling you will need alot of runecloth to get that rep up.
---
Thanks dude, very helpful.
---
Oh is it meant to be referring to being able to turn it in first in phase 3? I guess I misunderstood then. I thought it was about the first completed set of bindings.
---
All I can say in response to this is that, as a busy person I never engage in world PvP so as to not waste time reaching 60 and I always spare alliance players when I see them.
---
For every alliance levelling player I have spared there has been one lvl 60 alliance utterly destroy me and teabag me until I get bored and exit the game 
---
I still don’t kill low lvl alliance because I am rushing to get to 60, and I regret this from the bottom of my heart. Especially when I get ganked. 
---
But vengeance is near. I am keeping tabs and the alliance will be completely obliterated on Dreadmist-EU, young and old. Be ready.
---
Also sell everything, if you have quest rewards you can’t use make sure to pick the biggest weapon as they sell for more.  Some weapons I’ve picked up vendor for 70s
---
A plea? I would sell it to you for 45g and 45s and lough at you! Why would you even think of him or her sending it back to you for any lower price? You messed it up.
---
Macromanaged over 200 individuals? What raid has 200 people!? And even in the old school 40 man raids, you weren't doing that yourself. You had an officer team. Smh this post.
---
Lovely story you've written. Relate to you in a lot of ways. Happy to hear your relationship now is stronger than ever. I read the whole original post and the one critique I could give was that it would have been nice to have a couple of more paragraphs on your relationship with him. Would've helped it feel rounded out and fleshed out toward the end. 
---
Beautiful story nonetheless. The kind that makes you want more of it.
---
Its enough to have a couple of blues.
---
-First rogue pops all cds and evasion and tanks angerforge
---
-Second rogue waits for 1-2 ss hits then pops all cds.
---
-First rogue vanishes, when he is about to die but pops out of stealth immediately and continues to hit the boss.
---
-Second rogue pops evasion as soon as he has aggro.
---
This way the first rogue will die 100% of the time but you are sure to kill angerforge. Since you get a blue everytime you can easily cover the repair costs.
---
It is important that the second rogue doesnt get the aggro before the first rogue vanishes or its a wipe.
---
Thank you
---
yes i am am 31/0/20, i have pretty much preraidbis spelldmg gear + staff of dominanz (somewhere around 330 spelldmg i believe)
---
but this run can be down with far worse gear, the only real issue are angerforges adds that might start healing him if you are not fast enough.
---
I always do that aswell, i guess i spent a little too much on profession recipes haha. At least i'm 200 lw now !
---
I had four golden pearls in my backpack to post. They sell for about 10g each on my server. I was rushing to post a lot of things and did not check to see if Auctionator split the stack of pearls prior to me listing them. Instead of listing 4 pearls at 14g each, I was quickly notified my auction of 4 Golden pearls was sold for 14g. Oopsie.
---
Yeah it sucks but it makes it more bearable(pun intended?)compared to same lvlv and above imo
---
Booty Bay all the way!
---
Y-you already have HoJ
---
Weapon skill =\= +hit
---
To be fair, with how threat works thats... Halfway to optimal. You put corruption on each mon and then start your rain of fire. Unless theres a mage in the group to control then then rain of fire away. VW sac and hellfire if your healer is overgeared or a god-tier player.
---
Dude, my hero thank you
---
Lmao!!!!
---
Ashenvale, great atmosphere and music.
---
Same I just crafted the barbaric shoulders for myself and the chest that gives you +14 agility.  Was meant to write that in my OP but forgot.
---
Gnomish is worse because you don’t even see them when you’re close to the bush
---
Thank you!
---
I will try it like this thanks!
---
Winterspring - after the dead lands of Felwood and the primal wilderness of Un'Goro, it comes as a much welcome change of pace. I just love it.
---
thats pretty cool aswell, didnt know two rogues could do it
---
Any good rogue would dot you before their stun runs out.. or at least should be trying to
---
You just have to accept that this is part of life and only way to deal with it is to embrace it. Life is not about having fun.
---
On my server alliance are meek and friendly when they’re green to you but if they’re higher level or significantly outnumber you they will kill all desire in you to play the game. Absolute scum and I regret every time I have spared the life of an alliance player
---
&gt;just to be safe I always ask highly geared prot paladins what their rotations/strats are and I'm doing the same thing, so I know I'm not in the wrong
---
Yeah just a quick comment about this, the fact that they are geared might be the exact reason why what they are doing is not neccesarily the best thing you should be doing. Rotations and talents can change with gear. Idk if thats the case with pallys, just take care and make enough research :D
---
Officers look to who for orders? Their commander. That’s macromanaging
---
4hm isn't a good representation of vanilla raiding. It's the exception not the norm.
---
Stun inst short,
---
Stun has a chance to not be stunned.
---
Zug
---
I know you are trying to be funny, but I am dead serious and I don't think it's rigged in anyones favor. Simply believe it's made so that some stuff happens ofter(people rolling the same, close to eachother or very high/low number- 100 or 1 mainly).
---
&gt; Ran off on da plug twice.
---
I googled this to figure out what you were on about and now I'm only [more confused](https://youtu.be/K-8GWoC8Fp0)
---
WoW is actually a great way to learn some organization skills. Managing a huge WoW Guild is not much different from managing a small company.
---
My favorite place has got to be Ashenvale. The look of the forest paired with the wonderful ambient music is just wonderful
---
Lol. I had the window small and I didn't even notice that those were 4 chars...thought that's one.
---
Yeah if it isn’t broke don’t fix it!
---
I'm currently mining and skinning, but prepared to drop my skinning for something else.  Was hoping to go engineering eventually but for now, and for the purpose of making some $ I'm wondering if I should just go level up herbalism.
---
Any areas you prefer?
---
People have been making comments on reddit forever, that’s nothing new. I haven’t seen a comment like this before though.
---
Thanks for putting it up! I had majority of those already installed, but picked around 5 new addon and replaced my current bag addon with Inventorian, it's really nice!
---
Found a few gems I will add to my list. Big thanks for the work putting this together with descriptions and links!
---
Thorns doesnt work like that in this version
---
Some people were on 56k and couldn't handle cities full of ppl
---
We usually do the 3 kegs first. Kill the Boss.
---
Then go upstairs. Give the beer to the guy.
---
Then move towards the stairs again (as far away from any of the guys in the bar) and wait for the Event to Trigger.
---
Then we pull Phalanx to the stairs and kill him.
---
If you say there were Mobs together with Phalanx then you did something wrong or something bugged out :o Usually we don't pull anything with him
---
Remind me
---
I haven't tried Lake keltheril, maybe I'll try that soon.  Especially if any good resources are nearby!
---
Not taking away anthing from being a guild leader but you would hire someone if they said they have a lot of experience managing other players in an online RPG that you gave never heard of, provided they answered your questions?
---
Whats the chance of a casual finishing naxx one day?
---
That was where I was up to during the original release before I stopped playing
---
Its a meme.
---
"Oh my God" by Kaiser Chiefs...there was some druid PvP Video.
---
Today I understand how bad the guy actually played. 90% of the video consists of him killing lvl 59 chars without equip.
---
meanwhile, tirisfal glades has bodies hanging from trees everywhere enough to simply ignore them.
---
How the hell does one not learn all the available weapon skills? It literally takes one second when you are passing by to learn it.
---
Also, couldn't you just cast a summon on him so that the whole thing takes much less time? You can persimmon someone in an instance if I am not mistaken.
---
Literally depends on the server. It was October 3rd for a handful of servers.
---
That's one huge list, a few new and/or forgotten gems in here. Thanks a lot!
---
UI looks very clean indeed.
---
dal rend offhand too
---
It's good but other racials like the human weapons specs are just better
---
Hahaha fucking troll
---
Shit what’s the class color in chat console command? I meant to save it the other day when I saw it on another post
---
i´m 52 and consider rerolling just cause I started disliking my name.. but I think I´m too deep in

---
I think my favourite place in Classic so far has been Duskwood. It's a really creepy area and having to run off the road from Stitches is cool
---
Well, the youtube guides what ive found were from private servers and there were some missleading infos. They started the run from the east entrance and jumped down from that. You cant do that in classic you will aggro one of the big tree elemental from the two sides. Go from the main entrance you can jump down from there easily. The patrols move much faster then in the private servers, but if you find your path rutine not hard to avoid them. About the gear, you just need intellects and some spell dmg. I have truefaith vestment chest which gives no intellect, so on these runs i use a green chest item with 21 int on it, it was 1.5g in ah :). Gl hf!
---
Honestly I'd argue that the game is designed from the ground up to be addictive. MMORPG's like world of warcraft require a large volume of players actively playing to function.
---
T2 warrior helm on trolls makes their nose stick out lol
---
Hehe, the night DM opened a massive Alliance raid held the grounds completely denying Horde access 😍
---
You're starting to sound like you deserved it
---
If you’re applying for a job in Esports management or similar area this might actually be useful. Hard for people who haven’t played the game to understand I guess sadly
---
Wait, are you implying there's other way?
---
Finishing? Kind of low, but it depends how long Naxx is out for before we turn to TBC or Classic+ phases.   
---
Naxx requires a \*lot\* of effort, but mostly this is about getting people to show up. If you have 40 raiders coming two nights a week who're all attuned and geared, you'll probably get 15/15 within a month. Getting to the point of attunement and gear might be a struggle for a casual if the phases are very short, though.
---
Exalted with darnassus is needed for the tiger riding skill so night elves don't need this
---
Exalted with the wintersaber is for the mount itself
---
Yeah man. I married a girl I met in WoW, we stopped playing for quite a few years and now we're playing the game again in the evenings.
---
Point is, as long as you're not neglecting your RL relationships, WTF does it matter what you do with your free time?
---
YOU THINK YOU DO BUT YOU DONT
---
Still looking for an addon which lets me know which questitems aren't of use anymore. They take a lot of bagspace.
---
Yes. It was a bit short-sighted, but the TBC hype was probably too ridiculous of a money maker to pass up.  
---
Naxx was out for like, what, 5 months before TBC? Not much point grinding out your tier 3 when you know you're not gonna get to "use" it.
---
Because I love the UK and US mentality. :) 
---
European MMO community IS, at least from my experience, like I described my fellow Germans (quirky, soft, always a bit of cringey).
---
Thanks for all the advice everyone.
---
I decided the mugs should be the same size once I saw the paladin nursing a huge frothing pint I realised that it would be a much daintier affair for the Tauren.
---
Plus just look at the hat, he's clearly a refined gentleman.
---
Guess this blizzard employee is full of shit then https://m.imgur.com/a/axMA2QL
---
We just love peace in reality and mmorpgs as well. That's why :D
---
Haha, never knew that! Amazing. Wonder why it moves you off the bridge though, that's weird.
---
Lol, sounds good. I hope this applies to German server population.
---
Where are you from?
---
ye this is pretty cringe
---
Ah yes preserved nerd discussions
---
Lol... Fury rogue = Combat warrior
---
Aye found that the hard way lol
---
Yea well, why not go on a lovely, peaceful PvE Server then?
---
Rank 1 water is fine for him, he just needs to drink a few times more!
---
1. 1st boss: Downstairs first at the beer-crates, kill the 3 beer-things and it will summon a pack of mobs
---
2. 2nd boss: Also downstairs, talk to the goblin NPC closest to the beer-room, he'll run with a group at you
---
3. Go upstairs, sell your inventory to the mage-looking goblin and buy the pattern if he has one
---
4. From the mage-looking goblin, buy Ale/beer
---
5. Give the Ale/beer to the dwarf npc opposing the vendor, do this 3-4 times and he'll start walking towards the big stone-giant / Phalanx and open the door
---
I don't get this. I love all of WOW. And if I am not enjoying something then I stop doing it and i find something in game that I do enjoy. And if I can't do that, i log out and go do something else.
---
Any tips for making gold as a rogue? I've got mining/engi, but I've probably mined over 150 nodes and still no arcane crystal.   
---
And I utterly HATE pickpocketing, it's so damn boring. I like killing stuff and getting loot, is there any good farm spots for loot?   
---
Or perhaps anthing else that doesn't just include pickpocketing? :p   
---
thanks!
---
Imagine complaining about elemental water in azshara as a shaman.
---
Kargoz is my jam
---
I feel so bad for everyone trying to level in searing gorge or burning steppes. Basically every level 50 zone is gonna be a war zone
---
I came here to mention this. I'm Heartseeker Alliance and it's super depressing how outnumbered you guys are. I really hope they find a way to even it out as Classic goes on. I'm a rogue and i've stopped 95% of my ganking just because of OP's reasons
---
From what I've read so far you're on the "quirky, cringey" end of that community.
---
I'm pretty sure a stable job to pay the bills is more important than wow
---
I’d do to. I work with sales forecasting and I swear, TSM 4 is more complicated than my forecast excel files for work.
---
Awesome video! Thanks for sharing. Which combat text addons are you using?
---
Let's pretend you're not an idiot and your statement is relevant. Now you're telling me Warriors hit paladins in full plate and a shield for 2k? Lol fuck off
---
Blessing of sacrifice is so paladins wont get cc. Yeah 55 damage or even 1 damage, you moron, will break sheep.
---
*and quirky &amp; random xD, and everybody seems like they’re either a brony or furry*
---
Im so happy that you have your own containment server.
---
Leveling to me isnt the game, its a text of patience mostly. I have fun playing the game but leveling hardly qualifies as playing to me.
---
You lost me at watches teen mom.
---
sadly, yes. Green items from quests were better than nearly everything.
---
water walking gives nothing if there are people on every single spot
---
Now that is done, I need that greater stats on chest done plz Fletch \^\^
---
Cant confirm. Am german and (try to) kill every alliance I see, except low levels.
---
I did this on zandalaar tribe in charred vale with a horde warrior.
---
He got my priestly attention my clubbing me once, backing away and pointing at the lvl 28 mob.
---
Pretty sure blizzard doesn't give a fuck about this and neither should you.
---
Trust me I have spent hours up there for days in a row with people adding me to tell me they reported me and blah blah.
---
I can tell you 100% they never even warned me let alone an actual punishment. And also it's rare to get a kill from up there if your target is actually paying attention and trying to stay alive.
---
Just get good basically.
---
The fire elemental and the marshals spawn if you saggro the bat by attacking the patrons or the bar keeper.
---
So one of your guys messed up.
---
Ye man fuck qeues
---
just finsh the leveling grind to 60 and stop worrying about this
---
It' like my number three favorite dungeon. I do it on every new character at least once.
---
I use LunaUnitFrames but idk if that's what matters. I'll try with disabling various addons to see what affects it.
---
It’s an active decision made by blizzard to target the devilsaur market. They also changed how DM trib works so it’s harder to solo. None of these changes were in vanilla, blizzard is just doing whatever they want at this point.
---
Let me get this straight, your mage class leader lets one of his mages port out of the raid for some arbitrary reason like learning a weapon skill that the player should have trained long ago, AND make 39 other people wait for that mage on top of it. This is disrespectful towards every other member of the raid, and indicates that your mage class leader got no idea who he is distributing upgrades to.
---
My favorite place is probably Undercity, since it reminds me of Naxxramas, the coolest dungeon!
---
Cheers!
---
.
---
Bonebiter if you have axe spec and stoneslayer if sword spec.
---
Is it worth the xp though? I’m halfway through this one
---
It’s not 50/50, it works 99% of the time like it’s supposed to.
---
Well, it happens like this IRL. At least in wow you have a semi-meritocratic metric system (ilvl, gear, achi) that allows GL to choose and players not chosen to have a reasonable and understandable no answer...
---
You must be the same paladin I kept bumping into. Grats on the mount! Only started my rep grind 2 days ago... Wish me luck
---
You put all of that in quotes and it's really grinding my gears...
---
But yeah, there seems to be a bias against spending your free time playing video games. 
---
It does seem like most of the people who are against it, think that we are sitting there playing a single player game like tetris. They simply don't understand that World of Warcraft is you know...a world. Filled with different people with different goals and aspirations. And most of them despite being behind an avatar, interact with each other in a respectful way, just as if the interactions have consequences. Not in real life, but in WoW. You ninja an item? You bet that sometime down the line it's going to bite you in the ass. Ending up on a blacklist is like going to prison and having to tick that "have you ever been convicted of a crime" checkbox when applying to jobs. Good luck getting into a raiding guild if you are blacklisted.
---
Now, there are people who go way overboard and of course these people need to get some sort of help. But for every player who plays way too much, there are hundreds of regular people who play a couple hours when they can.
---
Nethergarde Keep-EU still two layers?!
---
Last night in IF was crazy - a hundred people outside bank easily. Is it possible they tried to merge the layers and decided against it?
---
I’ll be on later tonight
---
What is more useful for raiding and dungeoning? Long term etc
---
I for one hate cooking quests, don’t know why though
---
Its MUCH harder to hit high level mobs compared to players.
---
Just kidding. I don't know what server you play on, but try to get into Mc or Ony at venoxis on usual raid days  and you might think differently. Seems to be an issue on alliance side tho.
---
My favorite place is the little Defias  spot up the waterfall just south of , with the little house and the doc. 
---
I love to fish there.
---
There was a huge power-creep, and people who had Naxx-gear got to change it out rather quickly. I think even some greens were better than Naxx gear.
---
I honestly have no sympathy for you, you're class owns that area with the advantages you have over other classes. Either find another spot or go back at a different time.
---
If youre using krol blade mainhand, Hanzo Sword is best. Mirah's song is second best. Dal'rends offhand is third best.
---
If you get dal'rends mainhand, dal'rends offhand is best due to the set bonus, then hanzo sword is 2nd and mirah's song third.
---
This is exactly how I feel as Alliance on Heartseeker. We outnumber the Horde by a lot and I hate it. I, as a Rogue, don't attack unsuspecting Horde anymore because I feel like they're getting attacked all the time
---
Hopefully Blizzard decides to merge some servers or something as time goes on, but until then, any Horde players that are sick of outnumbering Alliance, consider playing on Heartseeker. Your Horde brothers and sisters need your help haha
---
Yea, you’re horde. That’s why. Alliance players are sleepy af
---
I’d be inclined to agree if the birds screech wasn’t just ungodly broken, I’ve seen pets tank 6 mobs and walk away like nothing happened
---
I wish. My guilds been in there for the past month and a bit and nothing :/
---
Nice broccoli tabard, you moo cow.
---
Dual wield shields! :p 
---
Sounds like you're best going WW axe for now.
---
Annihilator is a great weapon to have on somebody in the raid for the debuff it throws on the boss, but unless you're an orc, it's not a good tanking weapon. And even if you're an orc, Deathbringer is better. Though Annihilator is a good option prior to getting Deathbringer.
---
Why are these measured from Lucifron pull and not from first giants? Can't you abuse that by pre-clearing most of the trash (a couple would respawn sure, but most wouldn't)?
---
TipTac can do it, among other things
---
Time you enjoy spending isn't wasted time. Might not be your idea of a good time but gotta remember we're all different bro.
---
Race has a huge impact on classic gameplay, most people pick their race purely for the racials.
---
Well, speaking of Gandhi anyway, one of the ideas presented by Buddhism is to learn to enjoy the process, and don't focus on the result. 
---
I think this aligns very well with human psychology. Our own nervous system rewards us when it thinks we're doing a good job and on the right path, regardless of any external signals from other people.
---
What he said.
---
PVE server. If I were on a PVP server, yeah, that would be a blast, even if I didn't get anything off the WB.
---
It's actually the opposite on my server. Horde are dominant so Alliance acts all friendly but as soon as they outnumber you...
---
&gt; Farming a dungeon for one item 100+ times
---
I just straight up refuse. I decided to just play the game how I want to, and I started enjoying my time a lot more. 
---
I said fuck it and switched my priest to shadow. If it hurts my chances to raid or get into 5-mans, so be it. It's the spec I wanna play, and I got tired of playing a spec I didn't enjoy outside of certain situations. 
---
I need gear from a dungeon? I'll give it a couple shots, but when I get bored, I quit running it. No big deal. I might not have my bis, but I don't need that to enjoy fishing or farming, or flipping things on the AH, or chatting with guildies, and those are the things I enjoy most anyway!
---
Funny thing is, I found that I don't have a hard time getting into raids and 5-10 mans at all even in shadow spec, so all my worry was pointless anyway. My guild was happy to have a shadow priest for their raids after all.
---
If you consider your gaming experience ruined when camped you shouldn't have rolled on a PvP server. Sure it's not that fun but it's a part of the game you accepted when you rolled on a PvP server. Acccept it or leave.
---
But we talked about dungeon runs didn't we?  5 player party and such.
---
We took longer than that with no wipes, but breaks to fetch new douses and a long time to set up positions.
---
Thanks a lot for the tips! Sorry for asking again, but I'm not experienced in this.  
---
As far as I know there is DM North, West and East, right?  
---
So you are advicing not to do the farm runs in DM East?  
---
What exactly do you mean "go from the main entrance"?
---
I’m sorry if I hurt your feelings as a furry person. Do you have a preferred pro noun or can I refer to you as “he/him”?
---
So speedruns are counted as starting from when you pull the first boss?
---
Wait for phase 2
---
That means straight up not doing most of the grinds.
---
Hey I'm not the one whos insecure about getting killed in one of the easiest places to stay alive by a trick that's so old at this point.
---
Tauren only have 3 fingers tho
---
Well you gotta clear to lucifron either way, and who's gona stop you if you say "whoops we accidentally pulled two extra packs while making our way there". Just wondering why it wasn't full clear to begin with.

Is it blind? So like does the Loot master announce the highest current bid and take more bids or is it whoever  whispers the highest, gets the loot?

You're never going to be completely useless, but Naxxramas gear really is stupidly strong. Mostly in the damage department, though.
---
Also, don't expect the majority to run around in it.
---
Layers have vanilla size population caps(~3k). If a server has 3 layers with 3k each, what do you think happens when they remove a layer?
---
The biggest misconception in this thread is that people think the actual technical server limit is equal to the server cap. It’s not, a server could probably fit 50k players if blizzard wanted, but obviously they don’t set their cap anywhere near that.
---
That’s what I’m worried. I’m going engi with my gnome warrior, so as a paladin I thought hmm let’s not have the same profession as the other toon, BUT, in my guild, 90% of the paladins are going mining/blacksmithing which would lead me to go herb/alch BUT I don’t know if it’s worth and if it’s “fun” going herb/alch...
---
That was my nickname in high school
---
RealMobHealth or something like that
---
Weird ‘The Guild’ aren’t even listed. We’ve downed Rag as a guild for sure.
---
Ahh. Could be. Vanilla is such a long time ago I don't remember.
---
Informing 😉
---
I genuinely believe most people will clear Naxx with just the base level of consumables if they follow mechanics and listen to discord. Yes, it'll take them 8 hours over 2/3 nights a week, but I don't think it's unreasonable.
---
Not gonna kick you 10 minutes into a dungeon when they inevitably figure it out lmao.
---
^ This guy flips ^
---
As a tank I completely agree with this. Being a tank is easy, but stressful. It’s not hard to tab sunder and taunt, but when taunt/mocking blade is on CD and I have no rage there’s nothing I can do. 
---
Running a group with good dps/healers and bad dps/healers is night and day. With guildies and dps that follow kill order/wait until I generate initial threat , it’s a fucking cakewalk; pugs sometimes make me quit for the day due to how frustrating it can be. But in either case I’m pretty much doing the same thing; charge, sweeping strikes into whirlwind and d stance/shield macro with demo shout, or charge &gt; tab sunder with demo shout and revenge procs on skull. It’s up to the DPS whether it’s a smooth ride or a bumpy road
---
There isn't going to be too many people with it, and while it does give an edge you can always beat people by playing better. Especially as a rogue.
---
My biggest fear doing this this early is that I might server change
---
Is the ring unique? The video won’t play for me for some reason. If it’s unique and you already have it, you cannot roll.
---
lul why lie about something pointless like this? The flips are and always has been client side.

&gt;Ending up on a blacklist is like going to prison and having to tick that "have you ever been convicted of a crime" checkbox when applying to jobs. Good luck getting into a raiding guild if you are blacklisted.
---
I got black listed by this guy and his guild because when he asked me to sell him a portal he refused to give me the 1g until after I had made the portal and called me a scan artist and ninja for not making the portal before getting my gold ...
---
Disagree.  I hate leveling.  I love 60.  It was that way for me in vanilla, and it's that way for me now.  There's just a different mindset between the two facets of the game.  One for me is tedious and annoying; the other is enjoyable.
---
Understandable, I'd be interested in alternatives myself.
---
Just try to destroy an quest item. If it's still relevant it will say something like: "If you destroy this item quest xxxx will be abandoned"
---
of course. imagine how many times they got camped, ganked while being outnumbered etc... and then they will repay it whenever they safely can. it's just normal human behavior. violence begets violence and all that.
---
Thanks, I'm looking into Pawn right now. Where do I find these weights? I can only find stat priorities.
---
Yeah that came up in the OG thread. Someone was getting a good deal anyway.
---
yeah it’s unique
---
Thanks for your input, does this apply for mages? I totally forgot to mention my class at first
---
What makes you think that? I know pservers aren't the best metric but it was still a pretty hardcore raid on those and you couldn't faceroll your way through for sure. From what I can tell, "pugs" can clear up to c'thun and maybe a few bosses in naxx, but there's a big leap in difficulty from there.
---
Lol this is me right now. I hate questing so much, always have ever since I started playing the game just before BC. My mage is level 51 logged out in an in, bags cleared, quest log ready to go, in the blasted lands, I just can't be bothered. URGH. However I'm logging in now and spending all day questing till I'm high enough to get in some decent dungeons after farming ZF for like forever.
---

---
You know what's funny about *that* analogy?
---
Almost everywhere you go where the risk of theft from a vehicle is high, you will find signs in the parking lot advising you to remove your valuables to prevent theft from occurring.
---
Does that mean the business is now inherently blaming the victim of any theft in that parking lot when they don't follow their advice?
---
I am not a rogue player nor a rogue expert but I don't think you want crusader on your mainhand as a dagger rogue. I think you want +weapon damage. You should look up some guides, though.
---
On my first ever job interview, they asked me what kind of projects i did which involved teamwork. As i had no xp whatsoever, I answered I play wow. Interviewer asked if I have led a raid. I silently lol'd answered yes and added I play arenas too. He again asked what rating? I said 2k in 3s (wotlk at that time). He muttered "that sure requires teamwork", and jotted down something in his notes.
---
I got the position.
---
why is hanzo sword better than Mirah's Song? It has way less dps, and less stats.
---
&gt;	Today, we took the final step to reach a state where there are no longer multiple layers
---
*lists only 4 servers that were relatively late added and not large*
---
Well that really is a final step isn’t it
---
Gadgetzan, because chaos
---
Not sure an addon shows it, but generally you can do a search on wowhead for the item, and see what quest it belongs to.
---
On Golemagg, buff DAMPEN MAGIC on all melee. It almost completely will negate the Magma Splash. Meaning melee can stay in and require next to nothing in healing.
---
Spam blind or gouge while stunned, might give you a chance to reset if the other rogue is sloppy.
---
not really without the MH. and Mirah's is easier to get too
---
How so?
---
I'm a bit salty that horde neither has access to this nor has a comparable mount.

Neatplates addon does this. One of many nameplate customisation addons.

It doesn't proc on dots, so how much of a proc rate does it really have?
---
We were three guys doing the same apprenticeship that played WoW but only one of the other two guys was a really close friend of me. He was way more close with the third guy but still didn‘t meet him IRL except at work.
---
The guy I couldn‘t like was also politically pretty right-oriented but he never showed his stance to me IRL.
---
One day my friend said that he got the login details to his WoW Account (he couldn’t play for awhile so he offered him to farm with his pretty well geared rogue) and I had an evil idea. 
---
He gave me his login details, I logged in sold everything on his character, bank and traded myself the gold - it was round about 1500g I can‘t remember exactly.
---
Today I feel really bad about this but that dude was pretty annoying and dumb and kinda deserved it back than.
---
all crafting professions are equally "fun" IMHO.
---
Herb/Alch is great while levelling though, because a lot of it's potions are really making the grind a bit quicker. I loved having the range of troll's blood potions on my warrior, along with emergency health potions, agility potions, ...
---
HAHHAHAA
---
Thanks a lot for your effort, op!!

Yeah i wouldnt call classic and retail the same game tbh
---
In my guild when we used it the Loot Master announced the winner, but not the bids.  If the bidder wanted to tell you what he paid, that was up to them.   If you won you didn't have to actually pay your bid, just 5 over the next player.   If you bid 50 and Jack said 20, and no one else wanted the item, you would pay 25.  But you had to actually have the 50 to make the bid.

---
I experienced that for first time last night trying to kill trolls in stv.  Between 60 alliance group running around and over crowded area.  Took me 2 hours for the 30 tusks... Hopefully the charms area is not as bad.
---
I was the healer, but we may not have lived long with those monks hitting hard. We just decided to hearth instead and let him die. :D
---
This sub has twice the users of retail wow subreddit? Ridiculous. Classic was a huge success then?
---
Certainly not a faceroll, but coming fully buffed with 20 consumes is what you're doing if you want to clear Naxx that night in &lt; 4 hours. If you know you can handle wipes and longer fights, you're not going to need everything to clear. Still a lot of farming, but not so much that it will be casual-prohibited. People are genuinely just a lot better at the game now, there's more resources and they do more research.   
---
Even the 8 horseman mechanics become a bit simple when you can just watch the youtube video of 10 different guilds running it from every perspective and get it into your head before you step foot in the raid.
---
As a shaman who has exactly the same profs as OP, I make a killing in azshara. It's my personal money factory. OPs problem is the times he farms, if I had to guess.
---
Shadowed Unit Frames has this functionality IIRC.
---
I'm on same server as you, for me it seems like everybody trying to hit 60 and not "wasting" time after work, because they don't have much time to play.
---
Depends on:
---
* Whether you prefer PvE, PvP, or RP.
---
* Which faction you feel you'll like more.
---
Black Rock Mountain, fantastic place
---
It’s not the old version of DM but it’s still a later vanilla version.
---
So you're justifying your own future shitty behavior cuz people ganked you? You're just being part of the problem. 
---
Those low levels didn't do anything to you. They have nothing to do with you being ganked. Don't be shitty.

i bought a big iron fishing pole on the ally AH for 6g. not really a big deal.

This is the angle I've been waiting years to read. Holy fucking thank you.

Respawn time for each devilsaur has been halfed.
---
I'm enjoy vanilla because I feel like everything I'm doing is meaningful. If they announce TBC I'll probably feel less invested in classic. I **hate** the wow expansion cycle. It's pointless to advance the character once you get max level unless it's actively fun.

You poor soul. I'd wish that upon no one.

Client side just means every players' client rolls a dice to see if it uses the flip animation.

If there's a 50% chance of using the flip animation every time a nelf jumps, (on average) half of the players watching will see them flip.

Good meme

Well yea but it means every wipe is a lot of gold down the drain and it creates a *lot* of tension within guilds.

As a former stalagg alliance and now heartseeker alliance I know your pain. I try to keep to 1v1s and not camp at all. And let y'all in instances if I can. A lot of it is Ally frustration from previous servers so on behalf of them I'm sorry :(
---
Depends what you're doing.  Have you learned to chain seduces from succubus?  You seduce and run to max range, curse of shadows (or elements if soulfire is up), shadowbolt/sf into a searing pain, and then reseduce with succubus before they get too close and go do it again.  Since they arent dots, curse of shadows/elements dont break succubus seduction and make your shadowbolts smack.    Learned this strategy in the warlock discord to fight shadowpriests it's a really fun way to flex some of your classes skills. On the topic of spriests save shadow Ward for when they're casting mind blast!

Wait, bindings are boe?

Duskwood.

Super creepy, cool lore and stories, excellent quests for fast leveling, powerful enemies, and this ominous big hill in the middle which you always walk around, not knowing what's inside.
---
I have a 60 druid, lock, and mage. I have a 26 warrior and 20 pally and priest.
---
No idea when you get that, but at lvl 20 I only got water breathing to share, so thats what you get. I don't care if you are undead, a druid or a shaman and we are in the middle of a desert.
---
BRE is not a debuff, it is a buff on your character.
---
Hunters in vanilla rolled on everything. 
---
Warriors in classic roll on everything. Leather, mail, 1h, 2h and ranged. Basically any item they can wear.
---
It was a great game 15 years ago and it still is. Nice to see it do well.
---
Remember blizzard saying "you think you do, but you dont"?
---
Lol this must have been a huge eye opener for the devs.

Use witchblade+ OH. Sp is more worth on frostmage Than crit.

Crit gets more value with fire

We are all children of Cenarius. But yeah fuck the horse.

Stalagg if you want to go Horde, Westfall if you want to go Alliance.
---
Yeah ive stopped doing any daily or weekly quests after i got my heart maxed but i would suggest you do the 3 island expeditions for the follower mission.
---
Because the bonus rewards from those missions are always titan residuum and you are going to need it if you put your best 3 followers on that and get the residuum.
---
Use the saved residuums on heroic azerite gear on season 3.
---
Just get a second job loooool
---
Fuck I hate this attitude, it’s a PvP server deal with it.
---
I’m alliance on skeram, and I’m sick of the pity attitude. It’s not horde’s fault that the alliance is full of cowards. 
---
Don’t feel bad about pvping, camping, ganking etc is a apart of the game, don’t roll on a PvP server if you can’t handle it.
---
Omg I never realised this
---
Cheers, I appreciate it :)
---
As someone from Westfall it does not matter but i also do not PVP.
---
I found the Alliance leveling guide on deathblind to be fantastic. It's not hunter specific but it gets you to 60 with zero, or minimal, dungeons.
---
I’d rather than than wasted time and hold to redo. To each his own I guess.
---
It's a fun way to watch some of your raid groups race each other if you have multiple that run at the same time.
---
It worked for me, I got onto my companies graduate scheme citing plenty of my Guild Leader experience. I'm sure I'll use it in the future to move up management positions, just have to judge your audience!
---
How is it time wasted in SM where you will get leveling gear to last you to 60?
---
LOL, unexpected Snatch.
---
Could also be that less retail players are interested in reddit. Back when I played wow I didn't care about any social media associated with it, only started using twitch/reddit/etc after I quit.
---
Though I wouldn't be surprised if classic is significantly more popular than retail regardless.
---
For the first one if you follow #showtooltip with

He said "get thunderfury" not "get both bindings".

that sounds terrible, how are you strafing

Heartseeker is a coward alliance realm, reroll on a real PvP server like herod or skeram.

Still sad that there were no ships in wc3
---
Epic mount is used through all phases.

BoE gear is replaced sooner or later.

If you want to think long term epic mount is a pretty easy choice.

ah good to know, have to try that the next time :O

Was tankin on druid SM armory. Got mage lock and warr. Mage would immediatly after pull start blizzard and lock dot everything up. Cant hold aggro for shit as they were few levels above me. Told them to slow down as I cant tank 2-3 packs. I was told to just chase down runners. Healer alsmost died few times, I died twice. Was complet shitshow. After run told I them that  this was worst run so far for me. They tried to convince me otherwise, as they doing this all the times. Gl to other tan with them

Ye, happend to my group aswell, we wiped on ribbley cuz a mage pulled the entire bar with cone of cold. When run back, a pack with officers and a fire elemental was infront of phalanx

It was a popular thing in BDO to spreadsheet your hour grinds at locations to get an approximate Money/per hour and effective drop rates.

If your goal is PVP one of the most important tools are epic mount.

You can flee fights from all the 60%ers and catch up to people who flee from you. In AB you can cap bases faster.

Besides all that has been said: Naxxramas is a good ways out. It will be one of the last phases. We don't even have an exact date for phase 2(!).
---
You both underestimate how much surplus gold is on retail and how little people want to part with their gold on classic.
---
No it's the opposite. When you delete the item it warns you that it will abandon the quest, but I've found when you delete the quests, the items associated just disappear instantly.
---
There is always a reasonable explanation! What class are you?
---
^ mostly one-shot the bosses. Wipe 3-5 times on stupid trash pulls, or someone not paying attention. Take another 15 minutes to buff raid and go.
---
it really does not

I don't know how true this is in general. I was under the impression that some naxx gear was bis even at 70 for a while, and some of it even in wrath due to set bonuses.

Sadly I had some issues with that addon in retail and back then when I documented myself on many addons I remember that KUI popped up to be one of the lesser of all unit frame evils, so I kept using this one, no issue ever, retail or classic.

For your second question I believe there is a 30sec cooldown after equipping an item before you can use it's "Use" effects.

It happens. With my shit luck I’d want to port to IF and end up in Org
---
Group != Town
---
I didnt play during that time but im doing ship missions and follower missions every day for achievents. I literally come to garrison to only reset follower and ship missions nothing else
---
I disagree with you saying difficult to get the oil. You literally jist need to do 1 assault which rewards 600/750 oil per day and ignore everything else and you do the oil reward ship mission as well. Furthermore follower missions in garrison reward oil as well
---
I dont even do the oil rewarding assault for days after ive done once because oil ship mission sustains with oil enough and sometimes i dont do even oil ship mission because if huge amount of oil i have.
---
&gt; Didn't Elv Ui have a backdoor written into its code before?
---
No idea, but considering it's the most popular UI addon for Live and Classic, if there was an issue, i'm sure it would have been highlighted.

* Go to google and type "wowhead classic nameofquestitem".
---
* One of the first results should be the "Item" page of that item.
---
* Click the comment section of that item and usually one of the top most comments will be someone telling you that you can trash it.
---
I think you are seriously overthinking this. It's the same as with people who end up rerolling their character from UD to Orc because, in the end, the stun resistance gives an edge over WotF in case X and case Y in a duel versus class Z of race A, as far as min/maxing and overthinking goes. Naxx gear will make dueling those people difficult for you since they outgear you, but there number of people who will run around in said Naxx gear will isn't likely to be very large. 
---
But as you write, twinking will give you more control and ultimately that makes for a quite level playing field when it's fights versus other twinks - when you encounter the regular level 30-39 Joe who just wants to run some WSG to break the monotony of getting ganked in STV while questing, you will absolutely destroy them. I guess you're the one wearing "Naxx gear" in that scenario.
---
so you gonna reroll gnome and then get all the way to 60 and then want to reroll human for +5 maces and swords?
---
sounds like you are very fickle and once you reroll gnome you will just find something you dont like about that either.
---
4.1k exp until lvl 40 according to classic.wowhead. You get an axe you can vendor for 73s, which is nice.
---
Why would you drop the best gathering prof in exchange for the worst one? Only argument I see is leather for bags :D
---
I include my top world raiding experience on my resume.
---
I had a hunter at 26, a Druid at 20 and whenever I’m able to add more game time I’m going to roll a rogue because it’s always been my main class and I missed the mechanics playing Druid and hunter. 
---
What the hell is it about rogues that make them so fun???
---
That's bad. You don't keep your healer at minimal mana, you keep him as high as possible so that if you do pull an extra pack, it's not an instant wipe.
---
If it only takes 40% to do a pack, great! means the healer should be at 60% after the fight and he should be back up to full in no time.
---
Why would teebu sell? It's an okay sword but there's a lot of better alternatives in raids
---
Saw on a website its like $900 USD for like 2000g.
---
Just like the ring from Uldaman. Its Unique and once you have it, even if one drops with a stat roll you like better, unless you deleted yours before the boss you can't greed or need on it

I say Horde gets warlocks, Alliance gets priests. Fuck the balance! Lets get weird with this shit.

---
Ah.
---
ah ok. so the logical thing to do if you really want something is bid all of your points? so in the end, the person who can use it and also has the most dkp will get it.
---
- item that most likely could sell the highest price right now on the AH?
---
why didnt you just ask that? No one including you cares about the others
---
Yeah, exactly this happened to us. Any idea to fix this? We plan to go tonight with the same ID to the dungeon
---
Not entirely, no. When in doubt, check up on wowhead. Unless you find an addon you're describing, of course.
---
I started with xp to level and then went to Titan panel. Titan panel does a lot more in terms of calculating what it will take, plus a ton of other great features but if you want something basic and unobtrusive, xp to level is great.

Sadly, in general pvp focused players tend to play horde, while alliance players tend to focus pve. So why do alliance players roll on pvp servers? Good question. Probably has to do with being intruiged by pvp, and wanting to experience it sometimes, but not really having a clue as to what a pvp server really means.
---
Bizarre, I used this method to hop out of a trash farm group into a raid that went on to kill bosses. When I clicked reset instances, it gave me the 'molten core has been reset' message and I could no longer see my raid ID in the Raid info tab. I've tried telling people this but it doesn't seem to be the case for them and yourself? 
---
PS I did this a few weeks ago, maybe something has changed &gt;.&gt;

No benefit in wasting time

Use Master Looter not FFA. If someone was quick they could grab a binding or some other valuable item from the guild.

You always have to press these macros twice. (same as when switvhing stances) So 1 press is defensive stance, second press is taunt if you want to.

2 months in, one max level char, dozens of sub 20 others and I still don't know who my main is. So depressing.
---
There can be individual finish lines in Classic.  But you will end up continuing do that your guild mates can do theirs too, and then having alts lol
---
Report them and move on. Neckbeards with the saddest life you could imagine aren't worth getting worked up about.
---
The bridge at the entrance to Stormwind! Its a beautiful and majestic entrance to a city filled with life (in classic).
---
If i had the time id farm gold on retail and buy tokens so i can play classic for free.
---
yesterday, at activision-blizzard : uho, fun detected ! Purge initiated
---
A TURTLE MADE IT TO THE WATER
---
I've been asked to tank as Paladin even. I'm not gonna tank in cloth (the life of a holy paladin)
---
That’s just the guide that im following for this goal.
---
But mostly of those are the dungeon bises or world drops... :( I search for good gear but not the best (because of the time I can spend)
---
There are websites that do that for you. You can sign up people to a lot of newsletters/spam in a single website
---
God I hate this comment. As a retail player who hates mat or mount/transmog farming or grinding for gear which are things that ruin the fun of the game for me, was thinking aboit starring classic. 
---
But Oh my god.
---
Your comment just made me realize classic is even hardcore version of ruining the fun. Like farming mats for hours and getting happy over a gear with high number? 
---
Hell no. 
---
Im having fun seeing the achievement popup and   even tho fucked up a progressive storyline.
---
Tauren Male T1 looks strange. Like the head of the character was pressed trough the helmet and it broke
---
This also comes packaged up with ElvUI.
---
Wasting time? It takes what... maybe 40 seconds to end a pvp fight? 
---
The loser gets time wasted, the winner the thrill of winning the fight. 
---
That’s what PvP servers were intended to be.
---
I have 6 days left of play time, it's not showing up for me either.
---
Yes, use ogre staff over aquamentas+witchblade. The crit makes up for the loss in spellpower and the extra stats are nice too, you'll want to get your hands on an aquamentas at some point anyway though, for when you get mageblade and need an offhand
---
Lmao imagine being so clueless you think farming rep in wow isn’t 10x lamer than an actual job. 
---
Must be nice to sit at home while mommy and daddy work all day, huh?
---
No - example would be the pages in STV. Also I failed like this on a quest item which I had dropped and accepted the quest with right click on that item.
---
The quest was still active but the quest item which I needed was gone.
---
Play the Avengers theme music
---
The most fun I have in this game comes from world pvp on my alts.  Not the grind on my main, but the world ganking.
---
Felwood is my favorite looking zone in the game.  The green fog and the spooky trees are the best
---
On my server there is a late Taiwanese presence so those hours are going to be dominated by them regardless.
---
They can't use option 1 :D
---
You will not be able to beat last three bosses.
---
Everything else is doable casually, provided not everyone is a potatoe and you spend enough time.
---
Farming rep in wow IS a second job you dunce
---
Oh that’s cool. Any levels that are thought of being the best twink levels?
---
My favorite place in Classic is the near the starting zone of the Night Elves, Dolanar.
---
The reason is that it reminds me starting my very first steps in wow, all these years ago, alongside my then girlfriend as two Druids.
---
The music, the trees, the atmosphere. Those are all things I still hold very dear to my heart and it never fails on bringing a smile on my face, always.
---
I don’t see why can’t they make separate queues for alliance and horde and enforce 50/50 ratio on every server.
---
Agreed. I have watched and read so much (continue to do so daily) that as a new player to WoW id be completely lost without.
---
Kudos
---
I agree, that's usually the reason why people don't engage, unless someone does them wrong. If you pvp at a location where you're gonna quest, you'll usually not get to quest much and only get a revenge-on-revenge scenario going. If you kill someone who's got his 60 friend/main near him, you're done for the next 1-2 hours. 
---
So people prefer to keep the peace to be more efficient.
---
Plus that sounds a lot more professional
---
I think they would just sign up for normal wow if they do . The no-pvp server, pvp opt in was created exactly for this . 
---
Researching servers through forums and many other options is also possible if you just invest 5 minutes to determine ca faction ratios for a server. 
---
Mograine if you are EU is almost perfectly balanced I’ve seen. US I’d have to check . 
---
The max is only level 60 - many would just rerollwhere the other faction has the majority.  
---
Generally they get so used to winning that they are easy pickings
---
Not trying to defend the hunter, but pre-raid BIS may very well be the same as BIS for many players. A lot of people will never raid.
---
Lol what the fuck. This actually makes sense on an objective level. Your dad is a good one.
---
It's definitely true. At level 16, me and two buddies attacked and (semi) almost took down a player around level ~30+. Very very few misses/resists. If we did a couple things more optimally we would have gotten him down. It's exciting!
---
Yes, only one mage is on winter chill duty
---
I have been trying to get a tidal charm for 2 weeks now and didnt see the rare mob once..
---
my question have u seen someone who has the trinket equipped?
---
This is normal, to have around 100 gold. Not A Few Hundred like that guy said. :)
---
wtf does that even mean? coward because alliance outnumbers horde? Most servers horde outnumbers alliance, does that make them "coward horde realms?"
---
I do an AoE pallie build which thrives on reflection damage along with Consecration, all i need is like 5 seconds then dps can attack.
---
Exactly. If any of the neutral mobs in the bar are attacked, the whole bar becomes hostile, and a patrol consisting of a few elite dark irons and 1-2 elite Flame Destroyer elementals spawn and come through the exit. 
---
This is actually a backup plan put in place by Blizzard to prevent a soft lock of the dungeon there, since if you attack any neutral mob, you cannot give Private Rocknot beer and trigger Phalanx going hostile, and therefore can't escape, so they have the pat come by to "investigate the disturbance", and the you can kill them and continue on.
---
What I'm betting happened is AFTER you gave Rocknut the beer, thus triggering the event to make Phalanx go hostile, and THEN somehow attacked a neutral mob, therefore triggering the pat to spawn and come through the door.
---
My advice? Don't do that. And if it does happen, use CC (banish the elementals, sheep the dark irons, whatever you can) and burn down any members of the pat that you can't CC, then burn down the boss. Phalanx is not terribly threatening, but those mobs can cause a lot of trouble if left alone, particularly the Flame Destroyers.
---
My friend's warlock spells was significantly cheaper than my spells as a warrior. 
---
I'm presuming it's because warlocks have a lot more utility spells to get and rank up as well, so the same cost is spread out more. 
---
But that still makes it easier to simply pass on some spells or rank increases to save money when every spell isn't for combat, or useful in your spec.
---
Twice the people online. 1/3 the "members".
---
jesus christ do we need more of these posts
---
That's actually really good, enslaving hellcallers and just destroying those packs which also drop felcloth.
---
This is a really good warlock farm imo.
---
They can, what's gonna stop them? "Oh no, the community will be disappointed in us *again*!"
---
They make mistakes too, they miscalculated the interest and will now have to deal with it. I expect them to release phase 2 WITH layering, because people aren't losing interest as quick as they had hoped.
---
I myself grabbed a pair of druid t1 by mistake but you can trade everything for 2hrs.
---
Retail players spread between multiple subreddits, forums and other platforms that where popular during 15 years.  
---
Classic users don't have that much places to go.
---
I mean, that's part of a reason many people got jobs for real. It's mostly a matter to frame it right.
---
Yeah, but I'm not 12
---
Your total lack of self controll is simply your own problem. I have tried alot of things that you would call extreamly addictive and yet I manage to balance life while dealing with issues. I realy enjoy classic but some days you don't have time, thats just life. Grow a pair
---
Great list, some interesting new ones I havent even seen yet. I agree with you about Elvui, while a lot of people have correctly pointed out that it would make a bunch of your adds obsolete, i just didnt like the mechanics and feel of it and breaks the immersion for me.
---
Yea, you’re clearly 87 y/o
---
hope so
---
They made the clear statement and well, they are working towards doing it.
---
Might as well run GDKP then.
---
Part of an RPG is managing stats and abilities. Its perfectly normal behaviour.
---
Lol they would kill themselves.
---
You get something along the lines of MLQHRP just random and you either get a prompt when you relog to change name (sort of like character creation) or if its actually really offensive you have to contact blizz support and tell them the new name. But since yours is not very offensive or not at all you'll just be able to type a new one in.
---
Revive/Mend Pet are nature spells.
---
or changing targets

Dreamhack 2006 Day 1, me and a couple of friends were heading out to go buy some pizza when one of the guys in our group sees a login character screen on a computer where the owner was away... I remember it clearly, it was a human female mage level 60 with some netherwind gear and the staff of shadowflame. My friend ran up to his computer and deleted his character and started giggling. I, playing Vanilla myself actually felt a bit sick seeing that, especially since it was Day 1 of DH. He essentially ruined his entire Dreamhack...
---
Pocket healing the ones we love is an amazing feeling. It's like each heal makes up just a tiny bit for a major disappointment we caused that they think we forgot about. Heal on dad, heal on!
---
The answer should have been that you managed an online community. If they ask which one then you can go into detail. And frankly this does work in interviews, assuming that your job involves managing remote workers. It helped me get a manager position at a help desk. It was EQ not EoW though back then.
---
Awesome! Thanks a lot.
---
I've read them and I think this on it on how Krarg gets around;
---
That's how the game was intended by the devs for the players. They did put in grind and Raids and whatnot for endgame purpose, as any game has but I was convinced back then and now again with Classic that this is the true WoW experience. Sure this is slow, not efficient, maybe even annoying to some to receive random mail by that Barbarian, or discussing pets with him but IMHO he plays the game just how I always wanted to play the game but am not able to do because I also can't resist the max/min ideology, secretly admiring my dmg meter etc.
---
Thanks for the read and sharing this. I hope you'll continue with this and maybe even get a "book" together with all the episodes complied into it together.
---
Lol when I was in 7th grade I was a little socially awkward and really shy so I naturally liked playing video games on my free time, which I had a lot of. I ended up being one of the top holy Paladin healers on my server and all the interviews I had to join the big guilds on the server have legit helped me out in my real world interviews lol. Thanks WoW
---
I don't know about now because you get taken directly to the character select screen instead of the server list but it used to be around the 5th most populated server looking at how they transitioned from Medium to High to Full through the day.  Ashbringer was a little below those numbers but still in the top 8 or so.
---
The 50/50 comes from on paper (census data addon that last worked a month ago) with these two being the highest ratio for non-RP PVP servers on EU, as well as levelling experiences on both.  Mograine I haven't been on in a long time but I can't imagine much has changed, it's JokerD's server (first 60 and alliance) so I imagine he gained a few fanboys following him along there.  Ashbringer I can 100% recommend from recent experience that it's very balanced and incredibly active on alliance.
---
I'm on EU and OP is US, might be that then.
---
Slap lifesteal on it and spam wing clip r1 with shadow oil and chili

You should try [ClassicChatFilter](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classicchatfilter), goes along with the Utility without altering the UI mindset!

It allows you to filter the chat channels with custom white/black-listed keywords for an easier time finding messages you want (for LFG and other things) :)

And the respawn rates at the cauldrons etc.. are insane
---
I´m with Gandilf, sorry .. I´m the same. You gank me while grinding and I´ll hunt you for forever
---
This guy Bue2 and his YouTube videos on most quests in the game have really really helped me progress and locate flight masters.
---
As always. Honestly what can you expect from an Alliance?
---
You described gdkp
---
Just making a joke at the terrible layout, particularly the roundabout walk to the mailbox from the auction house or going for a swim.
---
So?
---
How go you know his dps? Can you do some calculation from the threat meter to work out dps?
---
Yes, you'll have to go to quite some extreme lengths if you'll want all the best enchants etc - grind up Timbermaw rep, get Libram enchants etc. I feel that's a bit over the top, but to each their own. 
---
I think the problem nowadays is that many people seem to go that extra mile, so if you are worried about min/maxing and an even playing field you might end up pushing for those same enchants and gear pieces in the end. 
---
Will having all the top stuff and best enchants for each slot make an actual difference in the end? Probably not in the majority of cases, but in some it will. Personal preference in the end I guess.
---
Let the horde fix queues, you left a great server and ruined your experience by transferring to a dead PVE server with no horde.
---
Queues were never that bad, just use Remote Desktop until the casuals stop playing. Why would you knowingly transfer to a PVE server? 
---
Reroll alliance skeram and I got your mount when you are 40. Come have some fun with the game on a real PvP server.
---
Well maybe you should quote the full sentence instead of cherry picking just to make a snide comment.
---
get crit chance for backstab in combat first. Then get crit damage in assassination. Then get damage % from subtlety.
---
After that you do what you wish. If you want Ambush crits continue down sub to get that.  If that's not your prio i'd recommed you get hit % in combat, and get dagger crit % after that. After that invest back into assassination.
---
Basically it doesnt matter much what you pick after you get crit damage, backstab crit and damage % on backstab.
---
now just wondering how do I get mass reports \^\^ .. mhm
---
I got layered in Orgrimar when joining a group. It went from a very busy layer to an even busier layer! Phase two might be some time yet
---
Thank you very much! Tonight we will try it (saved the ID). Maybe there are some items to stun / cc those mobs.
---
Make sure you're using a transparent system for recording and distributing loot. We got google sheets with all raid members listed, how many items they've received, and how many raids they've attended.
---
Ok, can't watch the video as I'm "working" at the moment, but I'm intrigued, you are playing a melee hunter?
---
Weapons that proc shadow damage and benefit from spell power?
---
Does improved scorch also increase damage for fire want damage?
---
Curse
---
it does if you put in on your resume

---
I'm a newcomer to the WoW series. I really don't get what is so wrong about gnome mages.
---
I don't see the issue with releasing phase 2 with 2 layers. If there are still 2 layers even now, that means the population is so high that a single world boss spawn wouldn't be enough anyway.
---
Earlier this week in Strat UD had a pair of mages competing to be the bigger dumbass. Asspulls, aoe spam before I get mobs in place, chain pulling mobs etc. Then they raged at me for forgetting about 1 of the rat trap rooms, while they pulled 3 ghouls on the other side and died. Plus our initial healer had never seen a druid hurricane on the AoE packs near the entrance and RQd immediately
---
Was rough,  the hunter and I were facepalming hard.
---
It's the age of information. It did happen in vannila in late game as people were starting to figure these things out more while leveling thei 10th plus alt, but still wasn't as widespread as it is now, it's because everyone has seen the streamers and YouTubers posting about it and want to be "leet players man"
---
It worked in pservers but doesnt work in classic. My group just tried in in brd.
---
You can still visit it though it's not lost..
---
Is that Arthas' Scottish brother?
---
Nothing, thats the problem
---
Tirisfal Glades and Scarlet Monastery!
---
If you're a mage or a warlock it's not like you have much reason to when your entire levelling experience is summed up as crescent staff&gt;illusionary rod&gt;hexing cane
---
I had to go and learn swords when I got my mageblade too
---
For me it was through playing neverwinter nights and the likes of baulders gate. I just like the builder spender mechanics and stealth.
---
I'm sure that if they're picky enough to want a relatively experienced tank then they're happy to wait. Sometimes the inexperience is not worth the headache.
---
Again, If they move to PVE servers (unlikely), we will just move over to the next server. Even an ally strong one is great. The long-term downside you’re assuming, is the exception, not the rule . 
---
I didn’t say it would sort itself out. The server won’t magically reset it self to 50-50 ratio. 
---
Also I said nothing about the census data. 
---
You can generally get a good idea by comparing the amount of guild advertisements for a server you are thinking of joining - in guild recruitment, as well as the traditional threads in A-H ratio that are in every server thread, among other options. 
---
There are also no bad servers, just imbalanced ones where you have to adapt (I like ally overbalanced ones as a horde, or avoid.
---
There’s a setting to block them in the game client!
---
Planning to do the same. I was looking for the SFK group for a goddamn week. Almost impossible as dps.
---
Starting with the pull of the giants cuts all that out. Form up, do your jazz, timer starts when the giants get pulled.
---
How is the literal beginning of the instance not the best metric?
---
Congrats man. Glad you were able to manage the run effectively. Now the endless farm begins!
---
Worst can be healers.
---
Have had a few groups with zealous warriors. They pull fast, don’t use CC, but hold good agro, skip the right mobs, and carry the group through the dungeon. Que the dwarf priest.
---
This particular dwarf thought he rolled the best char and could sit back and relax. Well, not in scholo. He would briefly afk the start of pulls, causing the tank to die, or maybe a mage aoeing. That same afk after pulls caused him to agro. We wiped, then wiped again because he forgot about mobs we skipped. He would not drink at 50% mana because water expensive, but would cry OOM on the next pull. Sometimes he would priest fear and pull more mobs, in a broken attempt to help the group. The final straw was him needing the mage casting gear...
---
He wanted to post it here to be ridiculed by elitist nerds like you.
---
Dude, what's with the attitude? People are sharing their stories of how they ding 40 or hand out linen bags to lowbies (which is ok!). This is a place to share all kinds of content.
---
Both factions are just as bad as each other in my experience.  If you leave random players alone to quest the first thing they do once they see an advantage, which is usually me in combat or a fellow player questing from his faction nearby, as predictable as sun rise they've eaten their spinach and they're up for an easy kill. 
---
If its red, its dead, that way you're the one initiating the fight and not on the back foot.
---
Great list. A lot of these are in my upcoming addon video but I’d like to add Santa Texture pack (not an addon but interface textures) for a darkened look and all addons by Jordonz.
---
Its called work, not fun time.
---
Any tips you found out?
---
You will find that a shed load of good two handers start dropping in Mara and BRD. DO NOT WASTE any time 'farming' a 2H at level 48.
---
Mara has gatorbite and BRD has like 4+ good 2H
---
Why does tailoring matter? Is there a benefit to having it?
---
I was on grob (west coast) and transferred to deviate delight (east coast) for same issue.
---
It’s his dwarven uncle
---
I honestly don't understand how you couldn't buff up in the insurance before the first trash giants. How is Luci to rag better than from start of the instance to endboss?
---
That's like saying a leveling speedrun starts at ten because character creation and thinking of a name might be difficult
---
Thanks for the answer!
---
Awesome, thanks.
---
Surprised about shadoweave being bad. I would have thought it would be good for a shadow priest.
---
It's not the exception, like, at all.
---
There are literally 10s of thousands of posts about imbalanced servers. It's not a problem that solves itself.
---
Griefing often makes people reroll, if they reroll, you won't have anyone to grief. It's extremely simple.
---
Yeah you might be right. As I said earlier it's just that the private server scene is used to starting to count from Luci.
---
You tank with annihilator as offtank from mc all the way until kel’thuzad if you want to minmax raid dps.
---
Like 90% of the questions someone asks in an interview are unprovable. They can prove that you worked somewhere, that you went to school somewhere, and that you're record is clean. That's about it. Most questions are about interactions with other employees/managers, projects, and so on. There's pretty much nothing they can do to verify what you say.
---
Up to lvl 55 i healed as shadow. ZF was not that difficult.
---
Totally agree with this and its also how we run it in our guild
---
Islam is right about women
---
It has kind of been a thing since Vanilla..just part of the stereotypes that emerged. Male blood elves were considered of a certain pursuasion. Hunters were huntards, etc. etc., its kind of what I love about going back to classic. Just the general sense of community with these jokes
---
Are you saying that once layering is turned off (like it is a a lot of servers now), that only 3000 people can be logged in at one time?
---
That number is not nearly high enough to accommodate demand my friend.
---
Literally git gud my guy.
---
No. Noooi we do not.
---
Downvote me as much as you want but all i'm saying is it took me nearly 6 months of weekly farming MC to get both bindings on retail.
---
Just rolled an Arms Warrior. Im looking for advice on what i need to do when i start tanking dungeons?
---
Do i have a secondary set of gear to equip for dungeon runs for example. I pretty much level solo.
---
Are there any minimum requires so to speak before i start tanking in terms of gear and skills/abilities/talents?
---
Woosh.. He is talking about family and parents
---
Ask people
---
Yeah nothing like tapping low (ooc) and having just started the heavy runecloth bandage only to receive a greater heal splitseconds after...
---
And the devilsaur thing comes down to layering, they doubles the original spawn timer while layered  to try reducing layer hopping abuse,with layering going away the timer is reverting to the original time.
---
Yea, a few.
---
When you FD make sure you literally let go of everything else when you click it. Even small turns with the mouse (while holding a button) can cancel the effect.
---
Also, until you become a pro (which I am still far from) take your damn time with everything. Corpse runs are a real drain on morale.
---
Maybe some more stuff I'll edit in later.
---
I'm not sure if it's possible anymore, but people used to use disconnect macros all the time for exploring and exploiting.
---
I'm still a little confused about the hit effect of my +5 swords weapon skill. I have read that plus 5 weapon skill equates to around 2.2 hit. Meaning you need around 6.4 hit to ensure all yellow hits connect on a level 63 raid boss. However the benefit is of course better for tanks than for dps as tanks get a reduced chance to get a block or party as well Therefore I assume the weapon skill bonus is only about 1 hit for dps. So I am gradually reducing my hit to see when I start missing raid bosses, at the moment I'm assuming that is around 7% from gear with racial. After that it's going to be about more about stacking AP as I'm already pretty close to the crit cap in raids.
---
Lol at all these tryhard capslock names.
---
Most often I activate autorun from a button on my mouse. When i press that i just let go of the mouse completely and only use A D and Q E to control my character until i reach my destination.
---
Then you got a free hands for drinking ,eating snacks or fondling your balls.
---
There's a whole string of people not being sure. If you wanna be helpful, double check before you spread disinformation, not only is it unhelpful, but you'll make people remember the wrong information.
---
Please jsut double check before you tell them specific stats plz
---
Yeah, MC and BWL you cant really go fire. 
---
 a) a lot of mobs are fire immune or have resistance
---
 b) you need a lot of +hit and +crit for fire to do more damage than frost. Fire scales better with gear. Until you have that gear (AQ) frost simply does more damage. If you or your guild does not care about that, sure go fire. I guess most "serious" mages respec every week.
---
If you stay frost you can spec somewhat okayish for Raid, AoE farm  and to a lesser degree PvP by going deep frost.
---
Done this before. Offered a free portal to my teammates after a good 5-man dung run and i just accidentaly teleported to IF instead.
---
good job, but it isnt 37min. The video start after clearing the 1st trash which must add a good 10min.
---
Stranglethorn Vale will always have a special place in my heart.
---
BlackRock Mountain.
---
So much lore, and love the architecture of the spire and chains.
---
Everything about that place is epic.
---
Nope, that's all it is. But a lot of players don't realize how fast you can spin, when you use the mouse. (They try to spin with the keyboard buttons.)
---
It does require some practice, because a lot of people spin too far, when they first realize what the mouse can do for them.
---
Xxblizzard420xX
---
Are you me?
---
If you plan on raiding in the next few months, you will need to respec. If you just want to do 5-man content than you will be fine.
---
It's kind of close, it's called spellcleave.
---
So, as a dual wielding warrior, there is no such thing as "too much hit." Theoretically, your hit cap is 25%, but I don't think that's achievable even with Naxx gear. Every % hit is going to increase how many white hits you get, and consequently how much rage you generate and therefore damage you deal.
---
That being said, once you're at 6% hit (as a human with mace/sword), 1% crit is better than 1% hit as far as overall damage dealt, since crits also give you more rage. The only time you should start to stack hit again is when you're approaching the crit softcap. I could go into the math if you really want me to, but the short version is your crit softcap is 36%. Beyond this point, crit will only affect special attacks (yellow hits), not white hits, but for every 1% hit you add beyond 6%, this crit softcap goes up by 1%. So once you are at or above 36% crit, fully raid buffed, then you need to start getting more hit.
---
I believe this starts to happen sometime in BWL in terms of gear.
---
My friend, who got me into Classic, told me about the Huntard joke, lol. Also, I remembered from a video I watched recently that gnomes have higher crit chance with spells, because of their extra intellect points. I guess this is the reason Gnome Mages are disliked then, right?
---
It is that bad. Multiple bosses are completely immune to fire damage, so you'll have to use other spells against them. But changing talents is cheap the first few times and I wouldn't worry about it yet.

^ this will allow you to shift from any form into cat form, if you double click it will power shift and cause you to recast cat form. Breaking any roots and regaining up to 60 energy instantly with Wolfshead helm and furor talents, if you do not want to power shift(which is not advised) replace the last line with “/cast [noform:3] Cat Form” the lines to cancel aura are added to cancel the auras before casting cat form to help prevent the bug of not gaining the aura when quickly shifting. This format works for any form so long as you replace the name of the form I.e. “Dire Bear Form”

r/wooosh?

Yeah, I moderated a gaming clan forum back in the late 90's and early 2000's.  We had about 200 members playing Diablo, Starcraft, Warcraft II and Counterstrike.
---
I def put that on my resumes for part-time gigs through college.
---
I'm really tempted to abandon my lvl 52 shaman because of this. I love healing groups, but the closer I get to lvl 60, the harder it gets to find groups (I assume because lots of hybrids switch to healing spec for raids) which leaves me with a useless spec for anything solo without having the benefits you got in vanilla as a healer - being wanted in group content.
---
Try to keep your one-handed tank weapon updated. It should be a really fast weapon with okish dps. This will help you with generating rage and aggro.
---
Thanks :)
---
There is the Altar of Zanza nearby which was used for gaining troll rep I think? (Not sure since I've only rolled Alliance. More than likely If you've been to Yojamba Isle, then you've seen the deadmines gates. I also have flew over it like 100 times on my way to BB.

You can only summon people who are inside of the instance, while you're in the instance. You'd have to step outside of MC to summon him back to Blackrock

Fuck

Twice. I did this twice, while leveling. Once was because I had the wrong spell on the bar, and once because I was just dumb and clicked the wrong one.
---
Similar (but worse) fuck-up from BC days... We were in SSC and I accidentally de’d my my mh sword instead of applying poisons. I was sleepy, and didn’t realize I clicked the wrong button until I heard the “ding” from the de. Luckily, I had at least one extra weapon in my bags and was able to complete the raid. And, to top it off, Blizz support replaced it for me :)
---
I mostly kill hunters pets, downtime on fun is not that long

Well yeah, that’s something, atleast.

We use an AddOn called RC LootCouncil to help, which shows priority and what people are currently using, so it should help us decide.

I almost said, "what about his redemption. At the end of legion?" And then remembered this is classic wow we are talking about
---
Yes, this includes all sources of fire damage. Same goes for Shadow Priests using a Shadow damage wand.
---
While this seems like a nice synergy at first, I personally recommend heavily AGAINST using the same element wand. You will run into enemies which are immune to your primary damage and in those cases you will be glad, that you can stil use your wand (combined with some lousy offspec spells).
---
this comment motivated me to finally make a plan for when to quit my soul sucking second job lmao thanks a ton stranger
---
Also able to duo arena/anger as hunter/mage. Hunter has to be smart and mage ready to blink tank at times and ice block with good timing/positioning.
---
It's not even the record for classic, much less all the other servers that have ran this content.
---
Lol this happened to me at Booty Bay last night. Seeing as I was a rogue in my previous life, I got a good laugh out of it. Still made it to the boat before it took off too!

Actual serious pvpers roll alliance because of holy paladins.

Grats! My goal this weekend is to figure this run out.
---
Because the game shouldnt have multiple world boss on multiple layers.
---
Rocky Road?!!
---
This, I went from RP PVE -&gt; Pyrewood, much more players seen for most times.
---
It happend to me also, everytime the flypath chance of zone I was dropped in the Middle, neither I could entre dungeons.
---
That's not his pinky.
---
Where you in my group? Haha, we killed phalanx after 2 wipes with single target on the officers and fire elemental, and MC dps with officer
---
It did work like this for a while, no joke. There was a time around TBC and WOTLK that companies and recruiters were using WoW as a platform to search for applicants, mostly related to project management etc. My guildmaster at the time was recruited through WoW by a headhunter. Not sure if it still happens, but it was a thing back then.
---
I'll look into it and add it once I played with it for a while
---
Not on my PC so from memory - open settings, then select the far right tab (move?). There will be an option to select panels (all panels will become visible). Delete the furthest right (press X on it).
---
I did this last week.
---
Ok yes, if somebody could tell me what's going on with this, it'd be amazing. This is so frustrating. It happens pretty often too.
---
Sometimes its a flightpath, and I'll just be randomly dropped off somewhere in the flight path. One time I almost died, because it dropped me off in a fatigue zone. Only survived because I happen to be at my computer and used a pot to make it back to shore.
---
Other times it happens when I am trying to zone into or out of a instance. It will bring up the loading screen, but sit at an empty bar for a bit, then jump back to my character, still outside the instance, but past the portal, and give me that same dreaded error: Transfer Aborted: Instance Not Found.
---
This has happened while running back after a wipe, while exiting to reset, while running in for the first time, etc. This has happened during flight paths. I'd say, if I averaged it out, it happens about once a day, though it's typically only every 4 or so days, and it happens in clumps of 5-6 occurrences.
---
The only thing I've found to help is to exit the game, force close the bnet app, reload it, and reload the game. Then I should be good for a few days before it happens again.
---
Only other thing I've tried is a repair installation, which didn't fix the issue. I want to avoid a complete wipe and reinstall, since that takes several hours, but it may come down to that.
---
I don't think he knows.
---
Well, you will need to grind those dungeons to get some gear that should be better than questing gear. I just wore anything that had strength &amp; stamina on it. You will run the dungeons around your current level several times trying to get your drops. You start getting bis (best in slot) gear around level 50 (I think) at Mauradon. My suggestion to you would be to decide if you want to be a dps warrior (dual weild fury) or a protection tank. There are hybrid dual weild builds out there as well. I feel your pain for leveling a warrior!
---
so
---
much
---
lag
---
We did almost this exact same thing and it ended even worse. We ran him naked (items in bank) into an enemy capital city and deleted his hearthstone (can get another one at an innkeeper). It took a while to set it up and we planned on getting it out for him too. He was a (lvl 30-40?) rogue so it was easy to get in/out of places, just took some time running to a nearby city.
---
Well, he did not take it well. I think he logged in right before high school the next day, we were about 14-15 yrs old, and came to school and he started bawling his eyes out and telling everyone that we "ruined his account". He was literally crying and telling people who didn't even play WoW that we were horrible people because of what we did. I'm pretty sure he even went home that day. The worst part is, before he even started crying we told him it was a joke and we'd get him out and get it all back to normal for him. But that wasn't enough, he just started crying and trying to get everyone to hate us. Most people didn't care (except for a few people) and people that played WoW thought it was hilarious. Everyone got over it in about a few days (except the kid). He ended up quitting the game and not talking to us for at least a couple months and I don't think our friendship was ever fully restored. It definitely affected our friend circle as well because most of us played WoW and were shocked that he reacted that way. Especially when we literally told him and others that we were going to fix it.
---
Trick is to pull the pathers when they are coming from rigth to left. Then you can use the building on the left to los with. Also to help yourself and the team mark all pathers you see with anything but skull/cross, that way everyone is aware of them
---
How is a lvl 60 holy priest supposed to farm or solo grind?
---
I’m assuming at level 60 a healer specced priest won’t have spirit tap or imp wands (or do they?). Is it literally just holy nova spamming and out living mobs?
---
someone explain for those who are a work and the website is blocked?
---
Deadly! Thanks for the info really appreciate it! I don’t think there’s much thinking to be done I’ll either stay on Mograine or go to Ashbringer I think. Good to know it has active alliance as I plan on rolling horde this time around and I don’t want either faction to be outnumbered :) thanks
---
Bring 40 food for pet 40 water. U can repair inside library, which is accessible from 1st courtyard in DM:North :)
---
There is this website where you can post combat logs from raids. I believe [this](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/qrc7knjMVNpKbd8w) is the run in question, clicking encounters gives stats for DPS, HPS, etc.
---
Demon bad Natur good

A group was in ashenvale needing just a tank for BFD for like 20ish min last night. I’m a Druid tank but I’ve only done WC once. Finally I said I could but I’m not the most experienced. It all went solid (no wipes or anything). I struggle holding aggro on multiple mobs, especially with mages and hunter pets.
---
Exactly, I'm annoyed by the lack of proper stats on it especially with private servers muddying the reports. 
---
Honestly 1-2% is more reasonable, there are some peeps on here and on retail that are farming it so if not me, then I hope one of them will provide some stats of how it works on retail.

I didn't watch this video, but I know it's pretty common to jump to the right and skip a few trash packs at the beginning.  I imagine that had something to do with their meta.
---
Retail lasts about 1-2 months from the start of the past 2 expansions. Literally nothing to do, unless you enjoy doing keys which die out quickly.
---
More work?
---

---
Yea, holy priest here. Feared two at the entrance to bed. me and warrior ran opposite directions they followed me all the way to kargath. They proceeded to murder every poor soul there. At one point I was far enough away to drop combat, mounted, then see these two still targeting me and chasing. I know they were the same mobs bc I marked them when they followed me up the chain.
---
Theres no such thing as unconditional love
---
Your hired, additional monetary compensation for heroic level and above raiding experience.
---
dragon's call not on it
---
kind of good and bad to not see your server on this list. 
---
still layering shenanigans  but also you know that it is one of the bigger servers with a higher population and it's not "dead"
---
Generally they awarded you with reputation for a faction. This was generally fine if there were other mechanisms to get rep, but there were quite a few factions with no other way to gain rep besides daily quests - which means if a player doesn’t log in to do the quests every day, there’s no way to catch up with where they would have been if they had done the quests every day.
---
Cheers matey.
---
I remember reading a really good educational paper years ago along these lines. It was about a small young settlement somewhere in Asia that went into conflict with an opposing small settlement. The settlement in question won, however as all the strong able bodied people died in or after conflict and only the weaker, more placid were left. The settlement declined into ruins due to their inability to maintain what had been provided for them.
---
Really? I don’t remember this at all honestly.
---
show roaster records!
---
You don't.
---
That doesn't work, because your alt wasn't online.
---
The only exception I can think of are DMT rewards, where the loot comes from a separate box. This loot you can offer to guildmates, trade with others or even sell.
---
We're both dicks, welcome to the club :) You've got a serious aggression problem if 3 bytes of chars end in a reaction like that
---
He's not having 500-600dps on fresh 60 with quest gear, he probably peaked few times on 500-600dps with lucky crits. Sure, on pack where is Hellfiring you have the dps, but definately not on single target or 3 target cleave.

Couldn't you have just started the raid group invites and have them all join your raid ID?
---
Crimson hat gives you 8 int and 8 spirit at the cost of 4-6 spell damage and 2 Stam. Most BIS lists will pick the extra spell damage.

This is exactly why I came here.

You sir, are a gentleman and a scholar.

Hey, leave him alone.  He may have just found out he’s adopted or something.  Don’t worry little guy, we’re here for you!

Apparently he was but he didn't do anything til WotLK

Id love to have a Gdkp raid on my server. That was you always get something out of the raid
---
I hope classic logs adds some speedrun logs soon and not just per boss speed/excecution!
---
DME Jump Runs
---
Yes, after layering is removed each server will have a cap of 3k.  That’s what they’ve been saying all along and that’s what will happen.  They’ve also stated that layers are always sized like original vanilla servers(~3k) so your example of layers with 1500 each doesn’t hold up.
---
I like how you go into one side of the mines and its temperate farmland and come out a km or 2 later and boom its jungle
---
I remember this entire subreddit downvoting people saying how crappy 99% of the pvp on pvp servers are. Now here we are.
---
It’s awful but it happens even on balanced servers. Just the nature of pvp servers to get ganked. The population being balanced doesn’t make people less likely to group up for quests, which is probably the main reason you’re getting gangbanged
---
Fire is also very inefficient for leveling compared to frost. You lose a lot of slows, crowd control and damage reduction. Not saying you can’t be fire, but significant efficiencies and survivability is missing.
---
Stunlock them first
---
Deers don't fight back though, shouldn't it be more like aliens, you murder all their babies.
---
&gt; I’d ask them a lot of questions and their answers would weigh heavily.

---
Chickens will eat their own eggshells too. Pretty crazy.
---
There should be at least 1 lost pug that failed portal roulette in this picture.
---
Op wasnt talking trash... he was genuinely complimenting them for keeping pvp alive on a massively imbalanced server. Calm down chief
---
If it had armour it'd probably be worth the effort. As a night elf on a 60% mount, I don't think it looks that great. Awesome accomplishment though.
---
You are right. I saw a Hunter two level below me doing an escort quest (chicken in Tanaris) and i didn't kill him. This will now change. Prepare to get ganked and corpsecamped for hours. Hope this is what you want OC.
---
Because that's how MMOs are designed. If you create a MMO that doesn't have months or possibly years worth of content to grind, then the players will either get bored and leave, or finish it to fast and leave. 
---
 They create content that is locked behind a rare drop rate, or some other mechanic that makes the playing grind in some sort of fashion to achieve a goal. Every MMO does it.
---
\&gt;.&gt; 
---
I mean I'll take this offer for sure

It's almost like you forget stuff after 15 years. Like my rogue was decked out in t3 and equivalent but you think I remembered you can't cast spells while sitting?

Ashenvale - it's beautiful, and has the best music in the game.
---
iirc there was actually a famous guild leader way back who got hired on as an executive because one of his guild members was involved in the hiring, and he had shown strong aptitude for the critical skills.
---
Thank you but cant weekends, but cheers
---
That boss is crazy even with 5 mans ON level. You’re a legend in my books
---
Paladin you'll end up as healer 100%
---
It's more than obvious that he just peaked few times at that 500-600dps with lucky chain of SB crits.
---
This one is a man of culture, let alone honor. :) This goes both ways, by the way. Counts also for alliance players not ganking levlers on horde side. 
---
I am a PvE player, been playing on PvE realm my whole life and now I chose a pvp server hoping for faction balance. Of course, you find the odd a-hole here and there, but overall I am finding rather pleasing experiences with horde realmmates, even questing together every now and then. 
---
Surely the danger of being out in the world adds to the experience, but PvP server does not mean endless slaughter in Arathi and STV. 
---
And you are right, since I am a PvE player, I would have not had an issue switching to a PvE realm immediately, but I really wanted to give PvP a chance for ince. It's been going well so far. 
---
To make a ratio, for every 8 horde nice guys, I encounter about 1.5 or two a-holes (undead rogues :D) . Which is way WAY better than I initially expected. (Ashbringer-EU, Alliance Side).
---

The fun gnome ghetto I figured was supposed to be a hastily constructed area for refugees. And even then it still has a decent theme as well as good utility for engineering and alchemy. The bad ghetto is just a dump, literally looking like at most they carved out a tunnel as the bare minimum or otherwise dumped them in a section of the town they just left unfinished.
---
Mulgore is such a beautiful Landscape. I am not visiting it very often, but the lvl exp is so good.
---
Well outside of hardiness/wotf being broken in pvp. Offering faction agnostic server xfers has really messed up server balance for most servers. A very common reason people on heartseeker left their first server was that it was really horde favored. Now where it used to be there was a couple 70%+ horde servers and a decent number of 55%ish percent horde servers. There is now 90%+ pop ally refugee servers like heartseker, and a bunch of servers that are basically horde only.
---
The issue I have isn't directly with camping. It's that the corpse camping is going to accelerate the rate at which the minority faction on servers either reroll or quit the game. I know of plenty of horde who have abandoned 40+ characters on heart due to ganking and phase 2 isnt even out yet.
---
My favorite place is Winterspring. I just love the colours, the atmosphere, the silence there. The snow makes me happy. I always feel a bit more at ease there than anywhere else. Sounds weird, but Winterspring is my happy place in WoW :)
---
Have someone help you setup grouping with one of your own alts. When you log between them it takes 2 minutes for lead to pass. For most people this is an acceptable wait.
---
Devoting all of your talents into a single purpose and ignoring everything else is a very retail thing to do. Right now raid content is easy, you can effort to put some talents into better farming. Eventually there will be more challenging content, but at that point your gear will also be a lot better.
---
Apart from that many healers get their gold from doing group content.
---
Your name is misleading, especially for a rogue.
---
Double check.
---
Maybe if you did this in 2005, but with discord and a basic game plan it’s not too difficult (other than the whining about loot)
---
Shadowglen, Teldrasill.
---
This is where it all started, virtually and physically:
---
1. I introduced WoW and created a NE Hunter for my girlfriend here for the first time in 2016.  
---
Since then she's as hooked as I am to the game.
---
2. On  the 3rd of august this year, we were at home and I placed our characters in front of the (sort of) altar with water in front of it (while she was taking a shower). I asked my girlfriend to come to our "game room" when she was ready and ask her to mary me  IRL and ingame (by doing /kneel in front of her). She said yes \^\^.
---
You can't holy nova spam high level mobs, it just doesn't do enough damage. 6k mana worth of novas does 2k, most 50+ mobs have 3k. With a little more mana and PI it might work, but still far from efficient in most cases. You can still farm some outdoors stuff like felwood satyrs but it won't be as fast as shadow.
---
Best places are prolly DM:E lashers (which have sub 2k health) and jump runs with a warrior buddy, though those are quite challenging as 2 man.
---
As a senior level manager I would absolutely take a potential hire seriously if they were a guild leader. I'd need, in lieu of corporate references, for them to provide references from the guild (in game acceptable) and audio of their kills AND wipes.
---
I was a raiding GL back in BC, Wrath and early Cats - that was hard work and absolutely required serious time and people management skills.
---
And plate because your fury gear will be leather and mail as well
---
Haha ffs auto correct!
---
I Personally wouldn't hire anyone whose management experience consists solely from being a guild leader. Vast majority of employers wouldn't either even if they knew about wow guilds. Couple it with some real world management experience and then sure I'll give them a shot.
---
My guess is that for some of the more heavy pop servers they reduced the amount of layers to maybe 2 at any given time. Which would make them seem more crowded, would explain the queue, but stil make them tagged as "layered"
---
For the horde!
---
I love gnome warriors, dunno why.
---
It's 8, tbh. Unless you're ditching Painweaver for an additional Elven ring. 
---
What you're forgetting to consider is that your talents provide you with 5% hit and 5 weapon skill.
---
11 warriors, way more then we bring.
---
Wonder if this would be faster if they had shamans\WF.
---
Where: Blackrock Mountain
---
Why: I mained a Rogue back in the days...
---
Some people enjoy gearing and optimizing their character on the way to 60.
---
Why would you only list English servers?
---
Aesthetically, it would be Winterspring but I'm not attached to it emotionally. 
---
My favorite place would have to be Durotar actually. Not particularly easy on the eyes but I have fond memories of hanging outside Org, dueling people all day after school. My friends and I would hang out there for countless hours. I can hear the music so clearly too as write about it.
---
There is no set standard, this was a common way of measuring on some private servers where they logged from first kill. Currently there isn't any way of ranking speedruns on for example classic Warcraft logs homepage, hopefully that gets added :)
---
Cannot unsee
---
Can confirm. This is how life works.
---
Sauce: Was raid leader at the age of 18 with an iron grip on my 39 dependables. Am now a professor with a similar style of class management.
---
Fine Shortbow is a drop, not a vendor item.
---
A holy priest maybe, my warrior doesn't compare to my shadow priest.
---
Am rogue. Whisp best passive!
---
That's the exact same thing but reworded to give OP the blame. Of course it's technically OP fault, you CAN aoe farm without dying like this.
---
Timer starts when you start. If you start at 7 and do 12 min runs then you should be ok at 8
---
Hahaha I see how that's possible, I kinda hope that was the intended message to be honest.
---
That's why I triple check the spell and the cast bar every time now.
---
I finally hit 300 on blacksmithing. I was just curious if I should eventually drop mining and pick up another profession? Obviously I will need thorium and dark iron ect for the mats for most plans, but am I just married to mining being a blacksmith? Or will I make enough gold selling armor to buy mats later down the road and not worry about mining? Farming thorium was terrible towards the last 10 levels or so.
---
Wut? They totally fixed this like a month ago. Works flawlessly now.
---
2 months in. I'm extremely hopeful for the long term health of the game. Long term is until we run out of content. I seriously wonder what will happen then. I feel for the people who are looking forward to TBC but TBC is not for me. I hate arena, I hate flying, I really hate the visual direction of 80% of Outland (spaceships ho), I dislike the linear dungeon design. I really liked the gameplay (as in combat and encounter design) but everything else in TBC was kinda meh to me. I want classic+. Worst thing to happen is they fuck up again but what would I really lose then?
---
Haha luckily we are in different departments. Sometimes our work overlaps in projects and those meetings tend to get very unproductive.
---
But it’s really the dream. I’ve turned down several offers so I can stay with my friends at this company.
---
I have it. Killed him twice until it dropped. I had an alt logged out there to check for the spawn. Both times it was around noon when he was alive.
---
I got curious about what guilds, so I got my Google on.  If I’m reading this right, it was 135 guilds:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8kcgtt/the_real_list_of_59_useu_guilds_that_cleared_naxx/
---
pretty sure it starts when you leave, i've tested this 4 times already in maraudon
---
No, it's not.  There is a heavy imbalance at Horde low levels because a ton of asmond alts came over ( skewing some census data ).  Honestly I think the census do more harm than good, it just encourages people to transfer/reroll en masse and cause imbalances.
---
Yes, that is what "this tribute is items from a different loot table" means
---
Weird Interface issue I’ve been having and have no idea how to fix. Ok so on my main I dragged both my nameplate and the enemy’s nameplate from the default top left of the screen to the bottom center of the screen. It’s been perfect on my main, but when I rolled an alt and try to do the same thing, anytime I relog onto my alt both nameplates get reset to the top left position. I’ve tried resetting my interface to default and setting it up again and it doesn’t work. They stay where I leave them on my main but it always resets to the top left on my alt for some reason. And yes I always right click both nameplates to ‘lock’ them in place when I bring them to the bottom center of my screen. Any ideas on how to fix this?
---
Obviously it's an exaggeration I'm not saying wiping in a dungeon is the same thing as dying in real life. I'm just saying that some times are better left unsaid that's all. Clearly it was a big deal for that group leader lol
---
I used to get really annoyed by getting attacked by horde because no matter what, it felt like always a losing fight and even if you somehow turn around the aggression, you know that the next time you blink they'll have multiplied.
---
Now however, ever since I respec'd to the shadow tree at level 40 everything changed.
---
I kill them. I kill them all. They're dead, every single one of them. And not just the yellow, but the green and the red too. They're like animals, and I slaughter them like animals. I HATE THEM.
---
Pro tip: be a gnomish engineer so you get your dimensional ripper for gadgetzan. Don't be surprised when it kills you every time you forget to equip the parachute cloak
---
Think about it, it's 150 lvs vs 60 levels , also ,even if they each do 1/5th  of the damage you are doing it still breaks even
---
Stormwind. Looks good.
---
Hes angry because hes short, wrath is appropriate
---
Oh god this sub is so fucking edgy 
---
NO by pvp I don’t mean to corpsecamp people for hours I obviously mean a healthy rivalance between 2 factions. Omfg.
---
Ah. I didn't know unique was a thing. I didn't check (and can't right now) to see if I already have the ring. I remember only one other run through WC, and I don't remember the ring then. But my poor memory is a more likely answer than a game glitch.
---
He doesn’t though. If I heard this it would sound to me like someone churching up their experience with business sounding buzz words. He describes the environment but says nothing of the style he used to navigate that environment. It also doesn’t adequately address the challenges. He could very easily be a tyrant by this description. 
---
To have value for a management role, it would say more about how he kept a group of 40 people together for 2-3 years despite the composition of that group spanning multiple generations and economic backgrounds. His group had a reputation for low turnover and fast progression. He accomplished this by giving a voice to lower tier members that encouraged experimentation with the approach to problems and clear lines of escalation for conflict resolution internally. His groups approach was so well known externally that he had a waiting list for new members that was never below 15-20 candidates. That list was maintained with a developmental group but didn’t shift much because of low turnover of active participants. This is in contrast to the revolving door nature of similar groups.

You don’t climb the ladder by selling yourself. You climb the ladder by having others sell you to those that make the decisions.
---
I don't farm consumes myself, I buy off AH. But yes I throughoutly enjoy the gold methods that I use. Sometimes I end up farming more than I even need.
---
I can see your point with strength, but stamina? Not a chance. Check any guide, stamina is by far better than spirit for hunters. “Of the monkey”&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; “of the wolf” in any situation. 
---
Even strength, with a slow 2h weapon does some damage with raptor strike to finish off your enemies.
---
They had us in the first half, ain't gonna lie
---
so keeping my 9% is not a bad thing?
---
I know i know
---
But that looks so cool
---
Dunno then
---
Yeah sure, mine is just throbbing and huge.
---
Agreed 200%
---
I'm not totally sure how it works, but as the population matures/settles they might well be adjusting the max no. of layers on each server and obviously that has a knock-on effect when they are initially reduced as the server can tip max capacity players at peak times being so close to the new N layered average max calculated threshold.
---
ie. assume 100k max player capacity per layer. Then also assume a realm with an avg. peak population of 350k - so it's currently set at 4 layers to handle that, but they will adjust it to 3 layers and let the queues handles the max capacity if it's avg peak should drop to &lt;310k. The apparent server population increases (due to less layers), and you experience some peak time queues occasionally whilst still being on a layered realm.
---
Once your servers peak population avg drops close to the max for 1 single layer, they disable layers altogether.
---
I leveled to 120 in BFA, kind of enjoyed the storyline even.  Then I looked at all the daily tasks and stuff I'd be expected to do, looked at my level 120 character and said to myself, "I think I'm fine with ending it here."  Cancelled my sub and waited for classic.
---
Lol. I ran that once for the nostalgia and we didn't even wipe but by the end I was still saying never again because of how much it sucked
---
Can you provide me with a link or anything ?
---
i cant seem to do the heroic strike cancel. i made a macro, do i need to queue and cancel it right  before the offhand hits? i usually queue it when i see my swingtimer on offhand is going to hit first then cancel it before
---
It's not a sword but a dagger, but for caster dps the Hypnotic Blade is better than Ill Rod.
---
There is nothing more therapeutic than when you're trying to lvl and an undead rogue ganks you twice, so you hop on your 60 and camp their corpse for half an hour or so. Some people call it griefing but it's nice.
---
I acidentally put a point on a talent that I probably shouldn’t have done. Should I pay for the respecc right now or is it not that big of a deal? I’m gonna respec to elemental around 40 anyway. Currently lvl 17 shaman with about 3 gold if it’s relevant

Hired on the spot
---
It wasn't in Vanilla, it was MoP though.
---
awesome post. I'm married with 2 goblins. I just lay the pipe twice a week and we goochie.
---
Thanks that seems reasonable.
---
So - I used it for five hours today. There seems to be an issue of tracking chests and tracking loot from mobs someone else killed when farming in a groop with FFA loot. Both types show up as "unknown".
---
However, I dont know how you really earn gold with Blacksmithing unless you have some rarer recipies, that people are interested in.
---
yes, it would be faster. Melee stacked raids are the norm for MC, Ony and BWL speedruns, so adding windfury into the mix boosts dps through the roof. Its only after AQ that caster dps starts picking up again.
---
I think QS was BiS tanking for all SnB tanks up until AQ40 or even naxx back in vanilla. Could be wrong though.
---
It's on a stick...
---
Ssssooo close
---
EPL. The quests, caravan, zone, lore, everything about it is what the game is all about. It's amazing and I always will love it.

1- Several people were nice enough to give me an answer, so I figured it would be polite to respond to each of them, to let each know that I got their answer. (I doubt any of them will return to this thread to see if I responded to one of the other commenters.)
---
2- I copy-pasted my response because everyone essentially said the same thing.
---
3- If everyone believed one response is enough (because it will get upvoted for visibility), then why did so many people give a response (all saying the same thing)?
---
4- I've been on reddit long enough to have no faith in people using the voting system in a useful way.
---
If you find a spot where you never have to wait for respawns or compete with others it is faster (and more profitable) than questing *most of the time*
---
There are some quest streaks that are fast easy xp, but standing around waiting for respawns and named mobs absolutely kills your xp/hour rate, particularly if you have to quest in an area where you cant grind on wildlife in the meantime.  If your server is dead you’ll have more fun questing, but busy areas during primetime you might be doing a single quest for an hour.
---
LemonAioli sent 2 stacks of cloth and 1.6g.
---
The other guy returned the 1.6g but didn't pay for the cloth.

Whats the server?

Except that BoP's are blue in lower level dungeons, too

Booty Bay, it's just a beautiful hive of scum and villainy.

This isn’t true classic. It worked easily and smoothly on Classic. 
---
You’re actually defending *needing* a macro and requiring multiple steps to use something properly that were never needed before? Lol, what?
---
I started as a dwarf hunter and tamed a bear because I wanted to be like the dwarf in the cinematic. I got my bear and then ran to Ironforge to show my buddy the pet, just as I get to the gates the bear goes wild and I start quickly trying to tame him again but the guards run over and kill my boy before I can get the channel off.
---
can vouch this nelf has /kissed me after I attacked her w a shock lmao
---
Its funny how many ways he could've gotten out of that now that i look back on it. We were total noobs then, even being 2nd top alliance guild on the server!
---
True, but you could clearly see on day one that once they added more layers they also upped the Realm capacity, so Im just asuming they bring it down a peg each time they remove a layer, would make sence anyway. Ofc not completly half the realm capacity if they go from 2 to 1 layer, but a small decrease would make sence as to not overload the more heavy pop areas like Org and IF.
---
the time window for getting multiple people songflower buff is really tiny, I believe less than 0.3sec short so you have to start the animation at a really precise time. 
---
There also seems to be a limit of how many people can get a buff from the same flower, we only managed to get 2 at once so far.
---
Wonder if we ever reach no layers. There's still up to 3 hours of queue at the end of the work day.
---
Also thanks for reminding me, I need to make sure I'm online on time for the raid
---
Upgrade to the rare-model wife who isn't jealous or passive-aggressive towards your gaming habits. It's legit great.
---
Or, find the legendary-model gf/wife who plays with you. I didn't get quite that lucky with rng, but maybe you can!
---
Yeah, any good interviewer would replace the "........." with a series of questions to help them understand your experience better.
---
&gt;razorgore
---
Swamp to razogore? what is that?
---
If i didn't know what an online RPG even is, I would just ask more questions. Like what the hell did he do exactly. Determine who gets an upgrade (managing limited resources), Analyzing DPS (Performance review), Scheduling raid times (Time management), Handle disciplinary actions for raiders (employee relations). These are all relevant outside the game, and they're quantifiable.
---
Show the employer your website with the raid schedule, your list of raiders and officers, your logs data and your analysis, your record of who has gotten what upgrades.
---
I imagine your name is a good joke. If so just come to Horde. Youll love it. If your name is nonironic, however, we're full.
---
Beem and Fredda seem to use the classcolor option coming with Leatrix Plus. Zave has a custom ui iirc. You can find his stream in the YouTube description, he can probably answer you more about this.
---
Well aren't I just the biggest idiot
---
I detect a bit of bias to the gf who is utterly jealous and envious of a game. I see this a lot in relationships. There is a lack of hobby for one party, and instead of finding a hobby of their own or joining in, the person without turns their insecurity into disdain for the others hobby, making it a wedge instead of an adhesive for the relationship. “No, instead of finding a hobby of my own, I’d rather rob you of your joy just to appease my own boredom and insecurity/jealousy/envy. I say this because tit for tat... she chose to spend her time with her hobbies as well, seemingly far more than he in this case. So she doesn’t get to blame his hobby for the lack of time spent together when she’s just as guilty.
---
(This isn’t about the cases where we have someone completely bingeing a hobby and ignoring significant other altogether. Specifically talking about a hobby with an average 2hr/day engagement)
---
Also, no biggy, not an attack. Was just having coffee and thought I’d drop my individual point of view.

Yeah, as a frost mage it sucks trying to kill things immune to frost with a frost wand. Now I have a nature wand and it's better most of the time (but there's a lot of immune to nature stuff too ugh).
---
Wasnt the exact wording "most of our servers have been on no more then 2 layers"? I could be wrong and it said all servers.
---
Not sure who to reply to in this thread, but I'm actually a little confused that people who see themselves as casuals are asking about Naxx.
---
For all intents and purposes, the final bosses of Naxx are some of if not the hardest bosses from a consumable and gear level in the history of the game. Mechanically they're tough, but they're made harder by the fact that the class toolkits are pretty bare in comparison to later expansions.
---
People worrying they will be behind the curve or something if they can't clear Naxx is insane. Less than 2% of players in Vanilla could even step in there.
---
Tailoring is fun though. Much more fun than a gathering profession. I've sunk couple of hundred gold into it just to have fun. :)
---
Eastern Plaguelands Tyrs Hand - best pvp zone! :)
---
I only ignore the players in the tank/ healer role who perform terribly.

I can carry bad dps that's fine as long as they arent purposely wiping us

Well, then you have the next 3 days to log in and do it.

How can i downvote your comment more?
---
Viking helm on a paly would be amazing :(
---
If you want to AoE grind, play mage.
---
You cant switch proffesion, and keep the progress. Its lost.
---
Google "classic wow level map" if you want to see zones by mob level.
---
Pls fix servers blizzz :)
---
Damn. 15% baseline is high impossible in blues hah
---
I even choose non-competitive modes and get flamed. It was far less common in unranked than ranked, no doubt about it. But why. I completely stopped playing mobas when riot no longer wanted players to be able to carry. Considered getting into dota2 but I did other stuff instead and now I have the one game to keep me happy, world of warcraft.
---
I did. There is no wow classic option. Just world of warcraft.. could it be because I haven’t downloaded the game yet? I just started downloading it right now. Will it give me the option later on when the full game has been downloaded??
---
Sooo many hunter bugs.
---
Feign is a mess and can’t be used reliably in wpvp. People in this thread are even defending the fact that, in order to properly feign+trap, you must now perform all these special moves that weren’t necessary in Classic like pet on passive, no dots/stings, can’t turn mouse while feign. Wtf is wrong with this sub?
---
And hold up - what did they change about trib runs?
---
It is, fighting over world bosses is a massive part of vanilla..
---
If you're sending something other than money or just text, I think it's 30, otherwise I think it's 10
---
Ironforge, I main horde now but my first ever 60 was a dwarf priest and that city always held a special place in my heart
---
&gt; I get that they can be sold on the AH. I'm just not the type to selfishly roll on someone's upgrade for personal gain. 
---
It's your upgrade, too.  And you earned that loot.  That's not selfishness, that's fairness.
---
Trying to take loot from your party?  That's selfishness.
---
&gt;  I also take solace in the fact that the top responses to this thread reflect that community spirit.
---
Only in this thread.  Most threads fully understand why BoP's are Need/Greed, and BoE's are Need.
---
It's not even complicated at all -- new players just don't understand yet.
---
I am currently levelling casually an alt Hunter (alliance, PVE server), level 26 atm
---
Are there pets that i have to tame (must have during the levelling) or this is not important?
---
And same question for quest rewards? are there some that i should... hunt?
---
When it came to tbc launch for instance, people who had been 60 in preparation, had completed major questlines up until the final quest, completed it and abandoned keeping the items. When tbc launched, people would then go around picking up the quests again and rurning them in, hence gaining XP now that they could, and getting a jump on the xpac, or at least that was the idea, Blizzard caught on ahead of time and made the changes before it could be abused iirc.
---
The plug = drug connect
---
Uhhh, no. There are hanging humans all over the goddamn place.
---
Quick question about questing. It's my first time experiencing vanilla and I've found the thing I enjoy the most is just grinding mobs on my mage, I find it incredibly relaxing and I enjoy the unknown of what items may drop.
---
Am I missing out on anything by not experiencing the quests? I may do the odd dungeon here or there but grinding is where the fun lies for me.
---
Typical rogue - watching disney movies and laughing like a 5 year old doing something unoriginal.
---
You’d never seen them do this in raid. 
---
The only time it’s relevant is wpvp, and those are the times where it doesn’t work
---
Worked for me.
---
Not wow though. Planetside in stead. Had to explain what it meant though. Interview took a while because of that.
---
I especially emphasized that we couldn't use forms of punishments since then people would just leave and make us weaker.
---
They were impressed and I got the job.
---
Just don't corpse camp.  
---
I love a good fight, I love dominating someone close to my level, I love a good gank, I don't mind getting rolled.. once in awhile.  
---
When the fight is over just move on, or let us walk away.
---
Flamelash has no queues in prime time any more?
---
This exactly. There's a very strong chance your previous employers, if contacted, will only confirm your start and end dates, job title, and potentially if it was a voluntary leave or not. They will almost never go into any details about your role, any projects you were on, or reputation you may or may not have. If they do they are most likely breaking their own corporate policy on the topic or some small mom and pop shop that a large corporation calling would take with a grain of salt anyway because you may have gotten the job as a favor.
---
I'm full Fury and I tank just fine in all dungeons, including UBRS, while dual wielding and bei g near top of the DPS meter.
---
AFAIK Paw is the best. Our tanks (both orcs) will be getting them or QS. Deathbringer really is too slow - sure you’ll potentially generate extra threat (less penalty on glancing) and need less hit rating, but you’ll also suffer hughly whenever you get a back to back parry/dodge. 2 parries of Paw is 3 seconds of no white swing threat gen, 2 seconds with deathbringer is 5.8, which is insane.
---
Also heroic strike (really) costs the rage you gen from a swing in addition to the static 12/15, so a fast weapon means it is in essence costing you less rage.
---
&gt;This
---
That?
---
Its so funny dealing with vendors that don't have what you want.
---
My Wind Serpents diet is so refined. Only cheese, fish, or bread. I wasn't aware they were honoring lent, like just eat this boar meat you pretentious ass.
---
Yeah I'm honestly wondering too. Blizz did a huge oopsie with their initial german server list. Faerlina was destined to be a mess as soon as all the big streamers decided to go on a single server, that can't go well in ANY game. 
---
Also you're welcome buddy.
---
1 hour raids? That would be nice
---
hello fellow Whitemaner
---
I do feel for the Horde but after the mess that was Stalagg, I have enjoyed Heartseeker. I’ve never been the initiate-pvp type anyways (unless you’re on my rich thorium node/when P2 starts) Stalagg horde caused me so much grief but when I get bored, I go to low level zones and help horde quest.
---
A gaming friend of mine who is in IT - a very nerdy part of IT - actually put his raid leading on his resume and it was huge success.
---
I’m honestly so blown away to see so many people in this sub defending the glitchy nature and the fact that after 2 months it still doesn’t work like true classic.
---
People in here really cannot deal with constructive criticism against Blizzard, their god and savior.
---
Feign+trap is NOT working as it did in actual Classic and thus NOT working as intended. But fanboys will make you think it works great!
---
Lol. You clearly don’t play hunter.
---
Exactly :) It's not the best "starter build". Ofc you can play it with less crit, but it won't work as well as it's supposed to be.
---
Ahhh that’s the word I was looking for. Portraits! Not nameplates lol thanks for that. But no I’m using the default portraits
---
Weapon chains ^_^
---
Inspect rogues and just do as them.
---
As someone who has been on several LCs, and also just been a nobody dps who shows up and gets loot; the stereotype of a toxic loot council seems extremely far fetched. I've literally never witnessed the corruption that Reddit alleges to be commonplace in the system (not claiming it doesn't happen, just that I haven't witnessed it). What I *have* seen is accusations of corruption, which seem to be 100% guaranteed any time someone doesn't get a piece they want.
---
Rewarding the guy who shows up every time and puts in 110% effort is spun into "rewarding the inner faction" by the 8 guys who  put in less effort and didn't get the drop. And because the limited drops to go around, basic math guarantees that the voices screaming about corruption outnumber the ones who don't.
---
yo what the fuck.....
---
oh look sapper charges
---
One day at a time obviously.
---
Loss of time is a real life consequence. The time spent attempting, and possibly the time spent farming for materials (gold, mats for pots, so on and so forth). 
---
My guild isn't the greatest and we were having issues downing a boss. We spent 2 hours failing over and over again that could have been spent doing something else(in game or out).
---
All layered servers have exactly two layers.
---
No mail between servers.
---
Thanks, so there’s no way to grind like that as a priest?
---
Aaah ok that makes sense - cheers! :)  
---
Just one more thing, after finishing the run, do you just walk back to the entrance? or is there a fast way to reset the instance?  
---
GL farming !
---
Servers full to the brim weren't really a thing in vanilla either.
---
They have had to improvise (admittedly because they wanted to squeeze us all into as few servers as possible to save cash) with the volume of players.
---
Layering was temporary fix while the main mass levelled to 60 but once they're all there and farming mats, having one layer rather than 3 means (if those mats are being farmed constantly) there's a third of the number of mats in circulation on that server. So tripling the re spawn rate directly solves the potential problem for the number of mats to dropping.
---
If it *was* an effort to target the devilsaur market, then it's half assed and poorly thought out, as the removal of layers undoes that effort.
---
why the fuck would you think that flying all the way from darnassus to ZF would be faster than taking an instant boat bringing you two flight paths away ?
---
Gotta keep em both on you :) sucks but it's smart
---
You can lose classic threat meter, details has one that works really nice
---
Yes and PVP is really the only time it matters.
---
Fun? For what? I did it for truefaith and dropped it.
---
Exactly what it is.
---
And why if you have the Venomhide raptor.
---
You will also have the frost saber mount on alliance with zero grind. (In retail)
---
Crafting professions will run you at a loss until a much higher level. 
---
You could drop leatherworking and pick up mining or herbalism but you cannot save your progress into leatherworking.
---
Youll have to start from scratch with your new profession. Priest leveling is slow, but consistent, very little down time drinking due to spirit tap in the shadow tree, would recommend 5/5 wand in disc tho. Duskwood, wetlands and ashenvale are the 20 braket zones. Stockades can yield decent xp/h if u have a good group.
---
Thought thats 1.12
---
Most jobs are unimportant enough that making even a big mistake is usually fixable.
---
&gt; You can persimmon someone in an instance if I am not mistaken.
---
that bugs out a lot sadly
---
Half of the quests you would be completing involve killing the same mobs that you're grinding.  You can be picky about what quests you choose to do, but if you're just grinding you're ignoring the extra xp and items quests would give you.
---
Need to level up your Jump skill
---
I said the long term downside is the exception, I didn’t mean complaining . 
---
Like I said , if they reroll many of us will just reroll to servers where the allies have the majority. 
---
People won’t quit ALL of pvp-then yes those of us, will still have people to grief (on other servers)
---
This endgame you are assuming, won’t happen.
---
Alliance on Stalagg here. Why'd you leave? Why did so many leave?
---
Damn I wish I knew sooner
---
6% for Human though.. go for str and crit instead
---
I would just look up dungeon quests and their prerequisites and try to do what you need to do for them, also see if there are any grinding quests for the mobs you are killing for bonus experience.
---
And class quests, but i am not sure what they are for a mage
---
What do you need gold for? If you need a lot this is not the class unless you always have somebody to farm with. You'll slowly accumulate Gold just by doing instances and raiding. Duo farming is much more enjoyable too, and Warriors love it.
---
No one is going to quit. You think griefing is going to get BETTER when kills are worth honor? Lol.
---
200 people in the guild.
---
Macromanaging means managing people that do micromanaging (officers)
---
Why did you killed him that last time ? You clearly had an opportunity to say : lets make a truce.
---
Ok, thanks for your help
---
You cancel it before your mainhand swings.
---
I toss it out of my bag. If it's part of a quest I'm given the warning message about deleting it "because it's part of a quest." If I don't get the error message it's safe to throw away.
---
Lol whats dkp? I was GM of a guild on a vanilla private server back in 2003 and we never used dkp...
---
You will easily make back the money you spent by picking up another gathering profession and continuing questing.
---
Smartest ally I ever did see.

I hope this can help you out. Thanks for the good wishes, same for you!
---
It's both that there are more and more players every day getting their devlisaur gear so the demand is going down for the leather and there are more and more people grinding things for mount money so the supply of leather is going up.
---
Same with everything else.
---
You can sell stuff needed in quest turn ins, then in Cenarion Circle turn ins etc. And if you do a lot of instances then passive income from that is all you need overall. And right now essences are quite valuable which is acquired without professions (although fishing is an option).
---
Barrens just because of its chat but it is not as funny in Cĺassic as it was back in Vanilla.
---
I think I’ll just switch to making a new character, a mage with skinning and  herbalism or something. That’s what I’ve learned so far would be easiest
---
Cool, thanks for the great answer!
---
I’m not using any macros for it and it works perfectly fine for me. Before it was fucking awful but since that bluepost about them finding the problem it’s been working as intended in my experience 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I use Tukui, it works well
---
Org.. it's too epic!
---
Cool, thanks so much!
---
DAMN THIS LOVELY PIXIE KILLED UNDEAD, GOOD JOB!
---
Yeah but no way of using them and built docs and other stuff for it
---
My GM/MT of the server first Ony/Rag on Thunderfury literally keeps his spell book open and clicks revenge and a few other skills out of it. His hot bars are filled with demo shout. 
---
Can confirm that he does nothing other than show up for raid night for loot.
---
OK so what pre Wrath even was then with plague and zombie players?
---
I’ve had it happen a few times. Actually kinda like it when it drops me in areas you can’t normally get to. But it seems to have stopped now. They may be fixing the problem. My main complaint about it is that you get charged for the flight even if it fails.
---
Ironforge, just a super epic city and the surrounding area is beautiful
---
Bandages are my best friend as a warlock. I keep a stack on me and a stack of rune cloth at all times. Tap and bandage between pulls. Much faster than drinking.
---
It looks nice with the full set, but pieces mixed in with other armour just looks awful
---
If you're enjoying what you're doing, you're probably not missing out on much.  However, there are a lot of quests that are just 'go kill 10 of these, 10 of those, and 10 of the other' or 'kill &lt;whatever&gt; until you get X doojobs' and you could complete those while grinding without any additional effort (aside from picking them up and turning them in).  Doing so would provide you with extra experience, gold, and sometimes some gear that you could use or sell.  
---
For me, I think it's all about remembering that quests are optional and you can drop them whenever you want.  I will often pick up a bunch of quests in an area, do 75% of them, and then get bored with the area (\*cough\* STV \*cough\*) and drop the remainder and move on.  Realizing that was ok made it so questing wasn't as much of a burden and more like just an extra perk for doing what I was going to do anyway, or something to giv eme a little direction when I'm at loose ends.
---
There are some quests that have nice rewards at the end of a long chain though, like [Thunderbrew's Boot Flask](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=744/thunderbrews-boot-flask).
---
It worked by immediately removing you from combat allowing you to drop a trap or drink water or do anything.
---
Now, to feign successfully, you need to do a ton of new things:
---
- Put pet on passive
---
- Have no offensive dots up
---
- Cant look around with mouse after feign
---
- Pet cannot be dotted or in combat
---
- You cannot be dotted or in combat
---
I don’t know how any hunter can defend the current state of feign+trap. It feels so buggy and unreliable. I realize this sub has a lot of Blizzard fans but this is a huge issue for the class in wpvp
---
There is a friggin fish vendor in Steamwheedle port. How did this huntard even make it high enough level to be in Tanaris?
---
Big true.
---
Back in vanilla our guild would bring a carry a few pugs though MC and they would bid gold for gear. Paid for warrior respecs repairs and flasks etc when we was fighting four horsemen
---
you can do some aoe grinding as holy/disc, but not shadow I think. And you need to a lot higher level
---
Yeah I realized that :/
---
It's not removed, it's just not out yet.
---
That’s the problem. How many guild leaders are doing data analysis for the hell of it close to as on par as possible with what you’d expect of a white collar management job? 
---
... a handful? In all of WoW?

Most of that wouldn’t even be close to useful, you just need a data and stats nut who loves WoW.

"There's got to be a better way!"
---
You can disagree, but it’s been shown over the last 15 years that stacking int and stamina are by far more efficient for mages while leveling.
---
I highly doubt Jokerd was stacking spellpower during any of his mage speedruns to 60.
---
if you wanted to do that, you should cancel it after the offhand hits and before the mainhand hits. queueing is really not that big of a deal in the long run though, i'd sooner practice/prioritize the actual rotation and death wish uptime before caring about queuing.
---
besides, once you actually have world buffs and a good raid group, you're just actually using heroic strike or cleave anyway so there's no queuing to be done
---
Later phases as they were catch up mechanics
---
I’m on mograine eu, id say the balance displayed on the graph is pretty accurate
---
The people who were there a month back didn't need this guide.
---
They've changed a lot bro. A whole lot more than #NoChanges
---
Just role with it and accept the long D of blizzard.
---
Honestly I found out that he was standing right next to the tauren windmill and I told him he should fish in a different area. Asking for trouble up there
---
*Types /played.* Whoops.
---
This.

Dragon‘s Call &lt;3

Populations are a lot higher even per-layer than ever in vanilla. So the fighting over the world bosses will be dramatically higher even with 2 layers. If you stick all those players on a single layer, it's not even comparable to vanilla anymore.
---
I’m thinking you don’t wpvp much if you think it works 99% of the time
---
They run away to a big farm up in Goldshire where they play with all the other runaway pets.
---
See that’s fine, nice to know beforehand
---
I would mabye check on classic.wowhead if there are any quests in your area, that a) require the mobs you are grinding anyways b) give items that are a great upgrade for you. Then you check if they are part of a longer quest chain that are too much of a hassle for you.
---
Also, you might wanna look up Mage AOE grind leveling routes. Those are designed to be mostly grinding.
---
well technically then would also fit in this sentence right? Still a better romance, then twilight
---
Yea no one talks about pvp. All I hear is how tough it is at 60 to raid and get gear. Back when I played vanilla through BC, 90% of my time was spent in BGs. It’s sooo fun and you can “solo” your gear without needing a well organized guild. 
---
I’m not going to farm gold and raid as a chore. If it sounds fun I’ll do it, otherwise catch me in the BGs son
---
Many guild leaders also seem to suffer from ego inflation and megalomania.
---
For mages, it’s true. Spellpower does incredibly little for AoE spells.
---
Did you even read the post you fucking moron?
---
For your level range specifically multiple things come to mind:
---
1. At the end of Duskwood you get a nice quiver/ammo pouch from a quest chain.
---
2. If you are in Kalimdor, make sure to tame an Elder Ashenvale Bear for Claw Rank 4.
---
3. Turtles in BFT have loads of cool abilities and ranks that you might want to learn.
---
4. You get a nice bow at the end of the quest chain with the prospectors in Wetlands.
---
Saving them money on repairs at least
---
The Wrathgate right by the Icecrown Citadel. There was just something about looking up at the gate, knowing we're about to assault this nearly impenetrable fortress.
---
The druid tank rolled need on them! Geez
---
Yeah Just hit 41. Nice to see a lot of other people at the same pace as me lol
---
This
---
none of the lvl 50 class quests are out yet afaik
---
Exactly.
---
That’s not how FD should work...... in real vanilla, you weren’t required to complete a laundry list of things just to have a 50% chance on whether feign actually removes you from combat.
---
A good bit of lore and almost all stories are given through quests. There may be some unique or powerful items for your class that are only available through quests (nifty stopwatch, which lets you sprint like a rogue; carrot on a stick which makes your mount run faster; mechanical chicken pet, which is a mechanical chicken pet).
---
Most quests are grinding quests anyway.
---
Fortunately this game is an MMO. 
---
If you want to 1v1 e-peen I recommend CoD rust.
---
There are a lot of helms that just look dumb on trolls. The model used for Herod's helm/Horns or Eranikus/etc comes to mind.
---
That's how I killed him on my first character except it was a poor horde priest who managed to solo it down to just the overseer at 5% before dying.  
---
Technically I did try to help him at the end when I saw he wasn't gonna do it...
---
Feelsbadman
---
Most guild leaders I have known were power tripping assholea. Perfect management material!
---
Not removed, it'll be added later. That said, there's about a million other things that has made classic depart from nochanges. That ship sailed ages ago
---
So you're proud of cowardly camping newbies bc "they should git gud". Yeah, scumbag mentality at its finest.
---
Ashbringer - Horde
---
Interesting. Never say their code on text selection
---
Obviously, but what many argue is that mounts *without* armor looks shit. I agree. This is a very nice feat though.
---
My guild worked out exactly as planned. 5 buff dudes who know each other from other games, just hanging out. Nothing sexual. We invited a bunch of acquaintances, only 2 of them hit 60 and they left for a raiding guild because they never integrated socially with the main 5.
---
As for us, we've been pugging MC/Ony. We abuse the fact that we have 2 healers to get our damage dealers slots as tag-a-longs. It kind of annoys the damage dealers they're the brunettes, but hey they still get laid so they can suck it.
---
Again, nothing sexual.
---
Lol my name is a joke I’m not into having sex with children but can’t join the horde since I wanna play paladin :(
---
... Mage
---
Cool homophobia bro
---
Happened to my old guild in vanilla. To bad they got ninjaed :(
---
Like the COO of symantec, https://money.cnn.com/2014/06/19/technology/world-of-warcraft-resume/index.html
---
That's a 50 DKP minus.
---
Only noobs roll horde on a PvP server. I hate alliance lore but have so much fun in world PvP. I usually end my sessions in stv with my warlock ganking the gankers.
---
Honestly what are you even doing filthy casual. I’m level 34 and you are just wasting your time. You need to power leveling hard like the rest of us.
---
Fuck em, I’m not seeking out lowbies to kill but if I see an easy kill I’m taking it.  90% of the time an alliance wouldn’t show the same kindness to me so why the fuck should I care.
---
you think i wont see a huge difference in misses with off hand from going from 10% &gt; 6% hit?
---
On private servers they 100% did procc Spirit Tap. Can not confirm on live tho.
---
What is leeway range?
---
Oh wow that’s more than I thought
---
Guild 1v1? What is that?
---
Whenever I go to poop, I just hear “you must place that on creep”
---
Unless that's actually more than you think​ it's worth and somebody else makes a similarly inflated bid slightly lower than yours. In that case you would be overpaying and losing DKP that could have gone to something else.
---
Just make a new character
---
Or invest heavily in savory deviate delights
---
Tab sunder /revenge.  There you go that’s 90% of what it takes to be a good tank
---
Imo I think you should worry about buffed not unbuffed. This only matters in raids, PVP is completely different stat prio/gearing and dungeons are faceroll af
---
oh really?  ive personally never quested there, horde or alliance, i just remember all of the ruined night elf structures.
---
Have you seen like...this entire thread?
---
It's nice you have your own rules, but saying "just put on a shield and try you best" is not right. The game is designed to allow people whatever role they want, even DPS as a warrior. Not only that, saying "just put on a shield and tank" is literally asking to get thousands more bad tanks that the majority will hate to be grouped with.
---
It are 3 repeatable quests in Winterspring that help you grind the reputation. I did it aswell, but only after a certain patch. I think it went 3 times as fast back then.
---
#NoChanges except the ones to avoid tickets about loot drama because there are about 1/10th the amount of GMs lol
---
excuse my ignorance but what does the raidleader mean when he says "fap fap fap" ?
---
He can restore this character.. still today. But that will be in bfa 🤮
---
Oh duh, I was thinking of Hunting Bow :)
---
Well no one talks about it because BGs are many months away
---
I stayed (60 warrior) but trying to solo farm in any of the end game zones is a nightmare. I've been ganked regularly by 2+ or when I'm half health. I completely understand why so many left.
---
You just described trainwreckstv
---
Got into mc with his guild at lv55, did no dps, doesn't even know the names of bosses, took shadowcraft bracers instead of giving it to rogues who could actually use them
---
2 resets later, he's still not even 60, so he's still not using the loot he got, and goes to MC again to get carried
---
good lesson to learn bro. np
---
Nobody knew how faction balance would play out, and while horde has better 1v1 racials ally is favored in 2 out of 3 bgs and has better raid fighting ability and easier pve raids.
---
Bite of Serra’kis is the probably the easiest compared to Meteor Shard from Shadowfang Keep and Prison Shank from Stockades. Since SFK is in horse territory and Prison Shank is drop from a rare boss.
---
There are earlier upgrades than Black Menace; there’s Toxic Revenger from Gnomeregan, Torturing Poker from SM: GY, and Swinetusk Shank from Razorfen Kraul.
---
shit happens!
---
Well I watched it and it's just the 4 ogres that you can't simply walk around.
---
Lies. I'm Warrior. Only times I fight for gear is in UBRS. In 5man I never fight for gear, because I'm the one inviting and in much the same way the One Lord of the Rings does not share power, I do not share gear, because I don't invite players who need the same items I need.
---
Classic PvP, run in and pop sapper, ResidentSleeper.
---
Blackrock mountain, the pinnacle of world pvp and the best instances in classic wow.
---
I only kill alliance on weekends ...
---
On weekdays ... Ain't no body got time for that.
---
But I am a prot warrior... If u kill me, i Will gank and murder u. I have hard time lvling and almost no gold.
---
I make up for that with a long list with ppl owing me favours. 
---
So when u kill me. U start a week of hell for u with multiple horde high to low level grouping up to kill ...
---
We have lists of kill on sight.  I lead kill squads on weekends if i wasn't able to farm. 
---
The core group are my family members.
---
Lol I’m actually human mage
---
That's a fair price.
---
That's a vendorin'
---
It's super rewarding though, tanking is so much fun. Healing is the same way. DPS follows kill order it's basically a snorefest, but I'd rather it be boring than dps pulling aggro every pull and having to pump heals for 3 targets over 1. If a dps dies it feels like the world ends.
---
The overly dramatic music, and hard cuts in editing for additional "dramatic" effect were just too much.
---
Less dramatizing, more gameplay.
---
Gladly paying the sub so I don’t have to touch that turd with a ten foot pole :D
---
I didn’t say they did. I implied that they’re prioritizing many other issues over bugfixing and as a result we’re waiting 2+ months of *live* (not counting beta) for a bugfix. And still hasn’t been fixed.
---
Can you link where they changed aggro? How recent was this and where is patch. I just did it last night and didn't see a difference except sometimes Cho would come to me sometimes when I only hit gordok but that makes it easier for me
---
Yes but strength users can wear cloth armor.
---
Confirmed boar.
---
Is there still queues on geh?
---
Yes, his wording might not have been great, but I don't think the mage was being passive aggressive. The druid though f that guy.
---
I was doing Scholo yesterday for the first time in Classic, and everybody probably knows Scholo is a bit of a bitch for aggroing extra packs - everything's tightly packed, a lot of the mobs run off when low. 
---
As a result, I was ranged pulling a lot of the packs to give us some space to work with. Yet for the first 15 pulls a rogue constantly opened with Cheap Shot while they were approaching and soloed some completely different target to the rest of the group. Inevitably, this mob ran off and pulled more.
---
After telling him several times after wipes to just wait until they're close to me and stay close to me (even marked myself to make it easy), eventually he cut it out.
---
But jesus it's fucking frustrating as hell to tank for a group that doesn't want to cooperate. Warrior DPS? Fuck 'em, not even gonna taunt when they inevitably pull aggro.
---
Nice try. We know that's a Tauren penis.
---
I guess you are tougher and more masculine than whole Germany. Congrats on this.
---
Mobs spawns are dynamic, having 2x as many players dye to removing layers = much faster spawns
---
True but i meant all those “life at 60” posts from even before the game came out. Meant for people to decide which classes they wanted to play
---
For reals
---
Many?
---
Spirit is definitely more useful than stamina for leveling imo
---
Did you just compare doing heart surgery for the first time to tanking a dungeon for the first time?
---
Yeah... you did. Yikes.
---
Thanks for the laugh!
---
Really hoping Nethergarde Keep would be on this list so our economy would start to get a bit more normal.
---
Did the Winterfall Incursion repeatable quest
---
Trivago.
---
Unpopular opinion but having held down a role as guild leader as senior managmenrt at a FTSE250 company I can assure you the qualities obtained from guild leader are meaningless and practically worthless. You need people skills and everything that flows off that. Living in a room alone playing guild leader is the nuclear opposite of that and infact makes your people skills worse. That is the reality of it.
---
And they're worth even more converted into bandages. The only cloth this is true for IIRC.
---
I still have mining on my mage (mining/tailoring, mining/skinning previously) and I'll very likely drop mining for herbalism (and I almost have level 35 alt with alchemy). Did some devilsaur (and pristine hide) until it started to drop, now thorium is bit to low compared to what it was.
---
For raw gold making herb/alchemy/fishing will be always valid (with some potions rotating in and out) while most of crafting professions not really and they can be done by anyone as ZG or CC crafts are BoE. That doesn't mean he has to follow those professions. Using them sets a specific playstyle of gathering and fishing. Plus there could be some cap of gold player needs and wants to do other things that using professions actively. Professions choice isn't only income related.
---
If you aggro any patrons or the bartender, a pat spawns that will show up at the door after a little bit.  This is just another way the door opens on top of pickpocketing the key or doing the beer event.  Someone attacked bar patrons or the bartender which spawned the group.
---
You can see it on the server selection screen. Layered realms says layered as pop.
---
Oh god wow did that to me too, cooking and alchemy are some of my favourite things to do in real life now
---
Yeah, this doesn't work, have tried a few times.
---
The correct mindset.
---
your edit changed the meaning of your sentence significantly
---
He's on a different server
---
There is no cut
---
You probably know this but the 200 ap buff only applies to melee attacks pog
---
It's only 1 dot, insect swarm is nature dmg and she's immune.
---
You prolly wo t notice the difference anyways but the realm overview will tell you
---
what good are dungeon blues going to do you in aq40
---
What? So if he thinks a gnome male looks horrendous in this kind of armor he's a homophobe?
---
Please stop throwing around accusations like that, it devalues actual homophobia and the oppression gay people face everyday.
---
Meanwhile on Deviate Delight zugs are open game. I’ve never seen a sadder group of people who can’t open world pvp.
---
Right? Forgot to mention that but yeah, *I* was "in the wrong" for not enabling him to ninja the item? Dude was a complete asshole.
---
Right, because knowing where absolutely every vendor is in the game is some indication of skill level.
---
&gt; why the fuck should I care
---
he just fucking told you why
---
As to this day I never saw a mage using anything but frost nova + blizzard. I will be surprised to see one using these skills even if they use it the wrong way.
---
&gt;But if there’s data you track it
---
You would hope, wouldn't you?
---
I didn’t say anything of the sort.
---
I have a friend who actually put guild leader of his guild on WoW on his resume, because it actually is something worthy of putting on your resume if you actually ran a legit guild and it gives the interviewer easy and interesting questions to ask and you the ability to stand out from your competition.
---
This literally is how real life works.
---
Hey at least his weapon skills are maxed out with all that extra int!
---
That's just what I said? Silk, mageweave and runecloth are worth more to vendors as bandages (40s vs 30s for silk, 80s vs 60s for mageweave, 1g vs 80s for runecloth).
---
You don't lose SWP or MB, so you can still use those. But it's way less efficient without wand and spirit tap, and obviously you're missing mind flay too.
---
A lot of people commenting to you are off base on solo grinding ability. You can easily solo grind parts of mara as holy.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MZIDzSXhKe4
---
You can find guides how to do it, by this is what you want to be doing as holy.
---
There is also nothing wrong with devoting 5-10 talent points to purposes and other than healing. If you want wand specialization go for it. Though as you get better gear I might suggest only a 3/5 spirit tap or 4/5. As improved end game healing gear will make up some of the difference in mana regen. You shouldn’t need spirit tap to prof on every single kill.
---
little b a b y i always feel really bad when my kitten does that on a flight. like no ur little legs cant go so fast
---
Meanwhile my guild cleared it 5 times with no bindings and I haven’t even gotten a weapon yet  ;(
---
It's so people can make "twink characters" for PvP so they stay within a specific level bracket. 19, 29, 39 are the most common.
---
Weird, I got to roll on that....and lost!
---
wtb broccoli tabard
---
That's now... it seems like when transfers opened it it was more 45/55 or maybe 40/60... but only alliance decided to xfer?
---
I mean I love vanilla and stuff but orc is master race for pvp. They had to have seen this coming where the last 10 years of retail you could see what people were playing on Tich. It was alliance favored with their trinket racial and then back to orc once that got nerfed.
---
They should all be multiplicative with each other. Darkness should only increase base spell damage (excluding spell power), not sure about shadowform.
---
Yeah, but you also beat a bunch of all the other races too. Even gnomes. You are picking on the gnomes too. They already have it rough enough, no need to embarrass them.
---
Eh from context it was obvious, but such is life.
---
I just got all 3 items. Used the rod for aoe farming and the  hypno/oh for dungeon runs until I got the staff dr ZF. Sm was so fun to run it just happened naturally.
---
There is a very distinct difference between managing two hundred people who WANT to be there, as opposed to two hundred people who HAVE to be there.  I've managed 100+ people before.  Scheduling, compensation, conflicting PTO requests, benefits seminars, HR infractions, promoting, terminating, delegating.  It's a fucking nightmare.  I'd much rather deal with two hundred people who want to play a video game.
---
I love Menethil Harbour! I love the boat theme and it's where I've had the most genuine interactions!
---
?
---
Who else runs to the quest area when they see this?
---
if you think raid leading is in any way going to help you in a meaningful way in real life you are very wrong, unless you are a timid baby who has trouble with speaking in public.
---
Goldshire!
---
First town you explore as a human just outside the great city of Stormwind. Also, most people's first time dying in the game is to the pesty murlocs at the lake near by.
---
Not just with Classic but through all history of WoW, Mulgore and Thunder Bluff have always been place I've called home.
---
Tanking Strath (especially UD) is all about line-of-sight pulling (around the corner). This helps SO much with keeping threat when they all in 1 tiny spot instead of spread and casting ranged abilities. Wouldnt waste consumeables on something that can be easily done without.
---
BuT tHiNk Of ThE cOnTeNt CrEaToRs!!!!!
---
If it's anything like I'm used to, they don't come in a good raid spec, and are more busy farming then they are trying to get bis.  There are some good ones out there and it's absolutely noticed when they are around.
---
And let's face it, none of them are really all that difficult or impressive either. Sure, it takes some coordination to set up and execute a raid, but let's not pretend that it's some amazing accomplishment that proves your worth as an employee or manager. In the end, it's still just a video game event and what OP describes is magnitudes less stressful, time-consuming or challenging than actually being responsible for the livelihoods of a few hundred people and planning, managing and supervising real-life business operations. All the OP shows is a basic capability to coordinate and communicate that everyone in a position with any responsibilities should have - nothing more.
---
Can confirme Spirit Tap does not trigger off the Skeletons. 
---
It did on pservers, hence why many guides recomend it.
---
I’m level 54 Holy Paly and not entirely sure what I should be doing next. I’ve got quests for BRD, am I the right level? And, what is the jargon in LFG for entry level BRD?  And, same thing for Dire Maul.
---
lol my friends and I quit the game cause we were getting outnumbered and killed on Skeram every time we tried to do any quests (we're first time WoW players) so the fun was definitely short lived
---
The trick is to not cancel cat form, they abuse the games logic to toggle state when you cast catform.
---
*This cancels the aura's, so they can be reapplied in cat form.*
---
*then cancels any form except cat form.*
---
*Then casts cat form if your not in cat form, cancels it if you are.*
---
/cancelaura Leader of the Pack

/cancelform [noform:3]

/use Cat Form

You don't happen to be on Kromkrush server?
---
Literally nobody
---
It’s always a joy to me on my server when some chicken shit coward attacks me at 20% health and as I begin to beat to ever living crap out of them they bring 2-3 more friends to kill me.
---
I’m sure this garbage happens on both sides.
---
That’s ok though because blizzard is just fueling the fire by allowing cross battlegrounds. 
---
Servers would even out pretty quick if they removed that.
---
Nope
---
No graphics settings, only a few game tweaks.
---
Clicked video. 
---
Heard God awful, overused, absolute shit music in the background. 
---
Closed video.
---
I don't think so
---
i’m level 14 and have 11 hours played.. this is gonna be a good long while...
---
&gt; Spellpower does incredibly little for AoE spells.
---
Ah I see. Yea, I guess since the current meta is 
---
"ZOMG CLEAVE CLEAVE CLEAVE CLEAVE NEED CLEAVE AOE CLEAVE LFM CLEAVE" that's all that matters.
---
I’m pretty sure I read a story where some guild leader became a ceo and he used wow as his main experience. I might just be crazy and making things up I’m not sure 🤔
---
Maybe check the classic rogue discord channel
---
I’m rather certain this is how one of the CEOs of Starbucks came to be? Correct me if I’m wrong. Surprised nobody else has mentioned it.
---
I got attacked in gen chat for saying I wouldn’t gank low levels. Apparently I shouldn’t play on a PvP server because I’m only interested in gaining people with a chance to win.
---
Epic mount &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other shit &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BOE epics
---
Un'goro crater. Such fond memories from the first time I leveled there
---
I love the area where Ragnaros spawns. The music still brings fond memories, the role-play between him and Domo is awesome, and it's just a great encounter in general.
---
Also 60 ally on stalagg. Just finished farming elementals as my PvE spec with 2 UD mages and a troll spriest around me, all whom could have killed me. They didn’t.
---
I’d say 80% of the time I see horde, they don’t attack.
---
Gotta adapt and survive
---
executions cleaver
---
superior to all, good to 60
---
It’s part of the base UI. It’s not on by default however, so they’d have to go through their settings to turn it on.
---
I think they were just showing them in trade. A different comment said it looks like it went to a Warrior. Hard to tell though.
---
Takes us about 2 hours but if you look back a few weeks it took us 5-6 hours over two days.
---
60 Warrior tank, and my guild is struggling badly on the Undead packs in DM:W.  Our guild can clear strat UD, DM:N but those packs in there just wreck us in seconds.  Anyone have any tips for dealing with it, or do we just need a priest for a shackle?
---
 No because even if he doesnt have an epic mount its not a thing that makes you stronger. If someone gets an item the dungeon gets a bit easier. From that point onward
---
I feel you. My guild has a lot of people that haven't been on in two weeks or a month. But my guild is the only horde guild on my server that is Letterkenny themed so I'd be sad if I left. Honestly, if end game raiding is your main goal then joining a big guild that advertises in trade or LFG might be your best bet. Hopefully your friends come back.
---
I do, scatter+fd trap has always worked for me. You’re doing something wrong if it doesn’t work half the time. What does your macro look like?
---
Good pvp ruined by incoherent video editing
---
I’m one of those nose to the grindstone players so when I’m one raptor and a tiger away from cashing quests and it has to wait another hour I get pissed.
---
Love posts like these, always nice to see if I'm missing something and generally seeing other peoples setup is interesting. 
---
Regarding your list: 
---
20. Field Guide, try "What's Training" instead, less intrusive as it's icon is in your spell book. 
---
31. Max Cam, this can be deleted since Leatrix offers the same option. 
---
Also for people looking for other nameplate addons or wanting to try something different: "Plater Nameplates"
---
Great customization and another big plus is the ease of importing new configs via websites like www.wago.io
---
Crosscompatible like Weakauras for the most part. (Some features are only available in retail, max render distance for example etc)
---
Depends on what you consider griefing I guess.  I don't think me killing someone in stv once as a level 60 is griefing.  Pvp happened. If I were to prevent them from questing at all, that would be griefing.  But there are literally people who think getting killed in a contested zone is griefing.  And ooh boy, phase 2 is gonna be rough for them.
---
But that how it really was in 2005....
---
Except the serious guilds had teamspeak
---
trick or treat last one hour. you can only get a bag from innkeeper when the debuff is off and cant click it off. The innkeeper will trick you with a buff that changes your look to a costume for an hour but wont allow you to mount or fly to other zones while altered, some will some wont i think, you can click them off if this is an hassle. They can also transform you for a minute that you can not click off and cant mount etc.
---
???????????? He got the tag
---
Rogue here, had at 40 92g (I've spent over 50 however ine course of leveling) money came in from selling on the AH and selling bandages to the vendor. If you watch out a bit it's easy to be at 100g at lv40, just takes some precautions, not buying your gear from ah and avoid skilling professions with stuff bought from ah. My brother managed 300g at 40 as herbalist and alchemist.
---
Nope, they're already tanked
---
Edgemaster was 500 gp 3 weeks ago and down to 300g now
---
Archmage pattern was 300g, now down to 70g
---
That tauren has too many fingers
---
Start tanking dungeons.  Add friends at the end of a run if you enjoyed playing with em.  Tell em to add you if they ever need a tank.  Play with them more and more.  Join their guild or find one with them.
---
Are... Are you *the* turtle? From beyond the grave?
---
If this is really how it is for you, you’re doing it wrong.
---
Just free hand man. Used a marker to draw and a small Walmart pumpkin carving knife
---
XDDDDDDDDDD
---
XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
aylmao
---
Yeah it is hard to tell.
---
Yeah same here, I did the quest on Lightbringer and it procced. Was told it might not here.
---
Don't forget to take any 90% of guides from actual Vanilla with a grain of salt, because man were we bad at the game back then
---
I wrote Fury guides back then. Fortunately the site they're on went down a long time ago and I can't access them on wayback for some reason, must not have been crawled. 90% of what I remember writing is absolutely wrong, and I've realised recently that 17 year old me was super bad at the game and had no place writing guides that were used by a bunch of people on my old server. Oof.
---
Can someone explain to me how PvP servers work? I have tried googling multiple times finding something that just breaks down exactly how they work but I always just find articles about which server to pick. I know PvP is where you kill the other faction and stuff but that’s basically all I know.
---
But..thats like a druid levelling to 60 and never learning any shapeshifts lmao. How can you be a hunter and not have a pet.
---
It's an *Always Sunny* reference.
---
&gt;Except spellpower is borderline useless for levelling, where casters would much prefer larger mana pools
---
If someone applied with Raid Leader as part of their experience.  I'd allow it.  Ask them which game, which guild and to provide me a couple of guild members names for verification and to see if they are, indeed, a decent person.
---
After not visiting a certain area for a few weeks I tend to forget where everything was. Fuck, sometimes it takes me only days to forget...
---
Oh no, I meant the wickerman buff. Thinking of getting one before a raid since it's not an easy task on alliance side, but not sure if it would last the whole way.
---
Logged on to Flamelash yesterday and the server was nuts!
---
WPVP HERE I COMEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Still leveling crew represent
---
Having more fun 1-59 than I've had in years of max level at classic, only thing that starts at 60 right now is MC farming without battlegrounds out :zzz:
---
I'll just be here world pvping
---
It wasn't our fault that ass was so fine.
---
Last night we were clearing trash to get to Majordomo to summon Rag.  Someone accidentally pulled an extra lava pack and we wiped, wiping out some of the buffs folks had spent 30 minutes running around getting.  Guild leaders chewed everyone out.  
---
At that point I just had a clear and crystallizing moment of "fuck this, this isn't even fun, why am I putting up with this?"  I have a job with a lot of responsibilities, a family, plenty of other things I can do with my time... it's just so fucking dumb to play this game, especially in the context of subservience to a guild.
---
I alt-F4'd, I left discord, I cancelled my subscription, I uninstalled, I watched The Good Place with my wife.  Great decision.  My advice:  just quit.
---
I... you... can't even... Dude just read the ability.
---
Bonescaper - fast dagger for offhand +30 attack power, drops from baron in Strat Ud, 7% drop chance. Best offhand prebis for dagger spec
---
All 51 points in feral, yup.
---
Thunderbluff. The best underrated capital city
---
Literally why I changed servers. Constantly got ganked 0 alliance to help or assist.
---
ahh 2 hrs im 95% sure
---
Maybe an odd question, are you marking focus targets and is your group actually following the instruction to focus?
---
If you charge in, thunder clap, switch to defensive stance and demoralizing shout that should be enough to hold agro for at least half an AOE pack... Assuming the group waited to unload.
---
From there, cleave like crazy and revenge / sunder tabbing. 
---
The water will help and engineering is actually just the best profession for any class if you have the time and finances to do it.
---
I do a combination of "driving" with the mouse (using two buttons) and moving about with the WASD keys. If I'm fighting in PvP, I'll move with just the mouse, strafe with A and D, if I need to by releasing the LMB. 
---
I also only use 1-4, Q, E, MB3, MB4, and MB5 (and Shift + 1-4) for all my hotkeys. 
---
I'm pretty sure anyone who physically watched my play would think I'm a crazy person, but it's what's comfortable to me. It's all muscle memory.
---
Sorry you are having a tough time. 
---
Our guild is super focused on “The Team” we started with 10ish RL friends, picked up another friends circle on day one and have been recruiting ever since. Way we see it is if someone in the guild made progress it was worth the time and effort. I have tanked so many low level dungeons and high level dungeons that I needed nothing from. 
---
Phase 3 is a LONG way away. We have plenty of time to get our BIS lists done. We are focusing on getting our lower levels to 60 and geared. We are pugging raids with guilds we made friends with in the meantime. Getting our player base to 60 before phase 2 starts is WAY more important than grinding out our last 1 or 2 preraid BIS items.
---
I got hired at my current position because the interviewer played WoW.
---
It's the same way people turn being a "key holder" or "assistant manager" at a fast food joint when they are in college into a good resume builder. Let's be honest, managing anonymous people online to work together for a common goal requires just as much effort and ability as dealing with people complaining about their schedule and showing up on time to open a store. They are both jobs that people with no experience either willingly sign up for or have forced on them because they are reliable. Turning that experience into something that sounds good on a resume is easy.
---
I remember hearing about this another time. Do you fly as fast as the Gryphons during flight paths? Do they have a ceiling or can you fly like straight up untill you see the whole island? That'd actually be pretty dope lol
---
Hmmmmmkay I’m not calling out 2h tanking. Not putting on a shield after continuously proving you’re biting off more than you can chew is what I’m calling out.
---
I had a delightful 2h tank last night. Best run I ever had.
---
Gnomeregan, the place is so atmospheric. To think that it almost was a functional capital.
---
They have warped views on griefing. :)
---
And yeah, I really want to get levelled up before Phase 2, haha.
---
I am really not finding that this time round. Playing less and slower means:
---
Questing is fun (because I don't do enough to get bored, and I take time to enjoy the environment)
---
Grinding is relaxing (a great way to wind down)
---
Dungeons are an adventure
---
Crafting is rewarding
---
Pretty sure the plan was to just blast Stormwind to smithereens with cannons
---
This is so damn good.
---
It's the same guild cleared naxx with on pserver so it's worked out fine. We're all starting to get quite geared now.
---
Nope but you can off tank. And do more dps than a pure dps class..
---
gotcha, thx
---
;)
---
...maybe.. :D
---
Winterspring grind was also very heavily nerfed at some point as well, became on par with the raptor.
---
If they played, they'd understand.
---
I know you probably aren't taking requests, but if you ever decide to do a panel/strip involving inexperienced players costing you several gold's worth of buffs/elixirs/etc and forcing a corpse run back to the instance, I'll smash the like button so hard it'll call me daddy
---
DOZENS!
---
It's not
---
BRD belt is much better
---
I'm impressed you got the first 1500 in a day. This shit takes me like 30 minutes per quest, which comes out to like 15 hours.
---
I still do do really decent AOE damage as a 17/3/31 warrior. I just save up 25 rage and swap to zerker for a Whirlwind if I can soak an extra hit or two.  Does aoe damage and threat.
---
You spelt Mara wrong.
---
Sorry I should have known to be more specific.  I was referring to Demonic Sacrifice of Void for HP regen.
---
Yeah, that's pretty much what happened, to be honest!
---
After a long time without queue, yesterday we experienced queue again because layering was removed. Queue was about 10 minutes.
---
I really love to fish off of darkshore.
---
Love it man, I also love alliances like yourself, that get their ass kicked 4 times, 1vs1 and then they go call 2 of his friends lvl 60 to come kill me, or in winter spring i go alone i kill two or 3 allies, alone, they come back with a group of 5 to kill... **ONE HORDE**.
---
*laughs in survival hunter*
---
It has *never* been no changes. There have been many changes, both good and bad, so far.
---
Yeah, it did, with some hiccups. A variety of factors led to most players in the guild (myself excluded) taking far longer to hit 60 than two weeks real-time, so we're a bit behind the most cutting-edge guilds when it comes to gearing/progression. Our first official raid was two weeks ago, and I would have preferred third week of September. But (1) I've grown to like the guild members; and (2) I'm in a rare position of being a guild Shadowpriest, so I wasn't going to just run to a very slightly faster guild.
---
Raid times have remained what they were advertised, we have our guild comp mostly set, we're comfortably clearing MC and Ony (last night we had some serious problems with pathing and respawning bugs that caused several wipes, but that's life), and I've gotten a surprisingly consistent amount of loot given that I didn't expect to receive anything for some time.
---
Gratz man, I'm still trying to scrounge the money for a regular epic mount before starting this grind.  I've gotten past the meat, but the Incursion quests are sooo much running, it doesn't make sense to do it on a 60%.
---
carrots have a great shape for a buttplug, just have to make sure the green part of the carrot are strong enough or you will have a bad time
---
That is subjective. The best part of wow is not the “friends you make along the way” to me. The best part of wow might be the combat, the progression of gearing, the gathering of mounts, battle pets, cosmetics for transmogs. Let people play the game they pay for the way they want to play it. Not everyone wants the drama that comes along with guilds/people but love to play wow for its Lore combat and gear. And nobody talks? As soon as I login I get upward of 10-15 whispers from people asking if I can help them with this or that, Again though I’ve been playing wow since release so I guess I’ve built up quite a friends list. I simply would like you to understand you can’t decide what makes a game best for everyone.
---
If you want to give it a little longer you could Pug for a few weeks. MC gear is pretty optional. Rag and Ony are the two big bosses with T2 which is usually a major upgrade rather than T1 where stats are less optimized.
---
Don't worry, It wouldn't be a pleasant video for a hordie like you anyways.
---
Hey what’s that add on you have which shows whether the quest is regular or a dungeon?
---
too big.
---
it's just a contest between mages spamming AE-nova-CoC.
---
smaller scale 10 v 10 are more interesting, imo.
---
What is the threshold of worth it? Obviously it will shift as you level up but let's say you are at 40- what is sufficient SP to be worth stacking?
---
It’s like a constant demoralizing shout. Your tank will love you for it..... if he could hear after listening to it every 4 seconds for the entire instance
---
Valor shoulders on the orc
---
The fishing dock in Loch Modan.
---
What quest addon is that or is that the default quest ui?
---
I knew I would get roasted by sweaty redditors for how I worded that. I don’t know the specifics, but fishing will make you a fuckton of gold for little work(clicking a bobber) in SV that is a fact
---
Thanks man this is what I was looking for.
---
Haha, you can't win on the internet.
---
Nice!
---
The hell is this awful music
---
Very impressive! I also want to become a balance/boomkin/resto hybrid pvp beast.  Whats your talent build? How do you manage your mana so gracefully? I would go oom in the first 15 secs of any of those fights lol.
---
&gt;So I don’t get it. Why come on a pvp server if you don’t want to pvp? 
---
Because  ot everyone playing on pvp is or should be interested in pvp. I would never play on a pve server even if i had 0 interest in pvp because pve servers dont make sense to me and having the option to attack someone and vice versa is in my opinion part of the game even if i had no interest in it at all. Its like friendly fire in fps games, i dont intend to use friendly fire and i hope people dont do it against me but im not gonna turn it off because it makes no sense to me.
---
This is exactly how you put dungeons and dragons on your resume too. If you can get around telling them what the position actually is it literally just sounds like you were a boss. Its a good life hack for us gamers.
---
🦀11$🦀
---
You should probably get that ball checked out
---
ew night elves, gonna have to aimed shot a few of them when I get on...hehe
---
Yep pretty much confirms to me that most horde gankers are just one big dum hivemind.
---
Wish I could transfer my character to alliance from horde on stalagg
---
Hell yeah dude, that’s exactly what I was up on too!
---
This time I got super lucky—my SO found a Recipe:Savory deviate delight and gave it to me... now I can just snag deviate fish, cook em up, and sell em for 2-3g a stack!
---
Some manager type positions are not face to face either any more. Knowing how to organise a group of people online is definitely a skill that some employers want.
---
We are going strong. Started a few months before launch and while people have come and gone our core team is in for the long haul. Highlights have been consistently downing Ragnaros in phase one of the fight &amp; clearing MC and Onyxia in one night. 
---
We aren't a private server guild but all of us played original WoW so many years ago and most of us on the server Medivh.
---
Equifax has entered the chat.
---
&gt; The next one down the list is Smite with 71% but if you're DPSing with Smite, then you're doing it wrong. Almost every other offensive cast has less than 50%.
---
Eh, leveling as holy, the spirit into spellpower talent and all the +spirit/+spellpower stacking has the dps while solo pretty high. Obv its not a group dps spec, but its fine for solo
---
Un'goro crater. In a world where quests are all over the place, having this little heaven of condensed quests and short distances is great for those last few levels.
---
on a pvp server you have "contested" zones where you can freely attack players of the opposing faction, of any level.  There are also uncontested zones where the home faction is safe from attack from the opposing faction unless they turn on their pvp flag (/pvp) or act as the aggressor which will automatically turn it on.  These are mostly just starting zones around the main towns like Durotar around Org for example.  Most of the world is contested and open pvp.  
---
PVE servers are always safe from other players unless you turn on your pvp flag making yourself able to be attacked by the opposing faction.
---
What happens in undercity?
---
I'm asking because that's where I ended previously and curious if I can continue my journey, even though i have like 20% of the time I used to have.
---
Although reading my OP and seeing the responses, im happy to be able to visit a few of the bosses I suppose, forgot there may be huge differences between 'setting foot in' and 'finishing off the last boss'
---
You’re talking mainly to an audience that will smile at your face then frostbolt you in the back... while being 10 levels higher.
---
I see the same people farming the same spots everyday. Its nice pvp :)
---
Yes you can.
---
It was only used on pservers because they would record boss kills, so it was easier that way. But since Classic doesn't do that, there's no reason to measure from Luci pull. You're right that it's a dumb metric that is very open to gamesmanship.
---
Most region are "contested" (hillsbrad, STV ETC) so player from both faction will be flagged for pvp (in pve server you have to /pvp to toggle it and let other player attack you). Other will be "dominated" by one of the two (for example the Barrens is horde) so only alliance member will be automatically flagged.
---
Any general advice for a warlock new to raiding? I find myself dying early in important fights (like ony and rag). I’m using full consumes and have LIP, but for instance in p3 ony I keep getting aggro and dying instantly for some reason, or getting blasted way back into the lava during rag.
---
My guild is cracking down on low performers so I definitely want to be able to stay alive, any general advice in terms of positioning/consumes etc?
---
It's like a 4% drop so strap in
---
On PVE Servers you can't attack players of the other fraction in the open world, period. On PVP Servers, you can attack them. Exceptions are areas which are fraction speciic, i.e. alliance can't attack horde in durotar. You also can attack players in towns such as Booty Bay, but you get aggro from guards and they will kill you.
---
You're not wrong, but lore-wise, Stormwind should have always had a harbor.
---
I just means, that in a contestet zone (basically every zone, that is above lvl 20 ish) every player from the opposing faction can attack you at will. A pve Server works like the lower level zones: You can only be attacked if you flag yourself eligible for pvp.
---
Oh no
---
I don't know actually. But from what I recall, if you can get all the crafted SP ones (like Azure set) etc, it is worth it.
---
big kudos for scrolling down, already thought my comment will go unanswered
---
if you dont mind I would like to expand my question
---
first of all, after posting I noticed that I most likely wont get "Black Menace" because same quest has "Sword of Serenity" as quest reward which is prolly higher prio
---
second to clarify, Im playing combat build but I chose version without any weapon spec for leveling, you pick up endurance and imp sprint instead, which imo has 2 benefits, first of all you improve your solo leveling and increase your wpvp potential, second it doesnt narrow your weapon choice so for example rn Im rolling with Sword in MH and Dagger in OH but I could as well use MH Mace if I get smth nice
---
third, I would value "Bite of Serra’kis" because 1.It has high attack speed which results in more poison dmg and second it has long lasting  2. it has long lasting poison (%chance on hit), which is nice in wpvp because it should counter bandages (at least i think it should) but on the other hand it ruins your own gouge so its like advantage and disadvantage both
---
So I would say daggers like "Prison Shank", "Meteor Shard", even prolly "Toxic Ravager" and "Torturing Poke"r are all worse daggers for OH
---
First one looking straight superior is "Coldrage Dagger" which has really high dps and decent attack speed
---
I might be wrong, still learning so if my point of view is straight wrong let me know please
---
Yes, and a lot of that will come with gear and practice more than any specific spec. Who knows who will still be playing in a year, it doesn’t make sense to artificially limit it now for what will be happening in a year.
---
Do you have a source for this? I gave you the benifit of the doubt and looked around for information but couldn't find anything about the Devs wanting the servers to be the same cap as they were in vanilla (3k).
---
Besides, the Devs increased the server size on August 28th to help reduce queue times as classic was more popular than anticipated.
---
If more layers increases the server size already, why not just add more layers instead of  putting out a hotfix to do the same thing?
---
One of my first jobs came from a friend i met playing MMORPGS. He wanted to me to help manage large corporate events for a big IT firm. I had no confidence , and these events were always in different countries  , always ones where I didn’t know the language at all. 
---
He said that he had seen me deal with many difficult personnel issues online and after that these gigs would be easy. 
---
He was totally right.  Hard work but satisfying. We’re still great friends and still throw each other work. 
---
Even if the skills don’t make it onto your CV, doesn’t mean you don’t have them.
---
I straight up got dropped in 1k needles on a flight to Tanaris. 1k foot drop and reincarnated and hearthed. Another time it did it over and over in Tirisfal for a good 10 minutes on my way to Undercity.
---
I'm a click player. I also do amazing dps/heals. I tried going to keybinding but after 14 years it feels clunky to me. Why fix what ain't broken?
---
So you need to learn to manage your threat.
---
I meant the loot whining, that's basically the same.... Lol.
---
And yeah, MC and ONY, even then are large dungeons... Or as I call them, awake checks.
---
Let's see if this continues into BWL and beyond.... Im thing of Val the corrupt... Or as my server called it then, the guild breaker.
---
Can everyone stop saying it's on a Rogue. Are you blind?
---
The Rogue is on the left of the Trade window...
---
Yes, that too....
---
 i have had an alt in winterspring since like week 2. i have gotten over 200 runecloth bag patterns from qia HAHAHAhA
---
Naraxis’s cave in Duskwood.
---
I'm 55% of the way through level 39 with only 49 gold so now I'm grinding Shadowfang Keep so I can get that mount money before I hit 40. Luckily the grind hasn't gotten boring so at least I got that going for me.
---
 [Rhok'delar, Longbow of the Ancient Keepers](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18713/rhokdelar-longbow-of-the-ancient-keepers)  is the same 2.9 speed?
---
A wild guess, Classic questlog
---
The more non-sequiturs they work in, the better it is.  Props to the OP - they are pretty good at this.
---
I've always pulled the first couple back to the gate where you can use that elbow. In my experience none of the buildings actually block LoS and mobs can just run/cast through them.
---
It's just a joke bro
---
It's called Wide Quest Log!
---
Tbh I'm genuinely having fun healing. The fact that its hard sometimes and keeps me on my toes, isn't 100% cookie cutter, and having to play the mana conservation game, it's a good time.
---
You could try and add some of them if you like them.

What's your ui add on :)
---
Because OP made the chart for himself and probably speaks English...  I'm sure he just thought it would be nice to share the data he does have in case anyone else finds it helpful
---
The only difference is that on PVE servers only the major cities are faction-specific areas that force your pvp flag on, with the rest of the zones being neutral, while on PVP servers all zones apart from the first two zones for each race are "contested", forcing everyone's flag.
---
Yep.  When people start leveling alts the original prices from 3 weeks ago will be the steady price.
---
Thank you for you reply mate, all i needed. I'm a NElf so i guess i'll stick with Axes.
---
/join Lookingforgroup lets you keep questing or go ahead and head to the dungeon and make the group along the way. But automating the social interaction of forming groups is bad for communities. 
---
Add good players to your friends list. If your guild is a ghost town find a better one by asking around. Our guild is far from Massive. 40+ mains but I have like 20 people on my friends list from pugs that I met and talked to on my way to 60. We have made alliances with other guilds. We are pugging MC with one of them this week. 3 bosses left to clear for tonight. Yay! I’m a tank so groups are easy for me to make but with the community we have built up I could go DPS tomorrow and still get groups within 10 min.
---
I just assume I drop the meat on the floor if I don’t get it
---
Stranglethorn vale, I just love the jungle feel and it was the first time I came about the love/hate relationship of pvp :)
---
I recommend Power Rangers next.
---
Thats not the honor im referring to. Im talking about personal honor. Something you might lack.
---
some of the stuff about warrior is outdated and only applied on private servers though.
---
I ended up watching the serie with Takanshi's warrior masterclass, and this is the real shit
---
What do people do to fill the time?  I have my Epic Mount, I have all of my Pre-BiS along with various pieces of raid (T1/T2) gear.  Toying with the idea of making an Alt.  Is this the part of WoW that most people will just raid-log and wait until Phase 3 and BG's?
---
*Notices HoJ and Blackstone Ring*
---
Yes, you're invited to my party.
---
Double check the phone is your pocket before you stand up and hold on to it while standing up. My brother did not once and the phone plopped right in the toilet. I’ll keep it a mystery on whether he flushes before or after standing up.
---
One of the worst feelings is to turn all of that in and still not reach the next level.
---
Fuckin RNG...
---
Ditto, but slightly worse.
---
Really, I would like to thank Lactose from elitist jerks for writing his famous (for me, at least) "Hunter damage cycles breakdown", in which he analyses thoroughly the hunter weapons and the possible dps of each of them. It has helped me better understand the strengths of the class, as well as perform better as a hunter.
---
So middle management then
---
Maybe you were lucky enough to do it relatively soon after a server restart or something. I've done that quest twice and both times there were basically no scorpions anywhere.
---
They either don't have the money or the access to Healing Power (+55 healing) or Spell Power (+30 spell damage). Plus, weapon damage adds a soft blue glow for aesthetic.
---
Yes, and both TC and WW are limitated to 4 targets. I'd rather spend the 5 rage more on a change stance WW.
---
Tried to create the Dark Brotherhood, requiring a performance of the Black Sacrament before we'd go out and kill... I thought it would have been fun
---
This is exactly it. It is, we are both home, all I (the gf) have to do is watch TV or knit or something, while you are upstairs laughing, goofing off with your friends, and generally having a better time than me. Why cant you laugh and goof with me like that etc etc etc.
---
I still spend plenty of the time with the lady and do things that make each other happy. I just get most of my gaming time after she goes to bed. I do tell her ahead of time that certain night will be game nights. Like hey, babe, COD MW comes out tomorrow. Im gonna get us some pizza, a 6 pack for me and Ill get you a bottle of wine. lets carve some pumpkins tonight together but tomorrow is game night.
---
A lot of it is managing expectations and communicating. Let he know what you want to do, find out what she wants, compromise.
---

FYI you can save the posts :)
---
on the flip side!
---
You need to CC and DPS the whatever the whiteish looking mobs are called, they do a mean AoE. You can't let them free cast.
---
I don't think he is saying there are no consequences, but they don't compare directly.  
---
If you make a big mistake as a guild leader, you've lost some members or some time. There are no real life consequences for your actions there. You aren't relying on being a guild leader to pay your mortgage or to feed your family. Worst case is you lose out on time and pixels. 
---
If you make a mistake at your job, especially at a higher level, you could not only affect your income, but you could cost the company thousands if not millions. You could cost other people their jobs. There are real life consequences for your actions there.  
---
It's not that it has no value, it's that there are less consequences for failing at one compare to the other.
---
You think you want it, but you do, and it don't.
---
Are you being dense on purpose?
---
I've found a guild months before launch. Mostly 30+ year olds with fulltime jobs and lives, so the guild was advertised as casual - which I'm very cool with. We're like 200+ members at the moment (some of those are alts I think).
---
The lion's share of our guild reached level 60 rather quick and we started organizing MC and Ony raids, which was cool. Since 2 weeks we're finishing MC in one night (like 2,5 hours maybe), so as you can probably tell we have it quite easy.

Guild management has one simple desire: to clear raids with ease, because we all have less time on our hands as adults. To support that goal however, they want every raider to bring a ton of consumables. They don't want people to have freedom spec-wise. They will not invite non-optimal specs to raids. To apply for trial rank, you'll have to be almost full pre-bis. 
---
That's starting to feel really mechanical and boring. I sympathize with the desire to clear raids effectively, but considering how easy MC and Ony are, I feel disappointed about their mindset. 
---
My guildmates are good guys who I hope to play alongside with for quite some time, but I might stop raiding altogether and focus completely on PvP when it gets here.
---
That actually makes sense. Thanks.
---
I wonder what it would look like if the top guilds in that server all came to an agreement to not use sapper charges for a week just to see what happens
---
What’s stances, precious?
---
means youre in a group of shitters.
---
Screwing up at work in a way that is total disaster is also pretty difficult unless you are completely clueless. Honestly, most managers are shit. Look up the Peter Principal and you will understand why most leadership roles are filled with incompetence.
---
Oneheaded axe*
---
I don't get it
---
yes! I got dispeled by priest twice while doing that q. Waited few hours came back and managed to finish it. 
---
As shaman I waited near castle and keep purging ppl near mobs and run away, killed like 10 :)
---
Everytime i got ganked in not fair combat, I say to myself im gonna kill 2 alliances i find first when im 100% sure I will kill em
---
It takes some fiddling since the base layout for SUF is meh. But the frames are great once your get everything laid out well
---
That's when you grind just enough to make it a level before cashing in!
---
This is great to know thanks. I’ve kinda hit a wall of not knowing what to do next dungeon wise and as Holy soloing is a nightmare XD
---
The jargon on 5/LFG is confusing as well, so that really helped. Thanks.
---
Farm gold or mess around with random world pvp. You can also try to farm things like arena grand master or tidal charm.
---
Its always sunny in Orgrimmar
---
Google exists,  use it.
---
That’s to recover the calcium. Laying hens need a lot of calcium to make all those shells. If they don’t get it from diet they get brittle bones and can get real sick and die.
---
Its because all the alliance are  off on pve servers pretending to be lotr knockoffs.
---
Yeah we have specific positions to stand in. The times I died on the rag fight were also when I life tapped too low as well and got one shot by hammer. Like I said it’s probably just execution I suppose.
---
Once seen. Never unseen. Thanks.
---
So you’re a top 2% player only scoring in the top 5% because of your aesthetic preferences. Play how you want to play, but I don’t see the point of this post. You didn’t disprove anything.
---
Usually people don't have that much time, so they don't have this issue.  
---
Majority is still leveling, and Epic Mount is somewhere in the faaar-away plans.
---
But you're responding to a recruiter who hires people as part of his job and he's explaining why it might be a good thing to put on your resume.
---
I have a friend who did put this on his resume and he got the job and nearly every interview asked more questions about it and made his interviews cake and helped him stand out.
---
Un’Goro because dinos.
---
Just because something is multiplayer, it doesn't mean that people are expected to try and befriend four other randoms every time they want to run a dungeon. Do you even play any other multiplayer titles yourself?
---
regular rolls don't get posted here, only unusual ones, so the number of "rare" rolls seen is a huge percentage of rolls seen. (over a million playing daily, Rolling several times per dungeon run) makes 1 : 10,000 relatively common.
---
Random, Freaks out the human brain which is trained to see patterns, so even a truly random system would get the same, "it doesn't feel random to me".
---
Then add on that these are psuedo random numbers, and it gets worse. 
---
Just keep in mind outside of hacking, the same thing working against you
---
True, it's not bad while solo-levelling as Holy, but I don't really know why anyone would do that. Haven't played priest in Classic (yet), but Shadow seems a lot more fun.
---
#NoChanges
---
60 hand-ins yesterday? hot damn, you aint playin!
---
Our guild hosted a pug the other week where both bindings dropped which i wasn't in. You already know how this ends.
---
Due to not setting up loot rules or just being naive, i dont know. When the bindings dropped, any warrior tank could roll on them, including the pug tanks. the Guild won one binding and lost the other to a pug tank.
---
To say the least our guildmaster was not happy, first that he's a warrior tank and secondly that they lost one binding to a pug member.
---
Ashen'Vale, like the sound like the woody atmosphere, one of the first zones to encounter an enemy and overall just great
---
Could be a main tank
---
Thanks I will start looking at those. I am really just trying to find +hit rating gear.
---
No, only the helm is not designed good. Rest looks awesome together.
---
gosh HR makes thing complicated.
---
my last interview went something along the line of:
---
interviewer: ''so, what's your experience''
---
me: '' I linked my github in my CV''
---
interviewer: ''oh right, let's check that''
---
.... 10 min later
---
interviewer: ''let me show you around the place''.
---
Cooking doesn't take up a profession slot, it's a secondary profession. That being said, as a mage, you don't need - not worth the hassle. 
---
Skinning I would keep, but it's not really efficient compared to AoE grinding. Tailoring won't make you money while leveling, I would suggest getting rid of it in favor of herbalism or mining
---
Yes, it's not no changes. But this is not one of them lol. It's not out yet.
---
I absolutely agree, I'm speaking more of an interview question process though. 👍
---
This almost seems fake.
---
Not much market for stolen accounts once you could buy near max level characters
---
Well my guild from retail wanted to go to Skeram and a lot of us didn't want to deal with hours long que times so I jumped ship and made a random character to play on Azuresong... wound up finding a guild to party and level with in discord that was real fun. 
---
Issue was that due to no que and lower population the server is a bit more casual so a lot of the guild are STILL leveling after we have been 60 for weeks now. The top 10 or so people in the guild started seeing the writing on the wall with our GM not being active, and the original GM already transferring ownership of the guild to just be a member. No decisions were getting made and there were too many officers with different opinions but no one to unify them. 
---
So once the top level hit 60 they were talking and grumbling about how the guild has a few hundred members all levelers, but the raiders were ready to start gearing out and running. So in the middle of the night all of the top levels 50+ all left the guild and formed a new guild, and put the most level headed planner as GM. 
---
Now we are one of the 2-3 guilds doing full clears of Ony and MC
---
&gt;Wiping is part of the fun!
---
Highly subjective.
---
o7
---
You can cheese the boss by dragging it back to back entrance with aspect of the pack.
---
You will beg for layers :P
---
That doesn't sound that bad. How much gold do you typically get at the end of a full MC run? I would guess like 400g maybe?
---
Karma for the Shadow Council's (and Ragebrew's) unending generosity in the Barrens? Maybe!
---
If you are allowed to use corruption and/or COA on bosses, witchblade and aque is better for pure dps. If you're just spamming SB, then Rod of the Ogre Magi may draw ahead. The caveat is that crits lead to unpredictable damage which leads to unpredictable threat.
---
What's the addon's name that tells you where to loot and with which % chance an item?
---
T1 what?
---
That’s how it was in private servers, but for most of my macros they work with one press.
---
So.. you could buy that stuff easy from other players, craft it into bandages and make a profit from the npcs..? I am too tired for this, but can someone math out how and what you'd make?..
---
Around 200g
---
You could've left him at 3% hp and made a truce....
---
I agree they should work on those issues but i still feel like classic servers are still being felt out by Blizzard. They arent going to put alot of dev work into something that is designed to die off as classic is currently designed to fall off after phase 6.
---
I mostly dislike it because I already done it 13y ago and did it on every expansion!
---
I juste hate the grinding to max level, where the game only begin to be fun according to me
---
Ha! Gottem!
---
I think it's meant to be a joke.
---
But... it does... I list my raid leading and community leadership experience on my resume. When I interviewed for my current position my boss asked me about the experience and we had a brief discussion about it.
---
No Changes means, No Changes!
---
If they were never fixed back in the day, they will NOT be fixed now.  (As much as I would like them to be)
---
My first tip would be changing the guild
---
So you decided to give it to a rogue instead of the main tank. Lol.
---
That's why you just need one good person to lie.
---
You're already hooked the fish why would you cut the line?
---
I would guess pvp or alts.
---
So what you are saying is, only use fresh carrots and don't clench.
---
This is the most Horde comment i've read.
---
Hey, at least he knows what stances are.  I ran SM Library a couple weeks ago with a tank who had apparently never switched out of battle stance and wasn't aware other stances existed.
---
Nice, 
---
what's that sword? looks like a 2hander. Skullforge reaver, maybe?
---
TRUE
---
Curious as well, AtlasLoot maybe?
---
but, Its the only way I can handle the witty comments! =)
---
Enchanting is a good compliment to tailoring. Can d/e all the greens you make for mats/AH, and if you don’t wanna level it you can still shard max level items for easy money. As far as talents go man, level how you want. Even if it’s a little slower than aoe frost, you’ll enjoy your time more and that’s what it’s about. Anything to make the grind a little easier
---
To be fair to him if he was working full time and going to school part time I'm shocked he even had time to play wow let alone be "well rounded"
---
Warlocks aren't that simple, you should not make that assumption. Just say that you don't know.
---
I have mine set to mouse wheel up, down, and pressed in. Takes a little to get used to but it’s a quick break in period.
---
Many of the more high-ticket positions have an HR or Recruiter round that you have to pass.
---
This initial guardian *can* be baffled with bullshit.  They're the ones least likely to be able to determine your skill, and so they're the ones you should be aiming to game.
---
Once you reach the actual interview stage, you can impress them through good answers to their questions.  What you've actually written on the resume isn't as important, just how you respond to the other guy attempting to call you out on what you've written.
---
// Source: I've been on both sides of software technical interviews, and it really, *really* is in the applicant's best interest to buzzword-up a resume so to get passed the initial screen
---
the few time I had to interact with white collar management, they kicked me out rather quickly when I pointed out how most of his job could be replaced by an excel spreadsheet.
---
It’s always some crazy garbage “wow-Gold-funtimeXxxxxxchina”
---
Lol my 3yo is a gnome warlock with pink pigtails, but to be fair, she designed the toon herself.
---
True thats another option! It just bc I like the name on it but I can deal with another name lol
---
That looks really nice! Which add on in particular is responsible for the HP bars?
---
Well I'm not in the game. If it passively applies you could say that. Pretty sure you need to be using it though.
---
Arena for sure, but angerforge is 56 and will be red and slow for me. I don't really want to spam arena to get that gladiator epic chest. My main goal is to rush to 60 atm
---
That's a dogshit excuse they're making 8+figures a month purely off classic this isn't just some game they rerelease for free they're not only charging for it but charging an insane premium
---
Do you like doing it all?
---
Do you like stealth runs?
---
Do you like utility?
---
Do you like 30% travel speed at level 30, instant cast even if in combat?
---
Druids are a fantastic jack-of-all trades class.
---
Spend quality time with the wife or play wow? Yeah I guess that is pretty tough.
---
Yup, I'll wave to any Alli I see regardless of their level, but if they attack and I have a fighting chance, I don't mind spending my next half hour on a personal vendetta
---
I run a Full Resto Druid. I have had absolutely no problems healing any dungeons.  I've been complimented many times, on how good my healing has been.  Once, when I was 52, I was told I healed better than a 60 Shaman the group had previously.
---
Druid tanks are viable as well.  I was in LBRS the other day, had a druid tank.  He felt like he was a full prot warrior.  It was so easy to keep him healed!  First time i ever healed a druid tank that easily!
---
Druid DPS?  Only ever experienced them, twice.  Both times, they came in at the bottom of the DPS charts.  Not bad DPS, mind you.  But certainly, not good either.  I suspect they were hybrid trash, (spec wise), to be honest.  But since we don't have armory, there's no way to tell.
---
Love me the bay of storms. Spent many an hour there fishing and staring at the sunrise/sunset. So pretty.
---
😅
---
&gt; invested
---
"Running SM Cath"
---
"BiS"
---
What a dickhead - no point in BiS at that level
---
now that's cringe!
---
coming from a rogue lmfao
---
Love how dedicated people are to that ugly ass thing.
---
Wasnt talking about dailies.
---
This is great. As a hiring manager myself I would appreciate it.  However it does lack one fundamental problem.  It’s not quantifiable.  So while I would appreciate it, the experience wouldn’t be a significant deciding factor.
---
Waiting for Jed Run Version :P
---
Dirty 'mericans and their trash food
---
Because every time this is suggested the horde players throw a massive hissy fit.
---
Did you know you can have those hot keys be macros that will check and put you in the stance to use the ability?
---
Well a druid woulda worked with the name Maui as well I guess....there's no hook weapons though in classic I know of!
---
What's the fastest way to get timbermaw favor, if I don't care about drops? Party up and circle in felpaw, killing bloodmaw when he's up?
---
Or is it even worth partying with the feather drops? I assume these are soulbound on drop and would not work well with ffa group drops
---
Badlands
---
I don’t know why anyone downvoted this. It’s funny. I’m sure your wife is nice if she makes jokes about wow as she goes to bed alone.
---
That would still be a speedrun strat and should be included.
---
Just taking a guess here, but I think prime times are more noticeable on EU servers due to languages and time zones. The US stretches over many time zones so not everyone will do their evening raids at the same time while everyone on German servers will be playing at the same time. This would make EU servers feel like they are more crowded than they actually are.
---
Is leveling blacksmithing worth it? I have a buddy who leveled it to 270 and he complains about all the gold he spent and opportunity cost of alll the mats he used and how the next few levels are going to be even harder. The gear itself is generally always useless (like most professions tbh), with only a few money-makers during the leveling process. Is the endgame for blacksmiting making Lionheart Helmet and that's about it, or is there more to it? At least with tailoring there are bags to be made on top of the BIS robe.
---
Do you know if there is a similar site like this for Ret Pallies? This is awesome
---
Thanks! That's Easy Frames.
---
You clearly aren't understanding me correctly. I never suggested the time had no value. What I'm saying is a bunch of raiders free time has relatively no value when compared to a business or branch of equal size. One generates wealth, and can sustain lives. One is just a free time activity that actually costs money.
---
All time is not equal in value. How you use it matters.
---
Seconded, what’s the sword?
---
basically every "badass ganker" in this game is the type of guy who joins a pvp server that favor their faction
---
It's amazing right!!
---
lol thanks :)
---
the \#nochanges hashtag is a joke at this point :D
---
there are hundreds of changes, we're playing wow remastered, not vanilla.
---
Winterspring!
---
niceee
---
Maybe for healers it's different, priest levelling is basically just shield and wand so far in my experience but I imagine warlocks would benefit more from being able to life tap more and have a larger mana pool, thus letting them go more mobs between drinking/eating. For mages it's absolutely better to have a larger mana pool, since aoe farming and spellcleave groups are so effective for levelling them, both of which have minimal benefits from spellpower.
---
She’s ace. 👍🏼
---
The better way is to get a second account and have your 60 on /follow
---
The warrior putting them in trade is only doing so to prove that both could be traded within the 2 hour time limit verifying that both dropped in the same run, the rogue did not receive them he was simply the one to take a screenshot of this.
---
The best stealth nerf would be to increase their frost resistance a little. Call it "chill of the grave" or some dumb shit for lore reasons. Boom, every frost nova gets at least one resist and you get fucked.
---
but what do I do when alliance ganks me?
---
"So anyway, I started blasting"
---
They’re especially good in fights that require lots of tanks for adds, which require that tank to switch to DPS after the add dies, as Druids can flex between those two roles much easier than warriors can.
---
That takes setup and wouldnt yield me better results as is tho.
---
BRD farms are still a good way to gain exp for you. The whole prison area + Gerstahn + Arena should be 25% Level in about an hour with a good grp.
---
And you don’t want to miss your chance on Gladiators Chain, will you?
---
Undercity ruins, where you can see ghosts by using detect invisibility.
---
same should ring true for lvl 60s  ganking under 60s.  Sure a lvl 55 will be yellow to you, but lets be real If it looks like i just crawled out of maraudon, please keep your MC gear out of my kidneys.  Brd is annoying enough to get into with elites spamming nets.
---
Comparing Whataburger to Five Guys is blasphemy.  Whataburger is trash.  Literally the worst fast food I have ever ate.  Now I will accept the hatred from all the Texans.
---
I level slowly but I attack all enemies. There's much more fun in bathing in the blood of your mortal enemies than there is in smashing to 60 so I can get gear so I can kill things more easily.
---
If I kill them too easily it's less fun.
---
mmmm. did you touch BFA recently?
---
cause with the current azerite power system it's almost impossible to fall behind... or to get ahead.
---
someone grinding AP 15 hours a day might be 2 or 3 level ahead of someone who only do dailies... and someone who only do the weekly island + weekly mythic will be 2 level behind.
---
so the difference between someone grinding 70 hours a week, and someone spending 2 hour a week on AP... is 4 level.
---
Of course, that only matter for mythic raiders pushing rank, and only for the first... 2 month ish ( after which people start hitting the cap)...  a fresh lvl 120 can get his neck to lvl 60 within a day of hitting 120... (cap of 70)
---
Just started raiding/healing endgame with my guild but my HealBot doesn’t show which targets are afflicted by curses so I can’t dispel effectively.  
---
Is there something in the settings that I can change that would show me?  Like the char box colour changes?  As it’s 40m I need something that won’t make the HealBot frame too big so a colour change would be perfect.
---
yep i' m burnt out now. Quitting since i play games to have fun and not just grind. Already have anxiety and stress problems so this game dosent help that.
---
I was very much impressed when I started watching, but that slowly turned into sadness for this guy.
---
He actually needs to stop playing and get some help. It's clearly not a hobby, or a game for him anymore. It's turned into an absolute obsessions that most certainly is negatively impacting his life.
---
&gt; they're making 8+figures a month purely off classic
---
Lmao
---
Thanks for the answers everyone. I figured this would be the case. I just lose out dps to other locks that I'm same spec/gear as. I just need to burn more consumables basically. I'm cheap and save them for the latter bosses
---
I play 5-6 hours a day and still have loads of stuff to do lol, I dont think 20days played is very casual...
---
I just love old Stormwind. Only been playing wow since bfa launch and it's so refreshing to see the original city in all its glory. I still keep forgetting that the auction house is different and get confused every time!
---
I mean he isn't far off... I don't know of any locks that get free reign on debuff slots during raiding. Currently any open slots get distributed to locks to cast corruption with SM warlocks getting priority due to nightfall procs, and if you have enough locks to cover the 4 curses you would want on a boss then you have enough locks.
---
Huh, you learn something new every day I guess.
---
Did it work this way in vanilla?
---
You must be new here....
---
This is the wow classic Reddit bro. 
---
No one gonna respect you here for picking the wife over Azeroth.
---
It was supposed to be the venomhide ravasaur but the quest was broken and they never fixed it. You can find the NPC in Un'goro
---
Leveling never required a group, you can do it all solo.
---
There is no rush to 60, and there is no rush for anything. If you can't keep up at the pace of others, the game will always be here waiting.
---
To assist in your leveling, it'd be good to find a guild that is currently focused on leveling and dungeons. Once you're max level, you can re-assess the situation and find a guild that's right for you. There are plenty of casual raiding guilds though.
---
 Un'Goro crater, the whole vibe feels like an adventure in the jungle.
---
Literally the most fun to play bar no other class, and a competent druid in pvp is a thing of beauty.
---
I get the impression you're overly concerned with pve meters
---
&gt; working as intended
---
:D
---
FFXIV if thats what he was playing, follows a pretty linear story path. Maps are also very linear as in you cannot jump off certain places and what not. Instant porting with no cooldown to anywhere you have been in the world is there as well.
---
With WoW, while there is technically a story its not as plain as a MSQ. You kind of start out as this weak little level one (whatever class/race you choose) and you decide, hey i want to be an adventurer and start asking for random quest. You progress through the zones or you travel the world (if you are strong enough) slowly and on foot for most of the leveling process. Leveling is a lot slower and meaningful and every piece of equipment is important as it could be an upgrade.
---
You cannot instantly port anywhere, however there are modes of transportation such as gryphons(windriders) (think of those chocobo taxi things, except you can't jump off when you want) and there are boats(or zepplins) that take you to different continents. There are rarely any loading screens unless you go to a dungeon or across the ocean to the other continent. And there are rarely limitations to where you can go. You see that giant cliff, hop off that bastard and die. See that mountain? Try and climb that bastard as well. You like swimming? Hop in the ocean and go as far as you can till you either run out of breath (swimming under water) or you go into the deep end and die from fatigue.
---
Wow combat is a lot slower pace, especially in the early levels. Once you hit around 40 do things really open up and you get a lot more skills and talents to play with.
---
How do you know?
---
Youre literally not wrong.
---
Never leveled Blacksmithing because thats exactly what it looks like to me. Engineering is way better for yourself. Or take a moneymaking profession like Mining, Herbing (+Alchemy), Skinning
---
yet, when dailies were introduced, nearly everyone welcomed the alternative to the current classic method : grinding sh*t on offnight to pay for your repair bills.
---
Ya but in that case they would be worried you are a double agent for their competitor looking to get a position of power then take them down from the inside.
---
No changes was a joke the minute it came out private servers actually made changes to compensate for increased skill. Everything since has been a meme or a way to dogpile and about people down for wanting fixes to shit design choices.
---
Well that is fcked if that didn't use to be like that. Which I'm quite sure it didn't?!
---
I have really never played hunter beside private Servers and I know that it worked perfect on those. 
---
Well sux really :3 But you are still really strong if that makes you feel better xD
---
Just go beast master and you won't Need a trap. Your pet will kill the rogue quicker than the rogue kills you xD /s
---
In original vanilla i got pranked by a friend Who had my acc dates.sometimes when i was going to bed for the day he asked if he coud play pvp with my char for an hour or so.one day i logged in tue next day finding myself at some roof in OG(as alliance ofc) with all my gear and mounts in the Bank and all money on my twink.Was a long Walk from og to ratchet naked
---
large scale wow pvp is so bad
---
I've had a weapon swap macro suddenly stop working:
---
/cast Defensive Stance
---
/equip Weapon
---
/equip Shield
---
Now it only equips my shield. I have to hit it a second time equip my one-hander. This worked the first 40+ levels I used this. Any ideas what would cause this?
---
Shaman life baby.
---
I did this last night. My lvl 30 mage was in shimmering flats and this dwarf hunter named flaxey kept killing me and every other low lvl horde there. I logged onto my main, flew to tanaris, walked there and he will still killing every low lvl he saw. The general chat was flooded with people complaining about this dude.
---
I legit sat there and camped his body for about an hour. It felt incredible.
---
You see what they are doing to retail? All they care about is money. If classic doesnt bring more money than retail then why would they push to develop it more? Blizzard is not the same company that we remember from 2004.
---
4 60s and a 57 dps warrior shouldn't be an issue.
---
Blacksmithing only makes money from super rare plans like lionheart/strongholds. Tailoring also kinda sucks at making money but at least there's smaller scale stuff like felcloth or robe of winter night.
---
I can quit and go resto any time I want!  
---
...just not today
---
Scarlet Monastery Cathedral. Easy to level and the boss fight is pretty epic!
---
I personally feel like the Druid is closer to being the ultimate jack of all trades class, not the second least jack of all trades class.
---
It's a long and confusing dungeon if you don't know your way around. And while I personally like that aspect of it, I can see why others wouldn't
---
If you wanted to actually try pulling this off just say the position title was Area Manager or Floor Director.
---
This might sound condescending, but is honest advice: Have you considered doing something else that is not WoW?
---
I know the habit of logging in every minute of my free time all too well. The feeling of "I might miss ... something, if I don't" is always there in a game where you constantly measure yourself against others. But in the end this is a game, nothing more. If you don't feel like playing, just don't. Go out, watch Netflix, play another game, finish some chores, go to the gym, whatever floats your boat. If playing a video game becomes a chore, a habit, instead of enjoyable time you look forward to, it's time to step back.
---
Yep, there should be a setting under debuffs (can’t check right now) on by default. Default is blue for magic and purple for curse. Maybe mess around with those options.
---
Can someone explain
---
The best guilds are often run by people who manage to put those same qualities to use to be successful in other aspects of their lives, though. Or at least "successful enough" that they're choosing to give up further success for hobbies they enjoy (including video games).
---
I'm not discounting it as tough, but the best guild leaders are the best because they're an anomaly even within WoW. Most of the gulid leaders you see running around, including certain popular streamers, would never be able to handle the pressures of managing a large organization in corporate America before it all imploded on them.  
---
&gt; Here's what a good raid leader gets out of his raiders: Close to full pre bis, full consumes (over a hundred gold per raid), be on time (not 5 minutes later, not stuck in queue, not waiting for a summon), understand role and fights (yes mc is simple but there's a big difference between half hour MCs and 3 hour MCs and it comes down to knowledge), reward expectations (deal with ego and drama over gear), morale (dealing with slow progress or burnouts), and much more. 
---
Are you surprised though? All of that comes down to time and energy invested *outside of the actual raid* and getting the guild to help each other by forming farm groups and generally elevating each other by being not-dicks. Getting people to be not-dicks to each other is really the hard part.
---
Lookin' at you, BRD Lyceum :/
---
You say that like the alliance players arent doing the same thing to themselves joining pretty much an alli only server lol
---
Realm.
---
I fucking hate gnomes every time I see one I KOS I cant stand their little asses
---
Seriously, fuck that guy. We rolled on Herod because it was the popular non streamer server and then he goes and brings a bunch of fan boys over screwing up the existing imbalance even more.
---
It's fun if you're a healer.
---
Blackrock Depths, greatest dungeon there is
---
As a Rogue, my go to sin is "I can't open that chest yet with my LP skill." just to go back after the dungeon is done to open and loot the greens.
---
It does it client-side for other players too. If you see a NE do a jump flip, the person playing the character might not see it.
---
I've read that "casual" guild don't work for this reason. If casual means any spec, no consumable, bis requirement etc.. it's just a mess. MC will take 6 hours, leadership will not care, your most serious players will quit etc...
---
I personally joined a "semi-hardcore" guild. We clear MC in 3 hour, no requirement or anything but sub optimal play is frowned upon. Most raiders grinded the game heavily at launch so almost all pre-bis. Now we can raid log and sustain on less than 10h a week or wtv. The true casual way.
---
Warlocks generally should not apply corruption, and be assigned a curse to use for the raid due to debuff limit. Impossible to know without seeing logs, but maybe your rebuffs were getting pushed off, maybe he had more crits (fights are short so parsing can be a gamble).
---
You’re fucking garbage
---
Way to much editing and overly dramatic music. I already got bored after seeing the first 30 seconds of the video. No need for the 3rd and 4th slowmo where you basicly can see nothing. 
---
Less editing, more gameplay next time.

My macros are

---
One press brings me into the cat form ; 2ND press brings me into normal form and if I press bear when in cat form  it brings me into bear formats vice versa. 
---
Dunno if that's what you want, but you need different buttons for each form.
---
send him rotten bear carcass's, for the goblin that has everything
---
it's ok, i believe you
---
Fuckoff RMTer
---
Currently level 46. At what point should I start running dungeons such as BRD, BRS, strat, Maura, for BiS gear? Should my last 5 levels be spent running dungeons? Should I quest as much as possible and run dungeons when there's time?
---
That’s exactly what I said lol, it’s like getting all 99s in normal difficulty raid in retail.
---
For some getting money is enjoyable. But that's very few people.
---
Was running ARM the other day as a Elemental Shaman with a druid healer. Druid was a few levels lower and went OOM a lot. I decide to peel for healer (kept getting aggro’d) and off-heal when needed. Tank isn’t sundering adds (may have been 2H tanking as well). A blue BoE gun drops and tank rolls need. I pass thinking he will equip it for use. He was the only person to roll need. Healer keeps dying due to the tank not holding aggro on more than one target. Wipe 3 times and tank says he’s done. I go back to Org to see the gun is now on AH and the tank is offline when I try to whisper him. Send him 1x salt in the mail with a letter telling him to sunder more than one target when tanking.
---
Right, so you can stop with this kind of PSA unless you’re talking about massive gank squads (which is all you’ve got due to lack of talent anyway).
---
Sure, I’ve been killed by a few good horde but most are pretty bad and *think* they’re good. Most of the time you guys gang bang in groups like warriors with shit blue gear...yeah, they do outstanding with their priest pocket healing...but don’t worry, when I’m out mining I find you alone grinding elementals or whatever and cook you up for dinner because you’re free food to me. Oh and to the rogue I killed and stole your thorium vein...you tasted like chicken. Thanks for the engineering mats. That was easy money. Oh, yes even Tauren taste like chicken.
---
Bottom line: don’t do us any favors, we played Alliance to PvP being underdogs while you wussbag Horde have such overwhelming numbers you might as well be on a PvE server. We will kill you anyway in a rich target environment.
---
Remember: keep traveling in packs for your safety, otherwise you’re free food.
---
Your turn to talk shit... but that’s all you’ve got. Bring it on.
---
—- Alliance
---
Unfortunately, scam like this only work because the internet is widely open to extremely naive people.
---
(nothing to do with being new to the game... just naive in general).
---
Goldshire Inn
---
Through all the years I’ve been playing WoW, Goldshire felt like a home where you go after a long adventure. No matter what level I was, I have always set my Inn in Goldshire. No matter what quest I wanted to compete next day, I’ve always teleported to Goldshire Inn before I log off (welp, 200% exp bonus is also a good motivator to end up in tavern). I just walk in, take a seat, and if I have some spare time I talk to a stranger who’s also resting after a long adventure.
---
How's the game run for you? I was playing on my Linux partition for a while but sometimes the game would straight up freeze my whole computer. Nothing for it but to reset. I've had 0 issues running it on my Win partition.
---
you the man bud keep going
---
Pinging people is for losers
---
Thanks. I actually did try that initially. I've also scrapped it and reentered everything.
---
Haha, the next Run is probably going to be LBRS
---
but a jed run might be interesting, ill think about it :)
---
I play on Kirtonos and so far I've experienced mostly the opposite. 2-3 Alliance rolling around Hillsbrad and STV killing any horde they can. Alliance mages hanging around Shimmering Flats waiting until you have 2 mobs on you then attacking. I know our server has more Horde than Alliance, but so far it feels pretty even and that Alli are the ones that like to pick unfair fights.
---
Our entire guild was on stalagg to start, we are all casuals and it’s not fun when you get home from work and can’t log on because of ques. The people who can play all day, great for you...but when you have an hour of playtime but 3hour que it doesn’t work.

If you want to blame someone, blame blizz for not doing servers properly.

Maybe you will understand my short retort now because this shit is the first result when you put your question into google.
---
How do i know it wont what? Make me more efficient? Im already hitting the hotkeys close to as efficiently as i can, as ive been doing since late vanilla early BC. Ive never been one to care for macro optimizing like frostbolt autocancelling or whatever. Im just playing the game and thats always been fine.
---
It probably equipping the weapon into offhand and then replacing with the shield. Try replacing it with 
---
/equipslot 16 weapon
---
Your macro as is will work for sure when it's a 'Main hand' weapon but might not with a 'one hand' weapon, which is why you might notice it work/not work as you level and replace your weapon occasionally
---
But when will then be now?
---
800g? Must be on a pvp server because god damn that's a huge rip off.
---
A guild falling apart because the leader fails to keep it together is a real consequence to a lot of people.
---
Even regardless of that, job interviews are about selling successes
---
3 of your total of 4 videos have this kind of shit music. It's not going over our heads. Your editing, specifically your music, sucks.
---
They are taken from presets of https://sixtyupgrades.com/ 
---
And it's exact values, not rough estimates.  
---
&gt;Does base stamina cover that?  
---
In general, yes.
---
What's wrong with ZG?
---
Sounds like a pvp wildy group on osrs to me
---
easiest way to scam people. require next to 0 effort.
---
And on the plus side, anyone naive enough to get caught by such a scam is likely unable to do anything about it after the fact.
---
The weird area above Ironforge where you can slow fall off the top and scare everyone outside Ironforge while they're dueling.
---
Shadow Priest  + Warlock  + Mage
---
worked pretty good for 3 man for clearing leveling dungeons, but you need an extra level or two versus a 5 man.
---
I only tried this up to level 40, but worked fine.
---
I've also seen 3 feral druids clear leveling dugeons, All 3 start as dps whoever has least aggro does emergency heals, Whoever is hurt the most cowers to drop aggro.  Before next pull whoever has lowest mana drinks to full, while the other two engage.  It's very "messy" to start but it falls into a rhythm pretty quickly.
---
I could see Warrior + Druid + Pally working,  The problem here is that both the druid and the pally burn mana to do dps and heal, and the warrior don't.  So might need pally and druid to alternate pulls, one heals first pull, then dps next, Then back to start, or might need better healer to mostly heal, and better dps to emergency heal only.   There are so many variables, your basically going to have to see what don't work and just keep going until you find something that does.
---
The helmet is okay, the others I would not take as a Hunter.
---
I thought it's supposed to be 4.8g. 1.6g to return the money sent, and 3.6g for the payment of the two stacks.
---
Hey, Gnomes are in this with us.  Though I will have racial envy once P2 releases...
---
Exactly anyone that tries to use I was a wow guild leader unless you were a top guild kind of pointless managing schedule is so hard 8-12 3 nights a week look I just did that. Managing loot dkp or personal loot, am I hired yet. No average guild compares meters and evaluates them. Top guilds might do this to an extent but more of everyone is good going to pick right class for this fight.
---
Hey man I was all for koombayah but after getting ganked 5x times almost every time I’m heading to BRD I’m done with mercy. Kill on sight, all of you bastards
---
I'm at work so I can't really test it but this should work.  It is just a basic icon with the timer.  You'll have to size it and move it around as you want.

Ah ok thanks. That does sound kinda rough.
---
Toggle auto run with middle mouse scroll button and strafe is keybound. As a warlock, what advantages are there to back peddling?
---
"Why join a PvP server if you don't like PvP then lol"
---
You should run dungeon when you are no more than 3 levels lower than last boss.
---
Dude I was just about to say the same exact thing haha. Started in late BC, but most of my memories were during Wrath. Was very confused for about 30 min trying to find the boat from Darkshore to SW as a lvl 10 night elf and ending up in Theramore :)
---
I look forward to getting my alt drood to 60 soon and main spec tanking with him. 
---
Altho tanking will be my main spec, I play on carrying a healing set with me as well and plan on filling whatever role a dungeon might need. Sure I won't be the best healer but 5 mans should be easy enough that just swapping my gear should be fine.
---
And maybe they're not the best at anything, but are plenty viable for any role for at least dungeons and possibly some early phase raids too.
---
1) Druid tank is legit for maintank in MC &amp; Onyxia, all minmaxxers just looked at future raids where crits sucks. Gear doesnt upgrade well into raids, but when everyone is in pre-raid bis blue you're tankier and have more aggro than your warrior. So good early-raid tank, falls off later. For dungeons its the best tank ingame due to aggro.
---
2) Druid feral dps can be #1 on the charts, but requires the hardest rotation (and pre-raid farming) ingame. It depends on the pummeler from Gnomeregan (need 20-30 per raid), combined with the wolf mask and energy talents (cat&gt;backstap&gt;shapeshift&gt;cat&gt;backstap&gt;shapeshift&gt;manapot&gt;cat&gt;backstep&gt;evis while activating a new pummeler every 30 sec). If you play cat the regular non-shapeshift non-pummeler way you'll fall behind on the dps meter.
---
3) Druid resto is insanely strong in raids and scales the hardest with gear (since u can switch to regrowth spec after a while). Downside is that noob raidleaders assign you to raidhealing because you have hots (while competing with ur rank 4 HT with still a longer casttime than the other raidhealer), but if they let you tankheal u can do the job of what 2 ppl normally heal or if you can do both tank and semi-raidheal u top the charts even. Big downside is no non-cooldown res in dungeons.
---
Obviously they are one of the best units in battlegrounds.
---
Ok at pvp? Do you mean duels? They are mandatory in wsg
---
! thnx alott this was very helpfull, but what type of pet would be best for solo dungeon runs?
---
lmao i tell every single person that says they have any achievement to show me proof. almost every time they have an excuse. the few people i know that have 99-100 parse in retail, or were something special in previous expansions always have screenshots/logs/achievs or some form of proof. when they show me proof i give them mad respect and will back them in any wow related social situation.
---
there is a guy in my guild that has a ton of classic  knowlege and made great claims about his achievements, so it seemed like he was truly some mlg wow gamer right? i asked for proof of anything, his stats, a tournament he competed in, a picture of his "gaming house" for his team he owns. deflected and showed me absolutely nothing. everyone else still believes him with no proof because he is a great talker and will talk circles around you so you are overwhelmed into believing him. i know the truth tho and take every opportunity to expose him for fraud.
---
tldr: show proof of your skill or shut the fuck up.
---
Congrats!
---
Might not be good or nice to make fun of a lost pet. Hunters get attached to them. Maybe not at that loe level but still, he may have put a lot of time and thought into that crab. I know I did, I looked online, on petopia, eventually settling on the black armoured rfd boar and broken tooth. They were awesome, my boar's name was Sofie.
---
That's something worth losing your reputation over just saying.
---
would you be surprised if I told you nigerians princes are still seekings help to transfer large sums of money? ( and it work?)

Or that people on dating site still get lured in by bots promising sex in the first 3 sentences?

Great idea, thanks. I'll give that a shot when I get home.
---
You could use separate addon for this - Decursive.
---
Depends on the person to be honest. Working towards something may not be immediately fun, but you know you're working towards something. This is how I feel when I'm prepping for a super boss battle in an RPG. I spend a lot of time grinding to get skills/items so I can find the super boss. While the immediate act isn't rewarding, you feel it come together bit by bit.
---
Mostly for the queue time, as far as I'm aware. I'm not sure if Blizzard has actively done anything against faction imbalance at any point.
---
Back in the day when I was big hung noob I was so excited to unlock mail gear as a hunter I needed on all that shit without a care for stats lol. Ravaged as well.... good times.
---
no but I bet people are going to wonder why you carved a toilet seat into a pumpkin
---
How do you get on top of the tunnel entrance to BRM in the start of the vid?
---
They would have to introduce a new grind for it, the Wrath version was easy and everyone had it.
---
That’s really good advice, and a good way to reframe how I think about fights! I’m definitely a little too laser focused on getting my dps numbers up there and like you said, not dying is the #1 way to improve that.
---
I was tanking RFC on my shaman last night. Seemed like most of the group was pretty new, so I didn't mind some of the little mistakes that were being made. We get towards the end and I guess the priest got distracted by irl stuff for a second and didn't heal, so we wiped. The mage absolutely flips his shit on the poor priest. This guy goes insane, calling the priest sadistic and continuously claiming he did it on purpose because he likes to watch people suffer. He doesn't stop. It's like he's having a mental breakdown. Easiest kick I've ever had.
---
Threat meters don't track it.
---
We were, but the guys are in opposing guilds. Therefore they will undercut eachother heavily
---
Wow, you won a 5 on 1, good for you. That's super cool.
---
All mc bosses are immune to Gutgores passive, some of the trash isn’t, if your guild Whines about the debuff on trash mobs, then find a better guild.
---
CoD stands for cash/collect on delivery, was confused at first too because I didn't knew the English term. So basically, she sent him the items and didn't demand money but instead added the gold to the mail, he was so "kind" to send it back but kept the mage weave so he basically got it for free.
---
&gt; Thorium Shield Spike plans
---
If something has a loot table like this, its a world drop. You cant really farm for it. Look for how much the sell, and figure out how many you would have to sell to make up the AH cost for the plans.
---
"hey look my guild went and did world buffs before raid, now I have 99s, damn I pressed bloodthirst really well tonight" 
---
classic logs are about as meaningful as logs on aoe pad bosses like skorpyron and mother ie. not at all. anyone actively caring about what parses they get is a fully fledged ape
---
Is there a addon for quick trinket swap? Been looking for one lately.
---
Earth Shock. Bye.
---
Not entirely accurate... Guildie of mine has made a sizeable amount of gold selling crusader enchants, but the sentiment is the same... while leveling DONT level enchanting, and I would say even leveling tailoring is a waste of time and resources (at least on my server it is) until you hit 60
---
Maybe a warlock then, since I’m gonna be 1v1 for the most part
---
Plaguelands have the best lore, Stratholme mostly :D
---
Roleplaying as a Mimic.
---
also Blizzard will never no matter what ask for your password.
---
i am a 39 mage with 80g. i havent bought all the spells i need. at 32 i did make sure i had all int / stam gear. that was priced at least somewhat cheap from AH. and i have no professions except first aid which is like at 80.
---
I'll leave Hordies alone to farm so long as they don't tag multiple mobs at once just so that I can't have them. If you do that then I will get you down to 1% and let the mobs finish you.
---
Apes did MC in 17 mins or less I believe. They had a video to prove it.  Amazing Alliance guild.
---
Easily the most versatile spec in the game. Pretty much any spec can do two roles well and the third in a *servicable* manner. You will never be short a tank or healer since you can do it yourself. Probably the hardest class to kill in world PvP due to how hard they are to lock down and large amounts of self-sustain.
---
How much are you mages making providing ports in Kargath? It seems like a pretty sweet deal.
---
a lot of this can be condensed by using elvui. that's why i love to start with it.
---
i think a lot of people get turned away by the default profile that elvui provides, but you can customise it to be as much or as little as you'd like.
---
Yeah but I did ony last night with 9 mages. Ew.
---
😄 Dude you mad, relax!

And thanks for the views 😘

What are some of the best or unknown places to grind mobs in the open world for gold at 60.
---
Obvious ones are Tyr's hand , Hearthglen etc. But I'm wanting a few places just to mix things up.
---
This is 100% why mobile games are so successful. It's way easier for me to pull open a mobile game while I'm on a break at work or randomly before bed. With wow I have to set aside time to do stuff, with mobile games I can play them whenever I have a free second
---
Uses nifty and runs away.
---
Wow that's dumb. So these people were all good people before they ganked someone on WoW which turned them into shitty people?
---
No, they were already shitty people to begin with.
---
Engineering is great for using bombs for AOE threat among a bunch of other little tricks but yes it is worth dropping blacksmithing for engineering unless you have a ton of help and support behind your blacksmithing so that you can get all the patterns and all the materials.
---
I'm actually tanking all the dungeons. I think it's fine all the way, except princess maybe. 
---
I guess i'll skip SM then, and focus on doing Maraudon.
---
I do this all the time
---
Though, the other way round. I end up putting 40s items for 40g
---
The problem is your opening line. This would be better.
---
You (me, scherado): Well, I was the founder and leader of a highly successful Guild with international membership, of myriad professions, racial and ethnic ancestry, requiring complicated high-focus coordination of myriad skills and personalities in a high-pressure environment, dealing with hostile competitors of low ethical standards.
---
&amp;nbps;
---
That's just the opening line.
---
Why even try these types of things? The word "Casino" reeks of shadiness all over it.
---
It's molten core imagine needing that
---
Don't know about you but I find the dragons in ST magical.
---
It's fine if you don't do it, but don't go shitting on people who do. If you are playing on a pvp server, expect to get ganked by higher lvls or be outnumbered.
---
2019 and still cant take a proper screenshot
---
Ohh well that is out of my scope to be honest :D I’m healer only as all druids should be :P
---
I just don’t like people saying they are not fixing because we had loads of that pre launch. And they fixed a shit ton then.
---
So im quite sure they will keep fixing what needs and has to be fixed. Just give em some more time :)
---
When PVP is released you may go after them! By that time it should be fixed really
---
Ahhh that’s funny. Lucky for me It dropped on my second run (: I was happy
---
Seems to vary from server to server but yea my experience is the wait times for finding groups below 55 is alot longer than I was used too back in 2006/7/8, maybe there is more "organised" groups this time round, people just playing only with friends or guild memebers
---
If you buy silk for less than 2 silver each you can make it into bandages and sell it for 2 silver each. The heavy bandages sell for 4 silver each. 
---
Selling silk for less than 2 silver each is like selling an item for less than vendor.
---
You can configure most UI overhauls like TukUI to show you how much mana you're missing.
---
The UI looks good, though I haven't looked through the list really yet.  There's too many addons.
---
Too often are people posting their UI's that they're proud of and it covers half the screen so they can't even see.  My guildmate posted a picture of his yesterday and the entire bottom third of his screen is covered up all the way up past his character's feet.  I don't know how people can play with all that clutter.  I want to see my character and the enemies more than my bars.

---
This stigma is by far the worst thing about being a Druid main, although it's gotten much better thanks to the work of players like Skarm, Stormx, Taladril, and Shedo. Their collective content has gone a huge way in clearing up a lot of druid stigma.
---
The great thing about being a druid main is that while you technically fall short of other classes, it only really shows at all while pushing the top 5% of content, and in very hardcore settings. In almost all guilds, you can be a top competitive contributer just by being slightly more hardcore than your peers. Only in top top guilds will you hit the wall.
---
For example, I'm one of my guilds mainline tanks. We have 1 MT prot, 1 OT prot, and myself for most things, and only employ furys with shields on domo/garr. I have no problem doing this as my main role, and still being in the top 5-10 dps on fights when I go full dps, just by being one step more hardcore than most of my guild. I don't ever come in first, and rarely (but non-0%) broach top 5, but for being one of the tanks it really is damn good.
---
Zul'Gurub, where I got my first-ever epic.
---
Lookin' goooood! I got 3 pieces of T1 last night and even though the blue items are technically better for raiding i'm rocking Felheart because it just looks so rad.
---
I found trying to leave it queued while your main hand is isn't going off makes you look at it far too much and makes you use heroic strike due to hand of Justice too much.
---
It's easier to just watch your main hand swing timer and just toggle it .4 seconds or so before off hand goes off and then toggle it off again rather than leaving it queued and watching your main hand.
---
You only want heroic queued for a small amount of time before the off hand hit. Having it queued for a long time will almost guarantee if you get extra hit procs on your main hand you will eat rage with heroic strike you didn't want to do and drop dps.
---
BRM. Intense world PVP and home to the most well designed dungeon, BRD.

That's from all the crack.

Yes, past BFD and faaaaaar north.  
---
There's a road on the right from BFD, that lead there.  
---
Arrive to Auberdine, take northen ship - and you will arrive into Rutheran Village, go into pink portal - welcome to Darnassus. And if you run to the east pas of Darnassus, you will find exit to Teldrassil.

I guess you are out of luck then. Only other option is asking for the plans in Trade chat, or  at least ask if another Blacksmith can make you some, if you need them.
---
honestly at what point does your faction just come and kill them?
---
I have 4 chats that can be shown at once, all along the left side of my screen. From top to bottom:
---
* Loot window: Item loot, money loot, skill-ups, system messages(aka rolls)
---
This is my basic loot window for seeing all loot related things, I also include skill-up since they don't happen often and won't spam the chat but.
---
* LFG/World Window:Looking for group, World, Trade
---
This is basically my spam chat and is often minimized unless I'm trying to sell/buy or looking for a group/dungeon
---
* Combat Window: Combat log
---
Pretty self explanatory as I like to always see it without tabbing to it.
---
My 4th window is my Default Window. This window consist of 4 different tabs:
---
* General: Includes everything that's on by default but excludes spammy chats like world, LFG, &amp; Trade. I do keep General chat here but it's only spammy when I'm in a city. Everything else in this chat (like loot, party, guild, whispers) is also shown and altho a bit redundant, it helps me keep order of those events/chats
---
* Party: Isolated to party/raid and whispers only, great for when I only wanna see the party/raid chat.
---
* Guild: Isolated to Guild and whispers only, great for when I only wanna see guild chat
---
* Class chat: Isolated to my guilds class channel and whispers only ""
---
I prefer to keep whispers in every tab on my default window because I don't wanna miss them although I still do at times.
---
Duskwood. It’s very gloomy and spooky. It has a year round Halloween vibe.
---
Definitely not 80g/hr, with so many items your inventory fills up way too fast and you need to run to a vendor and clear it way too often which takes a lot of time. also dungeon lockouts.
---
The shoulder only gives Str &amp; Stam.
---
The helm gives Str Stam &amp; 1% crit.
---
You gain a minor amount of crit and a negligible amount of Stam from this set. 
---
Get other items, they'll be much better for leveling. Don't be a loot whore because the set looks pretty.
---
Two stacks of mageweave for 1.6g total cod.
---
Even your maths of 1.6 x 2 is wrong lol, that would be 3.2 not 3.6
---
Surprised I haven't seen you around.
---
People making posts crying about ganking is literally what they want.
---
I remember seeing Robe of Archmage Pattern for 20g, when I had only 17g at lvl 30. 
---
RIP.
---
For real, kinda stupid, get you a girl that doesn’t mind you gaming or even one that games with you. A hobby is a hobby and if you say hunted animals all the time and focused on that, it’s no different. You probably were just in some high school romance that you thought would last forever, and blamed WoW for just being in a bad relationship to begin with. I’ve had many ex’s that things “could of been nice”, that’s the thing, those could of been, but the one I’m in now is with a girl that games (doesn’t play
---
Wow) and is understanding of raid times and even cheers me on when I’m raiding. You should be able to be in the same room with your significant other doing completely separate things together and that be ok. There are a million literally millions of fish in the sea.
---
That can't be good for his heart
---
I've made a mint crafting and applying shield spikes.
---
Druid plays the same in BGs no matter what spec you are.
---
In WSG you are the flag runner and offheal.
---
AB you spin flags
---
AV you put on your boomkin gear and try to meme people with Starfire crits
---
Is there a way to buy enchantments? Looked a bit in the AH but found nothing.
---
You can open a ticket and they will give it to one of your hunters.
---
Not to mention it's a waste of gear. It would be worth more as a nexus crystal being sold on the AH.
---
yea the game is bad for your mental health, and it's a really strong illusion. sure the social aspect is cool but you are socialising with a 
---
 lot of people who are already socially inept/mentally ill or will become so soon by playing the game. if you wanna play with friends there are 100s of better games that don't involve selling your life to become a glorified experiment rat.
---
There's  a Jordan  Peterson  chat on this sort of thing ( kind of ). Little bit long winded but still good! https://youtu.be/kzbGUDKCajk
---
The reason i have stopped playing it's boring and laggy as hell with the only spamming sapper charges.
---
I follow the same rule except for rogues... Those bastards think it was hilarious ambushing me when I'm aoeing as a mage
---
Worst part is he is most likely never going to get rank 14 anyways
---
Usually 1g per port, though I haven't really taken the time to sit there and spam - usually because there are already mages there doing just that, along with 55 water which I have to do the quest yet for.
---
I'd imagine on raid nights you could sporadically make 75-100g+ per hour.
---
&gt;I assume mp5 is an actual stat?  
---
Yes, it's just written something like "Restores 8 mana per 5 sec."  
---
[Here](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18757/diabolic-mantle), for example.
---
No that's not what I'm saying. People being shit is a symptom of something else in their life.
---
Maybe so, but I doubt I would have paid much attention to him because, like I stated, just asking a stupid question to passive aggressively call someone out does not indicate that you actually want to help anyone, even a little bit. People tend to get defensive when you, ya know, attack them.
---
The house always wins.
---
This is why you never, ever set a bid price far below your buyout.
---
That's what I was thinking. If they other binding drops, how is anyone allowed to roll on it?
---
There is still a massive disparity between total horde pop vs total alliance pop across all the servers.  Horde will undoubtedly have longer BG queues even with BGs being cross realm.  It wont be as bad as it would have been without xrossrealm queues,  but it will still be noticeable.
---
If you're a west coaster, I'm on the east coast, so our playtimes probably don't align.
---
It’s actually 7 people per raid, the leaders (if they are on) and rest are random members. For a casual guild when none of us have the time nor ambition for a DKP system this is what we have decided.
---
If you don’t like it that’s fine, different strokes for different folks :)
---
RemindMe! 1 day
---
All I do is dps down the tank's target and do what I'm told.
---
I know... never asked about that
---
Those low lvls are on the enemy faction. You don't need a justification to kill them.
---
If you're planning on farming BiS anyway, it just makes sense to run them as much as possible while leveling as well since you're killing two birds with one stone. Do what you enjoy, but it's a great way to keep leveling while getting geared for raids.
---
Dis backwards.
---
I was a vanilla guild master.
---
It was a vanity guild so my alts wouldn’t get spammed with guild invites. The only members were directly related to me (and all alts as well).
---
Consider me still in denial. The 60 mage wasn't that great in the first fight. The second fight was a hunter, a rogue and yourself vs the mage and a 47 warrior again. The 60 hunter looks like they don't have their pet, keyboard turning and pretty much oblivious to you up to when they die with sul'thraze equipped?
---
It's not the class / spec, it's the players you were fighting.
---
Even after blocking you still see the invite, and that it was blocked
---
Love is a fallacy.
---
It is worth it for bosses, 10% DPS reduction is great.
---
Gambles and loses.. calls it a scam. LUL
---
There's no way to buy enchantments?  As a lock is it worth training the skill?  I was told tailoring was more appropriate for me.  Total noob so i don't know.
---
The coast or there is a road.
---
Doesn't matter, it still counts those abilities for training points. If you train an animal with abilities, it will have negative points at first until it gains loyalty. Those negative points are from the abilities it already knew.
---
Queues and transfers should have been faction specific. 
---
I feel completely screwed on heartseeker as alliance. I switched the day transfers  opened and now I am stuck on a server with no world pvp.
---
You’re an idiot for trusting a random casino.. if you wana gamble with gold in game do it with friends.
---
This is canon now.
---
wtf?  Witch hunts are for screenshots without evidence.  Its been established that being up there and griefing is against the ToS.  Theres no other reason to be there.
---
Even if the pet starts with some skills, those still use your training points. When it comes to pets in the same family, the only things that separate them are looks and attack speed.
---
Just Uninstall retail, problem solved.
---
"How many times do we have to teach this lesson old man?"  
---
Damn dude, this is fucking sad and pathetic
---
Redridge so far, though I haven't travelled through classic that much. At least I got that goulash quest done!
---
Yeah and Everytime you make posts crying about pvp you're reinforcing the trolls doing it.
---
I'd rather quit than play on a carebear server.
---
Is there any way to hide/remove the combat log chat tab? I know it's a small thing, but I hate it. Also I haven't been able to find an add-on that allows you to move the windows by dragging them around (char window, quests list etc).
---
I think the NA servers had much bigger hype from the streamers and the 'all my friends are playing WoW so ill try' crowd. Europe has always been much bigger in the pserver crowd, and those players aren't going anywhere. 
---
I'm still queueing &gt;2h to get on during peak hours. Not sure if that's repeated across all the high pop servers.
---
yea you can buy enchantments from an enchanter
---
I always thought the might helmet on Tauren looked ridiculous.
---
Try whispering people.  Some people might not like being whispered by an unknown person, but it gets results and sometimes you find people who just needed that little nudge to join a group.
---
To each their own, of course. Of course.
---
But it does.
---
Speedruns are determined by the community.  Many Japanese RPG speedruns make you time until all the final credits roll and the screen says "The End" while NA runners usually just time to the last input.  If the wow speedrun "rules" seem odd there is probably a reason they decided to time them that way.
---
I prefer it this way. I don't think we should feel like gods at max level, just more experienced adventurers
---
I have 99/100 parses from retail in a few expansions. But that has to do with the sample size at the time of the parse as well.  
---
As for screenshots all of my vanilla/bc screenshots died on a hard drive or are on a photobucket account somewhere lost to time.  
---
Ironically I have some on facebook still since it's the only place that wont delete your data. But even then it's all BC stuff and very little actual killshots.  
---
Shit like this:  
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/YfeLUF9](https://imgur.com/a/YfeLUF9)   
---
I guess your best bet is to try to pick your name/character out of a guild killshot if you can find it assuming the site is still up from 15 years ago.
---
Was legit tip 350 in sunwell in bc. Have videos s to prove it
---
thanks got it
---
Rep group also helps when there's faction competition for the farm spot.
---
Bingewatching series obviously
---
My dad runs an NPO and maybe 10 years ago he told me that he had heard about looking out for these kinds of people because they had skills transferable to the workplace.  
---
I share this as a positive thought: there are people and places out there where this is how life works.
---
Everyone rushed to 60, and now they're trying to get geared for raids, get mount money, etc. Not many people are leveling alts yet.
---
You'll likely see more groups for low level dungeons in the future, when more people are caught up on their mains. 
---
Personally, I started leveling an alt immediately after getting bis/near bis on my main. I don't *need* gold/epic mount right now, but I'd much rather level my alt in phase 1 compared to phase 2 onward.
---
Why spend time googling when you can just go to redit? Ffs
---
Little fuckin rhinos coming at ya
---
Better yet leave the fact that you’re a GM out of the interview because no matter what it’s not gonna sound good unless the job you’re interviewing for involves managing a bunch of random people online with very little monetary or real life consequence.
---
Which means that the que times are manually placed there to force people to transfer or quit so they can remove layers to make the #nochanges people happy
---
What are you talking about? If I had sold this gold as I farmed it using RMT it would be over 10000 dollars lol.
---
That’s awesome man. I feel like you need to roll a warrior to implement this strategy since you are always dead. Mages and huntards will struggle to lose weight as they are never running back to their corpse and have a freelo leveling experience.
---
&gt; There's no way to buy enchantments?
---
Yes ... in trading window there's bottom row, it's exactly for things like enchanting.
---
Uh, you can't charge for tanking services if you yourself needs things from that dungeon. But I can see a level 60 geared tank getting away with this.
---
That people aren't significantly gimping themselves or their guild by choosing whichever race they want.  Hell, go get that Deathbringer and BWL axes while humans are still fighting over the 2nd Vis'kag in 6 months and waiting forever in line on CTS.
---
Not in the same sense. In tbc and WotLK dailies would take 30 minutes, and you would have all you need. Most of the time they werent even mandatory, just an easier way to get geared faster. Now it takes hours upon hours and you HAVE to do it to not get behind. So yes, its dailies but not even close to the same degree of necessity.
---
Very nice list! Though I never could figure out how to get my gaming mouse additional buttons to be recognized by Clique. Left click/Right click/middle work fine but the other 12 buttons on the side, not so much! WoW itself recognizes them and I use them for many other addons, just haven’t had any luck with Clique so far.
---
My god. What do you people do all day? 
---
How could you have 9 60s in t1 all ready?
---
not the first person to tell me this but 2 of my friends are alrdy warlock :(
---
I ventured into my first contested zone (Ashenvale), got ganked by a party of 5 that was skull to me, and then camped for two hours. After they gave up, I corpse hopped my way into Astraanar, then ventured on my first quest. I was rarely alive for more than 5 minutes before getting ganked again, and hours later, gave up having barely made any progress. Eventually I started grinding mobs near the graveyard so at least the corpse run would be fast.
---
After that day, I leveled in instances all the way to 60, usually taking 3-5 corpse hops to get into the instance, but after I get into that magic portal, I can actually play the game.
---
I avoid pvp like the plague now. There's no point. I try to spend as little time in contested zones as possible.
---
What's the addon name for this bar slots? Rly nice UI
---
100% I understand raid phases but bg's are just great and fun for everyone. I don't get it why to follow exact path like 15 years ago, they didn't bother when added layers.
---
Are there NPC enchanters?
---
I fucking cringe at people posting shit like this with so much confidence when they don’t know what they are talking about
---
lol I sold that a couple of days ago within 5 minutes for 150G on my server. Just posted that I was selling for 200 on AH and instantly got PM's for 150 offers so I took the money and ran.
---
The original epic mounts didn't have armor, they were just different colors than the slower mounts. At some point fairly early on in the game (BWL at the latest, maybe sooner?) they created the armor models and replaced the unarmored ones. They also offered a trade-in to trade your unarmored epic mount in for an armored one.
---
This made the unarmored epic mounts exceedingly rare, and left a lot of people regretful they didn't keep the unarmored ones or get their epic mount before the change.
---
In classic they decided to just stick with the armored mounts rather than open a brief window of unarmored.
---
As a geared tank. Preraid anyway. Just started pugging MC with a friendly guild this week. Running dungeons is an easy way for me to help my guild progress and make gold. Is it amazing gold per hour? No but the progress of the team is way worth it for me.
---
Depends on the area of course but generally they die while feared with enough spelldmg oder they come back low enough to finish them of with SB.
---
"Spellpower" affects both damage and healing spells,  yes.
---
No it's not. Try doing some runs and you'll see
---
Are you using hit chance gear and threat gear? You're gonna have trouble tanking with geared players if you're running all mitigation. You don't need engineering to hold aoe aggro but it will help.
---
fireprot pot too. spam gold and win.
---
It may the the server you're on. My experience is very different.
---
People do lots of endgame dungeons/raids, but the lower level ones are still pumping. Lots of people hit 60 and made alts, people who have busy lives and play casually, or people who are just now getting into the game. There's lots of activity at all points.
---
(I myself am an altaholic with 5 characters lol)
---
Ok so not from AH.
---
I'm a German playing on an English server myself and you can definitely see a difference between visiting the Blackrock at 8pm and 10pm CET.
---
Then again, this is all subjective and I have no numbers to back this up.
---
I’m pretty sure it’s not a gearing issue. You’d be surprised how many warriors just use 1-2 abilities and not their full threat generating arsenal. You should be able to maintain threat if you’re using all your abilities even if you have low DPS especially in dungeons.
---
Do you conduct interviews then
---
I see fireworks but not flares.
---
The realm transfers are just for queue times. They don't care about faction balance right now. Their main goal is to get everyone off of the over-populated servers so they don't have long queue's come Phase 2. Heartseeker was a fairly balanced realm until they opened up free transfers to it. Now it's 70% Alliance.
---
my partner is new to wow and he also hated cooking quests.. after westfall stew he was like "i'm tired of helping these bitches make soup! no more soup quests!"
---
I dunno, maybe it's a server thing.. I just started playing about a week ago and find there are always groups going for all the low content, I just did a WC last night and there was probably 8 or 9 groups being put together in the 30min I was in the barrens.
---
My friends and I took the free server transfer to Earthfury.  Best decision we ever made here.
---
No queues, a moderately balanced faction population, and we're never hurting for pugs.
---
We use councill and just have 2 active druids. One of them is the OT. The OT even got half t1 after 2 weeks of raiding....(because duplicate drops not corruption)
---
Interesting. I think the armor looks like shit.
---
Seems like you're looking in the wrong place to me, sm is in a low level horde zone, the only alliance you're likely to come across are complete SM groups, you may get lucky with someone leaving mid run, but I'd say go to an appropriate level zone and ask in general there an travel to the instance once you're full.
---
You have to find an enchanter (another player) to do it for you , just ask in /2 in any major city.  You'll likely have to supply your own materials
---
I did that in ZF a couple days ago. It felt great clearing out like 7 quests all at the same time. Carrot, money, and that much xp in one dungeon run? Yes plz.
---
Yep, they’re great moneymakers. For this book...Highest buyout was like 200g and lowest was 110g, I think. There were like 4 auctions up IIRC. Saw that I had to wait out a few minutes for this deal—totes worth it. :)
---
It is provable in Classic wow because we have logs. Also you have potentially hundreds of people who can say something. A GM, or even an officer, who does his job well will be a famous person on the server.
---
Yes. I hire for my team. Corporate setting.
---
Maybe it is the server size? I am on Benediction and have no issues running SM, as well as other dungeons, and I am DPS. The most I have waited is about 20 mins.
---
classic old Email scam... basically a meme... ?
---
Looks like Classic Questlog for Classic
---
did someone say...
---
The druid auras Predatory Strikes and leader of the pack.
---
If you don't include 
---
in your shape shift macro you only get the buffs every other cycle.
---
E.g. switching from Bear to Cat causes you to lose the buffs until you shift again.
---
Ones always bigger
---
Guild leader during wotlk with a 25 man raid and three 10 man's was no joke....
---
A team, B team, and C team and everyone wanted to be on A team....
---
Drama always...
---
Look for the guilds that haven't quite established a full guild raid yet. They're happy to take in groups of players and you're more likely to get the role you want to play.
---
Yeah, even if 99,9% of all players see right through scams like this, 0,01% doesn’t. So phishing it’s still a lucrative business, sadly.
---
I agree, but at least it comes with the JAWS theme anytime you chase the horde through water.
---
We had this too in the mountain 350 horde and me.
---
it's dogshit
---
the 10 FR can be useful if you don't have better
---
You have no idea how little I care about your opinion on how I choose the play the game and interpret the interactions I have in it, especially when you come across like a total arsehole.
---
### Tirisfal Glades
---
Some pro AOE mage. "Dudes we can just AOE don't CC." He was like 56 in LBRS. He was the only caster. We all mentioned maybe just CCing and playing it safe... he so he started blasting. Group fell apart after he jumped down after first boss and skipped half the dungeon.
---
Its the green mana symbol
---
I just forget to eat when playing wow. No exercises needed
---
Because I am on reddit.
---
I feel this so hard 35g on my server and I vendored 2 while leveling because “2g, we’re getting that mount in no time boys”
---
Going to a rogue?
---
We do indeed use loot council but I'm the only resto druid so I pretty much get all the set pieces at least
---
well it's only important to me that you show proof if you use your previous achievements to shit on other people or give yourself priority over other people. idc if you say you have done something but aren't being a dick about it. the  moment you put someone else down though is when i ask for proof infront of everyone.
---
I think game wide there are more horde. So there will be some down side to being horde even with cross realm BG's.
---
You know what would be the real kicker? Battle groups. Alliance:Horde ratio on PvE realms are closer to even. So if PvE only BG's with PvE, and PvP with PvP... then wPvP consequences will only be felt by PvP realms.
---
That's exactly our situation too lol
---
There's an amazing addon that's pretty new and works wonderfully called SlashFour and it makes a window that organizes all LFG LFM chat into categories by dungeon and shows how long the messages are.
---
Using this I was able to move all the LFG crap to a separate chat window but when I wanna see it, I can pull up all listings neatly organized and get notifications if people are posting about a specific dungeon in looking for. It's amazing.
---
How do I show tiny threat in details?
---
I have been thinking about re-rolling and instead of PVP server going to a normal one and as a night elf druid but idk haha, those flips looks so awesome!
---
Oh no! My watching!! Let me go check.... Nope, watch time looks good on my very casual YouTube channel.
---
You seem pretty incapable of taking a joke, are you a resentful shammy?
---
Ironforge because that is where dwarves can be dwarves and the women have top notch beards.
---
thanks for this, some of these look really useful that i haven't heard about before. i'll post some of my own addons that weren't listed that i've found very useful in case anybody here could use them
---
[ClassicCodex](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classiccodex) - a fork of "pfQuest" from back on Private Servers. it's a combination of a questing addon and a database addon but i usually disable the questing part as i really like it for its database. you can look up any npc/any item and it will put dots all over your map for where you might find them, but my most favorite part is its "vendor-finder". lets say you're in the middle of nowhere and you suddenly run out of arrows or a reagent and you don't know where the nearest vendor is - you just type the name of the item you're looking for and it puts vendor icons all over the map so you can see where the nearest one is. 
---
[ButterQuestTracker](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/butter-quest-tracker) - an addon that enhances the quest tracker by allowing you to track as many quests as you want and any quest that you want. so for example normally you can only track 5 quests and you can't track quests that don't have an objective to complete such as "Head north and talk with guy A" - this addon removes both restrictions
---
[oRA3](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/ora3) - an addon mostly for raid leaders that gives you some tools that assist you with setting up &amp; leading a raid. some examples:
---
- you can check the durability of your raid to see if somebody is close to needing to repair
---
- you can set up invite keywords so that people get automatically invited if they whisper you the word that you set up. you can also automatically invite everybody with a specific rank in the guild to your raid
---
and so on.
---
Yeah, the sleeves are literally just gone. Chest armor, then bare arms, then gloves. Doesn’t look the same!
---
This is why I just KOS the enemy faction, it's more fun than "waiting until phase 2-3" or "waiting until I'm geared out at 60" and just go for it, the rush is so much fun.
---
Arguably the worst ui of 2019.
---
Daily's were fine...at first. Repeatable quests existed in wow before then, after all, and I'd done them a fair bit. 
---
But they slowly got more and more tedious the longer they went on. Probably one of the biggest reasons I just dropped out. It felt like something I \*had\* to do before I could go pursue whatever goal for that day, whereas previous repeatable quests I could do whenever I felt like it.
---
I believe TSM (trade skill master) has a way to track prices over time. I personally have never used TSM but I have heard it is a little overwhelming at first.
---
8 and a half, point being?
---
My guild has cleared MC 6 times and we still haven't seen an Earthfury belt 😭
---
Stranglethorn Vale. 
---
Some hate it, but I've always loved it. Specifically the different animal types and humanoids that co-exist. Fishing? Sure! Pirates, sure! Alligators, Raptors, Basilisks, Gorillas, sure! Mega arena of death which anyone can willingly participate, sure! Goblins, in a neutral zone built into a cove, absolutely.  Man, I friggin love it.
---
This is just a repost with extra steps.
---
You need to speak to someone who has the enchanting profession. They can enchant your weapons for you.
---
There are addons that put the flight masters on your map
---
Lol worry about your own life. Are you a doctor? If not then you shouldn't be telling some person how to live their life, it's patronising and rude.
---
Thunder bluff! Tauren for life
---
Un'goro Crater
---
Thanks for this!!!
---
spam battle shout
---
nope - only other players :) you’ll see tons of enchanters advertising in the trade channel in major cities. a general rule of thumb is that it will be free if you bring your mats tho this varies of course. tips are always appreciated!
---
Molten Core has often ended up with a roasted raid group, for sure.
---
Enjoy your ban, bro.  You're toast!
---
Lol well people are trying to join us in droves. So it must not be that awful.
---
I could care less about the word "dead", happy with creating alts and collecting zebra hoofes in the barrens, but it still is a indication how big the server is compared to others right?
---
I used /fl ah with AH window open. 
---
I now manually set the value for most of the items im farming, does it overwrite if i do /fl ah?
---
&gt; So you say its fine for a mage to charge for food/water?
---
Realm is Ashkandi, I'll take that 100g whenever you're ready.
---
Oh I know that’s what I’m talking about, summoning people within dungeons. I tried summoning a group member to the end of a DM tribute run recently so he could pick up buffs and it didn’t work. Tried again with different people and it just didn’t work.
---
I havent done mara farms, so i cant tell which one is better. If you go for this gl hf man!
---
agreed i tried to watch it but just couldn't, seemed like it would just cut away at weird/odd times so anyway
---
I never disputed that they are built on similar skills. I just disagree with people making raid leading out to be this great feat that qualifies anyone to actually manage a serious business operation that is endlessly more complex, stressful and challenging than a mere WoW raid. All it takes is basic coordination and communication skills for something as relatively simple and straightforward as planning and executing what's essentially a video game boss fight. WoW does not at all prepare or qualify you for serious and demanding business management, and while you can certainly mention it somewhere deep down on a CV as "coordinating a social gaming group", it's plain ridiculous to compare it to qualifications for an actual job managing and being responsible for a business and 200 people's livelihoods.
---
I ran stuff with my guildies all the time in retail (WotLK-&gt;Mists).   I don't understand why people stop running dungs with guildies just because of LFG.  It's such a completely alien complaint to me.  Did you not know you could make a full group and queue up?  Even when I solo ran dungs, I *constantly* got grouped up with people who queue together.
---
Might? I believe the word you are looking for is 'obviously'
---

And as an ally on a pvp server, to the horde players, I will hit you out of stealth at every possible opportunity. You can try to resist but your pve pre bis stands no chance against my questionably thought out pvp build. I've played on a horde heavy pvp server as ally since vanilla;
---
***No mercy, no survivors***
---
Just know when your level 40 dies instantly to an aimed shot out of stealth that it was one of your own, probably an undead rogue, that was responsible for turning me into this abomination.
---
Could technically happen in any neutral zone like Gadgetzan or Booty Bay.
---
Suppose I worked at NASA as a manager on a team working on the Mars Rover, and later in life I decided to go into the business field.  Suppose I'm being interviewed for a position in management with Chase Bank.  Do I not bring up that I worked as a manager on the Mars Rover team just because they wouldn't understand what I actually did for the Rover?
---
The issue is about whether or not this bring a lot of gold into the game or not. Most of the gold made by hunters is by selling the items to other players. And that is not generating money that's just trading money already in the game from player to player
---
I remember this joke in vanilla, nearly verbatim. No changes indeed!
---
wow... I saw 3 in the 20 or so runs I did...
---
I agree but Barovs peasent caller is so fun to set on people on the boat
---
Maybe if it was 20.
---
amazingly efficient use of time here =)
---
bonus point if you also took 20 min to go get the UBRS buff afterward
---
Doing anything for 16 hours a day for 6 weeks straight is not healthy, no matter what it is.
---
He was killed by one of the mobs (you can see it in the clip) and I saw this as an opportunity to be successful with my dickery.
---
Yep that's called intermittent fasting and it was never so easy as now when classic is out 😁
---
How are the contested areas on Whitemane? Any guilds raiding major cities?
---
I hear it’s “only” 200-250g to level engineering. 
---
I’d like the gathering profession generate some income over time. 
---
But I do see the benefit of doing mining instead of herb.
---
Also keep in mind that you can start your own group if you're limited on time:
---
BRD can be broken down many ways, so you don't have to do a full run if you don't have 2+ hours.
---
Prison—Arena is the lowest level run and takes about 30 minutes. This run covers: Interrogator, Roccor, Hound Master, and the Arena bosses. You can also throw in Bael'gar to the run.
---
Arena—Vault starts with Arena bosses, continues to Pyromancer Loregrain, Lord Incendius, Fineous Darkvire, and finally the vault. This run takes about 30-45 minutes.
---
Arena—Golem Lord is likely the most common BRD run you'll see and also the fastest. It takes about 15 minutes to clear Arena, Angerforge, and Golem Lord Argelmach.
---
Council run is the same as above but also takes you through the bar and past it to kill Ambassador Flamelash and the council of the 7. Depending on how many bosses in the bar you decide to kill, this run takes 30-45 minutes.
---
Emperor lava runs start with Lord Incendius by way of window skip and takes you directly to the Lyceum to kill the last two bosses of the instance. This takes about 30 minutes as well.
---
LBRS can also be divided into two, with the first half being Omokk, Voone, and Vosh'gajin. It takes less than 30 minutes.
---
The last half of LBRS includes the spider, the quartermaster, the wolves, and Wyrmthalak. You can skip to this by jumping down the stone ledges and into the lava. This takes a little longer than the first half because there is so much trash in your way.
---
UBRS is also broken into two parts, but you cannot do the second part by itself (unlike BRD/LBRS). A Jed/Rend run also runs you about 30 minutes.
---
I've had no problem finding groups on Ztribe, I mainly play past midnight which is always gunna be hard but I've still managed to do every horde dungeon so far up to level SM lib.
---
Epic mounts don't make you stronger?
---
You play on a PvE server huh.
---
&gt; BOP BOE has nothing to do with rolling only rarity.
---
That's just wrong, though.
---
BoP's and BoE's have very different values/purposes, and they should absolutely be rolled differently -- for the many reasons that have already been laid out multiple times.
---
Have taken up running since the launch of classic. Feelsgoodman.
---
This is what I’m leaning towards.
---
Yes, item price will be taken from custom price &gt; ah scan &gt; vendor price in that priority.
---
Ah good, instructions to ensure my pug suicides next time I get into a arena/anger run.
---
Much appreciated!
---
Those were his brothers, he'd never eat them.
---
Uhh, maybe it would be better to hide your friends list and the people in the party.
---
Congrats, seems excruciating to do 221 runs for that one drop.
---
How much time until you replace it? AQ40 maybe?
---
DM specifically is kinda weird with summons I’ve noticed. Usually have to try different spots and it goes through eventually.
---
Is that a good show? I keep seein it pop up on Hulu.
---
YO NO DRUG TALK! THIS IS A CHRISTIAN WOW SERVER!
---
My favorite Zone is Felwood. I like the Furbolgs and the Satyrs.
---
Thanks, it's bartender 4. I just rearranged them accordingly.
---
its okay to be wrong.
---
A little unrelated, but what's the addon to change name colors in chat? Do those correspond with class?
---
Ah so it was a dick move, not you doing something special, okay, rogues are all arseholes, got it
---
Of all the dailys in MoP I actually loved the Tillers rep.   So much so I did it on a few of my alts too.   The entire feel of that zone and tending a garden (plus having my own little zone when I stepped into it) felt meditative to me.
---
Yeah, this weekend is my solo farm weekend to get as much gold as a I can. Just turn on a movie or podcast and go, if I get bored I can heal dungeons. P2 is coming, I think i can farm enough for a couple spec swaps, hopefully i can get some boes, and a few books.
---
Light's Hope Chapel.
---
We're definitely outnumbered but it's honestly hard to say what the ratios are. I haven't been to Diremaul recently but when it first came out I never saw it as anything less than completely and utterly Horde controlled, and I feel like BRM is almost always Horde controlled when I go there. Outside of those two areas though it seems like a 60/40 split at the most
---
Must have a pretty powerful PC lol
---
Up there it's world time, PVP time. 
---
Down here it's Instance time, our time. 
---
That all ends soon as you go through that portal
---
Ah, the joy of having to spend 50s in potions to kill a grey opponent.
---
There's no need, just open the AH and write "/fl ah", it'll scan everything in less than 30 seconds.
---
After leveling my warrior and now with a hunter alt I have to say that this clases is the smoothess leveling way of ever, I can even kill élites more than 4 levels (with my warrior I could only take élites 4 levels below me alone and needed to use my 30 min spells)
---
I didnt know I could feing dead and put a trap in pvp, lol hunter is the master race of classic.
---
There are a handful of articles out there that discussion the legitimacy of applying this experience to work. It’s a really interesting rabbit hole to read through online. I do recall seeing one article that was about a 400 company that actively asked about this in their hiring process.
---
I dont snack at my computer so I usually just forget to eat
---
This is missing a ton of red.
---
It's not even that there's a lack of Druid players. We get so many Cenarion drops that we're already DEing them. I bet we're gonna see a lot of Druid alts in the coming weeks for the "free loot."
---
That has nothing to do with WoWs rolling rules. The rules are dictated by rarity level.
---
Winterspring.  Love the winter aesthetic and the amount of end game farm.  Always enjoy farming here where as other areas I farm, I just wanna get in and out.
---
He says, after whining about being ganked... lol
---
Or r/factorio
---
Spent more time in excel than playing the game
---
Well if a bunch of 60s will be swarming all mid level zones nonstop, the game will be literally unplayable for new players. I don't think that would be quite the case, but who knows.
---
Don’t play on a pvp realm then. 
---
That was hard.
---
If you can find 60s who want to carry you.
---
I had a 58 fury warrior in start ud in my group, he did as much damage as the tank and basically no damage at baron.
---
Get a Boar or a cat when you start in stv
---
Yea, chest loot isn't supported yet and if you have "Fast loot" feature from addons like leatrix, it causes loot to be received before loot window is opened so we can't tell which mob dropped it.
---
Gets replaced in aq40 yea
---
Im at almost 300 runs and no drop :(
---
That's classic for me currently, but more like 1% fun 99% busy work.  Not having a PvP system in this generally pvp game has made it so boring, but I need to get MC gear / Epic Mount / Gold pool for consumes to have a fighting chance in P2 as a druid : /
---
We can't even farm, it's terrible. Since all the alliance transfers have caught up in level, I have tried literally every farming spot on the map and run into at least 3 alliance that relentlessly kill me. We did wipe the gaggle of alliance outside of Ony last night though.
---
Breathing?
---
The real reason Sylvanas burned the shit to the ground was so that Blizzard could rebuild the Night Elves a new capital city in a spot that doesn't suck with a layout that doesn't suck with all of the features to be relevant.
---
Unfortunately they are doing it in retail, where the cities don't matter and are all ghost towns anyway, so, yeah....
---
Tirisfal Glades. I love the creepy atmosphere.
---
&gt;DialogKey This addon is convenience! Makes any dialog box from npc's have a number, even those annoying bankers in Stormwind, just talk to NPC and press 1 = insta bank access. Also...Uldaman? Spam 1 until you get quest done
---
I love dialogkey but leatrix will auto advance bank prompts.
---
If you like to jump, make sure you filter some things off, like accepting revives .

The problem with Vanilla blacksmithing is that there's not a whole lot you can do that other smiths can't, there's nothing BOP to craft, there's no cooldowns, everything you can craft will get replaced, and anything that is rare requires level 300 to make.
---
The only things I could suggest would be to make consumables like maybe sharpening stones/weight stones and see if anyone buys them, look into weapons that are required for quests (Moonsteel Broadsword for example), maybe craft blues IF the crafted item has a good margin (some AH addons can do the math for you after a full scan).
---
I personally went for herbs and skins, since at max level there will be a constant demand for the herbs that go into flasks and elixirs and i couldn't track minerals at the same time.
---
You are already very behind the curve on making any money on Enchanting, though keep it if you have noone else doing enchanting in your circle of friends/playgroup.
---
not imagine this in a retail mythic raid where bosses have 3 pages worth of abilities and overlaps...
---
there's some horror stories about new guild trying out mythic raid, taking 30 minute between pulls... and take 15 pulls to get the first boss down.
---
I hate all dungeons that are "defensive dungeons", where you stand at a spot and wait on the mobs.
---
UBRS is one huge defensive event.
---
* The first room you're in for a long time and just do these small side rooms.
---
* The stuff before rend is pulled outside (or was back in vanilla, not 60 yet).
---
* Rend event you wait on mobs
---
* The room before drakkis is pulled back and you wait in the room on the other side of the bridge
---
I like dungeons where you attack, where you move and slaughter your way through.
---
Other "defensive dungeons" are
---
* Stockade
---
* The black Morass (TBC)
---
* Violet Hold (WotLK)
---
* Oculus (kinda) (WotLK)
---
What kind of sorcery is this?  A real printscreen on this sub...
---
This is just my own personal opinion and others will benefit in different ways. But I actually advise not using it. I used it for a while and realised I was focusing more on the details than the actual encounters. Because I was focusing on the details, I was missing out on the interactions and situations of fights by trying to min/max too much. Stopped using it and got a pretty big damage boost because my playstyle became more fluid.
---
I suppose it's each to their own and how you operate. Best of luck.
---
It was slow at first but once we got it down it was maybe 3 to 4 hours for a level?
---
Thanks!
---
To be fair, he didn't tell you to do anything, but asked about the topic.
---
And the way one wants to play has nothing to do with the pace at which content is being released.
---
No command, it just shows which mob dropped which loot and how many times it was killed. In future versions I'll add a drop % calculation.
---
Naw I'm not a doctor, but you're out of your mind if you think that's healthy.
---
Elemental Fires and Burning Charms, I'd assume. Charms are needed for the Whirlwind Axe quest.
---
Well it is a condensed version of the events just trying to get to the point.
---
8 slots are pretty cheap on the ah my man, hell even 10 slots aren't that expensive.
---
It's just the seasonal fruit ready to be harvested and be consumed
---
/r/Hadusinthefirsthalf/
---
Even I - a dad with a life - am aware of the phases.  What I wasn't aware of was that a class quest was somehow part of that.
---
They’re doing cross server BGs? Fucking gross. That’s the PvP equivalent to LFG.
---
They're farming elemental fire.
---
lol, I only bought shit at IKEA because it was cheap and I knew it was because I was adding my labor to it.   Never did I place any value on it, it all seemed temporary and disposable until I could buy (or make now that I'm a woodworker) something much better.
---
People skip a lot of packs in BRD usually, so I'd go no earlier than 52, and ideally 54 if you're doing a quest or full run.
---
Thx fixed it.
---
My favorite place is easily Zul'Farak. My very first dungeon experience back in vanilla. Had no idea about dungeons at first and got to level 44 without going in one yet. Every time I go in now it is a nostalgia blast.
---
So because someone has an opinion that differs from yours they are somehow trying to dictate how you play? Are you serious right now? 
---
No where did I say you had to play the game how I think you should I simply said your elitist (not allowing people to play with you unless they have all the pre-raid bis is quite an elitist attitude) view of how to play doesn’t sound appealing at all. 
---
Play the game however you want to. Still going to think your method of playing is terrible, but you do you. 
---
Maybe stop being so defensive next time and think a little before you make such a nonsensical reply.
---
Ony dropped 2 t2 druid helms this week. We have 2 druids in our team. Both already had it. That's classic for ya.
---
For your sake I would run with a group that doesn't use /roll for loot though. Something that is likely to better evenly distribute loot across the bunches of mages on the team.
---
Some people farm MC for months, even years to get both bindings. Seeing both drop in the same run is quite special!
---
Stranglethorn Vale, I really enjoy the waterfalls.
---
Lol 54 warrior, started a warlock alt last night when I couldn’t find a dungeon group
---
I've lost 25 lbs in the past two months since classic launched.  I completely stopped going to the gym and my calorie intake went way down.  I went from 188 lbs to 163 lbs.
---
I just wanted to share a positive experience instead of all the negative talk about tanking.
---
I had that before and the raid info entry disappeared after relog. Have you tried that?
---
In options, you can increase how long the history tracks, too. I think the default is only 5 days, but I've upped mine to 21 days and can see weekly trends a lot more easily that way (e.g., consumables at a higher price on Mon/Tues in prep for raiding and enchant mats at a higher price on Wed because people want to enchant the gear they got raiding on Tuesday night).
---
This, though really the bank and AH should be side by side on on the inner ring, IMO, instead of the throne room. Move throne room to very back and explorer's league to front, since you want your throne room in the most defensible spot.
---
Yea tbc was possibly the best expansion spec wise
---
Hey, thank you for the suggestions, I ll definitely look them up and see how they work. I want to make this list as complete as possible for anyone that just wants it and for my future uses aswell.  Will add them once I tried them in action. Thanks for your feedback!
---
Haven't looked at logs in years but I'm sure it's about the same.
---
Dps: 
---
Compare against others in your class that are doing better on each boss.
---
Are they using abilities more than you (uptime) and are they taking less damage?
---
Positioning/mechanics/rotation changes are probably needed.  You can see this by drilling into the player for the fight.
---
Are they hitting harder?
---
Might be gear, talent choices, or rng crits.
---
Healers:
---
Do they have more/dispells? Prioritize decursing.
---
Do they have less overhealing?  If so why? Is it down ranking, using different heals, precasting, cancel casting ect.  You can see this by looking at the amount healed by ability and comparing it to yours.
---
Do they have more effective healing?  Are you using too low of ranks, are they just better at precasting, are they using different spells, are they chugging pots when you aren't.
---
Are they taking less damage?  Don't stand in fire/get gud, you can see this from each players damage taken by source.
---
60s won't be swarming mid level zones more than do already.  No one under 50 will be worth honor, even then anyone below about 57 is probably not worth the time to camp since finding some 60 farming is a better bet.
---
The honor system probably disrupts people going around herbing/mining more than anything else.
---
Lordaeron. A decrepit castle that still holds the memories of it's great moments and tragedies.
---
Yeah, I don't PvP at all on Heartseeker as Alliance because I feel bad for the Horde. I'm making an alt on a more balanced PvP server and just doing PvE on my Heartseeker toon until BG's come out. I didn't want to move to Heartseeker to fuck over the Horde, I just wanted to level as Skeram was overpopulated and leveling was very difficult there.
---
It's one of the most quotable and hilarious shows I've ever seen. But I suppose you gotta have that kind of sense of humor.
---
Shadow and discipline until 41. At 41 respec to completely shadow then start taking back your disc talents as you level. Somewhere in 52-58 switch to deep holy of you plan on running high level instance. You’ll have no problem leveling through dungeons but keep LFG chat open and take not of what dungeons are run a lot and where there are gaps that it will be better to just grind out some quests to get to the next dungeon. (I completely skipped RFD RFC and ULDA). If you do find a set group and really want to just heal dungeons go ahead and take mostly disc talents. (Improves healing but still good for solo play) but healing as full shadow is fine until about 55.
---
As a troll what do i need to do to ride a wolf
---
Then you are insanely lucky. Most don’t even see the boss in 20 runs let alone get it to drop, and let alone all that happen 3 times.
---
Did you really enjoy it though or are you just happy it's over? It's just too broad a statement. Would you reset your furbolg rep and do it again because it was just so much fun? Is grinding gold fun? Would you give all your gold to a random lowbie? There's no way you'll climb to high in rank and think it's fun either. A lot of grinding are rewarding but not actually fun and that's okay too.
---
Wailing Caverns for that juicy staff baby!!
---
Should've used the glowstick from the strat quest.
---
farm some linen cloth. it's 3 bolts plus 3 thread for 6 slot bags. 
---
I was looking to give some away on my server the other day, and i'm only level 16! try  brill or crossroads if horde, no idea what the corresponding one is for alliance
---
By the weapon master.
---
Curiosity on Spy, how can it work through combat logs if he can detect people flying for example? Genuine curiosity here :-)
---
My favorite place is any bit of water in the wild, since Fishing is an amazing skill and doing it in "nature" is very relaxing
---
You can keybind raid target icons directly in the keybind menu, I do F1-F4 for easy marking. A skull makes dungeons 10x faster
---
Yeah I started leveling a Mage initially on launch but I really wasn't enjoying it, it felt kinda boring to me. I rolled a druid, got him to 42 but I started being interested in endgame and realized that there typically aren't that many raid slots for druids.
---
Ended up rolling a priest, which is what I initially played in BC when I started, and I've got him to 52 and he's going all the way.
---
Really enjoy trying out new stuff!
---
You will miss more, you will also crit more though meaning your flurry uptime will be higher meaning you'll make more attacks.
---
There's also a feature where if you have Heroic Strike or Cleave queued up your OH will be treated as if it's a yellow swing.
---
This means that you can keep HS queued and then turn it off before your main hand swing and during those two events all of your OH swing will only have a 9% chance to miss (6% as orc/human). This change actually makes hit even less valuable if you're able to micromanage toggling on and off your heroic strike.
---
Is there anyway I can find a list of rare world spawns?
---
I am a 35 human Paladin and I like all the hordies to gank, got a 41 shaman in alterac yesterday, and about 9 others 30-38, y’all just flounder most the time tho.
---
If you don’t have Thunderfury yet, then you don’t have Thunderfury.
---
I'm a priest. I just felt, especially early on in the raid, that I wasn't doing a whole lot.  Is it normal to have around 10 healers for MC?
---
Ironforge 
---
I like the big anvil in the middle
---
Auctionator actually DOES do this, but you have to do what's called a Full Scan. I normally do a Full Scan once or twice a day, just to populate a lot of data points. Obviously I don't care as much about items with really low volumes or any greys, but they're included in the scan too so I end up with that data. 
---
You can get a full scan by going to the buy tab. It's in the top right corner. It doesn't take very long at all, there's normally only around 20k items on the AH on my server so it takes about 5-10 seconds.
---
I mean, between bank alts and the mailbox that isn't really much of a concern
---
Thanks for the information. This is my first warlock, so I have very little knowledge of end game with the class.
---
Alliance and Skeram
---
What's the grind exactly ? farm professions ? Farm mobs to level up ?
---
I can't vouch for what would happen this time around, but people used to attack towns all over the world hoping to draw out more players. Why do you think hillsbrad was so famous for world pvp as a level 30 zone?
---
That’s suuuuper cheap. 
---
Overall, the AH economy is so screwed up rn. Example, elemental fires were selling less than 50s on my server not too long ago. Now that people are crafting FR gear, they’re starting to creep up in price. I expect the prices to “normalize” probably next year.
---
Qweasd keys
---
No you are correct, the amount of simple data analysis that 99.999% of raid leaders do is nothing compared to an actual job.
---
I still don't get how this works. I'm as dumb as a stump, makes sense I'm undead then
---
Well it was steadily going down since launch, starting at about 150.
---
Yes, because if you don't breath for the other 8 hours then your dead.
---
Un'Goro
---
0/30/21 is *super* flexible for this style of play.

I always remembered it as Stalac(eiling)tites are on the ceiling and stalag(round)mites are on the ground.

Official Auctionator is not out yet, but added link to quickfix recommended by the Author himself
---
Mind Control off the wall!
---
Swiftness was amazing.  You spend so much time in cat leveling,  and the extra mobility is great +4% dodge is also nice (would love bears getting this)
---
Lol
---
It's pretty bad. 
---
If you need the FR, it can be useful for Rag, but that's basically it. That's only if you're a tank - if you're a DPS it's not worth using at all.
---
Go BaCk To ReTaIl
---
I dps with BRE :p
---
Sounds like someone who browses Facebook while pooping. This is Redit, we know better 🙈
---
Or just give Darn a direct dock through a tunnel instead of the teleport tree. Hook a boat to Feralas along with a direct FP down the coast. And have the FP in the middle of the city.
---
Whoever designed the Darn layout is obviously long fired. And the real goal of Sylvanas is to have Darn reborn as a relevant city that doesn't suck. She's actually the Nelf trojan horse after all.
---
And that happened prior to the honor system as well.  We used to raid Barrens as well.
---
The issue is people thinking all this camping is going to become a bigger problem than it currently is, which is nonsense.  People get ganked and camped right now and it will remain mostly the same once the honor system is in.  The honor system will have a minimal effect on how much lower level players are ganked and camped.
---
No clue, the original image is actually pretty outdated, a lot of flight paths are missing and the spelling is just horrible.

I got Whirlwind last night :D made like 10 stance macros and it’s been going good!
---
For some things that I know I am gonna lose threat on sometimes I can keep it if I leave an aoe on the ground before it resets and they look back at me.
---
Most of the time I do BoP or use the seal where I do extra damage from holy spells.
---
Always though I have salvation on everyone. It lets them go ham and I just fart on the ground lmao

Leave out the word guild and the word wow.
---
Just say I was *team* leader for a non-profit.
---
buffs cost soo much mana it's ridiculous.
---
3k for fort, 1.5k for spirit... 1k for rez.
---
even with the new DM water, assuming you ended the pull with mostly OOM healers,  it take 10 second to rez someone, 40 sec to drink to full, buff 2 groups ( if inner focus is up)and another 40 second to drink to full before being ready for the next pack.
---
WoW doesn't have rolling rules though, it has a Need/Greed/Pass system to help facilitate item distribution.
---
Warlock lvl 22.  I don’t really know what to spec of if it’s even important yet.  I’m basically only playing solo and I’ve looked at one guide for drain tanking but it says wands are more effective until about level 30.  I haven’t really been following a method in my talent tree other than maxing corruption first.  How should I continue?
---
Definitely. On the one hand, it's not good behavior and could cause wipes. But when it doesn't, I just feel like a controlling ass telling people to knock it off.
---
Got into the habit of running in place or doing yoga stretches on flight paths.  Really helps keep the kinks out of the old back and hips.
---
Hey that's exactly what I'm using. I don't see a whole lot of people with Hammer of the Vesper so I'm always worried I'm doing something wrong.
---
100%. And if you’re trying to start a bidding war, don’t have your auction end at 6:30 AM when hardly anyone is online.
---
There's no scribe profession in Classic, so there's no way to put enchantments on scrolls and sell them.   
---
You need to find another person who will do it with their own mats, or providing materials and tip for work.  
---
But why are you asking? In 1-50 you will change items that often that enchanting them is pointless.
---
This awareness comes much, much too late.
---
These posts remind me why it’s so good to be on Blaumeux
---
As others have said, it's because your weapon is being equipped into your off-hand slot. You want all macros such as this that equip a shield and one hander to start with the shield. For some reason any weapon that just says "one hand" defaults to the off-hands lot if you're replacing a 2h weapon. I would assume your previous weapon was listed as "main hand" which is why you didn't run into this problem before.
---
Dailies are cancer and should have never been added to the game.
---
Properly related
---
That's why I said we don't know what will happen. If enough people are hungry for ranks, it might escalate out of control pretty quickly. The more alliance 60s are lurking around STV, the more horde will come to kill them, and vice versa.
---
I am considering transferring off of Incendius as the guild I was in had name calling, mean and petty leaders 😕
---
&gt; In real vanilla, when you got jumped by a rogue, you were never required to NOT attack them with your pet, NOT dot them
---
??? Yes you were. And if you dot them the trap would break anyways lol
---
Funniest thing ever! Gnomes have 4 fingers but i believe 5 toes, and trolls got 3 fingers and e toes one of which is at the heel.
---
So much gear from so many bosses though
---
I’d be happy if I saw horoscopes once per 20
---
Wouldn't really recommend unless you find people to carry you and pull extra packs so you don't face pull.
---
Then maybe ask around for 2 minutes before crying here?
---
Thats what I m going for in this addon list, to be as clean and manageable as it can be. I ll keep updating it in time, my focus is on addons that don t clunk the game load too much. The main exception here is TSM, but it s far too usefult to let it go. Open to suggestions, thanks!
---
Without that warrior tanking for you the gear wouldn't have dropped and you would still be looking for a group. The guy is helping out the entire group by tanking and then you want to tell him he can't roll on gear for his main spec? Pretty selfish imo.
---
Trash post
---
Being tank specc for dungeons is in no way nessecary as a warr. As long as you pick up some tanking gear when you get close to 60 you can tank just fine regardless of specc.
---
I started tanking Scholo at 58 as a fury warr with only 2 +def items (not my idea though).
---
The difficulcy of tanking comes from having to keep watch on both your party as well as every single elite mob, being held responsoble for anything that goes bad and being forced to micromanage your party to help out with cc etc.
---
Oof
---
Why are people so damn hostile all the time? I get he should have googled it but why is it such a big deal to so many of you? 
---
Maybe you should all stop being dickbags?
---
Oh yes! I see the layout. Mine was saying “unknown” next to it. Which I thought was weird (doing brd experience runs) but only on certain pulls. 
---
I guess what I meant was how it looks aesthetically. Breaking it up into better segments like runelite
---
You know it shows the mob name and then pictures of the loot itself in little boxes. I would guess that would take a long time tho, but aesthetically it looks great. 
---
I tried sending you a dm of a pic but Reddit sucks
---
1% crit &gt; any stat while leveling imo
---
&gt; I never kill the mage
---
Red is dead.
---
Reach Exalted with Orgrimmar and buy "Wold Riding" skill.  
---
It will cost 300-400 gold in donating Runecloths, though.
---
We do have a pretty good idea because we've been through this before and it didn't really happen.  Ganking didn't go up significantly when the honor system was released and that was when there was no real timetable on BGs coming out.
---
There may be some hyper pvp people try to start something, but it isn't going to be massive.  You might have some groups decide to make a raid and go somewhere, but it isn't going to be this huge warzone across the world.
---
With all that being said, there is no reason to not release the BGs with the honor system.  How they are gating shit is stupid.
---
Ok thanks.  This was a raid of 2 guilds and a few pugs, think we only had 36 or 38 total people - mostly trying to fill out, experience the content, get a little loot, rather than best efficiency.
---
No, you aren't in the wrong. On those packs I normally ignore the non-elites *unless they are attacking the healer*. In fact, keeping a non elite off a healer in those pulls is more important than keeping an elite off a dps.
---
He should also be reasonably comfortable holding aggro on 4 mobs, not 2. He also has 2 "taunts" since he should be making liberal use of mocking blow on aoe pulls.
---
Pservers recorded the time of death of a boss. paired with a video showing there's no excessive pre-clearing, it was a rather solid measure.
---
True, I'm usually up for starting a group if someone whispers me when I'm looking for a group, but perhaps I should try a more aggressive strategy.
---

1. Most fun class bar none. It requires practice and a lot of macros but well played druids are amazing. Best 5 man tanks, amazing raid OTs who are optimal in damage soak fights (Ie hp is more important than raw mitigation) as well as threat fights as druids generate absurd single target threat. Leader of the Pack is great, the HotW/NS build is better once you get into AQ/Naxx as there are many fights you will want to help dispel or heal
---
2. Passable dps. You have to work harder for less results but its not bad (horde side it is, but alliance dps is fine if you power farm gnomer). Also works as a fury warrior style "can pick up an add" rather effectively as a lot of feral talents overlap
---
3. Solid heals. Not priest level, but solid enough tank healers, utility like Fairie Fire, Innervate, Brez are the big draws though. Plus even in a (tier) resto set you can drop into bear to pick up a lose add until the tanks get ut
---
&gt;I do not believe in 5 years classic will be active if there is no new content.
---
Private servers have proved this wrong.  People start salivating over the next F R E S H as soon as the AQ gates open.
---
OMG so when you take a flight and you don't get immediately reimbursed for a shard, the pet is running along on the ground?
---
Too many rogues, nobody is full BiS because they all compete between one another.
---
That’s not ganking. That’s giving the people what they want.
---
And it's being given to the rogue? Really?
---
Quest and do whatever you can till 52. Searing Gorge, finishing up Tanaris/Feralas, etc. 52 Hit Ungoro, after Ungoro go Felwood, Winterspring, WPL and EPL. Throw a run of any dungeon you have quests for in there and you should be good.
---
I started being an addon hoarder in retail a few years back and I honestly been through countless addon lists and suggestions. This list is a result of my own trial and error starting from addons like ElvUI, Bagnon, Bartender etc. Some really made my game too slow, so these are what satisfied me  personally in the long run. I probably visited the list you linked aswell. It has been a long run to get to this point and I don t intend on stopping yet.
---
I've tried at noon, evening, at the 'casual hours' around 8-10 and midnight. Either have a really bad luck or people have decided they don't like me, idk.
---
Goodbye layering, hello 20 horde camping both boats in menethil harbor on my server all day long.
---
They suck at that role.
---
Their heals are long casts (or inefficient) their hots are purged as the mob always has offensive purge, but the biggest issue is they don't have magic dispel.
---
Druids excel at carrying flags and getting into small skirmishes(1-3 people on each side) capturing or protecting nodes by being annoying.
---
You can stand in the mob and heal but you'll never do it as well as a priest or paladin .
---
Then before their encounter with humans and dwarves, did their warriors wear just leather.
---
Why did we get shafted, bros?
---
Warrior T1 helm looks ridiculous on a Tauren
---
I started to run Scholo with a tank who thought LoS meant pulling stuff from one room to another, he we would just shoot run back and stand in the middle of the room... basically doing nothing, mobs would scatter I basically was stuck healing all the dps, rarely even having to put heals on the tank. The last straw was the fact that he had 0 idea how to tank more than 1 mob. He would focus all his aggro on main mob and just let whatever else go, usually heading strait for me. After the second wipe on rattlegore I had to leave. Worst part is I had run a BRD with this guy before, and took till rattlegore for me remember him.
---
Most bis for druid tanks is otherwise disenchant fodder. Helps a raid a lot to have tank 3 be a druid, he can heal on 1/2 tank fights and easily flexes to tank when a 3rd is needed
---
This explains why the Mechagnomes are replacing their parts.
---
And here I am still hoarding linen cloth and malachite
---
I wasn't thinking clearly obviously. Was so used to him hunting me my brain went "Kill him before he kills you!"
---
KUI cando this, you can also check Threat plates of it s more to your liking.
---
I honestly don't know how big my server is. There's always people in cities and at quest areas so I didn't think about it at all. If I find a dungeon group as a healer in under an hour I count myself lucky.
---
Im horde though
---
Hi, can you give me a link to the shaman discord? I'm thinking about switching to elemental from enhancement (about to hit lvl 40) and had a few questions. Thanks!
---
Why? Whenever I’ve tried playing a female I just stare at their ass. And then I gotta go bang my girl later. Do male players that play females just have zero sex drive or something? Or do they just identify closer to women? Imagine listing to that “OH” sound whenever they get melee’d over and over again. Sounds like they’re getting raw dogged. 
---
And Don’t use that excuse that you can slip through walls in wsg, that will likely be fixed.
---
I'm an officer in a loot council. 
---
Also a rogue.
---
2 perdition's and a brutality have dropped. I voted for other rogues over me and they've gotten them thus far each time
---
Is Zandalar PVP or PVE? From what I've seen on PVP, people are getting their main to 60 as quickly as possible before starting on alts. My friends tell me that PVE has a lot more people spread out among the levels.
---
If I can't be a Tree in Vanilla, this is as close as I will get
---
Got TS shoulders on my 100th kill. Saw 2 before that, lost both. Stay strong, brother.
---
I'm really satisfied with my Holy Paladin, but I want to roll an alt that can kill people in PVP when I get tired of healing and I'm not a fan of Ret. Looking at Hunter right now since they seem really strong in the world and have good gold farming opportunities. Are they a strong class for PVP or would I be better off with something else?
---
Yep. One of the best things you can do for your own internet health is *not* reuse logins/passes.
---
If you were a real gnome you’d be able to get him flagged while he’s lvling his LP lol
---
Before people ask:
---
I was one of the first to reach level 60. Sometimes I were totally alone farming Felcloth for hours. I was the first with Crusader enchant on Horde side, as well with 30 spell power. I was also one of the first fishing in Azshara. 
---
I also have 30 days played.
---
Amazing to hear!
---
Been knocking together a transmog list for my Paladin and the 0.5 heroism set for warriors looks sweet.
---
Might have to get some guildies together to try and farm this out at some point.
---
Deadwind Pass cause it's usually empty and isolated, and that's where I grinded out gold for my epic mount back in vanilla.
---
I responded with a simple concise no as in "No to the whole thing, it isn't going to happen". Then he responds with a condescending all caps google search as if I need to do it for him? 
---
Sure we may be dicks in our own way, but there is a clear difference in levels here.
---
/gquit
---
Holy crap. That was my experience during the first weeks after launch but now it seems people are at 60 and only playing on high level, and the people who are just catching up are only questing?
---
Hang on. To be fair, the post never actually goes into what position the gamer is applying for. It's far more likely he/she is applying for a position responsible for 10-20 people than say regional VP. In which case said experience would be far more applicable.
---
That's a pretty decent fake
---
I had no trouble getting past level 10 with literally 1 6 slot haha, also the 8 slots are not 1g they are like 25 silver  from a bag vendor, and the 6 slots are literally like 5g I think? Your putting way to much focus on bags, just keep playing and you will eventually get backs or play for like 10 minutes to earn the 10s for the 2 bags you are missing..

and a lot of people don't understand barely anyone ever stepped foot in MC before DM release, or how most of the classes changes don't affect raid spec.

I did. Haven’t found another guild yet.

Find a new guild. There are a ton of them on both sides.

Not amazing? Fire resists set, massive stam pool, pvp? That mace is dope.

How did you get the blizzard art bar to be smaller and move the settings bar to the right? And gratz.
---
The cooldown reduction is kinda useless because it's mostly paired with barkskin which is also a 1m CD, unless you are doing group killing I guess. But then you probably wouldn't even wear this gear as it's healing gear so all around, the set 8 bonus is super awkward and borderline useless sadly

Social anxiety is sabotaging me something bad, but from what I read from another person perhaps I just need to start forming my own groups from the start, pfth.
---
It means that "contested" zones (the majority of them) are automatically flagged for PVP and you can't disable it.
---
This mainly means dealing with the other faction when heading to dungeons, raids, quests, or farming spots as they will all be doing the same dungeons/raids/quests/etc generally (except for exclusive stuff).
---
In small groups people will play nice / ignore each other but fights do break out and it's not uncommon for one faction to camp the entrance to something. Last night 3 alliance rogues were camping the entrance to Blackrock Mountain
---
It gives a different kind of experience but it can certainly be frustrating if it's not something you actively want to participate in. You really need to get into the mindset of being ready to throw down at any time when you're actively out in the world.

Do you honestly think that there are less than 650,000 accounts paying a sub for classic right now?  Questie has been downloaded over 5 million times since classic launched.  I think it's safe to say that the revenue from classic subs are in the 8 digit range.
---
Oh yeah, I'll absolutely rock this in PvP!
---
Bought mine for 35g, then a day later got one from a jump run, sold it for 45. Not that expensive anymore, but I purposely waited for not getting it day 1 and let the farmers run the prices down a bit.

Thanks to all the trib farmers, major mana pots have gone under 2g too (mograine eu)

He was in Gadgetzan though.  Are you suggesting he should have started running to Steamwheedle Port on the off chance that *maybe* the right food vendor was there?

If your goal is raiding, then it shouldn't be. Raiding is borin af imo. The beat part about raiding is being a part of a team. Makes me feel like I have a purpose despite raiding itself being pretty boring
---
Btw, careful with looking back like that when the rogues have distract, that could've gone a lot worse if they were smart enough for that.

I'm honestly missing dungeon finder, sometimes a guy just wants to level without first courting ten people over a week's time.

Fray Island - thought it was a pointless island before i knew there was warrior quest there, love the randomness that little island.
---
Affliction for sure till at least 40. Throw all the dots you can on and wand em down. This will be how you level even past 30. People suggest drain tanking and its a very good method. That being said I opted for more damage, run with imp ad helhound, and just do dots and wands. You just have to make sure you have good gear to do that but that can be solved by just running dungeons.
---
5 second rule
---
Just keep in mind that Mocking Blow does not function like taunt. It forces the mob to attack you, but does not change your threat.
---
You should still be using it, since 6 secs of aggro is usually enough for the mob to die, your taunt to be off cd, or your healer to get the dps back to full.
---
SM loot is bad for a hunter.  It’s a good change of pace for exp and has a decent quest sword/stat stick.  Replaced in Uld with Grimlock’s Charge if you are lucky.

Worth.  Dire maul prints money.  Even non farmers can do jump runs.

Except that losing weight is what u eat, not what you exercise. Exercise supplements it and gains/retains muscle

People don't always Purge the heals, and if you get a smart ass who's trigger happy with Purge you can bait them into wasting all their Mana by spamming level 1 heals and watch them oom while you're still almost full.

I have Pre Raid BiS but for farming i use T1 &amp; T0 an other good stuff with Stamina/Int

haha spot on xD
---
I should have never tried anything new and instead just started with my healer from the launch, haha. I'm definitely paying for it now cause at this phase I'll never get my pala to raid levels before everyone has already gotten bored of the raids.

COSCO GUAC? ITS FUCKING DANK.

There is. It's a little "Blizz" icon in the same script as the Blizzard logo. It appears *before* the chat name.
---
Just ranged from what I’ve heard.
---
It's named Egan's Blaster IIRC. It's quest you can pick up at the small house top west in EPL, close to Strath. It has no use besides blasting those neutral undead ghosts inside Strath but for some reason u get to keep it after the quest and I guess it serves as filler for relics not being in game yet
---
Unless you're looking at seriously twinking him for BG's, I wouldn't worry too much about gear out enchants.  Send him 4 good size bags and 5g to get a head start,  and you'll be miles ahead of everyone else leveling.  Art a certain point alts need to be self-sustaining (unless,  again,  they're just going to be twinks), so busy give yourself a leg up.
---
Egan's Blaster - Quest in Stratholme from Light's Hope Chapel

Its true. I work 8 hours a day and even get two days off and I'm still ready to die.

Intermittent fasting is typically for longer periods than 12 hours. Usually, you either give yourself a 4-hour window in which to eat (20-hour fasting intervals, also known as OMAD or one-meal-per-day) or you skip a day while eating normally on non-fasting days. The reason for this is because it takes 8-12 hours for ketogenesis to fully activate. Ketogenesis is the biochemical function of converting fatty acids to useable energy and is from what the “keto” diet gets its namesake.
---
Westfall is my favorite place in WoW Classic it brings back so many memories of me dying to trash mobs by pulling one mob and accidentally pulling another, it builds so much anxiety in my blood that I start to run away only to be dazed while two mobs auto attack my character and wishing I didn't use my frost nova on the first mob. Then when I do eventually die and run back thinking I can't wait to get blink and rez up I do it all over agane. Pepehands.
---
I fucking actually tried that, didn't even get a reply from the civil nuclear constabulary. I wish o was joking
---
If it helps, im no longer running it on my rogue for raiding. Its doing less than 1% of my damage in logs. My perditions blade fire proc does more damage.
---
Then the Hunter need rolls it.
---
I mean, it's not optimal. But you don't need to be optimal. There are a lot of people who keep pushing "meta" optimal min max  it just find people who don't care about 100% theory crafting.

Are you Alliance or Horde?

Lol, oh boy
---
This is a random question but as a priest, how do you buff the enemy players by using mind control?
---
First off, try to find the materials needed for the enchant. Some enchanters carry mats but they won't have every mat so it's likely you'll need to provide your own.
---
Look for enchanter in trade chat offering the enchant or say "Looking for enchanter in &lt;major city&gt; with &lt;x enchant&gt;"
---
Meet up, open trade, put materials in trade, complete trade, open trade again and put your item in the bottom "not to be traded" slot, wait for them to apply the enchant, add a small tip of gold, complete trade.

just curious, what from this image shows that he followed a leveling guide? Could he not have just accepted all those quests, then did them all before turning any in?
---
they're mana-hungry, sub-mid tier dps. even if you had unlimited mana you still wouldn't out dps a mage or warlock, and in dungeons and raids that'd be who you're competing against for gear (tier sets are for healing). 
---
I play a druid at the moment, resto, and it's tough to really enjoy the class sometimes. I've built a balance set to mess around, late game your rotation is this in dungeons: moonfire, insect swarm, starfire (or just starfire). In Raids: Starfire. Pvp adds something to it, but learning to shift forms is crucial.
---
It's a meme spec, only play it if you REEEEAALLLY want to. you'll be fighting everyone to prove you can be useful...some people do and make it look amazing. more often than not though people dont, and make it look like hot garbage.

Easy builds can be found on wow head or icy veins, with explanations on why. or just google classic balance druid build

NSFW made this even more funny.

Please don’t listen to this guy. You will get laughed at.

It's exciting for the guild and for people to be a part of seeing them drop like this. Plus, it's possible to be happy for other people. It's a social game.
---
Look at who you are quoting.
---
Been playing drood in vanilla... Never felt so useful in a raid, while never being in any top healing, damage or tanking...
---
Shift to bear form should any add rush forward a DPS unleashing insane crits to save his a$$ from being annihilated, dealing reasonable amount of damage, while supporting healers when they get low on mana, choosing who will get the Innervate Award, 
---
keeping record of active brez and CD ones in raids, getting back in the course thru the MT / most potent healer battle rez, having the most versatile single buff in wow, being able to sneak past unsuspecting mobs, put draconians and beasts to sleep...
---
This plus there's nothing more annoying than a tank drood associated to a treant one in BG...

Damn man... good list.

---
Yah 4 am is always LFG’s weirdest hour
---
Is shadow council based on the old vanilla server?
---
For raids, yes it's bad. You will be used for crit buffs and innervate, tho.
---
For pvp, they are good because of great burst, snares and survivability. That being said, you will likely need to prove yourself to get into premade bgs.
---
That is so adorable. lol.
---
Yes I lost 10 lbs since launch. Who needs food when you have roasted quails?
---
Been selling DE mats

That might explain it, will disable fast loot and see what it does.
---
Some some words of warning in regards to hunter for PVP because most people don't know about them. They have a deadzone, that makes them useless if taken advantage of by the enemy. Anyone that is decent at PVP and knows this mechanic can and will counter you very hard. Hunter pet doesn't scale with gear (at all) so in later phases the pet will be less efficient than earlier phases, this is also exacerbated because other players gear gets more amour. So overall your pet has less impact in later phases.
---
Doesn't work.
---
I understand the point you are attempting to make, but when someone is doing something that is COMPLETELY consuming them, this is no longer healthy.
---
Just like if you saw someone make a video talking about how they can't stop drinking or how much they drink everyday then it's good to maybe tell that person that this isn't a healthy behavior anymore.  Not telling them to stop that habit/hobby/whatever it is completely, but jesus christ man 16 hours a DAY?  You can't possibly act like this is a normal thing that is 'okay' for someone to do.
---
Hunter was my original main back in the day so I'm kind of drawn to it. I didn't want to go Mage simply because there are so many already, but Lock and SPriest are considerations as well.
---
They are boring if you treat them as a game you can play for 8 hour sessions like we do with wow.
---
As a portable option to kill time they are great, which is exactly what I treat them as.
---
The mage should survive that easily.
---
 I'm a human rogue and an undead rogue open on me with a cheapshot In this very same area last night while I was just farming lockboxes. Was about half health fighting one of the dwarves when I ate the cheap shot into the kidney. As soon as I had control of my character again I popped an evasion, blade flurry and adrenaline rush and got lucky with my thrash blade and just burned him down. Kept an eye on his corpse saw him release when I started fighting another dwarf and saw his nameplate hiding behind a box, used my perception and stealthed just in time before he got me and hit him with the same cheap shot kidney stun combo only he didn’t live, he promptly respawns at the graveyard. Feelsgoodman.

no one yelled before rolling. amateurs.

“You’ve never been a bad player”

Of course I have, then I learned to manage threat first, then damage. - that was LITERALLY the point I was making - they are a bad player.
---
Tbf Nost didn't have THIS many people. Not that I don't think blizz could easily be doing much better
---
Like someone else said, most sm groups are hard farm groups especially it being a horde zone. Your best bet is try to make a guild group for it, I'd you're not in a guild find one even if it's not the kind of guild you want its easy access to people till you hit 60
---
the loyalty of wow classic pets is undeniable.
---
Just target them after mc and cast. You will only be able to cast instant spells though.
---
Felwood - way too many hours spent here collecting tubers and traveling in groups.
---
There aren't many good options. For pve, the only one that's remotely useful is Greater Stamina. Even for PVP that's still almost certainly your best option because you're not going to be blocking very often.
---
Are you a warlock? It's some talentpoint that improves X but decreases spirit. I think it's improved lifetap?
---
Nope. The chances of this happening are 1 in 625. With all the people running MC it's bound to happen.
---
I thought rogues couldnt use it?
---
Sad, but likely true. 16 hours a day, 6 days a week is not enough time spent pvping to reach rank 14.
---
The Classic WoW pvp system is not great. Not at all. But #nochanges and all, so it is what it is.
---
How would you feel about having servers that fully reset every 2 years while expansion continue  to be readded back in for other servers?
---
On top of that, there are a ton of raid guild leaders I would never want to work with.
---
Mind control and literally just hit the stam (or whatever) buff. MC will end once the buff is given. While MC other party members can buff him too with anything they got, without ending mind control. Only when you buff will it end

Does it become a bit more viable when fights are short? My guild blitzed MC last night with an actual 40 people, average boss fights were like 70-90 seconds tops.
---
I've run it 52-59. Hardly did any quest, just arena farm. Haven't seen Gorosh once
---
Ask before accuse. You're the one who set the tone here.
---
Very cool, thanks!
---
First thing is having healing assignments. 
---
After that, if everyone has healcomm you can see predictive bars for incoming heals, and avoid people who are receiving heals already.
---
The tiger armor looks pretty stupid tbh, it’s like a satellite dish mounted on their forehead. I prefer them without armor
---
Shamans for sure.  Better in bgs , and still great wpvp. On my mage I thought I beat a shaman last night and he ancestral rebirthed and sent me on a long ass graveyard run
---
It's not viable in PvE, but they're fine in wPvP. 
---
You should try the moonglow nature's swiftness build and invest more heavily into the balance tree. You can heal in raids with all the healing mana cost reductions and PvP as balance with an instant heal.
---
Yes it does.
---
Honestly, BuyEmAll's biggest strength is being able to buy only few of a stack. Like say vendor sells only stacks of 5 food and I only need 2. I can just buy two and only be charged for two. It's amazing. Plus if you have a partial stack in your bags and you click 'stack' on the BEA window, it will auto fill with amount needed to make a complete stack in your bags first.
---
Maybe you can land straight to trainer but I was tired of killing my alts. 
---
Warlocks can send their killrog eye in those warp holes instead of trying random jumps. It's probably the best way to do exploration but I want my bank alt to live her own adventures
---
We had 1 druid in our raid and they completed their entire set in like 2 molten cores, and we hadn't even gotten to majordomo or ragnaros yet
---
SM is not an easy dungeon to access.  Try on the weekends or Friday/Sat night.  Should be tons of groups looking.
---
People on r/2007scape started using clips from the crab rave video whenever Jagex messed something up.  That evolved into using the 🦀 emote in comments saing things like "Jagex won't reply in this thread" and other phrases.  A while back Jagex bumped the cost of new membership to $11 (older rates are grandfathered in) which people now use in addition to 🦀
---
TL:DR subredddit spillover
---
Nothing wrong with it indeed!
---
It's been on my launcher for at least a week or 2.
---
There's no current data on it because Blizzard wants to make it hard to access that information for some reason. All we have to go on is hearsay.
---
You can't get a histogram, but the market price tsm calculates is a rolling 14 day weighted average (more recent prices are weighted more heavily).
---
the problem with a lot of these is that they will not light up when they are active, for example if you do not have enough rage.
---
Is it coming out his pocket or something lmao
---
I feel like it should look more like an arm, flexing. Gotta get good bicep definition there.
---
It's to stop you from having several "use" items and using all the abilities of each in rapid succession.
---
Pretty sure this is Hunter pre BiS too. It’s mail, has agility and Crit Chance, why wouldn’t they roll on it? It’s a desirable piece of gear for plenty of classes
---
Yeah well, mob mentality says fuck your logs, if you don’t have a HoJ, you’re just a filthy casual scrub.
---
I'm at 107 runs without seeing it. I'm losing hope.
---
Ever since the rage from damage intake was fixed (see: significantly reduced), tanks no longer specifically look for fast daggers (used to for heroic strike spam).
---
Currently, the best tanking weapon in the game is Brutality Blade, especially for human tanks, with orcs looking at Deathbringer. Quel'Serrar is actually second place too.
---
It blows my mind that more people don't do this. People talk about atqnce dancing like it's carpel-tunnel inducing, but you rarely have to manually switch when using macros. I use an mmo mouse so it's pretty chill to tank as far as apm goes
---
Ofc it is. You just gotta have discipline
---
I'd be surprised if they can even come close to competing with deep frost mages given their mana issues, and 0 synergy with anyone else in the raid on things like Winter's Chill or CoE. 
---
They lose out on 10% damage &amp; -75 resists from CoE, and 10% crit from Winter's Chill.
---
49 orc enh shaman. Was lucky enough to get both theradras’ scepter and gatorbite axe on my first mara run. Would the axe be better to use because of the orc passive or should I use scepter because it has more dps?
---
I got a raid spot as a resto druid not long after hitting 60, because they needed an innervate bot. I had shit gear, never even ran the 60 dungeons. 
---
The guild was pretty crappy and I don't think we ever killed anything, just wiped over and over whilst the Italian guild leader would scream at everyone. GO DPS GO DPS, CAMAN GUISE
---
Yeah man I bet every building in America can be cleaned by ppl who enjoy cleaning toilets!..are you fucking serious dude?
---
except his dollars
---
My worst group in Classic wasn't that bad because they were bad or toxic. Rather, it was a guild group that PuG'd a healer (me) for "arena farm". We ran twice because they kept going for Angerforge - without Golem Lord, mind you - at a slow pace. They were level 53, like I was, and dealing with the packs with level 56 fire elementals was brutal. To top it all off, we didn't have a res since I'm a druid and they were a warrior, rogue, and mages. The tank and one of the DPS kept going afk so it took a couple hours just to do two arena and Angerforge runs. So much for it being an "arena farm".
---
I’ve been 2manning arena for 100+ runs. If anyone ever wanted to tag along for anger/golem I did that also and sometimes casters wanted to join just for banthok res for them. Thankfully it dropped when it was my paladin friend and I.
---
Thanks I'm cured!
---
Elwynn Forest. Every time I make a human I'm brought back to my first character on a trial account.
---
This has been around for a very long time in WoW. They were a thing in TBC and there were daily quests in vanilla if I remember correctly.
---
"As a student" lol
---
Calico from the Momentum guild in tbc?
---
And how did it turn out ? :)
---
I play a hunter and I'd recommend warlock, they're seriously strong. The only problem are rogues. Since you're alliance they might remove your fear, many rogues are orcs nowadays though.
---
Leveling a warrior is a bitch unless you're planning on dungeongrinding for the most of it. 
---
Quests that are entirely doable as a paladin will be hard as a warrior. And quests that are hard as a paladin is impossible as a warrior.
---
I did the same thing with rogue book instead of HOJ (I'm really tired of trying to get that trinket). Found a book in AH and messaged the seller. I'll take the 2% hit which is still a huge upgrade.
---
Good luck hitting 305 skill with BRE.
---
Did you even read his comment?
---
\*Cackles maniacally\*
---
The only use I give to this is for warsong gluch when I have the Flag and need to do a final rush
---
Not sure, and it's been a while since I played retail, but I'm pretty sure I was able to then, so they must have changed it at some point at least.
---
Yeah if you're using 2 handers chances are you won't be able to get any weapon skill a part from racials, hence you'll still be at 300, so you'll need 9%
---
And what I’m saying is as horde I have no way to get to 305 as 2H fury so it’s still 9%
---
Elwynn forest because it's so iconic to me
---
I am subscribed to antiMLM and all the way up until the very end I thought I was reading a post from a hun.￼
---
but why i have a hard enought time world leveling because of the skull hordes ganking me but my own faction making me die.....
---
Did you include the 20 ap then?
---
What's the best spec for hunter pets? What abilities should I be training - health, armor, resistances, etc.
---
is your name celinedion?
---
cause if so, you've mercilessly wrecked me more times than i can count
---
He edited it, didn't mention he was using BRE at the start, I'll remove the comment I made.
---
Ally huntards need to stay in their lane. 
---
In bad lands turning in a quest in the center of the map on my mount run by a hunter... nothing too harmless.
---
See a flower on my mini map and go to pick it when all of sudden I get marked and gunned down. He tried camping my body and so I called in the cavalry. Later on I catch him in front of uldamon trying to snipe people running in so I windfury his pet dead and chase him away.
---
Later on I'm in swamp of sorrows along the coast farming panthers for a quest when a different hunter 10 levels lower than me starts picking off my totems and shooting me when I engage a panther. I chase, he runs. Finally I chase him to the coast and he thinks he can swim away... while taking pop shots. I pop my water walking and shoot him down from above. I go back to the panthers and here he comes again... this time he got a little too close and didn't run when I pop my mount and gun him down again.
---
Why are ally hunters like this? I just swing first on any hunter now bc if I don't get the jump I die as a shaman.
---
At what level can I do DM runs? I'm at 55 rn
---
I think the first dailies were the Netherwing quests in TBC, then it was expanded to the Shattered Sun Offensive in the final patch. There aren't any in Vanilla.
---
You mean Runecloth or am i missing something with Felcloth and Rep?
---
Imp ad helhound?
---
How is that not a rule?
---
Most higher bars are slightly better than ores because people need them for crafting stuff (eng and BS) but may not have mining to smelt them.  Mind you, the margin is not very high (a couple silver usually), and sometimes the market swings the other way.
---
I usually only bar mithril.  Truesilver seems to be worse as bars for me, and iron was actually a little better as bars.  I have not really done thorium .
---
Yeah I knew it would be, I rushed up to 60 to beat the release of honor.  It would be a nightmare trying to level from 52-60 anywhere but in instances or places like Winterspring that are relatively less populated..
---
Yes! I’ll take three, please!!
---
Whatever I have to.
---
daaamn i wish i had time to see this for real before it got deleted
---
Nope. By 60 it ended up being a huge circlejerk of the core leaders and officers giving each other gear and perks based off of the work of others.  People who farmed pre-BiS not getting even a chance at certain items since they were afraid they’d leave because they didn’t know them well, despite being in the guild for weeks since launch day.  
---
Essentially, many knew each other RL or from previous private servers so favoritism took over fast.  
---
Left and found another group easily with people who play fairly, as well as distribute resources and loot based on merit and not sweatiness.
---
I see you have done business with us before.
---
Yep. That's definitely what it means.
---
Also selling for 35-50g on my server depending on the time of day. Just waiting for it to get a little lower even :).
---
Raptors are cool though.
---
You deserve it, tho.
---
I recently went fury. Think it's doable w/ two as fury?
---
People who like it or are fine with it.
---
GMs don't directly whisper using the standard chat, there is a special "GM Whisper" window that you are prompted to open when they initiate contact. Also there is a special "Blizz" logo that appears next to their name in chat.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Chatting_with_a_GM
---
Honestly, are you defending comments like that? Constructive criticism and comments are welcome.
---
Lmaoooo no, but i wish i was. To be called out in a forum for my ganking is a guilty dream of mine
---
My bad, man. Next time I get bullied online I'll keel over so that you don't accidentally misinterpret it as irony.
---
I’ll say this outright paladins are the most boring class to level at least if your questing. 
---
They are a support class. If your not in a group it’s literally you auto attacking your enemies to death.
---
And it is near dam unbearable.
---
If your questing find a buddy to quest with or Do dungeons.
---
There are three ways to go about this 
---
You can go full holy and pretty much tie yourself down to being dependent on others.
---
You can go retribution your auto hits with seal of command will tear through enemies fast 
---
Or you can go protection and be able to pull large groups and kill them.. you can probably solo groups of non elites (nothing compared to what mages can do)
---
But you can quest and do dungeons because everyone needs a tank.
---
Now end game you’ll be a holy paladin so there ya go.
---
Maybe its not available in this phase.
---
I mean yeah I'm sure it is
---
WOTLK changed the leveling experience to require less xp. I think that may even have happened late in TBC.
---
After 45, the levelling becomes a big slog. That was definitely the case during vanilla and TBC. The main difference between the two is that during TBC you can play 58-60 in Outlands and that was super quick. In vanilla 58-60 is super slow.
---
I am around 50 now and I am losing the motivation to play too. I log in like once or twice a week for an hour or two and that's it. Back during the original vanilla I was hyped to see what's at max level and what the future holds. Now I know everything there is about this version of the game and going through the slog is even harder. Grinding level 60s dungeons ad infinitim is not going to be that fun.
---
People managed to be happy inside concentration camps, and you're whining about cleaning toilets.
---
You can be happy doing anything, if you want to.
---
PvP. Did you read his post or just the title?
---
I agree. It's just the stigma that people "think" druid is bad. I frequently have druids that top the DPS charts, or save our parties ass with brez or extra tanking. That minor offset of DPS doesn't justify not bringing a druid when they do so much.
---
And, i fixed it. I alternate pets depending on what im fighting
---
Do you even get honor for killing a grey?  They won't be in low or mid level zones any more than they are now.
---
It's both pre-BiS and raid BiS for multiple phases because no other released items match it. The item for me is a ring for tank warriors that doesnt have any competitors until phase 4 or 5 fron Alterac Valley exalted. But the cost (225g for me) is enough that most people arent willing to pay for it ahead of time.
---
This is some urbandictionary level of explaining.
---
I to am incredibly happy with Incendius across the board! I even love that I have an arch nemesis (in my eyes) that is an instant battle as soon as I see them!
---
Death knights couldn't use shield in wrath.
---
I started lvling a priest alt, but apart from that after a month and a half of pretty much only wow, I am slowing down a little bit and playing other stuff.  Went back to my dos2 save  I started before classic came out, for  example.
---
Easily worth it.
---
Winter spring, I love the snow, polar bears, yeti and feel of the place.
---
&gt; I think the core issue you don't get is that the item does not have intrinsic immutable value (or at least, you pretend like it does only when its convenient). It is purely situational: either it holds the AH value, or the combat utility value + vendor value - both are mutually exclusive
---
When the item drops, it's a 200g item. That's all that matters at that moment, not its value after equipped or disenchanted or whatever. 
---
&gt;So have they gotten poorer by your estimation or not?
---
Yes in relation to the drop they should have gotten, they're 200g poorer because they now have to buy *another* item than the one that dropped. That item's value is not included when calculating the value of the *item that dropped*. It's really simple when you actually just look at the outcome of you needing an item to sell and someone that needs to use after, that outcome tells you that it is in fact not the same value to you and someone that uses it.
---
Say we have a group of 5 people. A druid tank, priest healer, 2 mages and a warrior. For this example they all have 200g in their inventory. An Edgemaster's drops and the only member in the party that needs it is the warrior obviously. So he needs the item, you however are not happy that he should be the only one to benefit off his gear drop so you ninja need the item and get it to sell it. It sells for 200g on the auction house. The warrior still needs the item so he now has to go buy an Edgemaster's off of the auction house. 
---
In total that leaves you with 400g, the druid and two mages with 200g, and the warrior with 0g. There is a 400g difference between you and the warrior that needs it, but only 200g difference between you and the other classes that would have just sold it. 400g is double the difference of 200g, hence it's practically doubly valuable to someone that actually needs to use it than it is to people that just want to sell it. 
---
&gt;It would make him stupid.
---
Why? He should also be getting 200g for that rare item drop, just because he isn't selling it on the auction house doesn't mean he doesn't deserve it just as much as you do for that boe.
---
Sorry to say but this is strictly wrong. Mirah's always &gt; hanzo
---
I have a similar one called QuestGuru, which also shows the actual level of the quests.
---
Cloth drops from lower level mobs that aren't farmed as much as silk+ mobs so usually in shorter supply than the others.  People farm the ever living crap out of places like SM and ZF that typically drop silk and higher so it's more abundant.  Also usually pricier on horde than alliance because alliance have stockades.  
---
I gleaned all of this info from a quick google search and do not have first hand knowledge, so... grain of salt with this.
---
Conan, what is best?
---
So I'm a level 29 Alliance priest. Is it worth it for me to go do the Dark Iron War elite quest with a group, pick up the stockades quest it unlocks, and go run stockcades again? I've finished all the other stockades quests. Alternatively, I could just go straight to ironforge, find a group that'll let me heal them through gnomergon, and then get back to questing.
---
Basically what I want to know, is doing that wetlands quest and rerunning stockades a good use of my time if my goal is exp when compared to other options available to me?
---
Copying and pasting from an old comment of mine:
---
A prison run is doing the early quest in the prison area. Other runs except for quest runs usually skip this run, usually only run by low level groups.
---
Arena runs do nothing but the arena arena repeatedly, because it has good loot and xp. Run with high and low levels.
---
Quest runs aim to do as many quests as possible, including potentially multiple trips outside the instance to let people turn in quests and pick up new ones. Run with high and low levels, though the quest to save the princess is usually high levels only.
---
Angerforge runs usually do the arena and angerforge. Usually high levels only.
---
Attunement runs are for 55+ and usually do the arena/angerforge route, (usually kill Golem Lord but it's not strictly required) into the grim guzzler, then do Ambassador Flamelash, the Seven, and then take a detour a few rooms before the final boss to grab the item for Molten Core attunement.
---
A lava run is a special kind of run where you jump down into a lava river to skip basically the entire instance up to the MC attunement area. Often used to farm the emperor.
---
Princess runs follow the route above and kill only the Emperor, saving the princess for a quest. She's you've done that quest, you're eligible for loot from the princess from then on and there's no reason to save her again.
---
An Emperor run kills the Emperor and the Princess.
---
At your level, and for xp, the ones you'd probably be most interested in are low-level quest runs and arena runs.
---
This is a bug, but it was actually happening before the change to aggro and leashing mechanics.
---
What classes are trolls good for? All of them, Berserking is stupid good as it increases attack or casting speed and the effect increases the lower the health. I'd say troll hunter is best horde hunter with increase in bow skill and beast slaying, trolls are op my guy.
---
I play a UD female because I like how much jumping there is with moves.
---
So true.  My family tried to blame WoW for the problems in our relationship, but in reality, WoW didn't cause any problems, it just exposed a lot of ones that were already there.
---
Leatrix Plus let's you do this.
---
Not me no- I play on an ally controlled server
---
Nah. This is my first time playing wow and I bet I have 40 addons. I just scroll through the twitch app everyday when I log on and see if there is something that sounds cool/useful.
---
Every 2 years definitely isn’t all the time.  It’s more like really long seasons and this with the idea that there is “new content” to move to of you don’t want to reset.
---
I love Felwood! I always find myself there chilling and exploring the little nooks and crannies. I think it's hilarious when I accidentally fall into darkshore. Whoops!
---
With the amateur hour editing and the actual neligible time skip I classify this as nothing but a shitpost.
---
If you always want to prioritize overpower then you can just set it up as a macro. I do that for riposte on my rogue.  
---
Ex.  
---
/cast overpower  
---
/cast mortal strike
---
Arena or Prison runs are the first type. Those just include killing one of the early bosses then resetting. Then you can do torch runs once you’re 56 or so and then full clears obviously and emp runs. There’s also anger/golem runs. Lots of different types. But at 54 probably just stick to arena runs
---
Level 40 Warrior....Sadly can't afford a mount yet, I have about 86gp.
---
Any suggesting on farming spots? I tried the Welplings in Swamp of Sorrows... There wen't enough of them to continuously kill. I felt like 50% of my time was waiting for them to re-spawn.
---
I'm alliance, have Mining, Skinning, Fishing, First Aid and Cooking all up to par.
---
Nah, majority of the dudes playing need to re-evaluate how they spend most of their free time.
---
Running up through the gates of Ironforge. Iconic.
---
Blame it on the healers.  For rag, its mostly their fault if you die.
---
For ony, no dots after 45%, and make sure you take full fireballs without anyone else getting hit, as supposedly the fireball spreads the aggro drop amongst the targets hit.
---
The rest is on your tanks.  If you still take aggro its either bad fireball luck, your tanks suck at generating threat, or you didnt lip fast enough.
---
They should just scream "I have a boyfriend!" when you open their dialog box to ask a question.  xD
---
aaand its deleted.
---
Yup, if you never intend to heal, that's pretty much worthless.
---
SoID isn't really sought after for PVP, it's for doing things like farming nodes, running through dungeons faster, etc.  In those cases you would just have a crappy off-hand equipped for a little while.
---
Booty bay all day every day!
---
Keto has nothing to do with IF. 
---
IF ‘works’ because it reduced amount of hours we eat in while fasting can lessen feeling of hunger. It’s still CICO at the end of the day.
---
Shhhhhh. This is how some of us make gold.
---
Prices are all lower than normal because theres double the resources to farm.
---
Mining and herbalist goods should all rise a bit in price once layering is removed. 
---
Don't get me wrong its normalised a bit (I bought so many arcanite bars at like 20-30g) but there's more to change.
---
He mentioned that last night! He was also dropping some nice numbers as well, unfortunately that drop through everyone off their rythm. Too much excitement that late at night haha
---
Had the binding from Garr drop our first and second week of raiding. Me and my OT are excited but I hope Geddon doesn’t turn out to be a complete cockblock.
---
That statement is frequently said by keyboard warriors who actually suck at the game lol
---
It's both. Exercise burns calories, which come from sugar and fat. Eating provides those calories (stored energy). When energy expenditure is larger than intake, you lose weight.  Granted there are subtleties day to day and hour by hour e.g. water weight, it's true in the broad sense.
---
Have him give you money/gear and bags, he can help you run dungeons if you are targetting certain drops, but doing so will kill your XP gains, and from I have read the general concensus is the 'tag' method also yield very little XP.
---
Ironforge. I'm a Dwarf.
---
Man! Wish I knew this earlier before I picked a lion and a boar. After I tame a pet I feel bad abandoning it.
---
Big PoM Pyro oof. I felt this in my bones
---
LMAO! best typo/auto correct. Top Keks
---
Is there a character in this screen shot? I just see a large shrub.
---
I don’t see green as off limits either. I mean shit, in P2, they’re gonna give you HKs. You don’t need to be a hardcore ranker to want to get at least a few ranks.
---
Went to STV to do the starter question but then they quickly turned orange / red. So headed to 1k needles.
---
not officially, no.  there is a census addon but it was broken and never fully accurate to begin with.
---
Thanks ya I'll do it now.
---
Any AH addon you would recommend or is Auctioneer the standard?
---
No, even very fast levelers are going to take over 150 hours. That's way too much time to spend on something you dont like.
---
Log in, hearth to kargath, port to org for ony's buff, port to UC, fly to Kargath.
---
I've seen the orc 15 times which is the worst part...

I kek’d
---
&gt;Comparing Whataburger to Five Guys is blasphemy
---
I don't know about where you live, but in my state.. I'd rather go anywhere except 5 guys, Premium burger price with dumster diving quality, Shit ton of half raw fries.  
---
I've heard that they win awards and stuff in california, and I'm not really sure who in the hell they had to bribe to get them, but now I understand why the price is high relative to the value.
---
I've never been to or heard of "whataburger" so I can't speak for them.
---
Ony is tough with its threat. Sometimes, you can help your guild just as much by dying in a good spot as P3 hits. 
---
You can also try to get hit by a fireball. The way we handle it is if any DPS doesn’t get hit with a fireball they need to run to the tank spot in the cave. So, if you retain agro in P3 you aren’t facing her into the raid.
---
So long as you have Wott ignored it’s great.
---
People say the dungeon thing doesnt work. But in my experience it's not that much of a deficit. I boosted my friends through deadmines at like 38, and they got at least a level each run. And afaik 10 levels above is the cap for xp garnishing.
---
Winter spring is the place to be
---
Yeah man dat fat nelf ass. Imagine playing a female character because you can’t even get your d!ck up so it doesn’t even phase you. But seriously, why do you guys do it?
---
@oldrasputin, have you also noticed different spawn points?
---
It's not exactly hard being class lead when you're the only druid. Or at least it works that way for the druid in our guild.
---
Consider me interested as well.
---
So a place thats literally on fire drops gear that consists of plants...
---
Works for me!
---
Leatrix can hide it.
---
I run just as many add-ons, but have not found anything for garbage collection or extending required memory for add-ons.
---
breaks of the mara runs I've been doing, allows me to go heal as holy rathe than burn in shadow. I just need to get some more mana, could you send me your build on bobo talents?  
---
  This is the build I was looking at but I kinda wanna pump into PI, even though with this build I think i'd be around 6300 mana

ok bye
---
I have been killed by skull level horde (sometimes whole groups of them) so many freakin times while I am fishing and every single time I sit there with my mouth open in shock wondering what kind of person is on the other end of this deal.
---
And it’s not like I’m fishing in a spawned pool or floating wreckage, I will literally just be fishing out in open water peacefully leveling up my fishing.
---
I’m all about pvp. I’m on a pvp server for a reason. This is not pvp.
---
Stala(c)ties (ceiling) and stala(g)mites (ground)
---
Blackrock mountain because it's fun to watch people fail the jump shortcut to brd/ mc :)
---
Didn't know, but just googled and no they can't.
---
Don't be rude, his mom just died dude
---
its always the same. some pvp happens, alliance gets pissed and starts camping the place for hours, at some point horde is pissed and eradicates them. every1 logs back to their low level chars, some pvp happens...
---
i think i had like 5 1on1 since classic came out, everything else was getting ganked by 3+ alliance, or finally getting revenge on those 3+ ally with more horde
---
BUT there is just no honor in this...for now. come phase 2, red is dead.
---
I don't get why people make such a fuss about warrior when paladin is just as bad. Their kit is literally made for giving buffs to groups and suck a dick alone.
---
I kill and help randomly. I'll usually unstealth before helping though. If you don't attack I'll follow and backstab anything you hit. Or I'll ambush you. A aoe farm mage is just an easy target. I only kill once though. Camping is shit and I hate when it happens to me so I won't do it.
---
And a paaaaaaartridge in a pear treeeee
---
1) Yes, Illusionary Rod is a good choice.
---
2) Your Ele gear is going to be just fine for Resto; the stats that you're looking for are really the same on both sets. You'll always want mp5, int, crit-- the only difference would be spell hit and spell pen, but you don't have to worry about these at 40. You shouldn't need to swap gear. If you mean you have mostly Enh-- well... I wouldn't worry about it too much. You should get some good drops from running SM, and you can even roll back to SFK or RFK to pick up a few pieces if you feel sorely left behind. But in general, just start picking up +int pieces.
---
3) This isn't your fault, but I take issue with "the right thing to do." Do you like playing Enhancement? Do you want to keep with it? Or do you want to change things up? I ran ele/resto in vanilla and had no problem soloing. I'm rolling it right now (pre-40 because I have problems), and I don't have issues questing or soloing. The essence of this is that there isn't a wrong way to play. If you want to switch, switch. You're at a good time to do so. If you want to stay with Enh, because you like smashing faces, and you don't feel like your gear is optimal for switching, then don't worry about it. You can always switch back!
---
Yeah this always leads to a discussion on how easy it would take to farm the gold or how long it will take. For some, 8 hours of game time is a lot and others its not. I think there should be best in slot lists for those with less time
---
You have to plan ahead
---
Keep at it man, no exaggeration our main tank (who recieved the bindings) is currently at over 130 arena kills. He has only been able to roll on Savage Chain 1 time and he lost it to an enh shaman. Most of those have been anger runs to help guildies as opposed to just running arena. Every dog has his day, just keep at it!
---
That’s a smart strat! Our guild definitely doesn’t have that down yet. And yeah dying may help I mean we usually clear her, but it doesn’t show up well on my dps meters in the log 😭
---
Who is that?
---
I’m an officer cause that cringe brag was needed rofl
---
Gathered one of the worst groups in terms of composition for WC on one of the new EU realms and went ahead anyway because of low pop and not much time to spare. I was a druid, we had warrior, shaman, hunter and rogue. Judging by the comp I assumed I'd be healing and warrior tanking but when we meet outside he just stands there so I figure what the hell, I'll tank our way in. We get in and the fun begins. Still tanking, I ask the shaman to not use rockbiter and earthshock on cooldown. He doesn't say a word. Him and the hunter run ahead of me and keep ninja pulling. We somehow get through lady anacondra and I finally state the obvious: "I can't tank and heal at the same time" to which the hunter says he has some bandages and can heal. The shaman does not respond to my requests of him to heal and keeps running ahead and pulling. Keeping my composure I ask the warrior to pull out his shield and 1h and tank so I can heal to which he confesses he has neither of those. We kill Kresh hoping he'd drop the shield which he does so we hand it to the warrior. Now tank, I say. "Do you guys have a 1h?" he responds. The hunter hands him a grey 1h mace and we proceed to literally wipe at the next pull as he can't keep aggro at all. I spirit rez and go back to my paladin on Bloodfang EU
---
You’re the worst kind of person.
---
Dps is at fault here.
---
They have to kill the casters first, protecting the healer, giving the tank time to build threat on the melees.
---
Nope its not working, i still have to manually set the prices
---
Is too much weapon skill past 300 bad/redundant? Talking about daggers specifically if that makes a difference
---
I enjoy the downtime in classic. Long flight path? time to do a load of laundry. - Waiting for a group to get to DM to a few push ups. ETC. So many games go at 100 miles an hour as soon as you log in unless you forcibly take a break (which many of us gamers don't know how). So classic forcing these breaks is quite nice. I think about a game like apex for a few weeks I played it and as soon as you log in theres literally no downtime, which I get is something the modern gaming community wants. But damn
---
How about you go kidnapp a princess to make yourself feel better
---
Drain tanking is great. I would highly recommend it. Here is the guide I used. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qdUs229_XvkR1NCeTrJkybL5BDXGIh7q/view
---
It’s sad because the alliance on my server is outnumbered by I’m still getting ganged by higher level alliance, was questing in stv at level 35 getting ganged by a level 50 Druid
---
Explain the irony.
---
Shit son, thanks for the Info!
---
thanks for screenshot and not a photo,
---
upvoted
---
Especially if you xferred from 70/30 Skeram, where there was twice as many horde as alli, and then transferred to a server with the opposite problem. I’m kind of shocked (:o) that Blizz didn’t make faction specific transfers... they went through all the effort of ensuring server health by implementing layers, and didn’t even take into account the alliance to horde. :/
---
you mad bro?
---
i'm leveling a druid to stealthily gather alch/engi/bs mats for my warrior main. 
---
30% speed boost at level 21 is coming in real handy with all the running around you start doing.
---
I ported my entire dungeon group to Darnassus when they asked for Ironforge.
---
Grats!
---
Meanwhile I picked Gehennas
---
:(
---
Is the meat that drops lootable by all in the party or is it one person loots only
---
For sure and i just return it back
---
I still don't like the idea of people profiting from illegal server content
---
Where in the hunter discord do you see this? I've been looking all over for suggest pet raiding specs and can't find anything.
---
What's the addon that shows nearby enemies?
---
Tell that to southshore pvp.
---
That is actually very clever. Good idea!
---
rekt
---
Undead priest, Thunderfury. I've run peacefully past one (1) skull ally that didn't kill me. One.  Insert Hero of the Alliance meme.
---
Well BGs are cross server so that’s not an issue. Ranking however will be impossible.
---
I wasnt whining. I was telling the guy blaming horde because aparently only horde gank to talk to the 5 alliance last night who should reroll horde if they want to gank
---
Starfire is the main spell used in raid (better scaling with SP,better DPM.
---
It synergize with the warlock curse.
---
Hmm I have the same problem doing DM Lashers farms where I don’t kill any bosses though. I just can’t figure out the timing.
---
This 100%, all the morons who say “not is easy you don’t have to be prot/etc” are usually people who have never played a warrior and who just follow tanks around the dungeon.
---
Level 38 is a tough area for a paladin, just hang in there, wait for your mount, and make sure you're picking up juicy abilities from the talent tree to make leveling more interesting.
---
I'd say don't be afraid to mix up your rotation but paladins are pretty fixed on the auto-&gt;judge-&gt;seal rotation. Try mixing in Seal of Light for better durability.
---
Undercity! The atmosphere of the place is fantastic :)
---
This is like the 10th I've seen from this same name... how the fuck haven't they stopped this already???
---
I already didn't want to insult 12 year olds. Didn't know how far down I should go...
---
Get invited to a group &gt; enter zf &gt; leave group
---
You are now in stormwind and problem solved
---
The system is rolling for loot. The rule is what rarity rolling occurs for.
---
I too would like to know as well. I want the dagger and belt from DM along with the core hound gloves in MC. I’d also have the talent in combat for rogues too.
---
They opened up server transfers but didn't consider faction balance. 
---
The Skeram faction transfers for example should have been Horde only until the Alliance to Horde ratio was balanced. Instead it was a free for all that resulted in the Alliance leaving en mass.
---
What add on is it that shows where the item drops when you hover over it? At the bottom it says who in MC it drops off. Thanks!
---
So this is what happened: 
---
“The guy” wants to buy cloth 
---
She is supposed to send it CoD (Cash on Delivery) to “The guy”. 
---
But instead of entering how much she wants for the cloth (CoD) she adds 1,6g to the mail as another item. 
---
Like when you want to send gold to a alt or whatever. 
---
So “The guy” gets a mail containing 2 stacks of cloth and 1,6g. 
---
So to make this right he should first have sent the 1,6g back that she sent by mistake and then another 1,6g to pay for the cloth.
---
Ora3 kept giving me a lot of errors during raid, especially during ready checks.
---
It's amazing up to 305 and decent up to 310. Past that, mostly useless.
---
The inspiration i needed :) Thx!
---
Good input there
---
You can get a glimpse of the complete loss of composure in the chat window. We ended up calling it at Sulfuron because most of the group was too shook after the excitement. We will finish the run tonight, feel free to reach out if you'd like to run!
---
The fee is a 5% cut (for faction AHs) on the sale price of the item, which will not be returned obviously based on what it is. The deposit is up front money based on the vendor price and the auction duration, and is returned in full if the auction sale goes through. Items with a high vendor price have a high deposit, while items with no vendor price can have no deposit. The fee and deposit are not directly related and one could be higher or lower than the other.
---
Yes and no. If I'm OOM and the healer and other DPS are good on mana, I'm not going to drink. If the healer drinks, or is under about two-thirds mana, I'll drink. Usually, I'm just looking for a renew or a rejuv to keep me around half health. Healer being at full mana means we don't stop pulling, and I'm not going to sit there and wand to preserve the healer's full mana bar.
---
Yeah if i was a rogue id def do it too cause it would be hilarious
---
#nochanges working like a charm!
---
Just wait for P2.
---
Whats wrong with herod?  Alliance run around ganking people all the time.
---
Skeram is pretty bad, like 70%+, but herod doesnt feel nearly so bad yet.  
---
Still, it's hard to judge now, wait for p2 where more people want to go fight out in the world.
---
To be fair, druid grinding isn't the best anyways. We can do IS+MF+barkskin&amp;hurricane on 3-4 mobs, finish off with bear swipe@ 60. Better than feral that's for sure. Usually have to resort to fishing/herbing for money like other healers.
---
It's not terrible for leveling but you miss out on movespeed from cat from 21-29 and generally no downtime and have to drink a loott more water.
---
Same. I also get attached to them. I think it’s just natural.
---
Ah, the simplicity of mage rotations. Short and sweet...
---
Says my wife... *sigh*
---
..... it's a joke bro.  I thought the "Duh." made it obvious.
---
I think it's a part of AtlasLoot. Don't think I have any other loot related addons besides BetterVendorPrice
---
Blizz has done nothing to prevent faction imbalance despite methods being successfully implemented on pservers for years.
---
Because you can heal yourself.
---
Well that’s one way to use a skill. Clicking it in your character menu
---
Honestly, I'm 58 and I havent hit a significant wall leveling so far. In fact, theres a ton of places that I wish I had spent more time in. Maybe OSRS just conditioned me for the grind because the road to 60 has felt like nothing
---
The question is, is it better xp than running with a good group that's your lvl. I don't think it is. Lol no one is taking 30 minutes to do sm gy.
---
Ok got it, thanks for the in-depth response.
---
I'm a Hunter and between pet food and ammo it isn't easy. Lol
---
Yeah we are disenchanting them too now and its pretty painful
---
The emerald dream
---
No cropping is just as bad
---
There's always truth in jest.
---
I would get cooking at least for now. I just leveled it up and it cost 10g max to level it up to 300.
---
No problem :) took me a while to realise that chances are you won't be in all-green items until level 16-18, so don't stress too much if you don't have one at 13. I would recommend checking the Weapon Vendors in whichever cities/settlements you visit (and sometimes the travelling merchants on the roads) - you can often find half-decent green weapons for reasonable prices for their level.
---
You dont need cooking and fishing, dont worry about it
---
I thex'd
---
I think that fishing is worth it. You can go level up on the barrens and sell the deviate fish you get for some gold.
---
Follow up question, do you also recommend swapping to a 2h in the execute phase, so long as you dont need to maintain SB/survival isn't an issue?  
---
I'd think this is ideal, but I am not sure in most dungeons if bosses/trash is alive long enough to see a benefit, I have just been executing with sword and board if  I am not pooling rage for the next pull
---
I believe it's 5% for normal faction AH and 15% for neutral (Hence why nobody uses the neutral AH)
---

Red is dead, but I prefer the satisfaction of him dying to NPC's and suffering repair costs as well as the corpse run.
---
A friend got SGC on their Druid and opens trade with people who need it, putting it in the no trade box. Cruel bastard.
---
This is incorrect. I have found that 1 additional lowbie boosts exp, but anymore than that decrease it. I haven’t written down my findings but am sure of it. Please test for yourself.
---
Just curious, new to the game and like to discuss mechanics while I'm at work!
---
Thank you! It's reassuring to know they are aware of it and working on a fix.
---
\^\^\^ and is what i plan on doing.
---
How is that ironic? Irony would imply that my statement, misquoted as it is, is not really how I feel. If I were being ironic I would have based my first statement on the opinion of whether others gank me, not on their action, or the second statement on my feelings regarding their actions. 
---
I.e, 'if people keep wanting to gank me I will quit' is ironic if I do not care about his opinion. Or alternatively 'if I keep getting ganked I will quit' would be ironic if I then said I do not care about what he does. Because I said that I do not care about his opinion regarding how I play the game or interpret events in the game I am not conflicting with my statement that ganking may provoke me, or other people, to quit the game.
---
Thank you I was trying to remember where this came from while reading. I was thinking Pulp Fiction for some reason.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dmj1hh/came_across_this_guide_on_farming_gold_for_anyone/). 
---
Being a choosy beggar for a Scholo pug tank.
---
Let's see how that pans out.
---
Those pulls are a little annoying for warriors. First we have to pick up the elites and then sunder the rest... and yes that includes the casters in the back. They’re a pain but if the warrior can’t sunder it he needs to rethink his approach.
---
What is more important in a raid than 10% damage reduction?
---
Yes it is. Unless your group is a full mage + priest.
---
Yeah, then it could be gear. If you keep getting thrown into lava from that spot. Tell your raidleader you need a different, or people need to move. It is stupid of him to not make sure all his ranged dps can maximize their dps.
---
Oof love it, Moonglow?
---
I've been tempted to swap but I love Hotw pvp too much.
---
Also what was that Eye patch illusion you had that sticks through form all I could find for things like that is Noggenfogger, is it ally only?
---
I'll remember it.  How much tip are we talking about?
---
Who needs Shadowmeld when I can just wear camo gear 5Head
---
Duskwood, creepy atmosphere with desolate buildings scattered around, woods plagued by creatures, the graveyard haunted by skeles and ghouls then there is the fearsome elite stitches that runs lowbie players off the road from his mere presence
---
Also depends on person running you. Mage/warr/hunter do pretty well.
---
I think what you're failing to understand is that I agree with you.  People who take no responsibility, but complain about those who do take it, are whom I would actually classify as "toxic."
---
Grom Hellscream’s monument in Ashenvale. In vanilla, I fought my way through many demons to make it inside the scorched valley not knowing what or who I’d find and behold it was a monument dedicated to my favorite hero in the Warcraft universe. I took a knee as a sign of respect and repeated the same thing nearly 15 years later. Amazing!
---
Literally just said that man. Exercise supplements. It isn't both when diet is 80-90% of weight loss, that's a supplement. Can't out work a bad diet, but you can diet lack of exercise - that's the key difference. As long as u have a calorie deficit then you're all set, which doesn't require exercise.
---
Basically. I was already a healthy weight to begin with, but I've still lost 5lbs since launch.
---
You really have to plan ahead with these. Skill of impending doom is specifically used in anticipation of long  breakable crowd controls like sheep, freezing trap, sap, etc.
---
The biggest blasphemy is where they placed In N Out.  Just absurd.
---
People ranking burger places based on French fries are fucking garbage people.
---
5 guys is a shitty Patty with no seasoning, just masked with condiments.  And, there were plenty of shitty burger joints that give you a garbage bag of half cooked steak frieds.  That's not a new concept and not fucking how a burger place should be ranked.
---
I do agree that Whataburger is nothing special.  Their patties are a good size and flavor, but it's not special by any means.
---
Although iirc the gate in the instance is to the north of the ship, where it should be to the south.. So the gate is actually facing westfall and not STV as it should.
---
Keep the pumpkin, ya filthy animal.
---
Well done Lurpy, looks good.
---
If you’re a Druid reroll. Leveling a Druid to 60 was a huge fucking mistake and I hate this game because of it .
---
My main tank in OG vanilla was a clicker and we made it to the 4 horseman in naxx and Cthun in aq 40. Clicking works for some people. We'd always laugh cus his furious clicks would come through the mic
---
Huh, seems like it would be against tos
---
Ok, good to know, so many mechanics I don't know about...
---
Blizzard doesn't want us to know. There was an add-on that would scour /who and you could upload the reports so that players could build an unofficial database
---
Blizzard intentionally broke the addon (To be fair, the /who function was starting to take up to a minute or two to tell you who players were, so it was definitely starting to lag a lot) so we don't have much clue
---
I personally don’t equip a 2h, but if your group is struggling on baron for example, that might be a benefit. (I used execute the last run I did and crit him for 2k with a 1h) I generally keep a shield on for bosses though. Been running Strat with healers around 56-58 haha.
---
Fish Steamwheedle Port for the schools of fish and floating wreckages. Mithril Bound Trunks will give you greens, leather, bolts of cloth, and potions that all can sell pretty well.
---
The full quote is something like 'a jack of all trades and a master of none is often better than a master of one' I think it goes for druids
---
We've had that happen three times in a row. We have 1 resto druid and 1 feral druid. Some of us are starting to get real salty.
---
You're part of the minority.
---
Eh, I like my paladin over my warrior because my warrior probably eats about 15,000 calories a day in food, just restoring his health.
---
.....on the other hand...my paladin probably has to pee a lot. &gt;\_&gt;
---
What exactly do you find 'bad' about the Paladin Experience (so far)? :o
---
((I'm a lvl 60 ret, hence why I ask.))
---
I recommend joining Pagle-US.
---
...totally not biased. :P
---
Nah. You wanna stay Resto so you can secure tier 2 pieces. That way you become a Fucking rocket launcher in phase 2/3. Ele Resto is godly later on.
---
Interesting considering I started last month and am in NA - there were like two low-medium pop servers and last I checked every NA server is high pop now. I had to wait in a 20 minute Q once, and then never had to wait again lol. Seems packed to me and I'm on a newer server. ~Lvl 51 undead rogue on Bigglesworth. I have three IRL friends who are level 60 already farming MC and Ony.
---
You can do that sure, but often enough your fellow healers will be sniping them as quick as they can.
---
Blizzard ticket would be my guess. But they probably made it that way.
---
Top 3 worst sets in the entire game.
---
Allright, I don't really have anything in mind, just realized this game mechanic existed.
---
Great video man, what gear are you rocking?
---
I tested it myself and its correct. Ive ran my twink in dungeons until SM and a full group always gave more exp
---
Fair enough.
---
I can dot drain life and coa on multiple things
---
Druid gear is the only thing that ever fucking drops lmao.
---
Lmfaooo if you can't look at a virtual cartoon girl without getting horny and distracted, that sounds like a you problem my man.
---
But please, keep pretending it makes you more macho or something, this shit is hilarious. 🤣
---
As the other poster suggested, it's helpful in dungeon situations where people will pull off you while you tank. Some bosses, UBRS The Beast for instance, move around a lot and fear so being able to charge back in is pretty clutch.
---
Theyll never release world bosses with multiple layers
---
&gt;Nothing can be done about it
---
I don't believe you.
---
And you never will
---
not only do horde get a blue fishing pole from a quest reward (the only other blue fishing pole in game is from fishing contest at booty bay) they get one of the best melee trinkets too: https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19120/rune-of-the-guard-captain
---
I honestly think the mount is overrated, sure the color is unique but no saddle just makes it look too simple imo.
---
For me the most special place will remain the view you see when you climb the hills next to the Crossroads in the Barrens searching  for the dude who gives you  the early warrior  quest. This is a really  peaceful and tranquil view to the one of the most iconic (if not the most) pre cataclysm zones. It may not be the scening Elvyn Forest oder the majestic Loch Modan but for me it remains the best as this is place where I have spent  hours playing  with my friends  having absolutely  no idea what I am doing without a care in the world.
---
I made some huge gold from ah and i hate buying mounts or pets so i didnt know what to buy so i bought follower success chance increasing equipment (platinum whetstone) on every follower
---
got a tigerstrike mantle for 9s and a warden staff for 100g that i eventually sold for 320g myself.
---
This. It's the pservers that motivated blizzard to capitalize
---
What's going to happen with the 60m people?
---
That's everyone on a pvp server. Both factions.
---
Meanwhile, my guild, which has been running 4 Druids (2 Feral, 2 Resto) only has 1 Druid with the 3-piece T1 bonus, one T2 helm (which dropped in a pug, not one of our guild runs) and one pair of T2 legs. 
---
We've been killing Rag every week since week 4. RNG is RNG.
---
I didnt keep reading when you said agony is only 1 target. If you arent sure how *that* mechanic works then idk how youre so confident you know anything else to be true.
---
Wait a decade, then show me this in VR.
---
Hm, not sure. I know the Org one does go over water. Either way, it’s pretty safe to just go outside the town and go directly west in the water for a minute and then swim north. It’s just timesaving to jump the zep.
---
I do that too, but a red name is already kill on sight so it doesn't matter much, I'll leave random people alone after a kill, but the KoS list gets camped.
---
Id say level some profs as you lvl, and first aid is very good for a secondsry prof. My personal fav for my rogue is herb and alc.
---
If you want quicker quest navigation download questie. (Some say this takes away classic experience but I like it).
---
If you need to find a group message in the general channel of that zone, people with usually respond. /join world and /join lfg are great for finding dungeon groups.
---
Find a guild with people who have your same goals. If you are casual mention that and you will find guilds. Even regular raiding guilds will pick you up but you may not get as much help for low lvl content.
---
Other than that you can go combat sword if you want to be op. However I like daggers cause I think its more fun! Also daggers can become just as good at max lvl with good gear :)
---
Other than that research what good rogue weapons are for different level brackets and try to get them. Good gear upgrades make a big difference! 
---
Other than that enjoy the ride!
---
Good work, my guy. 
---
PS fuck the horde
---
Weird man. I got 100 exp per kill when it was me (level 28), runner (60), and friend (28). 
---
We invited a 4th person to the group (28) and my exp dropped to 74 per kill. I made sure the level of the mob that was killed was the same. 
---
Hmmm
---
Thank you. That fucking crab meme has been confusing me for the better part of a year.
---
Randomly came across it im sure
---
Hey sorry one more question, will the Twitch version of Auctionator work or do I need to download the patched version of it?
---
Think of it like being able to hit at an effective level of 61 at 60 with each 5 points. It definitely has diminishing returns (after 2 levels up on something you're hitting well already so the increase doesn't show up as much past 2 levels if skill or so).
---
Yeah, to a dead server where I got no friends.....
---
I absolutely despise using the Blizz website.. It has WAY TOO MANY god damn media plugins and shit it's like watching a super high def movie if you just want to renew a subscription.. Plus there's some weird glitches that make it hardly accessible from certain setups.
---
Really liking your work so far. Keep it up!
---
Cured of what? Unhappyness? 
---
Listen to yourself.
---
It is. I've seen people selling the spikes, and I know of at least four people on my server who have the plans, but I've never seen them go for sale on the AH.
---
Hi!
---
The queue on Gehennas is crazy. I get home each day after work to 4k queue. By the time I get in, I have to go to sleep or I already committed to some other work.
---
So I want to transfer on a different server, but don't know which one would be best:
---
* Bloodfang
---
* Dragonfang
---
* EarthShaker
---
* Judgement
---
* Mandokir
---
I'm mostly interested in a healthy balance between Alliance and Horde. On Gehennas it seems quite unbalanced and as alliance I'm always outnumbered in open-wrold PvP.
---
Do you have any first hand experience with one of these realms? Or are there any reliable census tools out there I could check?
---
Those logs don't mean the druid is balance. So they can also be feral. Dps druids on Warcraft logs get moonfire icon no matter the spec.
---
DM: W (Deadmines Westfall) will always be a classic dungeon you should run before trying the expansion.
---
Honestly just level...  I have a 54 Warlock and have 250 gold right now from just doing quests, vendoring greys/greens and just playing.
---
Edit:  if you want something not crowded maybe the trolls in Hinterlands?  Or the Ogres north of Hillsbrad?
---
I never said you did. You asked for opinions.
---
This is my opinion. I think I found the Holy Grail of fun while other people are doing it wrong. And therefore I have come here to guide people to the path of righteous fun.
---
Join the crusade now! Death to all guides!
---
also check my [Alliance 1-60 leveling guide](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/allyroute) plz.
---
If the hour or two you have a day is in one session, than  would say you could get most pre-raid BiS dungeon gear, and it would likely take less time than farming the gold to buy all of the best possible BoEs.
---

A quick search told me that the mac mini is not good for gaming due to its graphics chipset.  From the article I found:
---
"No discrete graphics option is available. That means you’re out of luck if you want to play even the least demanding 3D games."
---
Looking into a review of Intel chipsets, they agree that WoW is tough and that you'll need to run it on low settings, but that there will still likely be hiccups and stuttering because there is no dedicated video memory.

Not true at all lol undercity is always highly populated

You got a reply btw, check below

Then don't? You already look things up online just do you. If you don't want detailed information it'll be a little harder, but wowhead you can search the specific item, ability, etc and get what you need from comments generally.

Ahh, good to know.

Lots of druids tank/heal/dps in raids and have no problems. Don't listen to this guy.

I'm sure in the grand scheme of things, you're right.  But if you don't think there's thousands and thousands of players in the same boat, then would be wrong.

You absolutely shouldn't reset the servers we have now. People wont come back if they are going to lose all their progress. Hell if I knew I was going to lose my character at some point it would absolutely kill my drive to play.
---
Separate aeasonal servers going through the progression and then resetting? Maybe sure, but I feel like it would be like OSRS dead man mode seasons: not very popular without another incentive.
---
Shadowfang Keep. A beautifully designed instance with a great story and progression with maybe the best music in World of Warcraft.

Lol go to that recent post about what race/class is always KOS for you and suddenly every possible combination "are all dicks."

There's 0 fucking chance this guy isn't the same guy as the other guy who posted this same shit with allen in his reddit name.  Should ban both of them if he's going to use multiple accounts to self promote
---
I tried Felwood earlier this week for the Elementals and Satyrs, thinking I'll farm my own Fel Cloth. Between the ganks, the packed camps, the competition, it sucked.
---
Everybody forgets about Blasted Lands because there's almost no quests there. the NW Ogres can be cleared, then you go to the Southern Cave Ogres, and back north for respawns. NW Ogres have 1x Solid chest that has ALWAYS appeared when I showed up, which is nice for a free green. Conversely, the cave on the East side near Kirith has a TON of mobs and 1x or 2x Chest spawns inside.
---
I like sheeping Alliance when they are low on health and then wanding them. I'd say about 1/4 understands I was trying to help them. The other 3/4 I can easily get away from as a mage so it's not a huge deal.
---
Using the debuff slot for something that is actually useful and does damage. As a tank you don't need the boss to hit you 10% slower, they die in under a minute anyways. It costs 20 Rage and you can't even use it in defensive stance, its a complete waste of rage and global cooldown.
---
Lets say the boss auto attacks once in two seconds  and the fight lasts a full minute, thats 30 auto attacks to the tank. Now, add thunderclap to the equation, the boss auto attacks once in 2.2 seconds. That is 27.2 auto attacks a minute. You have therefore managed to two full auto attacks. That is negligible, bosses in classic, except a few, hit like wet noodles anyways. As I said, just remove it from your bars
---
Now that, I can believe!
---
And in a retail world where that isn't even 2 weeks of game time, 60k for a long out of print TCG item with maybe 500 left unlearned on the whole planet is the most insane deal in history.
---
Like taking a 3 day dump.
---
So is it BIS for you now then too?
---
I don't know...I got really drunk one night and a ?? Alliance druid decided to mess with me and probably ended up following me around and killing everything I tagged for a couple hours. EXP was pretty nice.
---
I think the server sub Reddit’s are more active than the wow forum servers. Might try there. Or ask around there. “Hey I’m this level/class/spec looking for a guild that has play times around X time of day”
---
I think my guild depends on who you ask. We're the biggest alliance guild on the server so there's been some ups and downs.
---
For the people who hit 60 in the first 3-4 weeks it's great, we're clearing MC and ony in 3 separate 40 man raids in a little over 2 hours every week. For those who hit 60 later... maybe less so. Initially the plan was to rotate people in and out so everyone who wanted to raid got to raid but it turned out that was easier said than done. People started settling into their raiding groups, building up their DKP, collecting tier pieces so rotating fresh 60s with some pre-bis and 0 dkp into existing groups has provided some challenges. It takes a long time to get enough people to create another raid group where all the standbys get to play on an even playing field and because most people are playing dps classes we've had quite a few people leave because they haven't gotten to raid.
---
For me personally who hit 60 pretty early and has gotten to raid from the first raid it's been mixed. It's a great group of guys and girls and the raiding is a lot of fun including the walk through BRM with 120 people plowing through any horde guild trying to gank us, but after however long classic has been out now we're definitely approaching the "lazy" phase. Less and less people want to run dungeons, no one wants to PvP for the hell of it until p2 and outside of raiding it's mostly just talk in gchat while everyone goes about their business.
---
Yeah that should be easily accomplished. Just make sure you look around the major cities for quests as you level up as well . I went to about mid 30s no addons and rarely using the internet as a resource. I found myself asking people in game for completing quests. Or if you see someone let to do quest ask them where they got it if you can't find it. It will be slower but more rewarding in some regards, good luck!
---
Hmm strange. I have AtlasLoot and it doesn’t do this.  I’ll look around the settings. Thanks!
---
I would say never admit you’re a new player to people you don’t know, or don’t have some kind of rapport with. When you tell people you’re new it immediately colors the attitude of the group towards you in one way or another. They might not say, but they’ll be looking to criticize you to help offer “constructive criticism” which can very quickly breakdown into outright rudeness. 
---
Personally if I was new to a dungeon I’d do my best to stay close to someone who you know knows where to go, and follow in their exact footsteps to prevent anyone from suspecting I don’t know where to go.
---
As far as if you forget to dismiss your pet and you pull and wipe people just apologize and say you were too quick and that you forgot. As long as you only forget the one time people will usually look past that. I mean even vets make mistakes sometimes right? Once you tell people you’re new though and you do something like that people take a bigger issue because they think that is what you’ll be doing the whole run. 
---
FAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT! Classic example of this is last night in MC I was healing as a Druid and I started lagging badddd 3 bosses in. It was a pug tho so I didn’t tell anyone because I didn’t want to get kicked for bad internet, and we downed 3 more bosses and saved the rest for the next night. Nobody knew I was lagging my ass of and my healing had been basically cut in half. Still got 2 epics &lt;3.
---
I would do it all again yes, but I see no reason to do it on the same toon twice. There are other things in wow that I enjoy MORE.
---
problem is you have to be battle stance to use it, most of the time you dps in beserker stance, so that macro would help in the low levels, it wouldn't help after he gets zerker stance.
---
&gt; Alliance propaganda!
---
Nah, it's a horde to horde PSA.
---
Want alliance to murder in P2? Simple! The less Alliance you mercilessly gank now, the more likely you'll have more Alliance to mercilessly gank in P2.
---
pwned
---
Yes. Up until now I was using worse alternatives, just because this is a BoE epic that costs several hundred gold and when I first hit 60 I couldn't spare that kind of expense.
---
Yeah, for me it was always like a game to see how long I could go without returning to town. A pretty natural phenomenon IMO.
---
I’m on Incendius and I always see tons of players around the world. Unfortunately there seem to be more Horde than Alliance but I hear it’s relatively balanced.
---
Btw what he effectively did was get you to unlist it from the auction house for 3 days while he tries to sell his at a different (higher) price without competition.
---
If someone wants you to c.o.d. something expensive just tell them it's waiting for them in the auction house.
---
US/EU/other?
---
I ll add to the list as an option. Thanks
---
Drive them from your lands and hear the lamentation of their women.
---
You just cleared up so much confusion that I've had while working with transmogs and that set.
---
Yeah that's how it is for retail. Not sure why classic logs isn't able to differentiate.
---
Look out guys, got a woke fam over here
---
What are the best ways to look for a guild that has a profile aligned with mine?
---
Ohh okay sorry I was confused cause I thought the ring wasn’t BIS until later phases haha. I misread your first comment. 
---
Definitely expensive and grats on the item!
---
Ashenvale!
---
They should've only made RP servers for the snowflake generation. And also paid level boost.
---
So then, 4g off? Do 3 quests and go buy it :)
---
you could probably sell gorosh arena IDs for decent chunk (I would have paid 15g-20g, probably more for the ID regardless of drop, or 300g+ if payment is conditional on drop)
---
just use the spot in the southwest outer edge of the arena to avoid aggro (the one you use when someone walks up the wrong side of the arena stairs and pulls entire spectator crowd). donated away about 7 ogre sashes this way (almost half to randoms in LFG) while 2 manning arena with warrior + priest
---
&gt;I do not believe in 5 years classic will be active   
---
Private vanilla servers have been a thing since wotlk. **TEN** years and trust me, some servers are/were not as good as what you are playing right now. You have literally already been proven wrong. People like playing vanilla and are fine with it having a "finite lifecycle".
---
&gt; I mail almost twenty people a day
---
How much $ you selling 100 gold for ?
---
Not in classic. With wotlk.
---
I thought it was 100g?
---
90g for mount and 10g for training?
---
Incendius best realm!
---
Maybe after I grind 240 engineering and make one I’ll find out and report back. I’d imagine if you could have two someone would be doing it already.
---
Play more hours per day than he does, play with intention and decided before hand what you want to accomplish, whether it be questing (get an addon), dungeon grinding, or just grinding mobs, whatever you choose, maximize you XP gains.
---
I have a friend that complains that he is getting left behind, we both play a few hours a night.  He logs in and spends 15 minutes browsing the AH, 10 minutes jumping around Org, travels to a zone, does a quest, flies somewhere else, gets ganked, decides to try another zone, does a quest or two, flies back to Org to jump around. Dont be that guy
---
Leveled from 55-60 at Hearthglen in wpl. Not many people there; just watch out for the elites and pats
---
Getting exclusive pick over drops is something that can't be understated.  Not to mention the money from getting every blue from a boss.
---
It took me way too long to realize this wasn't about Call of Duty...
---
There's a new bot named Orca that can grind 1-60. I've seen a few people using it on my server, none banned yet.
---
Just saw the epic book drop off the demon boss in DM:E last night.
---
I mean getting from 21 - 40 is not too hard and I could do it quick enough. Especially for a long term benefit. I was more or less just throwing that out there.
---
It was changed in 1.10 to not work with melee, at the same time the crit sharpening stones were changed to not work with ranged.
---
I haven't tested the scope, but I know the stones don't work for ranged, so I expect that the scope doesn't work for melee.
---
Ironforge, because you can have entire battles happening in the pit with people completely unaware above.
---
No, the fix was to keep Solenoid from resetting if you don't hit him every 5 sec and attacking him adds didn't count. That is a bug.
---
Changing a fight that has been the same way for 15 years is not "No changes".
---
I play Kromkrush Alliance, but obviously can't make opposite faction on same realm
---
My point was, even if you heal, it doesn't do enough because the enemy won't even be dead before you run out of mana because the dps is trash. That is, if the enemy is even three levels higher or two enemies 1 or 2 levels higher before 40ish?
---
Kind of more referring to how can we play together now ... level gap considered
---
So the joke is they both have morbidly long hogs?
---
Didn't. Fuck.
---
Server discords are a great place.
---
Also, try your realm forums.
---
&gt; Its annoying that people choose their faction simply because of racials, thats how we get the imbalance on servers =/ i personally have played horde since vanilla and never changed because i think they look cooler and are more intresting :D
---
Sounds like you chose your faction simply based on racials.
---
Looks = racials, as each race looks different. (Captain Obvious!)
---
I got that Fire Resist trinket for lv38 for a whopping 36s. I’m sure the seller was not pleased to see they goofed listing it
---
You need to re-read your reference bro, what he’s saying is crits have no implicit extra threat simply for being a crit; it’s still a 1 damage:1 threat ratio. You can see this in action SUPER easily almost every pull in a dungeon or raid - throw 3 shadowbolts at the tanks target, and in situations where 2 or 3 of them crit you’ll 100% pull aggro. No crits and the tank will hold it just fine assuming he’s not somehow missing everything!
---
We definitely do this
---
I wanted them all to be locked away!
---
Do them anytime you teleport, cast a portal, or hearth then.  The rate mages sell portals, you’ll be in shape in no time
---
You're in a tough spot as a warlock since you can't slow the mobs at all but I recommend finding elites your level and soloing them. If you do full damage you'll get full XP from the mob. If your friend helps it will reduce the XP you receive, even when out of party.
---
Have your friend just heal you and buff you but not hit the elite.
---
same boat here for might belt and bracers
---
If it helps, you are not adding what poison procs occur on that attack as well, nor are you counting what perdition blade fire procs you get from that extra attack.
---
You can certainly take this route, but the culture of the game and its community isn't really on board with that approach.
---
If you're dead set on simply learning from the game and the in-game community only, I would suggest maybe fielding more questions to in-game you're friends with. Maybe join a casual social guild oriented towards new players,  if you haven't. There's nothing wrong with asking if someone's willing to answer some questions for you in a busy city or trade, if you're wondering about something more in-depth, I suppose. 
---
Personally, though, I think it's helpful to at least research information about your character on a technical level (spec, rotation, general advice, etc). Then just do as you please, don't follow leveling guides, and don't look up quest info. It should still be immersive and community oriented with minimal ALT+TABing, if that's what you're interested in.
---
Most got a C&amp;D from Blizzard, but I guess that doesnt fit your narrative.
---
Probably a combination of both. That's why I'm trying to see where it dropped - even if it's a really low drop rate, if it's an activity I can stomach then I may spend some time doing it to see what happens.
---
Fuck no, my dice are terrible.
---
They are KoS for me as well! It was the leper gnome costume.
---
I just googled that build. Looks like the big tradeoff is losing holy shock to gain blessing of sanctuary, is that right? Is blessing of sanctuary that good for AoE grinding? If so I might change my spec to that. I levelled ret and am now holy and the slow kill speed is indeed frustrating.
---
Do you guys just swim the lava or run the whole thing?
---
\&gt; Stop ganking us or we will quit. I personally almost quit this week over the terrible sportsmenship Horde players show on my server. 
---
LOL BYE
---
Yes, yes you do
---
my guild asked me to come raid on my (now) alt feral druid, so they dont have to disenchant the druid t1.
---
Exactly
---
The gnomes one is capable of measuring the exact temperature. Propably has other tools as well. Like a pickaxe, a screwdiver, extansion-rod, firestone, a jewelers kit and highspeed mode.  
---
The taurens is just.. massively huge and long and propably hairy. Very very hairy. Like hagrid.
---
you have filthy gnomes, THEREFORE we are superior
---
Only if
---
Pagle is a Nice sever for Ally, but is a non PvP sever, many guilds are good and the community is very nice, high population. And a lot of streamers plays in the Pagle.
---
Yeah I feel like what some tanks fail to understand is that even if a mob is non-elite and doesn’t do enough damage to kill me, the actual problem is that I’m taking a shitload of spell pushback. If it takes me 6 seconds to cast a healing spell because you couldn’t be arsed to touch the mob that was hitting me your happy ass is probably gonna die.
---
Yes, just start at one end, stop and fish for a while at the other end after each pass, and remember to buy a bunch of nightcrawlers before you leave.
---
If you are max lvl fishing though i would go to south dustwallow marsh and kill dragonlings and crocolisks there though for skinning
---
If you're looking for something less major than ElvUI, NeatPlates is very well put together and will accomplish what you're looking for as well as update the unit frames a bit to help with threat! [Screenshots](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/neatplates/screenshots) here if you want to take a look, either way, happy hunting!
---
Not gonna lie. Its a legitimate job skillset.
---
Ironforge.  Nothing screams classic experience like falling into the canal.
---
Yeah I don't think that's an honest answer. You for sure would not grind out 900g for a mount and then give it away and do it again because it was so much fun.
---
greys sell well, and save Elemental Earths which will be 4g+ each once AQ comes out
---
I was there for vanilla, nearly addicted at the time as I was on most of every day for freaking years- cost me a relationship even, so I’d remember if it was a “thing”.   It wasn’t.   In fact, if anyone had tried this crap, they’d have been blacklisted so fast you’d have them rerolling in a week.
---
&gt; I'm gonna camp alliance scum until they quit. I'm going to win world of warcraft by making it so no alliance are left.
---
Just roll a PVE server then, So intent on making your server a giant carebear realm, Just skip the chase and get to the meat.
---
if u have your 7 quintessence it should be about 2hrs 3hrs if you keep wiping and two shotting bosses
---
Of course I have source: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/hnewman/2019/08/26/warcraft-classic-layering-and-realm-queues-ion-hazzikostas-explains-why-youre-waiting-to-log-in/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hnewman/2019/08/26/warcraft-classic-layering-and-realm-queues-ion-hazzikostas-explains-why-youre-waiting-to-log-in/)
---
I'll quote the exact parts for you as well:
---
 **Hazzikostas:..."** I think server capacity was  something like 3,000 concurrent logins by late Classic. "
---
**Newman:** How big is a single layer? What's the end target you're shooting for, for each server?
---
**Hazzikostas:** Each layer is effectively going to be what a healthy server was at launch in 2004 in terms of the number of people it holds.
---
As for when they "increased server size", I refer back to my original comment, they're never operating at the peak technical load of the server, only their own \*\*enforced\*\* cap. If that's at 9k (3 layers) and they increase it to 12 or 15k, that just means adding on layers. The size of the individual layers has never changed, and 3k is what it will be when P2 launches. 
---
QED shutting down layers gives more queues.
---
Because managing 15 fury warriors doing the DPS of 40 DPS in Vanilla isn’t hard and the content at this point doesn’t really have any insanely hard mechanics.
---
Yeah, I have the same problem. I have whirlwind on 2 and overpower on 3 in both battle and zerker which is what I used to switch them until now. (developed very pve dps centric keybinds this time around, was dungeoning a lot with a tank friend)
---
took me 140+ UBRS to get TS after loosing 12-15. In that time, only every saw 1 MH drop.
---
🦀Authenticator delay may actually be coming🦀
---
Grinding is more XP efficient than questing.  It’ll make you a decent amount of money too.  But it’s boring and monotonous.
---
I lost eye of divinity to a 58 priest our guild decided to invite cuz we wanted to make it a complete 40 man guild run
---
Is that ferelas happened to me with the wolves
---
this is the way to enjoy wow
---
Good screen shot.
---
Thanks for this. Didnt want to install something as intrustive as titan panel.
---
Where's my glorious graph with that gorgeous line inching its way to the upper right?
---
This is the only correct answer
---
Oooh you're right! Totally spaced
---
Solid stone and elemental earth sell for quite a bit on the ah, and the greys are decent to vendor. It's around 25g/hr if nobody is around and you can kill stuff quickly.
---
Oh I didn't even realize it wasn't stock haha. I was just trying to poke fun because I thought you'd missed it
---
That. Nost had a couple thousands. Classic has millions spread over different continents.
---
They need to offer Normal, PvP, RP, RP-PVP.
---
They scale at a completely different level then a private server.
---
Solving scalability issues takes time and skill. Typing a Reddit post saying something is unacceptable takes a fucking crybaby that probably hasn't produced anything valuable for society ever.
---
Sorry....I'm mad cause I'm dealing with a scalability issue at work.
---
Give [https://wowclassicpopulation.com/](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/) a view, it could help narrow down your picks. Take the realms with a grain of salt however, some servers aren't as frequently scanned as others. Best of luck!
---
I installed this yesterday, and it's great, it summarises the looking for group mess/spam into an easily readable format. You can see what's been going on ( and when) at a glance. It will also filter by dungeon so you only see the ones you're interested in.
---
I’m talking about these servers progressing content wise, but then having reset servers become available for people who want to play through vanilla again and again.
---
I play on kromcrush also - libram the holy pally here if you recognize that name by any chance!
---
Ahhh that one hurts my soul. I feel your pain :(
---
Besides FCing druids are good at anchoring bases in AB and AV. They are serviceable pocket healers for warriors in small scale engagements (using your CC to slow the kill target and interrupt an enemy healer)
---
They are not good healbots. If you want to stand and turret out heals reroll.
---
Not sure about the rest of my server, but I eat well, don't smoke, and get regular health checkups and a flu shot every year.
---
Don't listen to this man, I grinded my horde tauren warrior to 60 with no dungeon grind. Of course I did dungeons, but only to knock out all the relevant quests in one go. Were some quests impossible without help? Yep. Could I fight more than 3 mobs at a time anywhere near my level, nope. Do I feel like a real man now that my warrior is 60? Hell ya. I even beat my friend who was a priest, another friend who was a mage, and another shaman. All who played about similar time as me. Do they suck? Maybe. Keep in mind, I never played retail. They all did. I just jumped in with zero knowledge and made it happen. Do note however, you will be asking strangers frequently for help, but they almost always help. It's great!
---
I'm pretty sure Blizzard strategically plants unkillable mobs like this around the world as traps for people running bots. 
---
I've been wandering around and seen 2-3 players smacking the same mob like this for extended periods of time.
---
This is more sad than those african starving children videos.  If you're happy though, all the power to you and grats.  Quite impressive.
---
Yes, that’s true. I simply wouldn’t recommend an 8-hour window. It’s easy lose discipline with a larger window.
---
the thing is that aoe farming can only be done where there are no casters so that leaves sooo many other options whereas i have to bounce between like 3 places or spam LFG
---
I play horde on Venoxis. Its PvP.  
---
I account for the smaller alliance population.  
---
I dont hunt down alliance that are questing or doing some farming.  
---
I do engage in combat if they attack me, or if I see someone of my faction being ganked.  
---
If a lowlvl character really engages me or tries to fight me. I dot him up. If he survives, he lives another day. If he die, its his own fault for putting a freezing trap underneath me, when I literally only want to hearth away.
---
Did you just tell me to roll on a pve server because I said I'm gonna pvp so hard that all opposition quits the game?  Way to totally miss the point
---
I plan to this weekend.  I finally got both my characters to lvl 60 with enchanted pre-bis so I can pull the throttle back on wow for a while.  The first two months of a server are always a grind.  Glad this one is behind me finally.
---
Because they have to upload a video of the entire run.
---
Feel free to preclear as many mobs as you like, but your run will be auto dq'd before it has a chance to be added to the leaderboard.
---
Everybody who's into speed running raids knows the location of each mob and how many there are. You can't just snipe a surger or a firelord and expect people not to notice.
---
Nice, Even better. o7
---
I think the two best balanced realms with high pop are Zandalar Tribe and Mograine.
---
The guild is such great guys though. I raged logged after that. Logged back on next day and GM asked if everything was alright and they were worried, kinda felt like a dick after that lol
---
I used to work for a firm who recruited several employees through Eve Online. One of those hirees was entry level with very little experience.
---
Play more than 30 mins a day
---
On my hunter i'm killing mobs my level in less than 20 seconds with 15 seconds downtime every 10 mobs. Its all about which class you are.
---
Yes, and all sharing resources, sharing zones, sharing all those spell effects and shit in the same area, etc etc.
---
Localized heavy strain has an impact.  I’m not savvy enough to go into it well, but that’s about it in a nutshell.
---
For me, as enhance I don’t even stop to drink at all most of the time. If I’m just farming something, my “downtime” is just me not casting any spells and relying purely on windfury autoattacks until my mama replenishes
---
We're just sending retailers back home before phase 2, I like to support blizzard products that way
---
It kind of is.  Stephen Gillett is now CEO of Googles security offshoot Chronicle and put WoW on his resume.  
---
https://money.cnn.com/2014/06/19/technology/world-of-warcraft-resume/index.html
---
LoL it’s the same thing as world pvp you should always make sure you’re being safe/cautious when farming it’s all free game baby. Nice video
---
Couldn't find a dungeon group as a WARRIOR? Hmmm
---
Running two accounts I’m about to start this with my 20 warlock and my 60 druid, group up all the mobs with the Druid but not tagging them, throw a hot then start rain of fire, use demo roar to keep aggro on the bear.
---
For my warrior and rogue alts on the second account I just used the Druid for heals and let the melee alts chain pull with no down time.  Do all this out of group for full xp.  Step in group for quests that are elite or more efficient to just slam through with the 60, and it’s very fast.
---
AllTheThings does this.
---
Cross your fingers for next week!!
---
Yeah they’ve ranged from 75s to 5g on Kromkrush over the last few weeks. Normally sitting around 3G.
---
There’s a lava run to angerforge?
---
I see it pretty often
---
It was definitely nice having the 160 or 165 goggles before lvl 20.  I think i made them somewhere around 14 or 16...not going to complain about 8 stam at that level lol
---
That's what I figured lol. Ty
---
Did you get to a weapon trainer to learn the weapon skill ?
---
Hey nice editing :) Do you have a guide how to chain the animations in Modelviewer?
---
it was enough time, its not now. too few servers , with too many people going for it
---
i hit rank 14 with less time played with that but was on a smaller server and our farm group set caps low enough that we basically we done farming honor by the weekend
---
Same.  I have guildies worried that there's always a rogue ready to backstab them in any contested area and they might die. I'm used to being cloaky camped in my pocket while flying a rorqual in a game with severe death penalties. The loss of 3-5 minutes of gameplay in wow is nothing.
---
Can now confirm that you must grind mobs to level pet. Standing in down did not work.
---
Have you trained for that weapon type yet at a trainer?  Pretty sure you just start with daggers and have to pay a special sword trainer to use em.
---
Instead of dismissing i put it on stay and out range it. Doesnt seem to get the decressed happiness.
---
Have to learn weapon proficiencies from the cities. Rogues start with daggers.
---
Check your settings since there is a setup for improved graphics quality. Maybe thats what you are using. Not sure which one was the default at classic launch but I had to change that too.
---
That’s a good call. Fortunately I don’t need brd anymore so if I run it I would be helping someone there who needs it.
---
Don't listen to the alliance babes about herod. Sure we outnumber them, but if you spend any time PvPing in BRM or DM you know there are some hardcore bad boy alliance who will own you without hesitation. Have no mercy, if they don't want world pvp they shouldn't have come to Herod and if getting owned makes them quit then they shouldn't been playing classic
---
So your point is that private servers didnt have as many people. Okay.
---
You will need to go to Undercity and speak to the Weapon Master to train you in the use of swords.
---
Yes the items you have get more valuable but the items you want to buy from that gold will get just as expensive.
---
Inflation and all
---
Pretty much.
---
Is there any blue post out there addressing server imbalance with the removal of layering? Not sure if something can even be done but it’s been apparent since the first week some servers are extremely favored one way or the other which isn’t great for either side. The removal of layering has just magnified it. I’m currently on Kirtonos as Alliance and it already felt overwhelming while we still had layering.
---
You get a 10 percent discount if you are honored with the faction you're going to buy the mount from.  
---
Most people are just from doing the starting quests.
---
&gt;It's not viable in PvE.
---
People have done mc with 20 people. you could be a druid hitting the mobs with a staff and no talent points spent and still clear mc.
---
Yeah I was super bitter about the rep changes.  All that work only to have Blizz throw it back in our faces and make it so much easier for everyone else.
---
You don't hold your beer mug like that. One does give the beer a friendly Handshake and ain't holding it so awkwardly.
---
Alliance on Bigglesworth and it's starting to feel pretty awful. For a few days I haven't been able to make any progress questing because I keep getting ganked by higher level players. I've gotten a few bars of xp over several hours and I'm starting to feel pretty frustrated. If it keeps up, I think I'll probably transfer somewhere else.
---
Jump down at the dark iron anvil and swim a little ways fight a few fire elementals you come up past the council fight. Then you just gotta get through the hall of a billion fucking dwarves. This is also the fast way to get your shard for MC attunement.
---
&gt;It's not viable in PvE, but they're fine in wPvP.
---
Care to elaborate? I know one of the common knocks against Crit-chickens is they go OOM during long fights..
---
But aren't boss fights super short now? Like 1-2 min, with top end guilds operating a full MC in under 30 minutes with sub 20 second bosses?
---
And with Dark Runes, mana potions, etc... is running out of mana during "long fights" really a concern for boomies anymore?
---
Like, is it a valid one?
---
Boomies are mana-inefficient - that is a fact. All you have to do is a bit of math to show that per mana point spent, they are going to do less damage over time.
---
But at this point, is this still something that is keeping this meme spec off the table?
---
Methinks... no. Be your boomkin self. Best dance in the game, and that's good enough for a lot of us.
---
Yeah I'm glad I have access to 2% hit on trinket. I eventually want to switch to daggers because swords are boring and IMO don't make me feel like a rogue, and this trinket will help bridge the hit cap quite easily.
---
Save them until nexus crystals are in the game
---
Can you feed them the apples from the hallows event?
---
Free action potions last a long time.
---
I feel like 40 60s could clear mc without spending any of their talent points
---
Felt the same. Who gives a shit. Quality post right there
---
Ty
---
Spellshock leggings can easily be on any list of rarest BOE also.
---
Oh for real? Where can I see that/where is it mentioned? Appreciate it - I would've been pissed if I grinded that rep for nothing.
---
So he gets the 1g back every 15 days?  Nice...
---
What's a decent spot for a Warlock to grind at lvl 45?
---
Preferably not super contested
---
Bro if you haven't gate-camped in low-sec star systems in EVE Online and ransomed the poor sucker coming through by warp scrambling them until they pony up the ISK, you haven't lived
---
Yeah lol raid probably saved me from that
---
Stormwind. Just a great city, and a really cool place to experience and run around in.
---
It's for checking if Jed Runewatcher has spawned in UBRS
---
/target Jed
---
Im debating transferring. Im from rattlegore and don't get me wrong I love the server, everyone is super chill and I think the faction balance is even. But it just feels dead to me
---
Paladin tank, wearing a dress.
---
You look treefic.
---
Oh that’s the thing I don’t use any addons for that. I still use the default portraits and nameplates for everything. I mean I have classic cast bars that puts the enemy cast bar under their name plate, but that’s it. Otherwise it’s all default
---
Ya huh
---
Any variable can be minimised as long as the other variables take up the slack, throwing Dynamite or holy water on these large trash packs makes it less likely to need "oh shut" measures from dps and healers.
---
It might be zpearl
---
Yeah right, just 2 mob groups before the final boss.
---
We did our first guild hosted PUG this week and successfully recruited 4 or 5 new players. Next week we're going in to MC with 34 guildies and we're going to do great! I did an lot more raid leading than I intended but I really enjoy being the "face" of the guild, doing recruitment, PR stuff, and putting a positive spin on wipes as an iterative learning process. It's doing well, but I would wish we could be a bit more organized (other officers step up).
---
The weighing procedure is the same, get a good scale though, cheap ones are innacurate.
---
That sucks. At least it's not really BiS stuff.
---
I'm not a fan, but I do respect that he gets to earn a living doing whatever he wants.
---
It is funny that he's so successful that the internet thinks that wow and asmond are the same thing
---
Nope. I've done that to cancel an auction where somebody was the high bidder on a vendor green for 1s, and it vendors for 1g.
---
Dude, 20 pounds is a hell of a lot! Go pick up a 20 pound weight and walk around with it for a little bit if you don't believe me! You have every right to be proud of it :D
---
The starting point is kind of arbitrary. It's not any more or less fair to anybody where the starting point is inside of Molten Core so long as everybody follows the same rule set.
---
Initial threat is very important for warriors, I use dynamite basically every run I do. If dense dynamite is too expensive then I'd recommend solid, which is slighty worse but still highly useful. It can make runs go far more smoothly, particularly in Strat and just about any DM wing
---
Tclap is garbage for threat and you should not be using that for AoE threat, if anything it's actually better on single targets that hit harder and slower and only for the debuff and only if you can spare it. Demo shout should be used primarily for the damage reduction and for AoE threat you should be using Battle Shout, which generates far more threat as long as your allies are in combat and in range of it. On large packs I'll usually charge in, shield bash a caster, group them up, dynamite, spam battle shout and rage dump with cleave, tossing a sunder or two on elites and tabbing between them for white hits. Engineering is very good all around, some even call it almost necessary for tanks.
---
Don't feel bad - you've trained it to survive in a world which would otherwise kill it mercilessly again and again and again. Once you let them free, they will never be seen again, safe from all the players hunting them for their fur, teeth, eyes, etc.
---
Elemental Fires are going up due to Greater Fire Protectiom Potions being necessary for the current raid tier every week as well as there only being a few places to farm them.  On high pop unlayered servers like mine elemental fires are already up to 3.5g a pop, 4g+ on tuesday.
---
You can. Not really fair to the bidder but that's how the system works.
---
Shit gms are shit
---
Str gives 2 AP to all physical classes except rogues where it gives 1 AP
---
14 AP = 1 weapon DPS
---
AGI:
---
For warrior/paladin/shaman it gives chance to crit, for rogue/druid(in cat form) it gives chance to crit + 1 AP, and for hunter it gives 2 ranged AP + chance to crit. The agi needed for 1% crit depends on the class though and it's hard to say how much value you should give 1% crit.
---
Not sure but I use shadowpanther.net
---
UD Strat, as with all dungeons, is better when we are all on the same page. As a tank, that whole place is a break LoS fest. There really shouldn't be any problem holding aggro if you take the pulls correctly.
---
Someone told me that you can enchant any level gear. Thanks for the gnomergon advice.
---
Was your group a bit dickish in their criticism? Yes. Is responding to criticism with "I'm a shit tank" acceptable? No. It's a defeatist attitude, and implies that you have no interest in improving. 
---
A lack of experience is one thing, an unwillingness to learn is unacceptable.
---
&gt;Basically, ERP software are there to replace all of the middle-management job

Did you enchant his chest yet Fletch?
---
Need an answer soon, this is important.
---
Hijacking the thread! Is there any way to grt Elvui to display my partys mana? I only get their HP bar and its quite annoying to tank when I cant see their mana.
---
I bur'd

I know you can move them by default, but when I moved mine using leatrix, they stayed in place.  Try that.  Or I think there is an addon called 'move anything', same principle.

It dropped for me on a boss my 1st run through DM:E.
---
Tarren Mill
---
My guild worked out great! It's a banking guild, so I only ginvite obvious bank alts, I have about 12 members, and no one is ever on. Perfection.
---
Took me 150 runs exactly, lost it 4x previous f huntards
---
Where do you see the happiness meter or w/e is called?
---
Neither does anyone else, but that’s the new blizzard.
---
As I tank I despise mages so I only do anything but mages 
---
My favorite is 
---
DPS
---
Paladin Ret 
---
Feral Druid (or) warlock wit imp out 
---
Hunter or  rogue
---
Healer 
---
Holy Paladin
---
Tank (me) 
---
Warrior 
---
 👌 those auras Ret + devotion  and either IMp’s fire shield or Druid’s thorns  
---
 And traps from hunter or saps from rogues 
---
Not to mentions the Paladins can buff as well as the lock or the druid ! Who needs a mage except for water
---
It's felt fair to me and I'm having fun. Lots of fighting but only a couple assholes trying to camp here and there.
---
Anyone know best way to get rep with Darkspear Trolls? Really want a raptor for my forsaken.
---
I feel cheated by not looking stuff up.  All the content I missed by not having questie for the first two weeks was insane.  This game was so poorly designed  in various ways that I feel zero regrets looking stuff up constantly.
---
"BRO FUCKING TAUNT"
---
I do this with weights, alternating leg day, upper body, and a rest day. I have a nice home gym so just go push out a set (sometimes two) during long delays in WoW. I work out more total than doing a whole 30-45 minutes uninterrupted because I end up doing lots and lots of sets just to fill time.
---
One day I did like ten fairly heavy sets of squats throughout the day until I had to stop because my legs felt like jelly. The next day I could barely walk.
---
Ok thanks brother I’ll check that out
---
You're that guy? Well, 'that guy,' you know what is delicious? A Chicken Egg and Cheese Sandwich. Yes, I will take the unfertilized embryo on top of its dead mother, cover it with fermented cow milk, and enjoy myself immensely, thank you.
---
Social engineering. The weakest link in any security system is the meatbag operating it.
---
The problem isn't even going OOM, they just do really poor dps regardless.
---
Shammy shield + https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17780/blade-of-eternal-darkness
---
Boars and bear make for great eat everything pets.
---
Cats are also great because they eat fish, and fish is very very easy to get.
---
It's a cheeky way to level melee weapon skills, since the mob keep triggering evade then resets, it can never die so you can just semi-afk level your weapon skill to max.
---
If they are doing this you should see them take a couple steps back then heal up to full then start again.
---
cod means cash on delivery. you click the button when you mail items and then set the amount of gold they have to pay to receive the items. then you get the gold
---
A lot of the time in pvp you are relying on instant casts and have sparing openings for full casts because X class can lock you out of that tree if you get interrupted casting
---
What, you don't like the bosses that are literally 4 reskins of the tens of other druids you're fighting the entire dungeon? What's wrong with you?!
---
The garrison didn't actually require much time or effort unless you were taking a "clear the board" approach which was completely unnecessary. You could skip all of the garrison stuff you didn't feel like doing except for the legendary story quests. The world quest system (combined with the need for artifact power/azerite) has been considerably worse as far as daily chores go. They are the most efficient path to increasing your character's strength so it's hard to justify skipping them.
---
Not available
---
That is useful but I don’t think my pets ability’s show up in the spell book do they?
---
Actual zone: Silverpine Forest. I love the creepy dismal setting.
---
Non-actual zone: A few guildies figured out how to load into the unmade TBC area’s. We used to go there a lot and explore what we could. It was surreal. Until we were finally caught and the loading entrance was patched out. That would be my actual favorite place in Vanilla.
---
First aid and buying food as you need will be all you need for leveling.
---
Tanks should not be using that dagger, bis is the fist weapon. We aren't comparing dagger vs sword rogue, we are comparing fury vs any rogue and right now fury is much, much higher. They are the best dps. There is also more loot to go around for rogues such as tier. Really other than weapons fury really only get a belt and ring out of MC and its off Rag and most tanks will need the ring first.
---
Next add some arrows too.
---
guess I will have to double check and adjust our raiding schedule then. We have plans to do onyxia days every Sunday and Wednesday, and if it was every 4 days then it wouldnt be so bad and we would have a wednesday skip every 7 onyxia runs, but if it is every 5 days then that means we would need to skip 2 weeks in a row to keep our lockout schedule
---
Could someone give a simple explanation between the advantages and disadvantages of all the AH Addons? I haven't used any since Vanilla and am not sure what would work best for me. Currently only level 36 so I just need something that can reliably tell me vendor price, AH price, and DE price so I know what to vendor and what to sell. I'm not at the point where I'll be playing the AH or selling a lot of crafted items, etc.
---
I've looked at Auctioneer, Auctionator, TSM, Aux, and Auction Faster. 
---
Any advice on which would be best to use for simply knowing what to vendor vs sell vs DE?
---
I like the tooltips from Auctioneer and Auctionator a lot. I know I could just try them all out but was looking to get some first hand advice. Thanks!
---
Add them to your friend list or your guild to remove the warning.
---
People have been doing that since beta it was even done during that beta tournament by the tournament winner, if it was a bug blizzard would prolly have fixed it
---
Hi, /u/Letsrollablunt85

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dmjyac/stranglethorn_fishing/). 
---
I mean the teleport tree is fine since it repositions the flight master and boat way closer to Auberdine.
---
That set is garbage, dungeon blues are better. The +healing is low. The healing mace from BRD and the offhand from Dire Maul are worlds better, Finkles should be DE’d. Only good MC healing loot is the Cauterizing Band, Salamander Scale Pants, Aurastone Hammer and Wild Growth Spaulders.
---
Idk, kind of just makes you come across as an asshole who would hate someone for having insecurities.
---
yeah the tank was kind of downplaying his capabilities, but as a leveling tank myself, I feel for him. Tanks in classic are kind of fucked. People these days dont like to wait for sunders or even follow target markings before unleashing, so the tanks life is harder and a higher pressure job. And now they are forced into a complex rotation to maintain strong 3+ mob threat (some variation of: charge w/ 2H-&gt;SS-&gt;Bloodrage-&gt;zerker stance-&gt;zerker rage-&gt;WW--&gt;def stance-&gt;1h/shield) because everyone loves to AOE right away. Even 2 mobs isn't necessarily easy if the dps attacks the non-skull target right after I pull.
---
I stopped stressing and don't even put much effort into regaining threat from a dps who steals it. I only bust my taunts if a healer is taking damage.
---
Yeah, people weren't believing it when it was said that druids didn't have raid loot competition.
---
There are raids specifically looking to fill slots for the lesser picked classes to not waste loot, so getting a raid slot isn't even hard at this point.
---
Are you high? The standard rate on any goldselling site is like $45 for 100G.
---
You're essentially making $70 an hour playing WoW.
---
Feralas - once you hit 46 you can go to a cave in the Blasted Lands - it's on the left if you're heading south and coming in from Stonard (Horde) or due northwest of Nethergarde keep. It has humanoids in it and you'll never run of out mobs to kill if you're in there solo -- you can grind there until 50. The mobs drop mageweave, greys, greens, and then the fragments you can turn in at the badlands guy for Greens/blues.
---
I prefer to think of them as chicken periods
---
Wailing Caverns - fishing there is great
---
i'd stay and try to get a remote connection to get in queue so i can hop in straight from work 
---
i'm on a "high" pop server and it feels like it's already dying out slowly, less and less people on during the off times with only evenings being really active.
---
I love those gnome voices. Awesome vid!
---
Ah man sounded very much like a run I ended up tanking for on Thalnos lol.
---
Apologies, my google-fu failed me.
---
Your reference to meta-gaming seems on-point. Meta-gaming refers to obsessing over the rules of the game, and trying to find optimal strategies. 
---
"The meta" is the optimal way to play the game, according to some group of ~~idiots~~ players.
---
Why though? I actually have to make An effort and zoom in to Read now. while if he made the photo withhis phone hed make sure i could Read IT without effort
---
Yeah I bought the game to relax, but my personality just made me stress even more
---
You get a 10% discount if you’re honored with your home city (undead = undercity, in my case)
---
The Bloodvine garb set requires 300 tailoring work and since we will probably end up using that forever, I'd say keep it. I make ok money making a mooncloth bag every 4 days and i can normally sell 10-20 runecloth bags when I notice the price high enough.
---
What's been your favorite grinding spots previous couple levels? I'm 43 lock and about to grind some stuff out I think.
---
Western Plaguelands. I love the atmosphere and the history of it.
---
Man those set bonuses are ass.
---
Yeah it's really weird. So there are neutral blasted lands and BRD quests that send you there, but besides that there's three other quests. Makes it even weirder with the enormous night elf ruins, massive amounts of demons, Timbermaw Furbolgs, and Naga.
---
Push ups and sit ups (as stated in the OP) are basically negligible calorie burn--like 7 calories for 50 good push ups for the average person. Most people would think 50 is a lot of push ups for a day, but that's 1-2 baby carrots worth of calories. You lost no weight from it.
---
Trying to lose weight on exercise, particularly lifting, causes people to burn out and give up on weight loss because they think exercise is more important than anything else. But it requires huge time commitments to do. You have to be doing serious cardio to really put a dent into your caloric burn via exercise.
---
Want a guilt free Snicker bar? That's a *three mile* run for most people. Want to lose half a pound a week for a while without changing your diet? Run 2.5-3 miles every day or put in super intense weight training for an hour every day. Or just give up your 250 calorie afternoon snack and save yourself a huge time sink. (Note: Exercise has tons of other amazing health benefits--rapid, sustained weight loss just isn't really one of them.)
---
100% drop tailoring for engineering. Now is a good time with phase 2 coming in a little over a month.
---
Arathi raptors
---
Duskwood, the lore, the quests, how well the "mood" of the zone is set. I picked alliance because of duskwood.
---
BoE items approaching the end of level decades (17-19, 28-29, etc.) in general, and items like Underworld Band that give very unique stats for their level range. It would take a comprehensive bis list to be able to tell what things should actually be worth, but that's the idea.
---
which demon caused that much problem?
---
The best tanking weapon in game is Eskhandar's Right Claw. Quel'Serrar is a very good mitigation weapon, but the Claw is too good for threat which is very much needed.
---
Stealth opening is smooth-brain stuff. It's way more disrespectful to just concussive shot and walk away.
---
I am on a high/full pop server, and I only have this issue during dead times (mornings or post midnight). Otherwise, I have my level 38 tanked parked at SM and during peak times (6-7pm), it takes 15 min or less to find a group.
---
Make sure you are spamming /1 AND /4 (lookingforgroup).
---
Yeah the Forlorn Cavern is depressing.
---
I have no clue what relics are out there to be honest. I just know they drop when AQ comes out
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
I’m at 58. Every day I whisper to myself. Not today
---
Because there isn't a chosen specialization in Classic like in Retail. It's easy to say "Oh well if they use shred they are cat, maul they are bear, and starfire they are moonkin" but that isn't a perfect system and people can use it to cheese meters. Hell, I'm a Bear/Cat hybrid and on a lot of fights I'll use both maul and shred. I believe the developer is working on the algorithm to better detect the different specs but is focusing on getting speedruns completed as that was the previous metric used to compare guilds on the private server.
---
Instead they have a metric to determine if you are a tank (You take at least 20% of the total melee attacks in a fight) and otherwise you are considered DPS. On some fights I'm considered a DPS because we kill my add target first before it gets enough melees on me.
---
And if that is over populated, just about any mob in Hinterlands.
---
do this  /console cameraDistanceMaxZoomFactor 5
---
it lets your zoom your character out further than normal... and you can keep here in your sight by moving your camera around. Deep breaths are easily avoidable but it's good to have a raid leader call out her position and knowing that her sides during her position are safe -- so if she's north or south, her east and west will be safe, then so on and so forth. 
---
GL killing her =)
---
awesome work man, dont listen to the haters, they're just mad they will never have as much wealth
---
good luck on the grind OP, impressive work thus far!
---
So it's not calories in at the end of the day because people might eat too much, got it
---
Yes you got it. In other words, it's short hand for describing the community's consensus about what is optimal. In general when people talk about "meta" in reference to games, they're referring to optimal courses of play with the assumption other players are also aware of what's optimal.
---
An example would be, since we know that bosses are limited to 16 debuff slots, meta DPS specs are generally how you can maximize your DPS without using superfluous debuffs like bleeds.
---
Blizzard has never shown that they care about faction balance. To them, it's a source of additional revenue because they get paid transfers when people get fed up with the imbalance.
---
It's already pretty bad on several servers. When P2 hits it's going to be much worse.
---
Yes but if you bottom out on Mana, you will have to tap a few times times to re-coop. He's saying to tap every so often and not bottom out completely. That way healers don't need to panic as much. I've been in that boat several times where I don't know of the warlock somehow took aggro, or if they are trying to commit suicide for some Mana.
---
The long cast times become an issue in shorter fights so it's still not a great caster dps choice even then
---
Honestly I don't group with mages anymore. Too many shit ones so far while leveling.
---
Lvl 46 rogue and play with the same war tank, priest heal, and lock. Pug a 5th dps and I'll take anything over a mage. IDK if it's just my server but I think all the spellcleave farming makes them into shit teammates. Pulling extra packs and dying. Not making the healer mage water. Complaining that we are either not going fast enough or that we aren't waiting for them to drink. It's just not worth. Give me a Ret Pally, Hunter, Shadow Priest, druid, I don't care at all as long as you aren't a mage.
---
Also you can tell pretty quick in PvP who knows what they are doing and who just spellcleaved their levels because they heard mages we're good in classic.
---
Save your money. You can't double death ray as it shares a cooldown with itself.
---
You’re thinking of the wrong boss bud
---
I  actually am a warlock in classic lvl 60, mind letting me know what ability I could use? I haven't seen anything that would let me talk cross faction.
---
Let's say I fucked up and can't get the Spirit of Aquamentas from the quest anymore.  Am I doomed as a warlock to farm ST until the Drakestone of Shadow Wrath drops or is there a third alternative?
---
Well, the LK is still there, and there was a lot of foreshadowing in Legion about him getting more active.
---
Idk hunters are still a pain in the ass. It is certainly the class that shows up on my ignore list the most.
---
Use that breastplate of the falcon to fly away.
---
Thats spell batching, was around in classic. And what makes Ele Shaman strong.
---
Azshara
---
Specifically the northern camps with satyr and blood elf. 13year old me spent so much time there
---
Night Reaver going for 200ish on my server
---
Assassin blade i got and stupidly sold for 98g (insta sold) it goes for around 200. 
---
Shadowfang ive never seen in ah its prob bank
---
Yes I know.. This is the gear I just like to keep on. My normal tryhard gear has over +550 healing so far
---
No you fucking moron, that would literally make the game P2W. YES LITERALLY. 
---
Most classes get their BiS from the AH..
---
My favourite place in Wow classic is Elwyn Forest! After a long day of hard work and shopping in the city of Stormwind, I want to relax in the beautiful surroundings around the city, and enjoy the nature and the animals that live there.
---
Buy a lot of runecloth (I think like 12000 pieces or something) and turn that in.
---
You have to wait until they reset
---
Wait, you want a list of every twink item, for all 9 classes and all 5 twink brackets...?
---
And that's assuming everyone who plans a twink intends to use the same item in every slot as everyone else...
---
Just use your head, if the item is blue and requires a level close to the level cutoff for twinks, chances are it can be considered a twink item.
---
To get you started, [this page](https://www.wowhead.com/news=291929/wow-classic-level-19-twink-class-guides-and-bis-gear) has a list of level 19 twink BiS items.
---
What do you mean when you say "+ max enigneering"? So fiery encahents and engineering gear? Or probably just engineering equipment, yeah?
---
I was debating on whether I should do engineering or not - if I did, what should my 2nd profession be?
---
You should communicate this to them, YOU may know you can survive but they don’t have the inherent trust in you that you have.
---
Lmao cause 20 minutes to play on a good server is definitely worth it.
---
In the second (or third?) week after launch, I managed to get a Tiny Crimson Whelping for 60s.
---
Could be any to be honest, back in the day I had the damnedest time in winter spring cause I just couldn’t get the jump/spin/shoot/keep running mechanic. I’m sure it’s at least a LITTLE easier now with more than the 15 FPS I probably got.

I thought if you helped at all they despawned? Or was that a private server only thing
---
They will never even notice that youre an orc with that mask on. Good plan.
---
This is why some guilds prefer a DKP or Loot Council system.
---
Ironforge gates, just an epic scale to them. Really makes the place feel special.
---
Oh perhaps you misunderstood/ I misunderstood. I am not asking for LFD for classic at all. I’m saying the features are good for me personally on current wow. I play classic but would agree it would absolutely spoil the classic feel if it had this feature at all. Please no.
---
I though that maybe he wanted to start enchanting all items that he get. And this is a waste of resources.  
---
This is why I asked.
---
Yea I hit 60 a week ago and now mercilessly camp horde. I want to be a nice guy but they turned me into this monster. It's their own fault.

For me it's the feeling of progression while leveling. How you start as this little pleb killing boars with a strike that does 5 bonus damage, and then 30 levels later you've got a whole kit full of tools that you can use to overcome/get out of any situation.
---
It can be argued that you get this same feeling at 60 with gear progression, but I've always just preferred the 1-60 grind over the gear/dungeon grind.
---

If you see blue items that are at level end of their bracket. So if you see a BoE blue and it’s level 19, or 29, or 39 there’s a good chance it’s a twink item. Besides the level requirement and rarity it’s important to know the stats classes are looking for. Things that will increase damage and survivability is priority in twinking. If you’re a rogue and you’re twinking you’re either looking for attack power, or chance on hit burst procs for your weapon (Shadowfang, SFK). It’s important to know what classes need to increase their damage. If you see a two handed blue weapon and it has a lot of STR or stam on it warriors will want it to twink with. Important to note that very specific items are already known and researched to be the highest dps at these brackets of pvp.
---
He owes you a life debt now.  
---
Somewhere  sometime  when you are backed into a corner and death is near, look to the horizon and you will see him running to you.
---
Most healers understand this inherently, and nothing needs to be said. If I see it happening, I will explain the reasoning, and generally problem solved.
---
Some will still insist that they be 100% mana before every single trash pack. This is a waste of everyone's time. I shrug my shoulders and continue business as usual.
---
Everyone would level mage alts and bring them.
---
tbh it seems like a really forgotten zone
---
At your own risk I believe because if someone were to ninja it Blizzard will not recover any stolen goods.
---
Love how you tried to censor their name but missed one, but you are super kind and I'm glad there's still random enjoyable encounters with people!
---
Glad to bring the issue to light for some people! I’ve done forum posts, submit bug reports, etc. I’ve never gotten a response from Blizzard. This seems like such a small, simple bug... I wish they would just fix it.
---
Spend a lot of time prepping for going back out to grind, increasing bag space, getting Mats for crafting and potions, repair, restock food and water, try to sell crap, see if anyone gets g a group together for any dungeons I have quests for. Check what level I get what spells a and how much they cost so I know how much to make sure I have when I get to the next level. This all takes time. Sure you can get most of it done quick but some times you need a bit more for change of pace
---
Ugly
---
Wait for your friend to hit 60 then guilt them in to spamming runs for you to level 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Get a friend to make an alliance and put something on AH in booty bay. Go buy it on your horde, then trade afterwards on your alliance (this is if u are deleting them ans making alliance on same server).
---
It doesn't, but blizzard probably wont help you if you get scammed.
---
Just hitting 60 is mine🤔
---
Lmao. I like it.
---
I'm not as familiar with the last two, but the way it was explained to me is that Auctioneer is for players who plan to spend a lot of time playing the AH, whereas Auctionator is a much more casual friendly option. I went with Auctionator and I've enjoyed it. If you're still leveling, then don't forget to do something called a "Full Scan" whenever you're at the AH - this will scan all items currently for sale, and give a reference point for their price. I try to to do this at least once a day so I get a good history of prices for different items.
---
They spawn on the island where you do book of the ancients, much easier then going underwater.
---
Yeah, pretty much. The mithril bound trunks are the biggest money makers. You get them mostly from the floating wreckages, but also sometimes in the fishing pools. You can also fish a bit outside of the pools for winter squid. Bring nightcrawlers, I usually buy them on the AH for 50c each.
---
I'm just speaking from a speed running perspective.  I mean if there was a sequence break in a console rpg speed run that skips to the first boss you don't start timing the speed run from there do you?  Hell no, the skip is speedrun tech.
---
And also apparently the reason this became the norm on pservers is because some pservers had a function to time from boss kills.
---
That's it, just a reason of convenience.
---
Do you want a list of them all? Fucking google it, man.
---
Hmmm what server?
---
Actually, His/Her mindset would fly better on a RP server.
---
More people would accept the fact s/he wants to keep player knowledge and character knowledge seperate.
---
You're going to get a lot of answers telling you to play the way you want, and pointing out the weird context of this post, but I understand where you're coming from.
---
Remember the first time you played a game, and just did it for fun? Sure it took you a while to finish, but you enjoyed learning and adventuring. Next time you played you wanted to know a couple tips to do better this time, and the more you did the more you found min/max aspects because someone wanted to know the most efficient way to do anything. This happens with MMO's often, especially one that's 15 years old. It's something that has made games less desirable for me; I want to have fun, not spend hours getting a 1% increase in damage. 
---
It's very easy to do that with WoW classic. 
---
The content itself isn't hard, so you don't need to have absolutely BiS to get what you want done. What might be a better idea, is quickly skim through a guide that has your question (ie. What armour should I use?)
---
You'll get every single item that's the best for you class, and options as well. Instead of blindly following those pieces across Azeroth, take some time to figure out WHY they're BiS - what stats you want to prioritize, then go from there. 
---
I know devilsaur set is about the best for any physical dps, but it looks like a low-res set of clothes that have been buried in dirt for years, so I don't want to use them, but that means I'll need to find AP/Crit/Hit elsewhere. Just find pieces and make a set you like, find a pet you like and use it, find a dungeon you like and run it.
---
That’s how I’ve understood it.  Essentially, there’s a numbers game behind talents, skills, and gear.  So what’s “meta” is what’s more or less been proven the most optimal.
---
Been waiting on a perd's.  We clear Ony and MC in a single night and have been for four weeks, but still no drop.  Gutgore ripper is fine, I guess, but god damn it I need my lawn dart!
---
I cast Lvl. 3 Eroticism. You turn into a real beautiful woman.
---
I had a Tank the other day tell me to dissmis my pet Because "Its aggro range is to long" 
---
My pet was 2 levels higher than everyone else in the group. Even higher than the mobs.
---
He also pulled 2 mobs at a time, through the entire dungeon. Even tho at the end of every fight everyone was at 100% and the healer had like 90% mana. Still, 2 mobs at a time.
---
Me not that kind of elf
---
It's not going to eat anyone. This game is an easy joke compared to what it was. Everything is tweaked. This is not a hard game.
---
Orc is better in pvp for sure. The stun reduction is fantastic. Warstomp absolutely does reset swing timer and it can be very annoying. 
---
I’m not saying you can’t win as a Tauren I do just fine but orc is a more optimal choice.
---
Yeah, agreed. And unfortunately, the warlock is most in control of the exchange most of the time. For me, I basically ask whether the healer would be doing DPS with their mana right now if I wasn't life tapping. And if the answer is yes, then I lifetap 100% freely.
---
Hunters:
---
Could someone post here ore point me to a macro for feign death+trap? There have been changes to this mechanic.
---
Mine quite often does not work...
---
I am aware. I was thinking for some reason that they were closer together not the same boss.
---
Jesus christ this sub lmao. 
---
No, playing less than 6 hours a day does not make you a casual lmfao
---
Think for yourself instead of obeying sometimes incorrect BiS lists
---
Yea like I said. No idea wtf you’re talking about. Enjoy your dumbass spec we’ve already argued over. 
---
If you think improved cleave is worth 3 skill points your are effectively brain dead.
---
I solo and group play on a PVP server. I tank and dps as needed.  The one point, I've found is incredibly useful. If I'm solo, and there's that one mob who just happens to decide - 'Hey, I'm going to run away - directly into that group of mobs because I want to cause mass-hysteria' - I feral charge.
---
I will say that it's absolutely useful with Furor 5/5 - and if you have it macro'd. I wasn't doing the macro portion of this, and it was more cumbersome.  Hitting one key - for cancel aura, into bear, into feral charge was a godsend. Can't go back. I love the utility of it.
---
I heard on the radio. They are going on tour

Is cleave really a better use of rage than sunder tab sunder?

Warstomp is an "oh shit" button.  Orc is generally better for PvP/DPS, but not by much.  Go with beefy boi.

---
Just hit 60 a week ago and I'm not really enjoying end game. Raiding feels like a chore. Any other ways to spend 60 enjoyably, or should I just roll an alt?
---
Again, though. It’s not about the money. If you’re level 18 without a main and you really want money, you can ask anyone in Org/IF for 2g and for some decent bags. You make like 2g per run of WC so it’s not efficient for gold purposes. It’s just better exp than questing.
---
What if you're fighting mobs under level 60.  Would it be worth it to swap to gloves other than edgemasters for stats?
---
I’m seeing people actively looking for more druids
---
All good, just wanted to clarify :)
---
I have noticed the same thing, the mage will try to aoe frost all the mobs and take the aggro then run around in a circle dying

Back in Vanilla I got the right binding with my brother's guild. A few months later I ran with my friends guild and the left binding dropped. They asked if anyone had a binding already and I was the only one and they gave it to me no questions asked. If I was in this person's raid I would have just said the same thing and gave it to the guy who got the first piece. F in the chat
---
Yeah this is just for raid bosses, when you're doing dungeons and whatever weapon skill matters way less. Just put on like devilsaur gloves or whatever replacement you have
---
Aaaaaaaaaaaand he never did brd again.
---
They can grab with their feet, like a hand. More like a thumb nail than a toe nail! What's the difference??
---
I only posted that, the impression that it isn't random is exaggerated by what gets posted.
---
Add on the fact even if it was truly random, any "funny" numbers would automatically make any human assume it's not random anyway.
---
then mentioned that it's not "truly" random, only  psuedo random, They don't have a big enough entropy source for truly random, and cryptographically random would take too long to process for how often there is a need for random.
---
It's highly doubtful that blizzard intentionally created "entertainment" rolls,  They just did best they could with the resources available.
---
The last bit is what I use to comfort myself when I see "irregular" rolls.
---
**Edit**
---
Another way to look at duplicates is like this. When no one has rolled anything the odds are 1:10,000 for the first two people to roll a particular number.  After the first person rolls, the second person has a 1:100 chance to roll the same as the first.  After the second person rolls, the third person has a 1:50 chance of matching either of the first rolls. After the Third the 4th has a 1:33.33 chance to match the previous 3 rolls, and the last roll has a 1:25 chance to match any of the previous 4.
---
But why do they say it worked fine on pservers?
---
Go with another hybrid like shaman or paladin
---
You’re not wrong, but WF is just so, so much more satisfying. And in the long run not a huge loss in average dps. Even with 1h weapons I love WF because with flurry from crits your arm literally just looks like a whirlwind of hits.
---
Why rage dump with cleave instead of sunder stabbing? Because its 1 gcd instead of 2?
---
Which addon allows you to display your HP/Mana in the health bar? Been trying to find that one for 2 months... I don't want any of that fancy crap that turns it into a big yellow square blob.. i just want to display the actual numbers without having me to curse over my healthbar to see.
---
I feel like a lower pop server would have higher prices on the market no? Since the BoEs and other mats will not be farmed as much
---
It’s a good combo 
---
But if I was you I would just pug 2dps
---
Finding two dps would go really fast.
---
came here to say this!
---
Ah I missed the "get into" part my mistake. Agree

---
On mobile see if this works.  I remember reading this back in the day.  This guy did exactly that and is pretty successful.
---
As a tank I felt the same. Generally at 60 they Respec single target so it's better.
---
I used some of those on my druid.  int/strength isn't terrible.
---
Priests don’t need to rely on group content...  I love playing Priest and really love Shadow Priest.
---
My advice would be Priest and go Shadow until you reach a point that you just want to run dungeons as a healer (which may never come).  Shadow Priest are great for PVP and great to solo level with.
---
Rogue healing spec, it’d be perfect

Wow, thats very interesting, I’m in a similar conundrum. Just made a post about this half an hour ago. If I choose to transfer, I can transfer all characters at once, right?

I don't know how to take a video or I would, but the buildings at the entrance there won't block LoS, never have. There are some "hard corners" in the instance but the little nooks and crannies of the instance won't. I'll take a SS of it later if I can time it right. I'm not talking about the bugs, I know they don't require LoS.

They aren't needed lol
---
I think I get your point. 15 years ago I did just that. Not because I planned it that way but just because I was new to gaming in general and learned everything at the same time from building my own rig to what's a character class or an audio com server, with wow. (I wasnt a teenager anymore and had dabble with some games here and there but wow made me a gamer)
---
Even after I've been pointed to sites to plan for gear or quests I wasnt sure what I was looking at and would pick gear either for looks or sometimes for stats but based on misinformed theorycrafting of my own.
---
I have very fond memories of this levelling that took me a year. Lots of stupid noobie things I laugh at now, and an incredible moment a guy took pity on me and dueled me for about an hour to try to help me with my noobiness, not just giving pointers but basically TEACHING me what a rogue does and doesnt, what's the class about, and how abilities work together.
---
I once went thru all the barrens map stealthed, heart beating like crazy, just because I had read "contested territory". I wasn't doing anything else but exploring and I felt like an astronaut.
---
It took me a year to level up to 60 and I played until the end of TBC. I lost that innocence on the way, ofc, joined raids, watched pvp videos, argued about drop rolls etc.
---
I get what you mean and I wish you as good an experience as what was mine during that first year.
---
Now I kinda want take revenge on that. I play less, do quests depending on rewards, grind mobs that drop whatever I am looking for at the time depending on loot tables I study before hand, I plan my builds, my alts professions etc.
---
I guess what you're trying to do is hard on a game that 1- is 15 years old , 2- is multiplayer and 3- is played in our day and age of dense information media with so many tempting ways to spoil your virgin experience.
---
Do your thing and have fun, it's great. If you cannot achieve that goal on wow because of the 3 points above, I would suggest a brand new MMO where everybody is a newbie or a dense solo RPG such like maybe Morrowind (try that without any guide, I guarantee you're in for some fun.)
---
Don't get me wrong, I do hope you'll fit here and stick with us :)
---
I'll just cant do what you suggest, that round, with wow. On another game, yes sure, but not here and now.
---
Still had my beast tracker on while flying and i saw the red dot of something following close behind. It was my hawk owl companion and that guy was flapping his wings so fast he looked like a damn hummingbird haha
---
Get better at dodging queues IMO.
---
nice statistic you got there
---
So far in classic? I got transmute life to earth for roughly 1g buyout. 
---
I also got an undeath to water transmute for 30g. Both of these should go for 200+ probably
---
Tailoring is very easy to level. Engineering adds a ton of useful tools and requires almost zero maintenance (buying iron bars and stone every now and then) outside of restocking grenades.
---
I went Herbalism Engineering, after levelling as Mining Skinning and Tailoring for 16 days. I hate looking for rich thorium and I'm not a rogue for silithus hive farming.
---
Picked up a Hyacinth Macaw pet for 99 silver. Thats a .01% drop rate, the rarest pet in classic. Still cant decide whether to sell or use it!
---
The only thing is that you run out of mana fast. On shorter raid fights/trash/dungeons, moonkin is fine DPS. Not the best, but average. On longer fights, you're pretty much bringing your group down due to the lack of mana, so it depends what you're striving to do but a lot of people view balance druids as a meme so they may not invite you based on that even though it's not bad in 5 mans.
---
putting hearts and smileys at the end won't hide your crying and seething

Why does is the info for boots showing while he is over a ring? 1 more thing, is that a gun where his idol should be?

Waiting 15 minutes to find a tank for LBRS. Dude joins for 10 seconds and goes, "No mage?" and leaves. BURN IN HECK.
---
Glad to hear about the massively improved experience after switching! Thank goodness I seemed to have found such a great server to be on - Kurinnaxx is busy, social, 95% of the people are great, plenty of PvP on both sides.
---
BTW good pointer on checking out the new realm as part of your decision making process.
---
That’s not a bad idea, will definitely try this if I stay. Just saw another post which warmly recommended switching for free, so difficult choice😇
---
If zooming in to read text is too much of an effort for you then maybe Classic WoW isn't the right game for you.
---
and people wonder why others run HOJ reserved groups....
---
All good. It's a very controversial opinion, I've tanked for 15 years, classic first time in WoW my main doesn't have a tank spec. It's kinda nice
---
Yeah, I got invited to a 4 mage farm run, and one of the things we had to do was jump up somewhere and let them deaggro. Which, they didn't explain that well so I ended up dying the first time.  Parkour for the lose.
---
Oh I see. You have a baked in assumption that if you have enlightenment you won't be allowed to drop on choker.

Mayhe you should have included that.

I can make very nice faps

Got a hunter with mining and herb. If I kill like 4 different type of mobs I'm gonna be out. Just hit 40 so it's off to buy the mount and then save up for some bigger bags...
---
I think mages are boring, and super over-populated, at least on my server, so no thanks.
---
Does anyone know a simple addon that will make my debuffs on a target larger than others?  I'd rather not have to download a unit frames addon just for this.
---
You're absolutely right.  That's how every other multiplayer game with currency works, too.  WoW players are just their own special breed, I swear.
---
Friends and I will be trying for first time. They are going as warrior and rogue, so I'm thinking of doing a class with healing. We're playing horde, and not sure about shaman, priest, or druid's healing. Just looking for have a good time with dungeons  any advice?
---
i mean it really depends, if you just want a good experience right now then switch but if you are planning playing for a year or 2 then i would stay on as high pop as possible
---
Fixed!
---
eliteplayerframe addon has a setting for it
---
well, you could do dungeons, farm for your BiS, farm for your epic mount, or shelve it until P2 comes out for Honor, or P3 for BGs.
---
4 HOURS?
---
i have a handful of buttons i click but most everything is 1-7, \~, F1-F5, and mouse buttons (i have 12).
---
damn, pretty damn impressive
---
Resto Druids are the best single target healers in the game. I played a holy priest through vanilla and it always triggered me that I was playing a PRIEST specced as best as possible to HEAL and a fuckin hybrid class was better at healing tanks than I was. It bothered me to an irrational degree, which I now look back with embarrassment ... but yeah, you can be the best at something, if you enjoy raid healing.
---
tbh a friend if mine went to an interview and she told them about beeing a guild leader and they thought that really was a perk and wrote down "2 years of relevant experience" which is freakin awesome imo!
---
Honestly if the proc rate is close to what the wowhead comments say (it probably is not) it is it would BiS until the mageblade imo. Proc rates I saw said 1 out 6 spells which would add 16 spell damage per spell not even taking into account the Mana aspect which beats witchblades 14 spell damage. That being said I wouldn't advise going out of your way to get it, farming Mara is just how I make gold and as a warlock I need the blade of eternal darkness for RP.
---
Meh,  I'm always going to roll Need on a BoE I can equip and Greed on ones I would sell.  If mouth breathers must do a GreedNeed roll so be it.
---
What? Isn’t reed and 2% Crit bis?
---
my server is legit too small to run reserve groups sadly.  the best I can do is run with some of my awesome guildies, but then i feel guilty because no one needs anything else there now!
---
Do you have a reference for the druid specific macros you mentioned?
---
Most likely z-perl.
---
I’d take perdition over HoJ any day, anyway!
---
Honestly it's good enough for me, I farm the place for gold so it's not like I'm going out of my way or anything just wanted to know if it's in the game. I mean as a warlock I feel like I should have the blade of eternal darkness If just for RP purposes you know :p
---
I've lost 150 pounds over the last year and a half or so. It's all about what you eat my guys. If anyone wants any pointers or has questions feel free to ask :D i'm happy to help
---
Actually yes that would be fair.  It's a courtesy to give these items to the people that need them.   If you were raiding with a complete group of strangers, I would expect a raid wide roll.  Only by raiding with your guild do you get that courtesy extended to you.
---
In PvP Balance handles fine. In PvE they suffer cause the go out of mana much faster than other casting classes. I think being a moonkin is so much fun and totally worth it to mess around, you can get some fun crits and be effective. I used to play feral druid, and gosh was it piss poor with my pre raid Bis gear I had while I was on a p server. The most effective druids I played against were hybrid ones, most likely Hotw with points in resto because they would use insect swarm, moonfire, root some people heal some people and when they'd get focused they would hot themselves and go into bear form while the rest of the team mauled the enemy down. I think hybrid druids are the best in pvp, and also decent in PvE so you can heal or tank.
---
seems like a lot of time and work 5 silver when at 60 you can just kill a mob
---
I guess I was also asking about it auto purchasing said items
---
Duskwood. I love the atmosphere of the place as well as the stories that are told there.
---
Thats good to hear! I always felt like cloth wearers would need help in anything other than solo leveling. I plan to level shadow if i go priest, and heal dungeons when possible as its not that hard sub 55, from what ive heard.

I think the problem might be your healing style. You are losing a little bit efficiency compare to moonglow bulild, but the difference should not make a big difference, unless your boss kill times are really long
---
No can do. Red is dead.
---
Bosses in classic are painfully simple. The only 'hard' content is simply a gear-check and with how much better the 'meta' is understood now than in 2006 I honestly don't expect any raid to be any trouble.
---
Warriors are more represented than rogues.
---
Making patterns for people
---
I'm on a massive server and can see some of these same things, but I think the guild I'm in puts those toxic problems to rest. Its a amazing to have a group of homies IRL and in game to lean on when you need help grinding something. I just don't know how people are finding competent players to befriend now after the first surge of launch babies. Thats when I usually 
---
How was the adjustment to the new server? I'd like to entertain the idea of transferring one of my level 60 alts.
---
Makes sense, thanks.
---
Where in Feralas would you grind? I am halfways to 46
---
It was a tragic raid this week.  Really hard to get ony buff for a late night guild.
---
It's nice to have time to run to the bathroom, eat etc without worrying about losing your spot or hindering your group.
---
Stranglethorn Vale, the PvP in this zone is what hooked me up when I first started playing.
---
Is [this](https://imgur.com/a/4YyytPE) the solution you're looking for?
---
Oops, well hopefully they don’t mind!
---
If its an upgrade and he needs it so bad he can take his ass to whatever dungeon has the next best item and farm it like everyone else does for their upgrades.
---
That's exactly what I do right now. I'll drop a stone skin totem if the mobs are 2+ levels higher than me but that's about it.
---
This is what I helped him with
---
All the best for the last 8 levels! You can do it!
---
Yeah maybe for a MC pug
---
I love Incendius, really feels like home ya know?  Have not had anyone bad experiences thus far.
---
Im planning on going HotW at 60 due to its ability to do a lil bit of everything, however i hear that if you want to do good healing beyond tanks, you needd to go moonglow, which has no real power outside of raids AFAIK, due to being specced healer and not feral at all. I could be wrong, im still very new to classic.
---
I had to give up on the classic version and switch to shadowedUI. It just wasn't working for me.
---
pls read this anyone who's been disenchanting
---
Cheers bud
---
Depends on your class i guess. A paladin or shaman could probably get decent boe gear in every slot where something like a rogue wont have quite as many options.
---
Dal rends offhand is complete trash without its mainhand counterpart and should never be used without it in a dual wield situation
---
I liked them at first. Sunwell Isle is an all time favorite of mine. But it really did take endgame in a bad direction
---
Thanks for the info. Can I download Auctionator from Twitch directly or do I need to DL the "fix" version of it for classic?

Thank you, Catm4n.

I bid on about 200 Savory Deviate Delight for 1c each today, hoping that at least a few would slip through. But nah, the bastard cancelled every single one of them.
---
I scored a tiger strike mantle for 25s on buyout, ended up selling it for 30g immediately. St0nks.
---
What would you replace it with though?
---
i feel like you dont know what DW tanking is. My armor wouldnt actually decrease because of consumables.  Youre a funny little troll.
---
So a monk lol
---
On my server Smolderweb iron goes for as much as mithril now around 9s a pop.  This is because nobody farms it.  I would mine iron in somewhere like thosuand needles.
---
At level 60 it's a rogue LF 9 more and it's 15 fury warriors and rogues answering, The next shout LF 9 more tank, heals and RANGED DPS. Also there's 6 of these exact things going on at once.
---
You shouldn't need to use a single mana pot on that one. Kite it until enrage, then:
---
* Scorpid Sting
---
* Melee 2-3 times
---
* Wing Clip and run out of melee
---
rinse and repeat.
---
It's the absolute easiest of them all. He hits for 1 damage when he's got scorpid sting on.
---
This is gaming while exercising not gamification of exercise. Don't conflate the two. Gamification of exercise would be like what the new ring game for Nintendo switch is doing.
---
If the warrior planning to tank? If not or undecided, go Druid. You’ll be able to heal or tank. I main a priest, and dungeons are a breeze even if you level as shadow. So that’ll always be my suggestion. If you want a pure healer, that’s your best bet.
---
I've raid healed all available content so far as HotW/NS and I don't see an issue with it. As one of 2-3 MT healers I just basically spam rank 4 healing touch and add rejuvenation if I need a bit more HPS output.
---
I don't even bother with raid healing most of the time because it's not worth it without being regrowth specced and other classes can handle it just fine. On most bosses I'm not that high up in the heal meter, but who cares when they're so easy. On Rag I'm easily on top or near it.
---
No idea how that hovering thing happened, I guess I did something during the screenshot.
---
The gun is from a Stratholme quest, called Egan's Blaster. It's useless besides blasting those neutral ghosts there. I just have it there for filler cuz there are no relics yet
---
Can mobs get on boats/airships? I wonder if you could take one of these to Darnassus.
---
I only play 1-3 hours a night through the week and a little more at the weekends depending on the weekend plans.  Helps I have a good guild too.
---
There are mages that know how to aoe and ones who don't. The guild mage  I run with almost never pulls aggro unless it's a huge group then it's kinda expected.
---
Blowme seems like its 50/50 and its high pop
---
It's the better rerelease change my mind.
---
My group started brd angerforge runs for me last night. We did 4-5 before we called it (were all sub 60 so clearing took longer). We got two of the one handed swords he drops that’s a lower drop rate than the hoj is.... Yay?
---
It really boiled down to initial server availability.  Once the Streamers picked their, the Latin community picked another, IIRC there was one east coast PvP server left in Herod. Since  PvPers tens to go Horde, the problem was entirely predictable.  Free transfers compounded the issue further
---
Kromcrush has 4 options. Blowme had 5 options when i looked last night. It varies.
---
Why's he gotta be a black Smith?
---
Finkle's Skinner, a drop from The Beast in UBRS.
---
Thanks for all the info, I really appreciate the detailed write up. So you are saying to use the Auctionator Addon in-game with the TSM desktop client for price data? How do you get them to work together, or is that done automatically?
---
Also, can I download Auctionator from Twitch, or do I need to DL the fixed version of it manually?
---
Dunno why you got downvoted I got the joke.  Missing the pre kid days where I could easily play 8 hours a day haha.

Some people like the class fantasy of taming a beast and having it as your animal companion.

Others such as you like the class fantasy of being a huntard.

Druid for solo leveling. Priest questing is dot+wand wand wand .

I was going to ask for your PayPal to buy you the subscription but I checked your comment history and you use racial slurs. I’m disappointed.

Boarding school!

Something that I have discovered playing classic is that I LOVE the leveling process. I like running dungeons and that feeling of your character going from a nobody to a hero. I currently have a 59 druid that I plan to get to 60, but I am not sure if he will do much for raiding. I will likely just do some of the high level 5-mans for fun. I also have a 46 rogue that is just a blast to play. I already want to start leveling something else. 
---
There is so much discussion on this sub about max level stuff, but I don't have the time commitment to dedicate to raids and frankly, I don't want to raid again. A few hours here and there on an alt is way more fun for me, and I play for fun.
---
So much wheeeee, what a barbecue night. Clap Clap on making this, amazing work!
---
Hope you gonna give us some more stuff soon and as always... Smile =)
---
Kinda related, but the other day me and a guildie were fishing in our "secret" fishing spot that's tucked away in the middle of nowhere on top of a mountain. No reason anyone would ever go there. Well some dude came up and we did a little light RP where he wanted us to pay him off not to tell, so we gave him some fish and he went on his way.
---
30 minutes later a horde rogue pops up and tries to gank us, and who shows up? Our guardian angel from before. Before we even know what was going on the rogue was running away and our Paladin friend was screaming "AFTER HIM!". It was glorious. Why that guy was back at our spot, I'll never know.
---
Fuck yeah classic wow.
---
What’s that? Osrs?
---
You jump on the roof to the right of the door and drop in to the courtyard right at the start.
---
Yeah, I guess that is me. Although lately I can't even get trashy girls lol. Getting too old now and girls that used to like me don't anymore. I think I am almost at that point where I am just going to end up with that woman that has been divorced a few times and has kids in college already. I hate being alone but yet I don't want to settle for that either. It really sucks.
---
Mostly because you're trying to get off as many Battle shouts as you can, yeah. If you're tanking 5 minor mobs and 3 elites you're going to be generating about the same amount of threat on all of them, so if you're holding the non-elites you're going to be holding the elites as well, except for the one elite that is getting focused by single target damage which you can still taunt away. 
---
If the minor mobs are dying fast enough you can also tab and heroic strike the elites to preserve your GCD's for BS. Even when there are just elites left, cleave isn't a bad option. I believe the threat modifier for HS is 160 whereas it's 130 for Cleave (idk why the tooltip says that HS generates a high amount of threat but it doesn't mention this for cleave), so it's still a pretty good threat generator.
---
Get directions... and her mailbox address. Maybe you two could have dinner at the Cooking trainer. Or spend a night under the stars fishing in the lake, or a walk on the Rutheran beach.
---
Yessir
---
As a Gnome I love finding all the little out of place spots we can use /lay and look hilarious. Also as a Gnome we can get into places other races cant, such as hidden areas on boats.
---
Well it's also more people needing fire pots for rag/ony since most casuals are just now hitting 60.
---
Call them out and shame them.
---
They returned 1.6g that was sent accidentally however they didnt include gold for the cloth.
---
Essentially they got the cloth for free.
---
The leaf/eye have a 100% drop rate it’s just random which one you will get. In my guild we have had 5 eyes drop in a row and hunters are still waiting.
---
Hey I live in Bologna
---
I find it rather funny when they gank in groups. I'll just accept the beating and release. Then come back behind a clothie and show them who the dominant force is with a WF crit followed by a /laugh as I accept my demise again from their gang of 5.
---
Haha he’s not long turned 1, mrs is wanting another then I’m doomed.
---
That’s... why he’s there in the first place dense brain. With that logic he’ll never get it if all the groups did that.

This is usually true but not always

Okay, well, I'm sorry you don't agree that we should treat people fairly.  =/
---
Who doesn't enjoy a good Disney movie anyways?
---
So it's bad?
---
The bonebiter could be a decent upgrade and teh sm helm is pretty good too, but imo swords are better than axes especially for humans so just roll with stoneslayer, i use that too even at lvl 51.
---
Yes, mine is something like /use [stance:1/2] Berserker Stance; Berserker Rage. But that's for all of those abilities I checked, yet it only used both the stance and the ability when I tried it with Intercept.
---
Just get TF lol
---
How did my 14yr old mind not notice this back then &gt;.&gt;
---
This is me. Nobody would step up or raid leading, so my level 56 ass started leading. Spent a BUNCH of time in 10m raids between 55 and 60, so it took forever to cap, ended up full clearing MC twice, and was shotcalling bosses, full on raid lead once, and co-lead the second time, all before 60. 
---
the 10m exp penalty hurts a lot.
---
haha too late now buddy, get ready for long as bg queues to get into a losing WSG match where your team is turtling, if you really wanted to pvp you should have know alliance was were it was at, when its out popped 10v1 that means i have 10 people to kill and you have one
---
Azshara is just so cool. I love the whole vibe.
---
i couldnt play a hunter I would get way to attached to my pet after reading all these post on reddit
---
It was always like this in vanilla. It’s a bug that’s not a bug. A bug they replicated because that’s the way it was.
---
bwl is cake if you have the dps 
---
aka very limited meme specs 
---
can be done tho for sure
---
Well it equalizes since there is also not many that are buying. That way they are forced to sell at the price point that the ones buying can afford.
---
Lookin' real natural Mr. class leader.
---
Nice humble brag.

---
Just so we’re clear you’re aware there’s an Auction House in your capital city that players put gear on to sell? Silk bags go for 30 silver per bag on my server and those are 10 slotters. I’m sure the bags you’re looking for on the Auction House are mad cheap.
---
Not having a Rez sucks. As a druid I'm not inviting a druid healer unless we have a priest or pally in the group. Or it's a guildie.
---
For rank 9 frostbolt (assuming ice shards):
---
    Avg Dmg per Cast = (457.5 + coeff*spellpower)*(.83 + hit%)*(1+crit%)
---
Take the derivative of this with respect to spellpower and crit%/100
---
    d_sp = coeff*(.83 + hit%)*(1+crit%)
---
    d_crit = (457.5 + coeff*spellpower)*(.83 + hit%)/100
---
    d_crit / d_sp = 0.01*(457.5+coeff*spellpower) / (coeff * (1+crit%))
---
As you can see, hit% drops out entirely and plugging in for most common values of spellpower and crit% you'll end up between 7.5-8 spellpower per 1% of crit.  If you're at like raid BIS and flasked you can get up to 9-10.
---
The best thing about being a Druid isn’t getting all the gear you want, it’s listening to people complain and saying “I’m gonna roll a Druid” which they do and promptly level to 23 and then ditch, thereby ensuring a steady supply of nexus crystals for the guild when such are available.
---
Elwynn Forest.  
---
The atmosphere gets me every time. I often listen to the Elwynn Forest music while I commute.
---
I saw the sword is a lower drop rate also, but that is definitely not the case. I have seen more than 10 of those swords in the last 105 runs, as opposed to 1 HoJ.
---
Undercity has the sword trainer.
---
Shaman would fit the best with 2 melee friends
---
cocke and also balls
---
Yes lets keep the casual mentality in this 15 year old game that we all chose to subscribe to and play because we're casual gamers.  I hope you can sense the sarcasm dripping from that sentence.
---
I think this addon deserves its own post tbh. Great spot!
---
The more allies in range the more threat that is generated. There was an issue early on in Classic where Demo shout was generating too much threat that was fixed, but they also repaired how much threat BS generated. It doesn't just generate threat on the first application, but every time they receive it so it doesn't matter if they already have the buff or not, just tell your allies to stay within about 20 yards of you and you should notice an increased ability to AoE tank.
---
If you're combat spec, then going up to 12% is worth it imo.
---
Hey just wanted to share our little youtube channel here just to show some of the class guides that we love.
---
This is how I got my epic mount the day after I hit 60. I had herb and ran mara. Clean fights with no gear all solo. 40-50g an hour just from drops and another 10g-30g from herb.
---
Between the mana inefficiency and the fact that you have no extra debuff slots for your dots nor will there be a raid debuff that boosts your wrath damage you’re pretty much looking at the baseline dps of starfire modified by curse of shadow and whatever spell power you have. You can suck a priests dick for PI i guess, but your ragnaros parses wont wash away the shame.
---
Can anyone tell me what addon people use to announce things like a resisted taunt? Can these also be used to announce when you get stunned?
---
EPL! Because of all the sick lore.
---
&gt;The best way with it is to form your own database and not by downloading one, so go on there and mine!
---
Uh, no, the best way is to use a pre-made database so you actually know where all the nodes are. GatherLite not only does this, but also allows you to globally share node locations with everyone else using the addon.
---
This makes no sense with a 15 year old game where everyone knows all the encounters.   It’s not like real world where anything can happen.
---
I strongly prefer TukUI to ElvUI in Classic. Used ElvUI all the way through retail but I find it to be too big and bulky for things now, so that's something for OP to look into as well.
---
If you've never heard of these before, they are the most popular 'all in one' addons. 
---
In saying that, I use an addon called Threatplates (or something similar) and disable the default TukUI nameplate, as Threatplates  gives better information (for healer/dps it shows a green background for things you don't have aggro on you, yellow if it's close, and red if you have aggro and opposite for tanks). It also shows debuffs with numeric timers.
---
I prefer the cancer insta-Svipul in Kinakka but ransom works too.
---
I've only seen them drop from bosses.  Never had any luck with the dusty tomes.
---
I'm level 40, and my friends are into their 50's.  I just follow them into whatever instances they do, and we get it done.  We as in, I do the best I can, but we still make the runs a success.
---
Yeah i am playing a tauren sham and I love it
---
Duskwood! The atmosphere, different kinds of kills you have to make and ofcourse Stitches (mofo killed me more times I would like to admit :P)

Are you poor and have no time? If you have time to cook you have no excuse. A giant bag of rice and some plain chicken breast will last you all week and be dirt cheap.

Azshara, good memories farming felcloth when the game first came out.

Like the Darrowshire questline but in a different sort of fucked up  
---
And yes of course, Stalvan
---
You can just kite him down the road. Just use a combo of rank 1 arcane shots, auto shots and concussive shots and kite him down the road almost to the redridge mountains. Then wait for an enrage, scorpid sting and wing clip to turn him around. He should die about halfway back. Very helpful to have a couple of buddies follow you to deter would be ganks.
---
Awesome, thanks.  Any idea what kind of leather you get from core hounds?
---
Same!  I actually was enjoying BFA while leveling my first character to 120.  I didn’t mind doing some of grindy stuff, but once it got to the point that I needed to log on every day to stay caught up? Nah, I lost interest. I started playing a bunch of low level alts because I was having fun leveling, then ended up playing less and less and just quitting.
---
It’s weird, classic is grindy, but not in the same way.  I don’t feel behind if I don’t do certain things.  I’m having a lot of fun with it and nothing really feels like a chore to me.
---
I was going to say Improved Imp on Warlock doesn't change the buff value either.
---
The BoE that therotically dropped has nothing to do with the item he was going for in the first place.  You seem to be lost a bit here.  Idk why you replied twice either, you can put those two replies in the same comment ya know.
---
I have Omni CC and classicauradurations so whenever i place a sting on a mob i get a timer countdown for the remainder of the sting. If another hunter applys a sting their debuff doesnt get a timer. Therefore i know which buff is mine, does this help?
---
There's the mechanical yeti, only a few charges
---
Haha man I'm the same way! I logically know that Rockbiter maximizes the DPS but WF is just so much more satisfying when it procs. I'm also running Ravager right now which I believe is pretty slow.
---
This is my situation too and I really like it. We aren't required to bring consumables, have pre-bis, etc. but most people do so that raiding isn't an all-night affair. We clear MC and ony in 3 to 3.5 hours then have six days to take care of real life and restock on stuff when time allows. Most of us are adults that pushed hard to hit 60 and gear relatively quickly to get to this point, and now we can all play pretty casually.
---
I mean do you have decent healing gear and are you downranking properly?  Spec shouldn't be a big deal as long as you didn't go oom
---
I wonder if the participation xp penalty isn't a thing cross faction?
---
50s is not a lot.
---
Honestly, armor on the mounts looks so fucking dumb.
---
Can we be honest here it’s fucking dumb that green bop raid items aren’t traceable.
---
Leatrix plus has this option plus a lot more
---
Lmao if your raid has boomy/feral dps then you're probably taking 5 hours to clear MC and probably failing at Rag
---
Why do you keep quoting yourself? It's weird. You're weird. lol I mean I get that your feelings are super hurt, but it's okay, kid. You can recover from this.
---
I'm up to 147 runs on my rogue. Every rogue I've ever partnered with has gotten it, and finding a group is getting harder and harder every day..
---
Just to add, it needs to be equiped or in your inventory to get into the instance too. Don't leave it in your bank!
---
Anyway I'm gonna go ahead and ignore you now. You're weird. Have a good life, kiddo. &lt;3
---
Orgrimmar. Every time I go back there, it reminds me of all the fond memories of shenanigans my old guild would get up to.
---
Duskwood; few places in the game have such a wonderfully cohesive atmosphere and storyline while also being a really well-designed questing experience.
---
That is two shy of the known world record.
---
Same
---
Out of those 147 runs, how many times have you seen it?
---
Especially since you are trading it for 20% intellect from HOTW. So its a mitigated upgrade
---
Honestly, for less competition on the boxes I assume.
---
I ganked 3 level 30 horde in Hillsbrad yesterday as a 60 on Incendius. Looked like they might have been grouped together.

---
Quite a bit, actually. Just never won the roll. If I had to guess, I'd say  I saw it drop maybe 10 times?
---
I entirely agree. I just don't raid on mages, only farm. It's the one class I can't force myself to raid on.
---
Silithus, some of my best memories are with my friends at 2am farming essences there...

They can be dropped by bosses but it’s a very small chance and his post didn’t originally say bosses, he edited after my comment I believe.
---
Perhaps I misread, but I’m fairly sure I didn’t, apologies if it wasn’t changed, but I’m sure it was edited
---
First of all, it never lockout because I do cath/armor combo less than 5 times in one hour(each combo took like 11-13 mins).
---
Secondly, the time it costs from running vendor to SM is like 3-4 mins( when my iceblock is on cool down in 1-2 mins, so its actually 1-2 mins wasted).
---
Lastly, this is only trash selling price in the vendor about 82G/hr(not included the blue items).
---
They gave it to him???

Every classic wow discord can be found here ;)
---
Unfortunately Boomkins don't get a chance to really shine till TBC, before that resto or feral is the spec to be if you want optimal results with out serious competition for gear with clothies.
---
Not in my experience?
---
I'm on anathema, one of the lowest pop servers.
---
Our devilsaur sets are only ~100-150 gold total for both pieces.
---
Most of our other materials are pretty cheap too.
---
There's just so little competition for resources. Half the time I visit ungoro, I see literally no one farming the devilsaur spawns. Nevermind any semblance of a devilsaur mafia.
---
The server's just more limited by raw gold farming as a result.
---
its 50-70 on my low/med pop pvp realm
---
This sub isn't really streamer friendly.
---
Mana pots on my server are now cheaper than the mats to make them.
---
Reminds me of when I saw a 60 rogue getting ready to kill one, I initiate and kill the rogue despite him free action potting (I'm mage). Then I mount off to find the devilsaur he was on (this is less than 30 secs after) and there's a 52 hunter killing it. He kills it and gets ready to skin. That's when a 60 druid pops out and tries to ninja it. I kill the druid too, with a tiny bit of dmg from this hunter who didn't even try scare beast. 
---
So I kill 2 60 allies who would have both easily killed this hunter and he doesn't even offer to split with me. "Well I guess neither of us are skinning it" when I asked to skin it and give him 5g (10g value on Incendius) 
---
Banksii on Incendius, you need to open your eyes man. That behavior won't get you anywhere.
---
10%? Bullshit. I killed 50 of them before abandoning the quest. I cannot believe I'm that unlucky.
---
"Wanding has no effect on the five second rule."
---
Thanks for the confirmation
---
"MP5 is unaffected by the five second rule."
---
Nice, so that 11 mp5 trinket is amazing then, thank you :)
---
Much better than second wind. 300 mana burst every 15mins vs 132 mana every minute, no cd. Easy choice.
---
I'm never setting a foot in brd again. Ever. :)
---
The horde on Herod are so laughably bad its great. You guys never have to work for kills so you have no idea how to win i love it. I fear no man on the server, and often 2v1 peeps. Id say the faction balance is fair and balanced, you need more people for it to be fun for both sides
---
Alliance side is definitely not dead but I think we’re really starting to feel the difference. If the ratio favors Horde too strongly then yea, we’ll start to see more and more transfers in the upcoming weeks now that we’re down to a single layer.
---
I'd say the saddest part is that this is the first time I've seen it. More interestingly, every other time I've run this dungeon, I've done it with a group that no one else needed the trinket in...
---
I think you'll be OK in terms of consumables. 
---
I have first aid, I cook, and I definitely use bandages and etc. between pulls when I need them. These are mostly opportunity costs (because I'm using drops instead of selling cloth/meat). But I don't think you'll be digging yourself a financial hole by switching to Ele. You can definitely pot yourself crazy, but you can do that in any spec. 
---
You will need to bring water of some sort to instances, and that does have a cost, for sure, unless you're pals with a mage.
---
I ve seen complaints from reliable sources that the data bases sometimes don t coincide with the in-game spawns so I only listed the 'safer' path using it.
---
Maybe it’s something to do with being a cosmetic item?  It’s more of a novelty for rogues than an actual helm.
---
My favorite place is The Slaughtered Lamb. Just a bunch of warlocks hanging out in the basement, being shady and summoning demons.

Don't delete the toon lmao. 35+ is perfect for a profession mule.
---
I mean, jokes on you. You make the auction last longer, they will probably appear as first page anyways, if they set start bid as 1c, and for most items they will sell before the auction expire anyways.
---
If you are smart about it, you shouldn't be losing money on this. You should only do it on fast moving commodites, or low deposit cost items, which will cost you nothing to cancel.
---
Not saying rare instances like OP's screenshot doesn't happen, but most of the time it wont. Not in my experience at least.

I hate leveling, but thoroughly enjoy playing at max level, and I'm sure plenty of people feel the same way

I think you can only Enchant white items and above in vanilla/classic.
---
My favorite place in Classic is Shadowprey Village. So peaceful and serene there.
---
Not needed, but handy dandy and make things a little smoother.
---
Probably not helpful, but the only time I do healing assignments are for Domo, since there are a lot of tanks that need relatively equal healing, and for Rag, since you need to space healers so that everyone is in range of one.  The rest of the fights are easy enough that healing assignments aren't necessary.

This assumes its trivial to beg for and receive gold and it most definitely isn't.  Most people ignore or admonish people asking for gold--for good reason.

Happy to answer!

I'm not at my desktop PC [currently at work], but I can check when I get home. From what I recall, you can download from the Twitch App - but make sure you select the Classic 1.13.2 addon [if available].
---
The tooltip info should auto populate with the TSM desktop client. You'll never really see it running, it'll be in the taskbar below. This is assuming you're on a PC - didn't even think about that - but I made the assumption you weren't on a Mac.
---
When you scroll over the text into it should look something like this - [clicky](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fmedia%2FEFuxnP6X0AYIZ8F.png&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Ftsmaddon&amp;docid=AvUUTxOWUwZXKM&amp;tbnid=MFQcj-MEh_pJJM%3A&amp;vet=10ahUKEwiTvtfyxLXlAhUQ26wKHXLjB3IQMwhqKBowGg..i&amp;w=522&amp;h=450&amp;bih=898&amp;biw=1680&amp;q=tsm%20tooltip%20info%20wow%20classic&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTvtfyxLXlAhUQ26wKHXLjB3IQMwhqKBowGg&amp;iact=mrc&amp;uact=8). I pulled this off of the net, but I can upload a picture of mine tonight. From that screenshot you'll see the disenchant value, vendor value, and the TSM market info.  Min buyout = minimum buyout currently. Market value is the average over time cost of the item listed on the AH. Historical price is what it says - historical price of the item. Region Market and Region Historical is across the entire region [mine is NA].
---
I will say this also as a caveat. Some items, and some individuals like to skew a specific item. Lets say I wanted to set a CRAZY price for a more rare item -- like gorilla hair. I could keep buying out the item consistently and listing it at a tremendous markup. Newer people will see, oh my gosh I have this item - I can sell it for 50g because of what the tooltip said. Well that's someone inflating the market. That's when you look at the region market value to see if someone is trying to artificially inflate a value.  Again, questions - reach out - happy to talk about it.
---
It's a lot to take in, but well worth it to make you more efficient at the AH.
---
I like to spend my time playing the game, so learning all this before I had kids was a priority. Now, I spend minimal time at the AH - and most playing the game. It's great. Hope this helped!

Guilds trying to speed run MC are actually bringing several feral druids because their burst damage is very high. Keep spouting ignorance it's funny.
---
I'm pretty new to Classic and WoW in general. Can someone explain Tier 1, Tier 2 gear, etc. that I see a lot on this sub. Is it just really special raid gear that you find in dungeons via drops or something?
---
Disagree, but everyone is allowed there opinion
---
Intellect is not a super important stat for raid healing. With heal canceling regen is far more important, even if Druids dont benefit from spirit as much as others. 
---
You can find yourself using 3-4x your total mana pool during a bossfight ... at which point that extra starting mana is pretty insignificant.
---
Wait- who are you talking about?? I don't have the dagger. Just wondering why it doesn't look nearly as  good as it used to. If I did have it that wouldn't be bragging. dafuq?
---
I think most moonkins are bad so it skews how people look at them.  Just played with one last night in strath.  He would waste 5-6 seconds after a pull looking around for crates at 5%mana.  Then would walk up to the group, while everyones already drinking and ready to go, and starts drinking as the warrior charges in.  Hes just wasting everyones time, whether hes moonkin or not.
---
You are already hit capped for yellow damage, but not hit capped for white. It'll help your DPS some, and it'll also give you some more options if you decide to change other hit gear out for various stats.
---
This is pretty much it. I didn t list quite everything, because I m still testing a few, like Ludwig, Grail, Wholly etc.
---
Unless you are raiding I would say you are fine playing it. And even in most raids you can be carried by other dps, or just pretend to be resto spec and heal to get by. Honestly if you love it, play it, classic wow is the only iteration of wow where you can actually do meme specs and have fun
---
Yes I 100% agree. I think it could help but isn't the same as actually holding a managerial position or anything. 
---
But I honestly list that I can play piano and drums on a lot of resumes just to show I can learn different things and what not. It'd be kinda similar I think. It's a nice frill but wouldn't be a great thing to throw into your actual Job Experience section

Stranglethorn Vale, it's like Vietnam in the 60s at Nesingwary.

I’ve done full UBRS about 10 times and have never had any real issues. 1-2 wipes, but nothing that’s stopped the run. All as a PuG (I may have been a pickup to guild runs, didn’t pay close attention).
---
Only seen shoulders once, and never seen the skinning knife :(
---
Personally would go 30/0/21 so I can heal and dps when needed. Versatility is what makes druids so great. With this build you can do some solo wpvp while farming and heal/dps dungeons. Most likely in raids you will also heal as this spec.

Currently in the process of farming Ubrs for DAL Rend MH and TS Shoulders. I have 12% total hit atm, would Wyrmtongue Shoulders from Strat Live be considered on par or better than TS since I'm already over hit cap? Still need to upgrade my bow to either Blackcrow/Satyr from the Hinterlands quest bow so that's another +1 to hit.

Ice block really fucking annoys me. Saw a mage go to attack me so I blind them. You know.... a roughly 10 second fucking daze. Dude instantly uses ice block out of it then after 1 second in block comes out and fucks me up.

I applied to receive supervisor training at my job. I had to write an essay basically explaining why I am a good candidate and the basis of my essay was that I used to be a raid leader. Needless to say, I was chosen.
---
Druid would probably have the better leveling experience solo with their movement abilities and different forms. Priest leveling is pretty much Shadow Word Pain, then wand away.
---
IMHO I think priests are better for the PvP side of things. Druids are good don't get me wrong they are super hard to lock down and can do some damage in wPvP. But it feels like you are working 10x harder for that kill compared to other classes.
---
STV
---
Right, but could you put all the folders in a github link so we could just download that and stick it into our add ons folder? So others don't have to go and download 50+ things.
---
That seems to be a fairly common sentiment on reddit. Make one comment about being frustrated getting ganked in by 5 skulls continuously while trying to complete a quest and people just tell you to play PvE. I'm all for PvP but I don't go to Goldshire with 4 other level 60 friends and 1 shot random grey enemies and call it PvE.

Thanks for your input! I think the part where he described firemaw really just resonated with me as a casual, which tempted me a bit. But like you say, sucks to regret it a few months from now

Level an alt while he reaches your level

I believe it's their anti-cheat detection thing

Spriest leveling is super fast and the pvp potential is extremely fun. The phrase "melt faces" is absolutely true. That being said, that all starts at around lvl 40 when you can get shadowform. Before lvl 40 it will be a little boring.

That’s hilarious

Man I don't know what to say to you. You're arguing semantics with some stranger who has no say in how the rules are made. If you care this much why don't you ask the speed runners themselves why things are done the way they are instead of making convoluted arguments to win an argument with someone who has no stakes in this.

I’ve found that it doesn’t work for me as well, but I believe it has to do with your pet immediately attacking puts you in combat. I keep meaning to test it myself but possibly make a macro to put pet on passive when you fd

this is horrible trash talk
---
Ho boy if you dont think leveling is fun you are in for a loooong ride. The latest world record to get to 60 was around 72 hours for someone whose been speed running for years. But realistically it will take you atleast 240 hours on average if you have some basic knowledge of where to go for each level.
---
Sadley classic wow is a very very very tough and long grind to 60, infact most of the content you play will be leveling up

Are there any addons that let us track innkeepers, vendors, etc. on the minimap like we can do in Retail? Also any addons that do a drop down list of mob tracking for hunters?

Boooo

if youre enjoying druid keep playing it

nah dont feel bad.  you dont need every BiS to raid.  they are doing this because they want to not because they need to.

The orphanage in stormwind, crazy stuff is going on there...
---
The one bummer about Kur is the faction imbalance. Not the worst...but noticeably bad.
---
It has worked just fine for me, thus far. Obviously with a player-created database like this, it's not going to be 100% complete this early in the game, so occasionally you run into a node that isn't listed, but, at the very least, it gives you a general idea of where the nodes are.
---
I’ll hope op brought enough drugs to share

Nope, that's not him... this ones got a weird line through the o. Keep looking.

As in, “prices won’t be volatile”.  Prices will always fluctuate, but when the fluctuations are minor (relative to their usual value) and aren’t spiking super high and low, it’s classified as “normalized”.
---
Example: Righteous orbs. When classic first released, I’m sure the price of these was all over the place. But after a few weeks and as more entered the market, he price began to settle around an average. Maybe around 20g? Not the 50g or 40g or 80g it’d swing around prior. This is “normalized”
---
Of course they’ll be impacted by new content, such as essences of water recently or how nature resist pots will be with AQ coming, but they’ll re-settle around the old price (or maybe a new average price). Boom. Normalized.
---
Pretty sure swatter is another addon that tracks addon errors lol
---
I don’t see why Clique is a banned addon. Did you install it from the Twitch client?
---
I can do that. I'll put a link in the post once I'm done.

"Lets make BGs a worse experience for people for no reason"

Second Wind is still really good, +healing is a sort of pseudo-mana regeneration because you can downrank spells (aka spend less mana) while healing the same amount as before.  That said, they're both good trinkets so by all means skip BRD forever if you're tired of it.

Yup, I'm out here wishing I could one day ride a kodo but nah it's all g

Top 10 in parses when compared to others in their class. The BEST druid will not even do 1/3th of the damage of the best warrior.
---
As your friends are going Melee I would highly advise Shaman, as others have done already. Shamans get a Windfury totem that causes all melee (auto?)attacks to have a chance to strike twice.
---
Im just saying, its unfair to call the GM an Asshole just because he did his job.
---
Unless you have a dedicated healing leader doing the assignments in a healing channel before the bosses, you can do it for MC. There isn't much you need to assign.
---
The most I did during our first weeks clears was assign 2 healers to stay on the MT on fights like luci/gehannas, and tell them to dispel the tanks first. We always ran with 9-10 healers. Told dwarf priests to stay max range on Mag for fear ward. I also assigned a healer on sulfuron to watch the tank who moves up the hill out of LoS in the kill zone, and have the rest of the healers down by the mobs. And of course, early on, assign MT healing tanks for rag and spread the rest out carefully, especially watching melee. (if alliance, make sure you spread out your paladins for aura and keep people in their party near them) To your specific question, at most you usually assign MT healers, and the remaining healers are understood to be on offtanks/raid healing.
---
Other than that, most of MC doesn't require healing assignments, and after a few weeks in there you don't need to really talk to your healers, other than watching their mana to keep the pace of pulling trash fast. When you get to much harder content, either a healing leader or you will 100% need to assign healers to things.

Scalebeard's Cave in Aszhara.  It was where I went to finish leveling fishing.  The atmosphere of Azshara is so serene, and the island is so secluded that it just feels so comfy.  I could just fish for hours.  Occasionally, Scalebeard himself would show up like an old friend ready to reminisce.  It feels like my own private island.
---
Then it Cataclysm the goblins put their city on top of it.
---
I mean, I'm going to talk shit groups of 60s that grief low level players. There is 0 skill involved, it's not an actual accomplishment. Yes it is part of the game but being able to camp 1 level 40 with a party of 5 level 60s is the equivalent of 5 adults walking onto a playground and jumping a teenager and then bragging about how tough they are.
---
Yes! Very excited!
---
Just curious, did this turn out to be a case of hacking/cheating by the person who gifted you the item?
---
I was under the impression there was no such thing as a banned addon. If the addon works and is just an addon (no 3rd party apps) then it's allowed.  Is this not the case?
---
And lots and lots of drugs
---
I mean at first they just kindly asked him not to pull so fast. Constructive criticism does not equal whining. If he didn't want to tank he should have just said no.
---
Things on resume's are often unproveable and intangible in terms of responsibility. 
---
I was never saying they'd accept this as actual job experience or that if this is all you presented that you'd get the job. But as far as things you could spin into talking about your skills you 100% could use this. I often say I was percussion section leader in Band in High School. I talk about how I led and what things I learned by doing that. The band director doesn't work there anymore and I have no idea how to contact them. It was an unofficial position so there's no records of it in the school. They might  be able to prove I was in band but that's about it. I've had lengthy convos in interviews about it and could have been lying the whole time.
---
This would be something you threw on as an extra skill at a job you think might have some context for what your'e talking about. In the interview they might ask about it (just like they might ask me about percussion section leader) and then you describe how it works and what skills you needed to use, what lessons you learned ect.. 
---
&gt;Of course they're not going to give you a job based on them.
---
Of just them? No of course not. Could it help? Ya in the right context it for sure could help.
---
You, sir are the true MVP, I been thinking to find this exact comic when I saw t2 gnome warrior.
---
I think a lot of the early hate on Druid was people posting incorrect builds. You won't outperform a priest in terms of raw healing, or a warrior in terms of raw tanking, or a rogue in terms of raw dps. However, you don't need to with 0/30/21, a build I literally never saw IcyVeins or Wowhead publicize, despite it being *the* build back in the day. With a HotW build, you're able to perform whatever role is needed in a group without bleeding yourself dry in respec costs. PuG's just trying to fill dps slots? Put on your Wolfshead helm and MCP and hop in. Massive tank shortage causing people to get real desperate? Grab a Warden's Staff, pick up your Mark of Tyranny, make some cash tanking. Same with heals. As a druid, you don't do any one thing well, but by being flexible between all three roles you're able to offer a lot to your PuGs.
---
Also levelling a priest is ass. It's way easier to level a druid to 60, and you'll still be able to heal dungeon content about as well as they can.
---
As an alliance, I wish I could try out Shaman.
---
The perks of being a druid. The 1 resto druid in my guild got like 4/8 this week in MC.
---
Oh for sure, Kalimdor is probably a nightmare with PvP. Tons of areas alliance (mostly elves) can theoretically go to tend to be more convenient for the Horde, especially often because of flight paths.
---
Good luck pug'ing the first boss of BWL...it'll only get cleared by the private server people who already have a strat down since organization is 90% of that fight.
---
https://i.imgur.com/tTc9cKQ.gif
---
well the reason i say elemental water is because the pools are named "pool of elemental water"
---
Just FYI, having more raid groups and a bigger guild is not necessarily a good thing... once BWL comes out, you will start seeing cracks between the raid groups. Something to keep an eye out for
---
&gt; Annihilator would be the best of the best in terms of BiS.
---
This is not the case. Annihilator's proc rate is 1/5th of what it was on Nost, it is not even worth using.
---
if you are stealth + pickpocket &gt; cheap shot with macro you are not losing too much health while leveling. also grinding green mobs.
---
Good on ya. One suggestion: replace those sit ups with [planks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSHjTRCQxIw). Your abs are stabilizer so muscles so this will do more for them.

Awesome - thanks!

Orc Warriors are the only people I won't gank.

Doesn't elemental water ah for around what it vendors for?
---
Essence of water is @20g each on my server but elemental water is like 5s
---
I am a tank, just not main specced.
---
I don't lose threat, others do hence my comment. Also I play fury which is superior threat to begin with. 
---
Taunts are kinda meh, mocking blow works to boost threat since you can taunt at the last second to overtake threat generated during those 6 seconds. But losing aggro to a melee means that the melee dps is dead because the boss will parry all the the other melees and insantly kill the dps with insant swings.
---
Comments like this seem to assume this would be the only thing discussed in the interview. 
---
This isn't his resume. You don't go into a job interview with 1 example of your experience. In my mind this is like an extra little skill you throw on the bottom AFTER all your job experience. Maybe it gets talked about in the interview cause they ask, maybe they don't care about it and dont' ask. 
---
The point is things like this can't hurt you unless your answers to the questions hurt you. How you talk about your skills is sometimes more important than how hard the skills actually are.
---
Which of these were able to remove the Dragon UI on the bottom action bar like that?

You can also just say \*\*\*\* it, I'm warrior DPS, and stand your ground. Yes it's not as easy finding groups as DPS, but you are your own person, you have Agency.
---
Hunters are fine DPS. Their DPS doesn't grind to a halt when they run out of mana, so that's awfully nice compared to squishy clothies who are sometimes made useless.
---
I agree with you, but since I'm mostly a dps, +heal is rarely useful for me. 
---
And yeah... BRD has become a living nightmare for me haha. Dropped Second Wind 7 times (9% drop rate) and lost the roll every single time, mostly to offspecs or not bis (ele shaman, mage, etc.)
---
Lots of times where I got scammed, did arena/anger as a healer and tank left group after we downed anger. Or tank intentionally letting me die during anger mob wave so he could call a reset while I walk and said it would have been a waste of time to wait... TWICE.
---
Some people must be tired of seeing this, I mentioned it like 4 times on /r/classicwow lol.
---
There are still server migrations for skeram available right now.
---
Hunters do fine dps and are great for soloing and farming.
---
Get the glove enchant as well as the knife so you can skin Onyxia too.

Yeah cause that macro only casts Berserker rage when you're in the stance already so you have to double tap. If you do them sequentially it tries to do them both at the same time and it works for some reason.

I transferred from Mograine to Bloodfang and never looked back! It was a bit quiet when I first moved (around one month ago) but it's fine now and is actually exactly how I remember my original vanilla server being population-wise.

I can't speak for Earthshaker but if you want to know anything about guilds etc on Bloodfang then I'd be happy to answer your questions!

Simple but gear/dps checks exponentially grow.

If you have good dps you’ll be fine in bwl and beyond.

 Not even whining more like, why cant alliance understand people lvling like how you’re trying to tell people not to attack Ally leveling, but yet nothing from Alliance players telling others not to gank low level horde players
---
Smolderweb is pretty damn balanced as well.
---
Yes. The "Go to Retail" /spit spam is certainly not bragging or a sense of accomplishment/superiority. I understand it is part of the game and have no problems with it nor do I think it should be "fixed" in any fashion. I'm simply pointing out that while you have every right to find a bunch of high level friends to terrorize a low level area I have just as much of a right to talk shit about the people who do this. They are trash at the game and no amount of killing players 20+ levels lower than them with a group will change that.

That would be awesome! I certainly appreciate you taking an extra minute to help others.

Don't listen to the dude above you. It's elitist talk trying to keep you on big servers for the no lifers to farm you in P2. Just look into a couple realms and transfer to the one you think you would like. I moved from a huge server to a smaller one and guess what? Now it's pretty big too and there's tons of progression happening and it's still a great server. If you aren't happy on the huge hardcore realms, you would defintrly enjoy the more relaxed vibes of a smaller server.
---
This is my mage experience. My group has no problem in dangeons. I control mobs not letting them run around and taking them from healers to the tank if needed.

Huh, sounds like times have changed

Yeah i can for sure but I'm just not a fan of melee dps haha and all my friends are melee dps so just fighting for gear sounds like a nightmare... I regret going warrior and wasting my time with it but it's whatever haha

How???

Well they arent supposed to be able to compete with pure dps classes....that would just be ridiculous.  A bunch of moonkin who do the same damage as mages, but also have combat rez's, 3% party crit buffs, innervate, and the ability to off-heal??

Someone get a Gatorade, this man has an extreme thirst.
---
Thats what I mean. I'm more of an outlier than the norm and I if still have a ton of stuff to do, I have no clue how someone closer to 50th percentile would have run out of stuff.

Hunters have consistently been the top dps class in raiding with my guild. It's anecdotal, sure, but the raid group is pretty decent, and I as one of the hunters don't at all consider myself an expert. I think if nothing else, you can pretty much guarantee doing well enough to be accepted into raids (probably better).
---
My favorite place is Deadmines. I'm horde this go round so haven't gotten to go there and I miss it so!
---
I would definitely recommend hitting 60 before doing this. It will allow you to get much closer to mobs without aggroing. You will also need at least 250 lockpicking for the boxes. Movement speed enchant on boots is also a nice bonus.
---
Is that because you Vendored the item? This page might be helpful, it's information on item restoration:

I think the term meta is a bit older than gaming although it's very commonly used in gaming
---
&gt; (of a creative work) referring to itself or to the conventions of its genre; self-referential. 
---
The "meta" or the "meta-game" describes the current strategies the majority of the playerbase is using for a given situation/game/etc.
---
Going against the meta or non-meta generally refers to a suboptimal strategy. For example, most raids only take 1 enhancement shaman into molten core. Taking more than 1 would widely be considered non-meta and quite suboptimal.
---
Just as a side note, Metagaming is a term used in roleplaying games to describe using knowledge your character doesn't have. e.g: You're playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons and another player steals from your character without you noticing. Accusing his character of stealing would be "metagaming" as your character never noticed the theft, it's knowledge that only the player has.
---
Right. Because they’ve had the same done to them. Over. And over. And over. And over.
---
Just dismiss until you get food.
---
ElvUi classic takes a good bunch of these and consolidates them in to one...
---
Duel, rank 1 curse then they start. He had no problem kiting within the duel range
---
kill Pyro and Guzzler.. u get more gold
---
I have no idea - that is one of my questions. It was on there less that 10 seconds before he bought it - I didn’t even have time to switch tabs and cancel the auction!
---
Only to get killed by the rogue as soon as he leaves the lava.
---
This is the right way to get off boat.
---
Im doing this every time i travel with boat 😂
---
Mouse is hovered over the ring but your Boot stats come up.
---
You don't actually have the bracers yet, those are Flimsy Chain Bracers, I'm onto you.
---
Lmao I didn't even notice.  I had to go back and look...and I have no idea why, because it's not like the name means anything to me.  Being human is weird.
---
If you think it’s getting bad with multiple raid group drama now... lol... implosion imminent come BWL I guarantee it
---
The rotation is just pushing starfire over and over again, soo....
---
Insect swarm should be used in raids imo.  I also used it on my druid back in the day.  Tank gets hit less = more mana for the healers.
---
And yes resto druids can easily get swarm too, but why not have a moonkin do it since they have the bonus dmg?
---
Meth, not even once
---
No, I was totally unaware that other items drop./s
---
So if a warrior gets to reserve an item, he will simply pass on other warrior items? No, he will still roll greed or even need on everything else in said dungeon.
---
I don't think Holy Shock is good at all with a 30 sec CD and the mana cost. It seems like hardly a loss at all.
---
Leatrix
---
How many of them were active for 10 straight years? Or even 5?
---
Been leveling a rogue off an on and sitting at around 45 or so.
---
Some things to keep in mind: 
---
Rogues are very weapon dependent. Pretty much all your abilities rely on your main hand weapon, so the stronger it is the better you will do. 
---
You will be face tanking a lot while questing, and many times you will win a fight by the skin of your teeth. Make sure you grab Cooking/Fishing/First Aid, this will help limit your downtime as well as make it easier to save money for your mount at 40.
---
I would highly advise also building towards combat swords. At least until you are lvl 30. At that point you can respec into Subtlety to get Hemo if you want a more stealthy build.
---
2. +mp5 gear gives it every 5 seconds, no exceptions. Same for +hp5
---
I mean that's pretty accurate.  Think about the leadership skills and personality type required to lead a successful raid guild. Those traits can transfer over in to the corporate world.
---
Did all that in the last 2 months? Nice! You must die alot. :)
---
Why DE? You can sell them on the AH..
---
How many private servers were active for more than 5 years straight no resets?
---
My sub ends tomorrow and I'm not renewing because there's no bgs
---
Im a former horde player on a diferent server and its the same over there, im afraid the queues for bgs are gonna be really long and the world pvp is gonna be non existent.
---
So im currenly looking for a server to level an alliance while we wait for the pvp fases and raid log my horde account.
---
Is this a promising server to do that?
---
We are a grp of 8 friends.
---
Sorry its not an answer for your question but when are you using AotM honestly? After i got my pet at level 10 i took it off my hotbar. When do you need 18% dodge? Are you survival? You should always be in ranged combat so melee cant reach you. If they come into range, than raptor strike them then GTFO of melee range, or better yet wing clip. Changing aspects will only eat your mana. 
---
Just stay in hawk for fights, after the fight switch to cheetah to run to other mobs. Then change back to hawk, place a trap, hunter mark your target, sit and drink if you have to, have pet start combat, engage when full mana and pet has full aggro. Just trying to be helpful
---
Back in earlier days most people even rock blues for entire classic. It is a very different picture today, you will absolutely get destroyed if you don't run raids since pugs full clear are as common as retail LFR
---
Details -&gt; Gear -&gt; Window Control -&gt; New Window -&gt; Gear (New Window) -&gt; Raid Plugins -&gt; Tiny Threat
---
That's to get it to show up. Once it's on your screen, it should just work out of the box as long as other people have Tiny Threat (Built into Details) installed.
---
The top bar will show approximately at how much threat you'll pull aggro and ideally the tank's name will be just below that (otherwise someone is pulling aggro shortly)
---
Just keep an eye on your name and make sure it's not sitting above the tank or heading towards the approximate threat to pull aggro. If you're going to be dumping a lot of cooldowns, you may want your tank to generate a few thousand threat first.
---
The accuracy will vary since it's guesstimating based on the combat log and other players' combat logs, so if they're missing the addon it will reduce how useful it is.
---
This is what you should do. Also, your pet has to be at loyalty level 1 and unhappy for awhile to run away. If your pet is at loyalty level 1, you haven't had it long enough to care about losing it unless it's rare.
---
Only map addon I've found like this is [Carbonite](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/carbonite-classic).
---
As for a drop down list for mob tracking, I'd recommend. [OPie](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/opie).

The BiS meta is the new gear score, ilvl, achievements, e-penis, elitest bullshit.

I hate all that shit.

Yeah but I'm a loser so I get anxious about cooking meals, the longer it takes to cook the longer I put it off. Also I'm a huge pothead, so I'd have to quit smoking to actually have money instead of hitting up food banks and filling in the blanks with $20-30. I save on cigarettes by emptying out a couple ashtrays every week, smoke it loose from my bong with my pot. I spend ~$100/m on weed. The rest all goes to rent. Need to find meds that work but I'm too anxious to call my doctor. Took me like 8 months to make an appointment last time. Doesn't help that I wake up and don't remember what the hell I was planning on doing until 2 hours have passed because I'm so focused on getting stoned, checking media pages and putting off making food until it starts to make me puke up stomach acid when I take a hit of tobacco. My dick has rug burn from masturbating so much and all I can do is laugh at what a pathetic piece of shit I am. There's nobody in my life but me, and I clearly don't care. Truthfully I don't think there is a medication that can fix this. Maybe better parenting and earlier therapy could have made me more functional. But I've never really wanted anything except to have fun with people I like. Other people just want to have fun with people who have money. I don't want to get money. I don't want to compete. I want to cooperate. Yet here I am, all alone and tearing myself apart. Broke. Inside, outside and in the deepest and darkest depths of my bank account. Time to smoke a bong.
---
You sound pretty geared.   Have them put you as a tank healer instead of a raid healer and you won't have to worry about being sniped so much.
---
Yeah but the difference between your argument and the speedrun ruleset is that at no point did anyone state that they were doing a 100m race and then just started at the 90m mark with no explanation.
---
The starting point of a MC speedrun is agreed upon: When Lucifron is pulled the run has started, Everyone who's competing agreed on the same rule set. They clear the same amount of mobs on their way to Lucifron. This has no impact on competition, it just goes against your personal expectations of what the run should be.
---
Which is why I said that this is an argument of semantics. The starting point has no discernible impact on competition because everyone's starting point is the same.
---
Most of the time it was 1 or 2 other grinders, very rarely had a full group of 'em
---
Is there a good program for classic simulations? I constantly find myself wanting info like this haha
---
Which is why it can have its flaws. There are times when someone has so much saved up that you have zero chance at an item.
---
What server do you play on where someone begging for 2g wouldn't either get ignored or mocked into oblivion? Even bags depending on what your definition of decent is. Gold in classic is sparse and practically everything is a gold sink.
---
Anyone who played both Hunter and Rogues? I want to be finally decide what to main. I'm casual playing solo 95% of time trying to aim probably pre-raid BIS and on a PVP server so planning to wpvp along the way
---
I thought this too, but when I tried to open a ticket there is a disclaimer that they won't handle loot disputes or distribution issues.   I'm almost 100% sure though that this wans't always the case.
---
Stranglethorn Vale - When i first wentthere i was only 11 years old and kept getting ganked soooo much i rolled  a rogue. Got my first taste for PVP... And i loved it :)
---
1 hour later:

---
This has been my first experience of what everyone means by the 'Classic Community'!
---
Rogue isn’t hard to level at all. I kept hearing prior to launch how Rogue was the 2nd worst leveler besides Warrior but after I got a few pieces of gear from quests very early on and kept my weapons updated I found Rogue to be very easy and efficient to level.
---
This is completely stupid. If you don't warm up and prepare your body, you're going to get injured doing those exercises. Especially if overweight.
---
How's calling out whataboutism related to being valid, whatever that means?
---
Fookin kneelers
---
Tirisfal Glades for lore reasons.
---
Amazing thank you for the info. I probably still wont use cleave because I irrationally hate it but this is gonna be great.
---
Do you swap to berserker to hit the skill that increases rage gain when hit?
---
For Atlas, you need the base addon as well as the Classic Plugin.
---
Rogue fasho
---
We had a Druid almost fully geared from a single MC run. We have only 1 Druid in the guild. So few druids in general.
---
Any workable CC helps, so, rogue, hunter, mage or priest, or even warlock void tanking.  CC the white ghost, kill the rest first. 
---
Also there are invisible ghosts too, and they tend to get pulled as extra adds in the first pull. If you get a see invis buff you can pull them separately.
---
there is no 'U' in the word "Honored". Honestly surprised you didn't add an 'H' to "Exalted" as well.
---
Stockades- need I say more? Who DOESN'T love that place. Easy to get the quests. Easy to get a group. Easy to get to. Easy to complete the instance. I mean what's not to love?
---
 Yeah mine hits for ~700 almost every time.
---
I get what you're saying. I've tried explaining it. Heck, I've made macros so I don't have to type it out. That's how often this happens. It just gets frustrating. The dps that learn and listen are great. Those are the real gems and I always friend list them if they are cool with it.
---
It's just beyond frustrating when I'm putting forward 110% effort and just getting shit on by pugs
---
I would like to see a Warrior leveling at say 28 pull 3 equal level mobs and come out ok. 
---
My Warrior is only 22 but if he gets 3 on him he is toast.
---
Roll the alt in the guild you love and move the hunter to a guild with a raid spot for you.
---
You're partially in the wrong here. You should be talking to the DPS.
---
Assuming he isn't prot spec, he is correct in that he can only reliably tank 2-3 mobs at a time, and he should focus on the elites. He has taunt and mocking blow but mocking blow is on a 2 min CD. What will happen if he tries to tank those mobs off you is he will lose threat on the elites then it just becomes a shit show. Even if he charges thunder claps, demo shouts and whirlwinds that's not enough threat on all mobs to prevent them from coming after the healer after a few heals.
---
It is purely DPS responsibility to kill those non elites or kite them. Mage Frost Nova, Hunter Frost trap, or just burst the mobs down.
---
What kind of gear do you need to pull this off?
---
it's called Mik's scrolling battle text.
---
also, in interface options, under combat, there's enable  combaty text but i couldn't see an option to help you.
---
You realize my problem is damage dealers assuming the healers can keep them alive right? I get your point but you aren't really contributing to that conversation
---
My favorite place in Classic WoW is The Lion's Pride Inn, Goldshire. I remember trekking down from Northshire Abbey with my freshly minted level 6 Paladin, seeing all my fellow adventurers running about in the town. From the moment I stepped into the inn, the music and the ambience brought together and cemented the atmosphere of the journey together and I found myself admiring the decor and taking a seat by the cozy fire in the hearth.
---
Yeah the gear is to take and do more damage. Elite mobs you gotta us VW and have a healthstone up just in case. It gets easier at 30 since you get Siphon Life, an extra dot that ups your dps a bit and heals you. Warlock isnt the best for soloing elites at low levels but they are still good cause if you have room you can just fear and put dots up and kite.
---
For the gear portion the best to worst for attributes is  Shadow Damage&gt;Spellpower&gt;Stamina&gt;Spirit&gt;Intellect.
---
Re read the blizzard post, he even confirms im doing it right
---
You're still special dawg
---
Mage for example can break your freezing trap with ice block and gnomes and undead can break IT with their race ability too.
---
That's the second best behind undead bloodfang rogue
---
I did. We aren't talking about pve.
---
Lost a ton of weight and got in shape since classic came out. Switched to keto diet and row until I burn 500 calories every day monday-friday with weekends as restitution. It's been great. It's still surreal to me how much fat you can eat while your body weight plummets due to the near zero carb intake. 10/10 diet would recommend to anyone who wants to lose weight without feeling starved. Just don't cheat on the diet because the slightest rise in insulin will put a fat-loaded body from fat burner to storage mode.
---
So let me get this straight- literally only an actual photograph of a real-world female would ever illicit a sexual response from you? There's no drawing or artistic rendering that you would ever find stimulating?
---
No, not really. Rain of fire just isn't as good. Your only option is to contribute to AoE instancing by using Sacrifice to shield yourself from your Hellfire's reflect damage. That's not really doable by yourself though since if you're solo you're guaranteed to be taking all of the damage since you can't AoE root/slow, so they'll just pop your bubble and then clobber you along with the Hellfire damage.
---
Shadow priest is a breeze to level and face melty in pvp.
---
I'd wager that most people are still not 60.
---
Paladin *IS* that slow, however.
---
Thats why I went alliance.
---
On my server (Faerlina) everyone hangs out in Ironforge and only goes to Stormwind to get the buff, so SW is usually pretty dead except for around raid time.
---
[Spoiler](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/living-yourself-tom-brady-cameo-explained-1248674)
---
Just grind. Turn on your favorite show or tunes and just farm a spot. Embrace the monotony.
---
Ohhhh great point my dude! I never considered consumables! Man how did you get so much knowledge!?
---
IRONFORGE
---
I would like to know the location of this fishing spot.
---
I disagree with your comment about grays. I'm at 56, working the Plagulands, and a lot of grays vendor for 1g+.
---
Wait. You can raise lock picking by pick pocketing mobs?
---
Lots of good ones. Krol blade ($$$), any of the BS weapons (Dark Iron $$), Mass of McGowen or Sword of Zeal ($$), Assassination blade($).  
---
im assuming you're human so..  
---
From Diremaul, CHo'Rush and Timeworn mace. Scholo Mirah's, hammer of the vesper.  
---
or Ironfoe :b
---
Set a goal to grind furbolg rep for medicine pouch or something, you should be close to 60 by the time you complete it.
---
Ya im getting to that point too
---
cheers
---
I like rogue but i feel its easier to farm and get groups for dungeons on hunter. Getting pre raid bis without having a tank friend is rough as its super hard to get groups.
---
Blackrock Depths is the most iconic dungeon and best place in the game .
---
Dude, I'm pulling for you. Get the help you need and get better. You can do it, good luck!
---
Ah ok, rock on thanks!
---
Nature resist sends a greeting
---
They drop in the DM Tribute chest
---
what do you mean how??? It's obvious he spent much time farming gold, as hes yet not even 60.
---
Maybe just grind on your own for a bit? You can take a break anytime and get some progress. It might be slow and a bit boring, but you're gonna get to 60 if you stay consistent for a few weeks!
---
More or less in the same vein, when you're riding the boat from Auberdine to Menethil Harbor you can jump off a tad before it reaches the deck when it gets very close to the beach.
---
It is the healers job to keep everyone alive.  You're claiming their bad gear makes that hard or impossible but people did mc sub 60 with greens so that's a ridiculous stance to take.   Having a few green pieces with no stam isn't a huge deal
---
I know, neither was I. Also, everything I said still applys.
---
Warrior is only slow if you level solo. I leveled exclusively in dungeons (like most ppl it seems) and warrior is one of the fastest. Mage - priest &gt; Warrior - Shaman &gt; the rest. Don't know about ally.
---
Umm. Did you not read the post? Im not doing an intense workout each time i die. Im pretty sure im not going to get injured for doing a couple of sit ups and push ups. You really dont need to be a negative nancy.
---
Our guild had both halfs drop on tuesday on grobbulus as well!
---
It's a caster weapon :p
---
Sometimes spells like sap, fear and polymorph breaks early in PvP. Probably the same for trap.
---
Normal servers???
---
Of course horde (which there are more of, will down vote :))
---
It’s not about attacking, it’s about using mana, so wand is fine, and skills like inner focus that give you a 0 mana cost cast are also fine. I think there are some trinkets that do the same but they may be later phase or even tbc. 
---
Mp5 ignores 5 sec rule and you’ll get that mana regardless of if you are in the 5 sec rule or not.
---
I don't recall the specific details, but most (long-term) CC abilities are nerfed in PvP.
---
You need to solo kill 100 elites without a party then it will be granted to you automatically
---
Freezing Trap will usually last 15 seconds and is subject to DR.  If you use scatter before Trap, it will usually last around 7.5 seconds.  Many will equip Skull of Impending Doom when facing hunters to break trap early as well.
---
As opposed to getting carried through a dungeon...?
---
Neat Plates
---
You can farm gold on anything but AoE farming on warlock is bad since you dont really get AoE CC besides fears. If you specifically want to AoE farm make a mage. If you want to farm other ways Warlock is your guy.
---
gno gnomo bro
---
Majestic
---
Wowhead spells it out well. You get 1 AP, 2 armor, 0.034% crit (29 agi for 1% crit) and 0.069 dodge (14.5 agi for 1% dodge).
---
You get 1 DPS for 14 AP so 1 dps for 14 agility, so the 20-30 agility you get from enchants won't be doing much. It's going to be like 2 DPS and 1% crit.
---
It will be a decent DPS gain until level 20 or so, but just keeping your weapon up to date will give you a massive increase in damage compared to the raw stats from enchants.
---
Rank 6 battle shout is 232. The talent is for 25%. That's 58 attack power for you and the 3 other melee in your raid group (plus whatever %buffs to AP you have). If you think that equals 2 dps and is not worth over an increase of 60 damage on an ability you don't use in raids until Naxxish time then you truly clueless. 
---
Also
---
&gt;Sweeping strikes costs 30 rage and effectively offers 5 extra swings.
---
This is incorrect.
---
&gt;An empowered cleave costs 20 and is worth 3 swings.
---
This is incorrect
---
&gt;Yes, that’s right, for 10 less rage and one gcd you’ve already negated half of the entire suite that is the aoe god known as arms.
---
&gt;But I’m sure you’ve actually tried 2H fury and I’m sure you’re aware than 60 extra damage on cleave is the difference in damage between BRE and arcanite reaper.
---
This is BIG incorrect and hilarious that this is how you think damage works on weapons.
---
You are truly clueless and I feel bad for anyone who listens to your advice on warrior.
---
Also, lets just settle this now. Link your parses.
---
Come to Earthfury!
---
Perfectly sized.
---
Devilsaur set 130g right now.
---
&gt; skills like inner focus that give you a 0 mana cost cast are also fine
---
Ohhh that's right! Good point. thx.
---
Maybe we'll pvp some day lol
---
I can only commit to questing when my kids are awake.
---
Mages can solo quest pretty quickly with the right build.
---
I'd suggest either leveling an alt and let your mage build rested exp, or possibly changing your mage spec to give you a fresh feel.
---
Good luck with the baby. Shit starts to get real once they learn how to walk.
---
Oh also, I found some middle ground by letting my babies nap in my lap while I quest.
---
Even though I'm playing Alliance for Classic, my favorite place in the game is Mulgore.
---
I'm in the US and still no sub remaining for me lol
---
Trap the pet and kite the demon all the way around the lake
---
Well that just reinforces my point in that there's no point in picking professions for their "synergy". It only made sense back when black lotus was BOP.
---
I'm hoping for enough fallout by P3 that we'll just have the groups we have currently. The issue is more having 150 raiders and only 120 raid spots with 2/3s of the extras being mages and hunters. So far it's working out because MC and Ony are so easy that it's just as easy to pug it but I reckon it'll get pretty bad if BWL is a progress raid.
---
I mean WPL and EPL are your best bet,  Maybe try a few quests out in Winterspring. If those are done Unfortunately your best bet is the instance grind to 60, Just make sure when you log off you do so in a INN, cause if you log out for about 15 hours or so you'll have about 5-6 bars of rested XP.  Maybe do some EMP runs or Arena/Anger since those are quick BRD runs and don't take much time.
---
Thrash blade works fine till you get dal rends. I would focus on doing MC for Brutality Blade and doing rend runs.
---
Try hard and elitism in classic is idiotic, we a bunch of ungeared plebs with no experience cleared ony and MC in a day yesterday. Mostly are people with vices from private server it seems.
---
Thats fantastic. I've been looking into a keto diet myself.
---
Shaman is the only real choice for that combo of classes.
---
I should've phrased it differently. I was specifically talking about questing alone, which I've been told, is pretty painful for Holy. But it obviously excels at healing in dungeons, which makes it great if that is your primary method of leveling.
---
u aren't alone on this. KEEP YER FEET ON DA GROUND
---
It doesn't matter if there are any parents in guild. Wow is the place where after you find a group nobody wants to have afkers in there. Those who start groups got some time to play right now, they don't want their play time shorten because you go afk often.
---
This is how it looks after they did an update to various weapon graphics in vanilla. Your pics on the left are the original graphics but at some point they updated them (during Vanilla) and Classic is running the version after that update. I remember this because I had Staff of Dominance on my mage, which looked like Staff of Jordan, and one day it was changed when I logged in to look as it does now.
---
So no bug, you’re just remembering the time in vanilla before they made a few graphics tweaks but Classic is after that time.
---
What a time to be alive!
---
God that's a mess. Auto correct.  So sorry to anyone who read that.
---
Damn son such a good healer ring Gratz bro
---
Honoured with the "u" is the correct spelling in most of the world.
---

---
Was hoping to avoid deleting the char if possible, so was going to simply move realms! even though I don't want to play it, seems daft deleting 2 high levels!
---
You can make a macro for that  that will work everytime with 1 press of a button... lmao, what a silly reason to reroll
---
From Sunnhordland?
---
Gooooot 'emmmmmm
---
I'm convinced they only wrote the lore they way they did so they could redesign Darnassus.
---
good to know, sadly, pvp server!
---
Oooooooh she thought you called her enchanting. Clever!
---
"Even when leveling as a Feral druid, you'll be forced into healing for groups all the time"
---
Uh, nope. I even keep a healing set on me at all times just in case, but I've never once in my 50 levels been asked to heal. I'm also running a utility spec (no LotP) and nobody seems to give a shit.
---
I think a lot of the classism and spec persecution is straight-up imagined.
---
It's the most efficient way yes. Lashers in DME
---
STV - Always up for a good fight
---
Oh yeah i know, i missread thought you were disenchanting the bracers and belts lol my bad
---
Time to grind in Winterspring my dude. You can do 56-60 there no problem.  If you do it on rested it’s really not bad at all. Still not too bad without it rested either.
---
The upside down bodys flotting on hooks room. I ghosted im to there way back in vanilla and was like wtf are they setting up here
---
Huh, TIL.
---
Bosses cannot be stunned. How did you assume I'm talking about dungeon tanking when its rather obvious I'm discussing raid bosses.
---
So a quick taunt wont matter because the person who overaggroes will get instantly clapped with 2-3 melee swings from the boss which is insant death for any DPS (unless your raid comp is heavily ranged focused).
---
Again, shield slam is inferior to fury threat and even with defiance, crit/hit gear and revenge threat will be difficult to maintain unless you're bottlenecking the DPS (hence DW tanking). There is a reason why builds like Threat tanks and DW tanks came around and its not because threat isn't an issue (unless your dps is bad like I explained before).
---
If you disagree feel free to do so but don't say "trust me" if you aren't already an expert on threat.
---
On the offchance this isn't going to get me banhammered then, got around 1k gold on Noggenfogger horde EU. wanting to go to any high pop eu server :P (pvp ideally) :P
---
Until you 5v1 someone because they're on a node or quest item you require. Or you take up 5 slots on a server with a queue instead of 1.
---
I just smoke haha.
---
Got a similar reaction with a lvl 30 warrior. It feels good man
---
RANK 6 IS 232 LMAO IM DEAD
---
Imagine me actually getting trolled by someone who doesn’t even play warrior. Holy moly.
---
Games gonna die in Phase 2 if Blizzard doesn't get their shit together. 
---
World PvP fights being a lagfest, people constantly getting gibbed by all the bugs and batched constantly, people are very quickly going to rage quit.
---
Who wants to go R14 in such a clunky mess Classic is. By then, no one will care about MC/Ony as they have geared out and the content is completely pointless, so all there is is this shit I wouldn't even call "PvP". Just Player vs shitty game mechanics and servers.
---
&gt; They can also be equipped on the spot as an actual upgrade. Why rob someone in your group of that opportunity for your own personal greed?
---
They can also be taken by that person and thrown on the AH, after they swore they'd equip it.
---
And for the last time:  **Asking to be treated fairly is not greed.**
---
If an item drops that everyone can use, then everyone should roll on it.  Period.  Because they've earned it.
---
You know what's greedy?  Telling people that they shouldn't be allowed to have an upgrade that they earned, because you want to equip an upgrade right there on the spot.
---
This isn't complicated.
---
&gt; currently level 37
---
Oh boy are you in for a treat
---
Humanoids that are our level or lower.
---
Yeah and when pvp trinkets are out you’re never killing another rogue again lol
---
i've just installed Dominos and configured my action bars to look pretty snazzy.  I wanted to setup some more keybinds for some skills.
---
But dominos lists the bars as Bar 1, Bar 2, Bar 3, etc.
---
WoW keybinds screen lists them as Bottom Left, Bottom Right, etc.
---
Is there a better way to configure certain buttons to certain keys without trial and error running through every bar 1 by 1?
---
Thanks! I’ll play around with it
---
As a feral druid, I so wish I could get the rogue DM trinket instead because our class trinket is useless for me..
---
I'm on a lower pop pve server. I have never ganked anyone. Anything else?
---
Just a quick question. What if their name plates are red?
---
There is no magic medication, but there are therapies like Cognitive Behavioral therapy. Pull the trigger and call the doctor, don't put it off.  
---
Go for a long ass run until you're so exhausted you don't care about being anxious, then give the doctor a call. 
---
Check out /r/leaves if you need support with your pot addiction too, I'd def try to lower/drop it.
---
It’s been bugged and acknowledged by blizz.. thanks though
---
I mean you can still play with players with the way I play (say you run into someone else in the world leveling)  you can play with them, or just play with guild mates if you're in that kind of guild... although I do agree that it depends on what kind of experience you're looking for,  I personally found great entertainment in farming for the bags, giving greens to players with only whites, doing dungeons every once and a while, even questing... although this also depends on what class you chose, I chose shaman so it might be different capabilities for your character.
---
Entered MC from BRD to evade death from mobs while doing attunement with 2 friends (none had save). Later in the day we joined the guild raid and we couldn't get in because we had different raid lockouts (checked the numbers and they were different). the raid hadn't begun yet and it was a fresh instance too.
---
I thought you get a lockout when you kill a boss or enter a raid with one already dead. ¿Is this not the case? ¿Do you get a lockout assigned the first time you enter even without touching any mob?
---
this was yersterday in EU, so just after weekly reset.
---
tl;dw:  Always ride the tip, then jump off right at the end.
---
The halfway point in terms of xp is lvl 43. So the amount of xp it takes to reach 43 is the same as 43 to 60.
---
Those who “appear” the happiest usually tend to not be. I promise you they are miserable lol. Unless you come from decent money and have a strong support system, kids pre 23-25 is basically the same as ruining your life in todays day in age. 
---
Not saying that a ruined life is a bad life, but in a ruined life you aren’t able to experience many many many things because you have real responsibilities
---
Blackrock mountain chains
---
then dont run too far.
---
2 things.
---
1) sounds like its his second toon, this warrior could be a bit twinked.
---
2) you gotta be picky with the mobs you want 2-3 of, if they're high armor, forget about it. If not? You should be able to cleave them down in a couple swings.
---
Otherwise you can try burning the first 2 down, making sure to use demoralizing shout and thunder clap, have all your consumables up. Cleave down the first two, then hamstring and kite the last one bandaging if needed.
---
Money almost literally cannot buy a better PC or internet connection that I have.
---
Still freezes. It's 100% the server.
---
MODS
---
How? I’m 58 and the last 8 levels have been a breeze. I’ve got my key moves, I know what I can and can’t handle, I’ve got plenty of options. It’s 30-40 that was brutal.
---
It's a hard class to master because it involves a lot of thinking outside the box and adapting to situations...also utilizing all of your abilities and forms.
---
Western plague lands have a TON of mobs ... 51 ish in the far west and higher as you go east up to like 57??? decent rep grind too. Or timbermaw
---
&gt; as is evident by your stooping to attempts at personal attacks
---
I'm "stooping" because I'm frustrated.  This is an incredibly fucking simple concept, and I've laid it out countless times, and yet you still don't get it.
---
It's like telling a baby that 1+1 = 2, and then the baby steals your wallet, tells you to stop being greedy, and that 1+1 = 11. 
---
Jesus fucking christ, dude.
---
Stop and think about it.
---
56 as a mage you can solo farm DM:E lashers. its decent gold/xp and you can take a break when ever you feel like it.   
---
*To reset the instances, make a friend invite you and your alt, then he leave the group, logout when you cleared all packs wait for leader on alt and reset, now you can do the instance again.*
---
Those are both good pets and work really well too. 
---
Owls/Bats/CarrionBirds are only good solo, while the other two are great in group play and PVP.
---
I've had ferals and asked then if they minded healing when it was taking a while to find one. But even if they say no thanks ik cool with it
---
Male NE priest... a thing of nightmares
---
Mouses over ring, gets boot tooltip O.o
---
You may have been able to get around this by resetting instances?  Not 100% sure, though.
---
The night elf starting zone. So peaceful and tranquil.
---
The guides I always recommend to players are somebody named James. If you just google Jame’s guide to vanilla wow (INSERT DUNGEON NAME) he has written very in depth and helpful guides that tell you every quest to pick up and where to get them before going to a dungeon and then he breaks down the path inside to complete the quests and certain mechanics of a dungeon to look out for, like the alarm bots in Gnomer.
---
I have to Google that I guess.
---
Yeah I agree it's not WildStar levels obviously lol. Nor would I think it would ever reach that. Warcraft has a decade long dedicated fanbase. It's extremely hard to deplete that to the point that WildStar is.
---
I think this discussion started on the wrong perspective. Neither of us have numbers to claim anything. But I still claim that Classic feels more alive than retail at the current time. 
---
General chats, world, etc, has (at least on my server) a lot more interaction than on retail. And that's part the lack of people and the gameplay of BFA.
---
And as I said previously and would like to reiterate... I DESPERATELY WANT TO ENJOY RETAIL. As much as I like classic, it will not last forever! I want retail to be good for years to come!
---
This looks super fun, for like 5 minutes but then every single time you want to go in BRD which in classic is often as fuck then you have to deal with that, it would get old so fast
---
Never said I did.
---
it's not particularly good for a healer or a DPS.
---
I'm not sure if the buff stay on if you unequip the ring... but it's gone at the first AoE anyway... not that MP5 worth much when the longest fight in MC barely last 3 minute.
---
as a healer, mark of fordring / rosevine are your go-to ring.
---
Flexibility shouldn't be underrated. Hitting caps with ONLY your current setup means you basically can't change out anything unless you have alternative setups or carry gear to change as needed.
---
Fucking turn cool boots into ankle jewelry. Cows too
---
Ooo Ziggy is a great name for a boar.
---
You definitely do not need a shard bag until 60. even then, most of the time I don't use my shard bag unless I am raiding. You don't need to carry 20+ shards, there isn't a reason for it. And if you are only carrying like 4-6 shards, you are better off using a regular bag.
---
Must be a dachshund
---
    /cast [mod:shift]Power Word: Fortitude(Rank 1); [button:2]Prayer of Fortitude; Power Word: Fortitude
---
that's so much worse than TS since drakk is impossible to one tank pug and the dungeon is long af
---
wasnt powerleveling a thing where higher lvl pulls mobs without hiting them.high lvl leaves party  the low lvl guy throws granade (or some aoe without dying) and high lvl guy kill em. 
---
I know that there is multiple strats using also multiple high lvl players as boosters ( 1 high lvl pulls them kicks (usualy mage high lvl) out of party aoe them also dead, warps out and mage just finishes them off. dose any of this works  in classic?
---
Because private servers didn't have anything close to the number of current players on WoW. Not overall, and not on a server. 40v40 fights run smooth as butter for me.
---
Also, in many cases, people are either lying, or misremembering. I played on Nost quite a bit, and world PvP definitely hitched when there were larger numbers of people involved.
---
 find someone you trust  ...oh wait ....
---
Take a day off to recharge, and maybe take a day to do professions so you aren’t so burnt on questing!
---
Yeah it's a bit overrated. If anything its nice for large scale pvp, any extra ehp is nice.
---
warrior level'ing is hard when you try to kill mob +2 or +3 level above you instead of mass-killing green cons.
---
Monks aren’t bards tho. A sweet talkin healer and buffer would fit rogue better
---
If you have your heart set on it, they will just stick you in the mages group and have you innerate the MT healer. You can find a place, you just won’t see many others.
---
heart literally burst
---
DM:E solo jump runs.
---
There's some youtube videos on it, siphon life/demonic sac does this really effectively. But you will want mining.
---
Don't go swimming in the ocean for the rest of your life.

Go priest and then you can switch to shadow if you ever feel like dominating some PvP
---
winter spring and only way I'll get a ticket this year, last year I spent most of my time on YouTube to watch the streams if I missed one because of work and they didn't get uploaded to the virtual  ticket.
---
You're missing it.  It's not about whether art can be stimulating, it's about whether [this](https://blizzardwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/HumanClassic.jpg) is stimulating.  Forgive me if I find it a little weird to be turned on by 2004 WoW characters.
---
I love my rogue but if you want to play more solo then you're going to want to be a hunter.
---
Im a warlock and previously i had a green ring from 10 levels ago, so its an update no matter what :D the effect goes away when unequipping.
---
Sorry, it takes it to 232, accidentally did the math twice.. My point still stands entirely, dipshit. 
---
Link. Your. Parses. Coward. 
---
Lets see how much improved cleave does for you in raids kid.
---
&gt;*the baby steals your wallet, tells you to stop being greedy, and that 1+1 = 11*
---
In this example the baby (player) is the one stealing the wallet (BoE), tells you not to be greedy (for wanting an actual upgrade you can use). Nice. The 1+1=11 is the *BuT yOu CaN sElL iT oN tHe AuCtIoN hOuSe...*
---
I hate you.
---
Who are you?
---
Meat is meat to wolvess
---
Bonechill hammer, Mass of McGown, cho rush blade, skullforge reaver
---
I have similar macros on my paladin to save bar space. Have you noticed the issue that when you press the mod keys your game slightly stutters to load in the new skill tooltips?
---
Except that private servers also wouldn't be able to handle a battle like this. Everyone keeps claiming that shit, but private servers had vastly reduced numbers compared to Classic. Show me a single Nost video with comparable numbers of people in it, that didn't hitch. I guarantee you can't find one.
---
I'd say the sterness is fair. This was the view back in the day and it was very disheartening being a level 60 Feral druid and learning no one wanted me as a kitty cat. Getting to 60 takes 10+ days focused playtime, which can be spread over months. Rerolling isn't really an option. Knowing this truth early on would have been nice **because it doesn't say anywhere on character creation that I'd only be healing**.
---
It doesnt add the effect from talents on buffs. They show the base value.
---
If it's similar to the retail addon then you should be able to right click/ shift-right click on the mini map icon and it enables keybinding. Probably somewhere in the setting also.
---
Probably winterspring, that was the worst for me.
---
Edit: Nvm he clarified Silithus, and yes it is very painful without a lock
---
SLOWMO!
---
Now fade out, FADE IN!
---
SLOWMO AGAIN!!
---
Yea man I just don’t think you know how to tank properly and watched a couple of skarm videos and immediately thought you could DW fury tank. There’s no way you should be struggling to hold threat in phase 1. I don’t think you’ve ever gone prot, so you’re not familiar with how and why it’s advantageous. DW tanking destroys healers mana but if it’s working for you then keep at it I guess
---
This is how Heartseeker is, 2-1 ally-horde and I left stalagg cuz too much horde :(
---
I am in a Guild where most of us are parents. But that doesn't change anything tbh.
---
I am the only one around my bracket except lvl 60's but they are busy doing other stuff.
---
I don't expect ppl to wait 10 minutes usually it's max 5 min, that's like 1-2 pulls without me. I am not complaining or not understanding. I only explained my situation as in doing dungeons is "hard" for me.
---
44 is the halfway point in terms of time /played because you also get more XP from killing mobs.
---
It saves the direction you face too, which lets me just point myself at the door in IF so I can run straight out.  This really allows me to min/max the time it takes me to run to the bank area so I can jump in circles for the next hour.
---
And MotW, and Fortitude, and Imp bloodpact. This was how it was in vanilla.
---
I think this often when I’m at the cross roads
---
Kitten was from Kenya.
---
And don't forget the veins. The veins are crucial to show how buff the arm is
---
We got 2 last night!
---
Simon, the pet is leashing now and didn't use to. Could trap and pull Simon away. The Burning steps one is the most boring and just depends on how many Mana lots you have.
---
Just slow fall down, ez pz
---
It comes with actionator I think
---
should've just rolled a rogue, feral druids (dps) are just a bad version of rogue.
---
You're wrong, all linked mobs should be tied to every other mob in the linked group.
---
It was broken until now. This is how it should be in vanilla, go read the blue post.
---
I don't really lag in big open world pvp raids like this.
---
I did 8 lava runs with my guild yesterday and only a tank a healer and two rogues. It was the smoothest experience I have ever had. Tanking it was fun too. I don't get this "3 mage only" meta that's going around at all, the lyceum was fast af too since they could just get the torches and vanish and distract the fire guards when lighting the torch.
---
this if you are at 12% you dont need any more hit, you could just use any shoulders and drop to 10% and still be fine 
---
I wore wyrmtongue shoulders till i got T1 because i didnt need the hit from truestrike or wyrmhide
---
A 39 boomkin DPS was on pair with my DPS (38 frost mage) in multiple CM Cath runs last night. I'd say they're pretty good for dungeons and questing but I dunno about raids
---
and how can i reset my custom prices? But it also didnt show the ah prices for items i didnt set a custom price
---
You have a great responsibility now! Looking forward to your Thunderfury, Blessed blade of the Windseeker picture ;) !
---
If you wanna be optimum healer, then I would go something like this  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/5012301305001-035051030300055](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/5012301305001-035051030300055) 
---
The point in Silent Resolve can be played with.
---
Previous comment was correct, it's phase 4. And yes it's a 20-man raid in STV. It was a psudo catch up mechanic.
---
The phases as it stands:
---
Phase 1: MC/Ony
---
Phase 2: Honor Patch (and was dire maul but they split it up to help out a bit)
---
Phase 3: BWL/WSG + AV battlegrounds
---
Phase 4: ZG / Green Dragon world bosses (4 of them), as well as AB from memory.
---
Phase 5: AQ and the War effort (should be fun)
---
Phase 6: Naxx
---
Future: Unknown. No announcement has been made at this time.
---
You got a problem, bud?
---
It's like when your boss pressures you to come in on your day off because they're short staffed. The staffing of a business is not the responsibility of the staff.
---
May as well just go run Live Strat now for the 100% mount drop.
---
Edit: nevermind
---
It's 100% worth killing Pyro for the blues he drops. They vendor for quite a bit and you're in the area anyway.
---
Not everything has to be raid tailored. I just got essence of the pure flame for minimum DKP for grinding, because it's a 13 damage thorns aura against all trashpacks like when you farm strat: live.
---
On the same accord this ring is *amazing* in dungeons when farming them for gold, because you as healer will not take damage whatsoever in most cases if you play with good people. Like DM:E there are no cases of healer damage when you bring a good warrior who knows what he's doing.
---
I usually wing-clipped, got out and shot a few times, waited for the enrage and immediately stinged and reapplied wing clip, had to use conc shot a few times to buy a couple seconds on the enrage pop
---
You can do a bulk of those with ElvUI and trim some addons from your list if you wanted  I imagine.
---
Can confirm.  I grinded mobs 1 - 60 with just enough dungeons sprinkled in to get gear needed for grinding and had 1200g when I hit 60.  Only did enough herbalism to get to 300, no second profession used, no crazy expensive BoE drops.
---
Blackrock Mountain...the first time you pass through the giant doors. You glimpse giant chains being held up by dwarves statues. The black drakes are flying overhead. Lava is pouring around the center span. The inevitable clashes between horde and alliance as they get ready for dungeons or raids.The wonder and awe at what dangers/adventures await you are endless.
---
This isn’t the case in classic pvp. Lower levels can most definitely wreck a higher level. Warlocks are a good example. A level 40 lock can chain fear any 60. It doesn’t break like in vanilla.
---
"Managed to complete my tier 1 set" 
---
*upon further inspection*
---
"I am the class leader and I awarded myself every piece of tier as it dropped as a reward for being the leader of a class consisting of 2 other people"
---
No. Just no. You don’t burn 2500 calories in 8-12 hours after your 2500 meal. You burn 2500 calories in the 24 hours (if we’re assuming that to be your daily average). 
---
IF helps with regulating hunger and may help some diabetics control blood sugar spikes. It won’t make you lose weight if you keep eating same overall amounts of calories every day. 
---
Also, on Keto you eat just fats and protein, with most of calories coming from fats. No such things as ‘focusing on ketogenic and fatty acids’. Again, it might help with initial weight loss because your body holds on to less water when you don’t eat carbs, but longterm keto won’t help you lose weight if the calories remain the same.
---
According to Biggie, that's number 4.
---
https://genius.com/The-notorious-big-ten-crack-commandments-lyrics
---
Each server has a few choices. It was originally as you stated but it’s loosened up since the first few waves of trabsfers
---
The GM almost certainly cares about you less than you care about the group, since you're looking at the other raid group as a whole and he's looking at just you.
---
It's not necessarily a bad thing (focusing on the group as a whole vs one raider) but you should definitely look out for yourself first.
---
If you think the team is really awesome and you're not dead set on Hunter, reroll and maybe your Hunter will be applicable down the line / bring him when possible, otherwise I'd look at a new guild. Every guild has people that are cool in my experience, it's just finding the group without a couple bad eggs that sour the experience.
---
Tried to do straight kite on this one and it was painful since he walks so fast, ended up doing a half-kite with wingclip and hawk instead of cheetah and concussive
---
Hahaha right? Im about to go do everything i can with this luck
---
Westfall because all my toons get to level there for a bit
---
Doesn't hurt that a significant portion of the Horde on Skeram don't know their ass from a hole in the ground.
---
I still get rolled when I'm outnumbered, but I'll take my chances against any horde 1v1 so long as they aren't a skull.
---
Dominoes has a built in keybind function that much easier to use than the standard one.  Just mouse over the symbol on the minimap and you'll see what to do.
---
Ohh. I got it on my first run... at level 52
---
If that's the case then you have an organization problem with your healers, or you have too many healers in raid.
---
That sucks for you op :( 8 days played and recently I had to fly to darn from Gaz. Only time I was like man why lol such a long flight there. So 15min/8 days ain't bad. It would better than your life chart lmaooo
---
If you type /kb you should be able to set your bindings. After you've brought up binding mode just mouse over the button you want to bind and enter the desired binding.
---
I have to drink so much and I die so easily that while I can do GY with relative ease (especially boosting a healer who can help me if I need it), the others are much more difficult. Perfectly doable, but they're not exactly fast.
---
Trust me, the problem is 99% not on your side, so save yourself the hassle and dont wipe.
---
That is true. I see a lot recommending winterspring so maybe I check that out
---
That moment when u sit on full tier 1 already and say it’s not amazing
---
Well, on the plus side, at least you don't look stupid! I look like the Mad Hatter lol
---
For example lets say your grind gold buy repeatedly killing the same group of monsters. Over and over and over again you kill them and each time you get a little bit of gold. If that action did not result in gaining gold you wouldn't do it otherwise because it's not fun. If that does sound like fun to you you're probably on the spectrum and that's okay too. You do you buddy.
---
Cant watch the video at the moment but i got about 600 elemental earth at 25s each. Already 1g+ on my realm.
---
On the flip side, I got a job at Sony and my resume was literally a list of games I beta tested for free in high school (I was a Beta fiend), and my experience processing support tickets on a pserver. 
---
However, I was interviewing for a QA position so as you said, it was directly related to the job.
---
Also, don’t work for Sony. Really. Its like the Wal-Mart of QA.
---
Why are they at a job interview if they don’t want to be working? Raid leading obviously doesn’t pay the bills lmao
---
If your realm has realm transfers you could have your friend/second account make an alliance, buy the item, and transfer the character with the gold to the other realm and then make your new alliance there and trade it back
---
Edit: No idea if this is against tos tho
---
Right? Bout to open a ticket... I'm pissed
---
I'd have to Google what that is but thanks non the less.
---
Don't worry, you'll never hate me more than I hate me
---
&gt;Queues... should have been faction specific.
---
\#NOCHANGES
---
Feralas, the twin colossals. Its just a magic place!
---
So do you charge, blood rage, SS, zerk, WW, swap to sword shield then stay in zerk or go into defensive?
---
How fast is "fast", cause a mage with AE can kill hundreds of those dwarves in seconds, granted most classic players are terrible which further requires 'proper' class stacking to have a decent experience.
---
I've ganked a couple lowbies while running through an area but I would never interrupt hunter quest like a warrior did to me. Ally scum.
---
I'll tell that to my hunter friend I suppose
---
Slow down. It’s all about perspective and what server you’re on. Maybe do this on your servers trade chat because the alliance on my server are physically incapable of fighting someone who is less than 10 levels lower than them or without 3 buddies. I leveled all the way through hillsbrad and arathi on my warrior and never once fought or was attacked by someone my own level. Only punk ass mages nearly killing me then polymorphing me to full again. Warlocks would nearly kill me then fear me into groups of mobs. Hunters would find me while I’m fighting mobs and nearly kill me then let me die to the mobs. Alliance are utter shit heads on thunderfury. The truth is the will attack you when they have a clear advantage. Hillsbrad is already full of lvl60s making it horrible to exist in.
---
Looks like a well diversified portfolio of items to invest in too, hedges him against bad luck or unforeseen markets quite a bit
---
We changed Servers on Day1 and got Serverfirst there.
---
as combat dagger you ONLY need 1 of those items
---
Aged Core leather gloves + rogue talent is 310 skill and that is all you should aim for. Muggers belt is good if you dont have core gloves but you dont need both of them
---
same with distracting dagger, its a decent item but the benefit of going above 310 skill is really low
---
Right there with you, bud. I'm full bear tank. The gear struggle is real.
---
Every single server right now is what blizz is currently calling “medium” or higher. They publicly stated a “medium” is a higher capacity than the highest vanilla server ever had.  
---
Now classic is most likely going to continue to lose subs where as vanilla was gaining them, but you are in no immediate danger of being on a “dead” server. Especially since all the transfers have been a one way ticket OFF the highest pop servers, they become more and more balanced.  
---
The only fear I would have is making sure you get on a server that isn’t like 70/30 faction split if you are on a pvp server, but that’s about it
---
Yes, if you use the MC Engi-Shield.
---
Idk...you could also just have a fury dps warrior throw on a sword and shield and go defensive stance if he's just tanking adds.
---
STV is one of my favorite zones! It's just got a really good feel to it, very immersive. The quest where you get the little raptor is really fun.
---
I don't play on a pvp server, so I can't speak to that sort of annoyance getting in the way of leveling.
---
What about my criticism about your personality don't you understand? I read your reply about whataboutism and then I criticized you the same way you criticized another's sense of humor. Don't play dumb. You're diluted with overused "go to" terms like whataboutism, but you're not dumb.
---
I just grouped with whoever was on.  Again, didn't need a full group. I find it's a lot easier to run with guildies using lfg than it is in classic, even more so due to the fact dungeons only took 20 mins max to run (except right after xpat release).
---
Ye that's not what I meant, I only meant it as they have to drink more often than my current spec. 
---
Yeah I was actually going to go with hunter at first for nostalgic reasons. But I somehow convinced myself that mage would be better for me, as one of my goals is farming a good amount of gold later on.
---
Have you tried it now?
---
Yeah I'm so sick of BRD (rogue farming HoJ) and haven't had anything like that. It's mostly been people joining arena/golem runs wanting quests like fineous or people just straight up not listening to instructions to hug the wall walking up to the arena balcony that's been annoying
---
Sorry mate, that's a real bummer. I hope you get some better groups in your future.
---
If you’re arms, I’d spec into the extra rage on charge for dungeon purposes, then charge -&gt; sweeping strikes -&gt; zerk -&gt; 2h equip zerker rage/WW -&gt; defensive/1h/shield -&gt; bloodrage -&gt; normal tank rotation.
---
Exception being a LoS pull, then I do BLood rage first in defensive stance
---
... no it doesn’t. You’re thinking of BS rank 7.
---
..... I can’t anymore
---
All these years of knocking on wood have finally paid off
---
Unless I am missing something, theoretically it could be done naked (except for ranged weapon).
---
The worse your gear is, however, the longer the fight is going to be and that is more room for mistakes/FD resists. Also, often you need some health to survive smaller mistakes.
---
Edit: And u need engineering + charges to blow the door + invisibility potions

Meta in wow isn’t like meta in other games. In most competitive games (overwatch, lol, dota etc) there is constant update and balance happening that leads to new emerging strategies with every patch. Wow classic is 15 years old, has minimal updates, all of which have already happened once so optimal strategies are pretty much set by the maths.
---
From what I understood it’s that way because you can technically skip everything up until lucifron so they start from there. Most guilds didn’t but that was the reasoning I was given back when I was part of that type of guild.
---
well I was raiding as boomkin and was with 25 dps on place 10-12... (over some mages, hunter and even one rogue) - so your boomie is just bad or has some wrong gear, but below tanks is really low.
---
The paladin in the picture
---
So I should leave them alone because we are not equal in every way? LOLTo many carebears on this game. Alliance running past me 24/7 and not even killing me.  
---
If you are near my level or below my level, we are gonna fight
---
Yep that's it.
---
You should have a dedicated DE char then who you take on farm runs. Because your entire inventory and bank will be nothing but epics by the time P5 rolls around.
---
Most of my gear is from leatherworking, which is enough for grinding tbh.
---
&gt;I swear I'm gonna get Nemisis cap before I see that hat.
---
I got my Netherwind Crown before ever seeing the CFH.
---
I've never even heard of that addon. I have TukUI/ElvUI though so I'm kinda assuming it's bundled with that.
---
Guys, is this humor or what is it, I can't tell because every alliance joke attempt looks the same lmao
---
On a pvp server playing the minority faction, frack no. Even in the morning there are bored 60s riding around just ganking.
---
You can fix it by making you pay whatever you bid I’m full
---
&gt;I see. Might work if they're not paying attention to that side, but I wouldn't be surprised if they see you coming and can nuke you before you get there.
---
You fall from the top at a pretty damn fast, even with slow fall.
---
Unless there are 3-4 mages with AP+PoM waiting with perfect LoS, it's pretty unlikely you'll ever die (Unless you mess up the jump).  
---
The other side is literally nothing, there's never anyone actually looking there and no one expects you to enter that way, so if you have Ony/DM/Rend buffs it's the best option assuming you're confident enough to make it.
---
Ignoring the proc on perditions blade, the claw buff would need a minimum of 72% uptime to maintain the same dps as perditions. Even If it actually has that kind of uptime, you still miss out on weapon skill modifiers, which as far as I know there aren’t any for first weapons.

You might not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like

I hope so, so that my /threaten before I jump aren’t wasted
---
I had a good time a few weeks ago where I was rolling with a death squad and slaughtering all horde we saw. Being fair though, we were at level and had been ganked about 10 times each before we grouped up and started clapping cheeks. My tip is to always keep your eyes on the mage if you’re running away. Some cheeky shaman thought they could bait us into tarren mill but didn’t see me flanking. R1FB after R1FB until the other 4 caught up then he was nuked. 
---
I’m usually pretty passive I swear. I like helping both sides when I’m not getting ganked constantly. Can’t count the number of times I have polymorphed a very low health warrior to give them their health back, frostbolted an mob to help them run away, or straight up assisted in killing hard mobs.
---
One. Joke.
---
I lost to a hunter.
---

---
The other important thing to know, which I Don't know if its ever been fixed, is that hackers can actually hack your account if you /w them back. So I wouldn't whisper anyone back that's doing a message like this especially if you don't have an authenticator attached to your blizzard account.
---
I say this because back in Wraith my brother, the GM of our guild, had his wife's account get hacked. I tried to tell him not message the person but he being very stubborn did so anyway and the hacker got his account info and hacked his account. Took the over 300,000 thousand Gold we probably had in stuff in the Guild bank, disbanded the guild and of course deleted all his gear off of all his characters. It was later told to me that there's a back alley channel hackers can take through blizzard chat to get get most if not all of your account info if you whisper them back.
---
Of all the warlocks I've been with I havnt had an issue doing this for them??  Do you not grab mage water before heading out?  Ever since that sparkling water came out it's been dope. 
---
 I'll ask for water and get like 100+ lol I always end up giving 70-80 away before I got cause 2900 Mana Regen is nice.
---
It’s an item that requires honored with the timbermaw faction. You get rep by grinding winterfall furnolgs in winterspring. It’s slow but worth it, they also drop winterfall firewater and winterfall e’ko (if you have cache of mauri) which sell for about 2g each, and drop cloth.
---

I actually did put this on my early resumes. Eventually I did get a promotion to a management position and excelled at it,leading the hotel I was working at the be the top out of our district, and in the top 10 of over 600 hotels, all while capping out on my bonuses each quarter. Worked out well enough, but yea, wish people took raid coordinating effects into consideration for experience :(

I'm so sorry for your loss :-(

Moonglow is the best spec for healing in raids. What you lose in the resto tree is 2  or 3 points imp rejuv (10 or 15 % increased Base healing for rejuv), 4 or 5 points imp regrowth (40 or 50 % crit chans with regrowth) and swiftmend. The extra bonus healing from rejuv is nice early on, but with more and more + healing, it starts beeing quite lack luster. 50 % extra crit with regrowth sounds nice, but the cost is to high (and you got no moonglow, remember) to use it very much. With the Natures grace + regrowth spec you use you regrowth to fish for natures grace procks for faster HTs. Swiftmend costs 20 % base mana (yeah, fucking alot) and all it does is consume a hot ans heal all of it instant. The tactic ia to use it in the last 3 sec to maximize mana efficiency, but it's still pretty bad for healing in raids.If you take all remotely useful talents in the resto tree, you'll still have 16 points left that won't help you with healing at all. Skipping 8 points in resto to pick up moonglow + nature's grace for a total of 19 % coat reduction for HT in conjunction with tranquil spirit seems like a given for me. You will also have the ability to pick upp imp wrath, imp thorns, natural shapeshifter, imp moonfire and vengence for solo content.
---
Last night while raiding with this spec, i was top 1 healer in 4 fights, top 2 in 2 and top 3 in 2. But stick to tank healing, the priests will destroy you if you try competing on raid healing.
---
Yeah I mean there's always someone bad at their class. I think the spellcleave meme didnt help with mage rep lol.
---
For people that don’t know, you can survive this pretty easily
---
What I did was simply stop playing that character for a while, and leveled an alt. After about 5 days or so, you come back to nearly a full level of rested xp. Keep doing this for a few weeks and you'll suddenly find yourself lvl 60 having spent half the time getting there as everyone else while also having a lvl 35 alt ready to provide you with another profession or 2.
---
Ashenvale. The innocent times of leveling ends here on PVP servers along with the eerie music.
---
I'm in top 5 raid heals every week using both Moonglow and hotw/nw.
---
PvP as Moonglow is pretty great too. You really rely on Moonfire/Insect and kiting with roots. Weave in heals and switch to bear for mitigation. 
---
Topping charts is easy as a druid. Throw on hots or just regrowth to your main tanks at the start of pulls and use rank 4 HT and ALSO rank 3 HT. Rank 3 HT is your anti-snipe heal. Use it to keep everyone topped off.
---
Rockbiter is still better unless that slow weapon also has on hit effects. On average, it will do more weapon damage, and it makes fights more predictable.
---
What does attune mean?
---
Here ya go 🥇
---
Im alliance on skeram and I was actually having a good time going back and forth with horde in the yeti cave in hillsbrad, until someone called their lvl 60 rogue buddy to come clear house for them :(
---
Nah that's pretty much it.
---
I usually go SoCrusader &gt; Judgement &gt; SoCommand
---
Throw in a judgement or stun or exorcism here and there.
---
I'm like 32 and full ret right now but I do decently on the damage meters in most instances.
---
100% not the asshole.
---
I did a lot of questing in zones I was a little under leveled for and 2 mobs a level or two higher than me at once can kill me  tbh fam
---
First things first, super lame to pull that "I don't understand why you care" card. It is such a lame way to try to shut down or belittle an argument.
---
But this is a silly internet thing that doesn't matter so I'm not hung up on that, and would rather just explain why some people do "care".
---
Mainly because it is just really silly and stupid to take a photo of your computer screen instead of just using the screenshot button. You have been able to take a screen shot of your computer screen since the 80's man, longer than I have even been alive. 
---
Uploading the photo is the same process either way, and results in a higher quality screen shot. (And by higher quality, were talking leagues of difference, even from the best phone camera)
---
If you are taking a screenshot of a PC video game...you are already sitting there...why wouldn't you just press the button?
---
I really don't get it, do people just not know how? Do they think it's more difficult/time consuming? Are people just that reliant on phones? 
---
I don't know man, keeps me up at night. /s
---
Well sorry for sharing about my joy geez
---
I tried resetting, reloading, re-logging and closing the game; didn't do anything
---
Dude that is such a sick race/class/name/looks combo haha
---
There's a difference between being a carebear and preferring equal level fights. Killing grays is acceptable but it's nothing to be proud of.
---
&gt; 3rd quit after some discussions about gearing and finding out that T1 is crap for healing
---
Really? 8 piece is THE best set bonus you could ask for in a set this tier.
---
Seriously dropping tranquility from 5 minutes to 2.5 is MASSIVE.
---
Just looked up a video of it. Looks like you don't even have to actually hit the window or slowfall at all? That's…weird, but I'll have to try it next time I'm around BRM.
---
Can you expand on what you're looking for?
---
All the trash will have respawned.  Best to just start a new one.
---
This made me laugh out loud, Ethan.
---
That’s 100% more buttons that frost mages
---
happened to me last night :&lt;
---
you don't know how much that means to me
---
I named a char the same way. Everyone in my friend group just laughed and said "wtf"
---
It's actually not bad if you accept that you need to heal at times, DPS other times. The "Resto Druid" raiding build runs 24 points in Balance and 27 points in Resto. Deep Balance builds essentially trade Nature's Swiftness and Gift of Nature for Moonkin Form and Moonfury. That's not much different from a standard "Resto" build, except you can also deal damage.
---
Loot is the biggest issue. Leather spell damage gear just doesn't exist until AQ. That means you're competing with Mages and Warlocks for non-set pieces. They will (rigthfully) lose their shit if you win a piece over one of them.
---
In practice, you will be below all of the core Mages and Warlocks on loot priority for spell damage gear, AND below the core Resto Druids for loot priority on healing gear. Most people do not want to make that sacrifice. They want gear more than they want to play Moonkin.
---
If you're willing to make that sacrifice, though? You can pull your weight.
---
Mine has to be Maraudon. You know the spot I'm talking about. Not the noxious caverns, not the plant infested tunnels, but right when it turns into this roaring expanse of waterfalls just teeming with life. Never experience such awe-inspiring beauty in a video game before. 
---
(ALSO WTS BLACKSTONE RING RUNS 25g ON DROP PST)
---
Slightly related, my co-worker and I were racing to get each others first names on name day just to fuck with eachother.
---
I got them both.
---
&gt; 1) sounds like its his second toon, this warrior could be a bit twinked.
---
I leveled a hunter and a priest to 60 back in Vanilla. I've played most other classes to less than 30 in Classic. My warrior is in no way twinked. My warrior hasn't felt any harder than the hunter, priest, or any of the others so far.
---
&gt; 2) you gotta be picky with the mobs you want 2-3 of, if they're high armor, forget about it. If not? You should be able to cleave them down in a couple swings.
---
The fact that so many people responding to my statement are readily mentioning 2 to 3 simultaneous mobs, and/or +2 to +3 levels above me is making me think when people say warriors are harder to level, they are talking about the "speed leveling" experience, instead of "normal leveling" experience. 
---
Like a professional racecar driver saying, "This car is slower than other cars," when he's trying to win a race, compared to a normal/average driver just driving to work and the grocery store. The normal driver would never notice a difference.
---
500 bottles of bleach? What kind of crimes are you planning?! oO
---
From what I've heard, for PVP you can completely ignore hit. If you have hit on your strongest items like Lionheart Helm. Great. But otherwise go for Stam &gt; crit &gt; attack power &gt; parry &gt; Dodge &gt; hit &gt; defense. Also use a 2H with mortal strike spec. Don't use dual wield weapons or fury spec.
---
We have a boomkin in our main raid group to incentivize mages to do well, so they would be placed in the boomkin group for the extra 3% damage. It works.

I also spent about 30 seconds with the timer going in the beginning in a spot where I wouldn't normally be (at the entrance) and I only paused the timer when I was talking and ending the video lol.

Sure, having an unfair advantage over other players in the same zone as you if you're killing all the mobs in one shot and not leaving any for others.
---
Plugger is a gnome, not a goblin.
---
Oh okay, thanks! Also, great addon!
---
I would like to know as well xD
---
As a lock main I can't agree more. Usually I let the healer know I can heal myself with bandages/life drain and try not to go below half health with life taps. 
---
If the locks you're running with don't have some sort of respect for the healer, let them corpse walk.
---
I'm on Kromcrush in a guild called KromKush, it's supposed to be weed
---
There are addons that will broadcast incoming heals to other people, so there's no overlapping.
---
We had this issue which got fixed by everyone installing the healing library (can't remember the name)
---
But can confirm, not really a playstyle thing, just some healers not knowing that you are healing.
---
Maybe he likes his troll mage?
---
it's been really fun.
---
my server is very heavily skewed to the horde side so I'm constantly looking over my shoulder.
---
I've been ganking people on my druid the entire time there though. I have't run into an issue where I was inconvenienced too long, and have had some nice pvp encounters.
---
Only real trouble is trying to turn in the Nesy quests sometimes.
---
We've been doing this since retail as well, makes raiding together super confusing for our GM's
---
Please do!
---
Ungoro crater has the best atmosphere
---
You should really consider running HOTW/NS so you can solo or tank in some feral gear, adds some spice to the class if you are bored of resto and you can very much still raid heal.
---
&gt;Just looked up a video of it. Looks like you don't even have to actually hit the window or slowfall at all?
---
Nope, just get near-ish it. But slow fall makes you feel like a badass and you get to laugh at all your friends taking the chain as you go down.
---
&gt;That's…weird, but I'll have to try it next time I'm around BRM.
---
Good luck! I wouldn't recommend tryng it the first time when you have your Ony/Rend/DM buff up
---
I can vouch for this.
---
It's an alliance problem in general,  not just your server.
---
same but thalnos \[H\] to stalagg \[A\]
---
such sad stats and set bonus :( do you actually use this in raids?
---
I dont know if you're up for trying another spec, but maybe the DPS is better on Arcane or Fire.
---
It means having the prereqs to enter an instance, taken from the name of the quest to enter mc, attunement to the core.
---
Non screenshot? You mean photo? Quality dude. Photos of screens look like garbage.
---
I usually leave Alliance alone. I know better than to start a gang war. However every now then if I get bored I’ll charge an ally and then flee the crime scene.
---
Mage tears are the most delicious and sought after tears!
---
Thinking about rerolling Grobbulus since it seems to have a nice alliance population.
---
Don't mind RPing, but does the RP factor get in the way of raid progression or groups?
---
Got this on my 60 priest and can confirm running any dungeon 55+ you're probably not going to have this buff for too long. 22 mp5 is great until it goes away. Be sure to carry an extra ring for when you inevitably get hit and lose the buff.
---
Edit: worth noting gives you a really unique purple bubble for 30 min. Recommend this as more of a cosmetic item than anything else.
---
I don't think it's worth using a vanish to "potentially" kill pyro. You can easily get fucked by RNG and not get the kill. I also don't have any raid gear. I personally don't kill them and I think the grind is a lot more relaxing if you don't.
---
which dusts specifically are you selling? or which dusts are your best sellers?
---
Join the guild KromKush on the server Kromcrush
---
Warrior so yes.
---
Warlocks who know what they are doing have plenty of ways to get health back without you healing them. In combat we got Life Drain and Siphon Life (if you spec into it). We also have our healthstones, first aid and potions.
---
In combat put the Warlock lowest on your priority if they die due to over spamming Life Tap that is their fault. Out of Combat other then maybe a renew don't bother healing them. Warlocks Life Tap out of combat because it is faster to do that + bandage/eat than it is to eat and drink at the same time. This is because Warlocks have a lot more mana than health.
---
God people who call others "bud" or "pal" are generally obnoxious douchebags.
---
damn that really sucks. I mean i guess it still has some glow...but it looks way less appealing.

Another dingus falls to the BiS list mentality. iF iTs NoT bIs ItS tRaSh WhY wAsTe YoUr TiMe?
---
Well, no, especially not for melee where the BiS list is highly dependent on the hit from gear each piece provides. Not playing melee right now but I'd hazard a guess that, until capped, hit is by far the best DPS stat.
---
I'm top 10 on warcraftlogs yet I'm a magetard? Cool story, bro. Keep being mediocre and expecting shit for free. It won't get you anywhere in life.
---
I guess you don’t care about being anonymous.  NtA
---
It's on par with retadins it will never be close to the optimal spec, you won't do as much damage as the pure damage classes your competing against, if you get a raid spot it's more for your crit aura then your own personal damage. That being said I could easily see a guild taking 1 moonkin to raid pre aq/naxx since you really don't need to be try harding till those harder raids come out. If you do raid as boomkin make sure your bringing at least 40 demonic runes and 20 major Mana pots per raid if you wanna see yourself on the DPS chart.
---
You steal skins from your own faction?  Then you put them in a video to show off on the internet because you think that makes you look cool?  I'll never pretend to understand the lower class of society or youtubers.
---
He says he's not an AoE mage, and you recommend an AoE farm? lol
---
The drag in Orgrimar. Big city back￼ alleyways please and thank you.
---
either that or he was screenshotting it \^\^
---
Wasn't just talking about trinkets. No set, which sucks ass. Just gotta mix and match and hope for the best.
---
That's why I said it's expected. If a mage is pulling aggro on a 3 pack, it's 100% their fault and completely avoidable. If I'm tanking 7 mobs, then I expect them to pull aggro.
---
Kazzak is going to be nearly impossible on some realms since you can grief your own faction.

This is where all my money has gone!!

Hired!

I like what I did for mine. It has all the bars and stuff you might need for out-of-combat ... then hides 75% of it when you enter combat to look something like this

Yeah, I agree 100%. Next MC I'm going to look at HOJ damage outputs on rogues that have it.
---
thanks for the input

I want to try it myself but the price of Skullflame isn't dropping and I just blew all my gold on Hide of the Wild.

No because lock can't stealth
---
What level did you find that you could successfully AoE mob packs down with your prot build?
---
Please take a class on video editing. This was rough to watch.
---
For what it's worth I also find the font a bit off-putting.
---
Trick to getting it is get a group, go in live side, the boss is first one there exit ud side reset.  takes less than 10 mins.
---
It's a great server,  and the RP doesn't hinder any progression.  The alliance here are equally as trash as alliance everywhere :)

It's possible the leader of the brd group was already saved to mc. So when you entered you got saved to his id

Wait. you mean I can lead teams of Fortune 500 company’s by screaming “LESS DPS!!” into a microphone?

Can’t they buy invis pots?
---
&gt; on and as far as it being a bit twinked, I love pimping my warrior out every 5 levels or so.
---
I honestly don't even know how to twink any class. I got the whirlwind axe at level 35 only because people here kept stating matter-of-factly that it was possible -- I did it only by buying the charms off the AH (slowly, over 5 levels), and getting help (from my son and 2 other warriors) with Cyclonian.
---
By the time I started the Brutal Armor quests, my regular green gear (quests and drops while questing) were as good or slightly better than each piece of the Brutal set (so I didn't bother finishing the series).

I'm more and more convinced that the most vocal people around here are playing the game in a much different way than I am.
---
I've had a guildie de one because the only person who could use it had it
---
Booty Bay, the Kai Tak Airport of Flight Paths
---
In what way? Not mad, just genuinely curious.
---
oRA2 gave me errors. DBM can do durability check
---
Just cause it's a 15 year old game does not mean people know what to do.
---
He's saying you need to advertise in various channels for a tank and healer. /2 is trade, /3 is defense, /4 is LFG. 
---
As for a duo-tribute run... I imagine it's possible with a warlock/rogue combo, but it's likely incredibly difficult, time consuming and you will probably die so many times in the attempt.
---
I got 1 million one time but it was so many in a row that the video file was too big and couldn't save. Def happened though
---
Locks can solo DME, so bring your friend along to take half your profit! :D
---
I have used my experience being the healing officer of my raiding guild in an interview when asked if I had any management experience. I just phrased it as "lead a small team to handle our given weekly tasks and took part in meetings regarding personnel issues and setting the goals for the next week." I left out doing the loot council task as I anything that sounded like choosing how much money people made would stand out too much given my resume. They didn't ask where I had this experience and I didn't elaborate.
---
I did get the job, though there was never any management duties. I no longer work there, the job was stressful BS with &gt;60 hrs/wk 4 months of the year and &lt;40 hrs/wk the rest for under $10/hr.
---
Our raid leader legit yelled at me saying it wasn't worth wasting the "10 minutes" for us all to fly around to burning steppes (even though we were all still at kargath) to avoid the fight and funnel in slowly. 
---
There was a giant group only on the north side ganking any horde that passed through. We instead lost all of our prepared buffs in seconds, and spent more than 20 minutes trying to get in. Thought it was great.
---
How is his latency on the prison internet?
---
Whats the addon for making the windows dark?
---
I've been maining feral since Vanilla and funnily enough, Rogue is the only class I never managed to level. I just found it to be a less flexible version of a druid! XD
---
You can PUG MC and Ony when you feel like it, but there are a load of disadvantages by going the PUG route this early in Classic such as wipes and not completing MC in one night. You can stick with doing 5-mans and UBRS which is fine for most classes because the BIS gear is actually from dungeons. Maybe change to a more casual raiding guild that has lesser consumables and buff requirements even though you know that means longer clears.
---
I didn’t say people weren’t allowed to play without full prebis. I said every rogue should farm it relentlessly. I have people in my raid that aren’t full prebis. I’m not even full prebis. I farmed the shit out of hoj though. Its too good. Every rogue should prioritize it.
---
Curse of shadows gives 10% damage and -75 resists to arcane damage so if they are spamming Starfall they only lose out on the winters chill debuff.
---
Oh wow thanks, keep up the good work man.
---
Totally binge watched this in 1 day. Couldn't stop.
---
in raids* 
---
Outside of raids there aren't many classes that demand more keybinds than mages.
---
These past 2 weeks there's been an insane amount of druid gear. Last week alone we had 5 unique pieces even
---
No but they did create Hardiness and word. And they did faction agnostic server swaps
---
I believe it's random ranging from 700 to like 3000.
---
 [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Gnomish\_Death\_Ray](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Gnomish_Death_Ray) 
---
Check the notes section.
---
I mean, that's how mages farm effectively. You probably don't even need to be full blown AoE spec for some of the lower level AoE farms.
---
[Pretty comparable in numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPnMFJiOxT4) to what we've been seeing now.  The problem going into the future is that if there's considerable lag in phase 1, just imagine how bad it'll be on Classic when honor comes out and servers are down to 1 layer
---
Why do you dislike playing a warrior?
---
Mostly just pushing the Ambiance sounds up yeah, put Sound effects and Music low, no loop music. Tbh Classic soundtracks are great but I've heard there so many times I just can't listen to them all day anymore. I might try to make a playlist later on including some soundtracks from later xpac. I was listening to some Nazjatar theme while farming in Azshara the other day and it was pretty good.
---
How is that even possible that stuff is cheaper than sand on my server
---
I spent an hour there distracting people off the chain last night. Eventually the horde started hugging the inside of the chain so they didn’t run off through distract.
---
I'm well aware. But he asked for a non-aoe farm and you gave him an aoe farm.
---
Heartseeker horde here.  Didn't even bother on my priest.  Currently 44 and no regrets in skipping it.  It's really your call on whether you want to slog through it.  The rewards from pushing through are more just personal satisfaction.  No gear that you pick up before level 50 will be used at 60.  Trinkets, epics,  and on use items are the only exceptions.  If you are going slow, the rewards may be worth it as you'll be using them for a few days/weeks.  But if you are anticipating a level every day or two, the gear is not worth the delay in leveling.
---
Three words:
---
Oil of Immolation
---
There are plenty of alternatives. Get paladin tank. Get paladin DPS. Get shadow priest DPS. Get shaman DPS. Get shaman tank. Don't die that often, it's not like druid lacks ANY res.
---
Attunement is basically being 'allowed' to enter a dungeon.
---
For MC, you can either go through BRD and enter the big green portal, or you can do the "Attunement to the Core" quest to get the Core Fragment and hand that it for a 'shortcut'.
---
After you've completed that quest, you no longer need to go through BRD to reach MC, you can just go through the window next to the blood elf and you will be instantly transported to MC. 
---
For Onyxia you need to complete a lengthy quest chain to obtain the Drakeblood Amulet, when you have that you can finally enter Onyxia's lair.
---
If you try to enter MC (Through the shortcut) or Onyxia's lair without attunement, you will not be allowed in.
---
You’ve never specc’d prot, I don’t think you’ve experienced actual tanking without going prot. You’re handicapping yourself trying to match DPS and not using other abilities. 
---
Who’s geared and skilled in phase 1 to take aggro off the tank??? Like c’mon lol. If you have to DW fury tank to hold aggro in phase 1 that says more about your tanking skill than anything
---
Lorty UI
---
I’m still trying to gain weight and I play 8 hours a day. Help
---
Moonkins get the 3% crit from their aura of that's what your talking about?
---
Jesus. 30 days played? Are you okay?
---
The only way to get kazzak will be to have warlock alts set up in blasted lands ready to immediately summon your raid team there before the rest of the server knows he's up.  Also dont say LFM kazzak in any chat....or else you're doomed.
---
Well this is an idiotic comment. " Read my comment and believe what I said " ... okay ? Not that I am accusing you of anything but just "farming" felcloths and enchanting on the side didn't net you (900x4)+(600x4) = 6000g to get all these mounts.
---
*and Tuesday.
---
take it into photoshop and edit out the name and you'd have a nice beckground. especially since all the interesting stuff is on the right leaving the left for icons
---
This video requires improved stealth and prep doesn’t it? 
---
They shouldn’t be surprised the money making build for their class also requires specific talents.
---
Did you read his post? He said he has a 60 on another server.
---
Dire maul north, i'm like a mean mean blowing green money machine, chaaching!
---
It's bullshit though. As someone that transferred from a "layered" server full of try hards to a "medium", "dead" server its just not true that there aren't people to do things with.
---
There are at least 4 guilds in MC. I've never waited more than 30 minutes to get a dungeon as a healer. Blizzard has stated that a medium server is equivalent to a "high" server from back in the day. 
---
The truth is that you have absolutely nothing to fear. I know, because I feared it. I've lived on both sides. It's bullshit.
---
If you dont like a server, leave it. You are not going to miss out on end game or anything like that. Have fun.
---
I think the main thing here is that raid leading isn't done in a professional setting, at least for most raid leaders.  If it were, I think it would be perfectly viable to bring up in an interview.
---
LOL, loved it.
---
Curiously, though, I've never had problems finding groups myself. But then again, I typically play tanks and healers, so maybe I'm exempt from this bullshit.
---
&lt;3
---
Something I haven’t seen mentioned: look for dungeons in between you two in level. ZF can easily be done at 42, and is useful for XP until 50. If he’s a little too high and you’re a little too low, it balances out. Also once’s you’re in the 50s and hes 55-60, you can both run the same stuff.
---
I love and second this suggestion. Do this.
---
2g+ today on Faerlina, loving it.
---
But bro, when I sim it on the Patchwerk encounter I do more damage with HoJ than any other trinket! Are you trying to tell me the sims aren't law and I can use something OTHER than what they say is BiS?
---
Not a fan of that mentality but hey... I got my Priest T1 last night with no competition because people can't accept that there are other chests worth using aside from Truefaith. Some guy even linked his Truefaith and asked why I was rolling on it. Because I don't want to craft or buy 12 mooncloth + the other materials? Also raw stats are better than 50 healing, we can fight if you disagree.
---
Are there any addons (for classic) that can show me my shield health as a mage?
---
I wish that information was more visible
---
Haha yeah we made this mistake once as well... We now gather at Morgan's Vigil before heading out to MC and roll out as a big group. 
---
It's kinda funny watching 10-20 horde panic seeing 30-40 alliance roll up and vice versa.
---
Well feral are there for off tanking so they dont take the warriors T1. 
---
And innervate the best geared priests ofc.
---
if you have a good profession combo and are smart about AH it really isn't hard
---
It’s got a lot of quests so you’ll likely wanna stomp it!
---
I’m a resto shaman. But in our guild we have 3 of us and we are now all 3 or 5/8. 
---
It’s funny how the drops go. We haven’t seen any rogue T1 yet which is crazy.
---
Thanks for your input. How is Heartseeker as horde? I'm alliance but it's actually a server I would consider transferring to if I ever get the opportunity.
---
What's scam anyway? I just visited that site and it seems legit.
---
Enchanting on the side?  first on server with 30 spellpower.. I was charging 75g each enchant. 20g for each crusader
---
I had about 150g at 40 and I wasn't trying overtly hard to make gold.
---
Well, I like to start fights with seal of crusader and slap that judgement on them as a pull. I feel it increases my kill speed but maybe I just want to press more buttons.
---
&gt; Golden pearls are up to 70g on my server
---
Jesus, they're only 13 on mine.
---
Friends and people online.
---
Dangerous as in am an altoholic, and if I first start I might end up having 7 different lvl 30's 😅
---
I have never NOT done every single quest in STV. Always start right around level 30 and I don't finish until I do that message in a bottle quest that takes you to kill the level 51 king gorilla.
---
Just do it!
---
Because it's a roleplay game. If I want to be a human male peasant, I can go to work. It's all about diving in a fantasy world and chill out.
---
Came from Whitemane and I’m on Anathema now. Not a single regret.
---
And the below comments are why people like myself stay away from toxic reddit :)
---
This was my first real post and it will be my last. Such a crap community. Cant just be happy for a new player :')
---
The only constructive feedback was from  [sphynxzyz](https://www.reddit.com/user/sphynxzyz/), after some non-constructive feedback and straight up false comments.
---
Any pvp on wow is nothing to be proud of. Its slow, boring and crap. Its the worst mmo for pvp.
---
I wasnt "proud", I was simply happy to have my first fight. Whats your problem? :')
---
Have fun being elitists yall
---
I'm the only druid in my guild that's 60.. 0 loot. 4 weeks of running so far.
---
/r/mildlypenis
---
As a tank I normally don’t focus the non-elites UNLESS they’re attacking a healer. Even then, I tell the dps beforehand to kill the non-elites first.
---
Guess ive always be a range guy at heart i love warriors but i just like being in the back line throwing shit at things. I'm a big fps player so probably has to do with that lol
---
(Incoming downvotes)Real hunters solo it like they are meant to. It makes you a better hunter, it took me over three days to solo the silithus demon but I feel good that I was to do it in the end. I even saw other hunters cheese the fight infront of me to the point of getting another top geared hunter to do the kill for them with a lock hearthstone shadowpot etc. They offered to do it for me for a price but I wanted to do it the intended way.
---
I love you man. I hope to run into you soon sometime. Wishing you all the best.
---
You don’t have to leave them alone, but you also don’t have to call it a ”Real pvp experiance” because it really isn’t
---
anyone doing yellow quests can experience this. It happens pretty regularly. I can still manage with ONE mob that is 2 or maybe 3 levels ahead depending on the mob. But for handling 2, they better be my level or below, and for 3, they pretty much have to be green. I'm level 38 currently.
---
Being chased by a mouse clicking, keyboard turning warlock 1.5x my level with a marijuana related name is a top 10 nightmare of mine.
---
Something that auto-deletes specified items from your inventory after looting. The only one I know of only has TBC/WotLK support :/
---
I've been snacking on sauerkraut and homemade pickles instead of chips, sodas and cheese sandwiches. I have also given myself limits to wow. I don't play if there is dirty dishes in the sink, or if my painting area isn't perfectly clean. I have organized my whole life around doing something so I can deserve to play wow. 
---
I go swimming for 15 minutes after every dungeon. So far, so good, I've lost 11 kg
---
Dungeon spamming has really helped making it not as difficult as it once was. Back in the day if all you did was just quest and an occasional dungeon here and there it would take a LONG TIME. Not anyone since you can dungeons spam and everyone needs tanks
---
I've been farming MC on retail off and on since late BC and I've never seen one of the bindings drop... to have both drop in one run is insane.
---
Well.. I'm doing my last year at university (4 out 5), and my thesis will be about audiobooks, which means I have to listen to loads of audiobooks = perfect time to play and study.
---
That's why you always set a reasonable minimum bid.
---
&gt; I'm just speaking from a speed running perspective.
---
No you're not, because the number 1 rule of speedrunning is that the community dictates the rules.
---
This is so true, god I hate this ”meta” or whatever to call it
---
I didn't give him anything lol. Wrong guy. But he asked for suggestions and the suggestion was to do an AoE one, even if he doesn't consider himself an AoE mage. /shrug
---
I believe the crusader but calm down with 75g a pop on 30sp lol.
---
 Retails heirlooms has ruined my eyes perspective on those sets :(
---
Im not seeing how this is a 60g/hour farm, you got 6 and lets say you got full stacks of those sellables its 10g per 10 mins but you said 8 min respawn for more like 10g/20 mins meaning 30g/hour. Or am i missing something? Still a good guide and an easy one to relax to.
---
That’s what she said.
---
Should come to Deviate Delight instead.  Good server.
---
This video literally requires you to be a ROGUE. Nothing about pick pocketing NEEDS improved stealth + prep, it just makes it a big easier and faster. 
---
But, you're missing the point. Someone asked a question and the answer was, "Well stop doing that because it's not the right way to do it."
---
all evidence to the contrary here, i am 100% certain you're an asshole irl.
---
It’s very legible, I think people just don’t like change from default
---
It feels like everything is bolded basically is I guess why I find it a bit ugly.
---
Warrior main here. I'm close to 60 and I don't know what to play for an alt. I'm looking for a class that is good at leveling, farming and pvp (wpvp, bgs and arenas if we get tbc). Leaning towards hunter and druid at the moment.
---
I did this back in retail after it was made much easier and it still felt tedious to do. Doing it in classic must feel insane. Awesome looking mount though, congrats.
---
You just need a clean Yak, and good fortune unto you!
---
Agreed. I love my druid, but I specced her as a feral tank knowing that me healing 5 mans is not realistic without a no cooldown after battle res. I usually find it best to put druids in other roles so they can battle res healers and tanks as needed while another person heals and out of combat resses.
---
Whaaat how does that work? Are they inside blizzard's servers?
---
Fair enough
---
I am a bit of a noob and don't really understand what bindings are. Could you explain why Pick Up Groupies should never expect to roll on this specific good loot?
---
They are at the job interview because they want a paycheck, but they just told me they already have a full time job.
---
Do you do the IF thing everyone is raving about? Or just healthier eating?
---
Yep, that’ll do it. I tried Ungoro at 50, noped out of there and came back at 55. No problem.
---
So this is what Bill Cosby is up to in prison?
---
Waiting 10 minutes for the next boat is only a minor annoyance to you? Haha dang
---
Nice try FBI
---
I suppose. Just be careful. WoW addiction is real. 
---
Remember to hydrate, eat and excercise. 10 hrs a day playing a game sounds awfully unhealthy to me.
---
Was there anything you could have done to position the mobs better? Probably not.
---
Also, what was up with the group to necessitate the use of chain heal... no wonder you had aggro.
---
To be honest those casters should really be burned down 1st. They are non elite after all it can be done.
---
Doesn’t seem like abuse unless the guild has rules against this. Or are you saying that people do this and then don’t uphold their end of the deal?
---
Don’t worry! You will get one more Druid in your guild and then all the Druid will drop! And you’ll lose it all!
---
You're missing the section that says "planning out stuff to have fun later".
---
Badlands rock elementals
---
If you look at the combat log you'll see your pet gain ticks of Happiness when you feed it something.
---
This list is awesome. Theres a few mods I've never looked into before that I'll have to explore when I get time to play!
---
I mean I don't think it has to be limited at exact 50/50, maybe a 2k margin for either faction. I assume a majority of players that are logged are probably within 10 - 30 and probably don't see that much Wpvp action anyway.
---
You could duo mara farm and hit the lockout twice as fast!
---
 But is it fun? The vast majority of people say no.
---
I haven't touched any alts this patch and I hate it. Getting rank 3 essences took me months. I can't log in every day but committing a couple nights a week is no problem ahead of time. My casual 2 night a week guild is 7/8M and I like raiding.
---
I don't have all the BiS benthic gear. My heart is only 67. I've been perpetually behind the whole patch because I missed the first 3 weeks and with my schedule I can't play this current daily system. I've consistently been a 95-99% player since BC but this patch I'm 70-95% because I don't have benthic gear, I don't have BiS gear as a result, I don't have titanforged gear with sockets because I only have the drive to run 1 mythic+ a week.
---
I'm not asking for free loot at all. I'm just asking for reasonably gated content that I can pick away at my own pace. Put the essence system account bound and allow daily system to be maxed out on a weekly basis. Let me play my alts again and feel like I can progress on them reasonably without being forced to grind content I hate. 
---
Stop. RNG. Loot. Possibly the worst system in this game. It's blatantly obvious it's inspired by mobile gaming and loot crates but instead of money we're supposed to trade time.
---
Classic shows me so much about why its game design was good. At some point Blizzard swung over from a design standpoint of "what would be fun to play" as a core design to "what would keep people playing". Heroine keeps people coming back but that doesn't make it good. Fuck the gaming industry lately.
---
Yep! But if you're using it, you gotta be in a world of hurt, it can save the group.
---
And if you're downranking effectively, you're pretty mana efficient (when you're moonglow, and just mashing healing touch all day)
---
We have 2. One planning to go feral tank. Not sure about the other one, but I sure hope it's resto...
---
Dont worry about grinding for a mount. Gold will naturally accumulate one you inch closer to 40. At 35 I had like 10 gold. By 38, I had about 40ish, and at 43 I had 100, all from questing.
---
Pvp rankings in phase 2, when there are no battle grounds, is going to make leveling 45+ a nightmare on PvP servers. Corpse camping, flight master camping, and roaming gank squads will be common place.
---
Getting to 60 before the rankings come out will be much easier than trying to do it after. Also, you are totally right and I didn't even think about that; I'll have way less time to level alts when I have BWL, ZG, and MC to worry about.
---
Sulfuras before 4pm: fair pvp battles   
---
Sulfuras after 4pm: merciless camping and griefing galore in tanaris, felwood, searing gorge, and plaguelands.   
---
Either way, at least there's enough alliance around now that it's not a total 5v1 slaughter anymore.
---
Mage or hunter for farming.
---
Druid or mage for pvp. (Druid moreso in wpvp and bg's as people will want you for flag carrying)
---
Is that why he spends the intro going over necessary talents in Subtlety? A combat rogue without imp stealth can’t efficiently pickpocket this at all. You will constantly have to reset, making the guide useless for Rogues outside of this build.
---
He asked for recommendations, and the recommendation is to go AoE build.
---
There is a multitude of reasons it will break.
---
1) DR lower duration on trap.
---
2) enemy spell resistance in this case frost
---
3) iceblock, escape artist and other mentioned abilities
---
4) damage to enemy, a single auto, dot or spell may break it.
---
5) every second the trap has an internal chance to break early built in, all CC does in addition to any resistance breaking the enemy may have.
---
CC is pretty unreliable. This is why fear is considered the most OP CC for Vanilla, it has a high damage breaking threshold and seems to be less subject to break early making it more reliable. Dots do a small amount of damage in smaller increments which makes them even less likely to break fear.
---
Ok. I don’t know where to reply because there are so many people saying HoJ is bad in this post. What the fuck is wrong with all of you? If you don’t want to take the time to farm it, ok. Fine. I understand. But don’t say the best trinket2 until late AQ is bad. It’s quite clearly bis and your DPS is worse if you do not have it.
---
Will do :)
---
We appreciate privacy
---
Keybind mode from the action bars options from the elvui menu
---
come to Sulfuras. pretty balanced and not much griefing
---
Do you remember when soulstones gave Rez sickness :p
---
If you have any professions, look for a spot that lets you maximizes your income (e.g. caves if you are a miner, fields/GY's for herb, beasts for skinning).
---
Dungeons are good, you can make some really decent gold at your level spellcleaving SM.
---
Other than that, random quests are fine for leveling as the rewards can be vendored for a bit.
---
Remember to install the "VendorPrice" addon so you know exactly how much items sell for to a vendor so that you can prioritize junk/rewards.
---
I went to 1 MC PUG right after reaching 60, we were 39 people and didn't have a single druid.
---
We found one for MotW and to not waste loot and this guy ended up getting like 5 pieces of loot.
---
If i already have a 60 Hunter should i level a rogue or a lock first (I'll be leveling both). It will be, pugging mc/ony, making gold (pick pocket or Mara runs), doing some pvp mostly as a break from mc/ony and tribute runs on my Hunter as it can only get gear from mc at this point.
---
well reserving HOJ only serves to not fill the party. I once saw a reserved items group lfm for 4 hours.
---
Just was looking this up https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-timbermaw-hold-reputation Quissy has a video in the link as well.
---
This response makes me feel sad for you
---
Most of the time I ran ubrs my warrior tank friend and I  one tanked pugs. Not that hard honestly do if you have a hunter
---
OMG yes!!
---
Hopefully you're next then :)
---
Probably, wanna hangout sometime to find out?
---
Yeah thats exactly what im sayin! The private server elites have created the standard (justifiably) and all these dumbass reddit referees are asking the same stupid question to a random guy thats merely participating as if hes got a say in it lmao
---
I mean it's cool and immersive the first 5 times, the next 3000 times you hearth to a major city and forget to desummon not so much so it makes sense they changed it.
---
Pick up herbalism or mining. Go out of your way to level it up. By the time you are in your 20s it starts to pays off. Get an auction add on. Post auctions just before peak hours if possible. Skinning and just vendering the leather can help with a little start up money. It's not that great higher level though. Auction greens/blues with good stats. Int/stam, str/agi, str/vit, agi/vit, int/spir. boom gold. I started with nothing and have 32 gold at lvl 25. Just started a few days ago.
---
Agreed, a set would be nice.
---
Once I got to mid 40s to low 50s, when I got access to both holy shield and consecration, I could pull around 3 mobs and live, though it works better if they are green to you. I could probably get away with more, but that requires cds and consumables
---
"Everyone is telling me why I'm wrong. They must all be wrong." lul
---
I stayed at the Arathi Highland orcs from 33-37 and made at least 50g
---
at lv 32, I had 8g.... at lv 39 I had 90g
---
&gt; Any pvp on wow is nothing to be proud of. Its slow, boring and crap. Its the worst mmo for pvp.Have fun being elitists yall 
---
It's slow and boring because you literally play that way. Anyone halfway decent at PvP doesn't click their abilities. If you had taken the time to see what halfway decent PvP videos look like you might have caught on to that.
---
I didn't like the video, but stayed away from commenting on it because I figured you would get railed by anyone who actually PvPs, and you did. But the above quoted comment is just flat out wrong.
---
Wrong in what way? I have not made any comments that need be proved factual or not. I simply posted a video. There is nothing to prove wrong :')  
---
Go back to bed :')
---
New guild. If you enjoy the guild, you can level your alt in it, but I wouldn't invest in a group that doesn't give you any returns back.
---
I vendor 90% of the drops because its just not worth it to sell them on the AH, I post the living essence, any decent greens i think will sell for significantly more than vendor, and blues/epics all of the herbs i basically vendor unless they’re worth something. Just gotta see what would work best for your server.
---
Id def get a new guild.  I know hunters aren't as useful in raids, in terms of raw numbers, but MC isn't as hard as it used to be.  We are able to clear MC easily with a grab bag of classes as long as we have the core healing and tanking set up.  It seems to me that they are purposely trying to gear up someone over you.  If anything they should be rotating you in and out.  Im sure a lot of other guilds would be happy to have a pre bis hunter in their mc or ony groups.
---
YTA for using your phone to take a picture instead of just taking a screen shot.
---
Have you ever played a dps caster?

Likely the mountains of the hinterlands, I suspect.

I figured this one out after many tries: the key (at least for me) to the fight was timing the sting. When applied it lasts 20 seconds, and after 15 seconds he'll enrage and you'll need to reapply it. Track the timer so that you are nowhere near him around 5s left on of the sting.
---
Keep smacking him with your demonslayer with the demonslaying enchant, use the demonslaying elixir and some potions and you should be fine.
---
I work with a couple of pylons.
---
&gt; No one is claiming it's an accomplishment. You know what I do when I'm lvling and a bunch of horde are running around and ganking? I go to another zone or log on an alt. I don't go crying on Reddit. 
---
I mean, you are crying right now about people saying mean things about ganking lowbies. Why are you being so defensive about this?
---
Yeah I'm also interested in what class they're playing. Most classes can replace a ton of gear from only/mc
---
Lvl 62 greens making epic bis and legendaries irrelevant pisses me of so much.
---
&gt; I'd wager that most people are still not 60.
---
However, if you charted the hours spent online in a week by level, 60's would absolutely dominate that chart. So most of the players you actually see are 60. This gives a skewed impression.
---
LOL I was waiting for this comment
---
BWL is not that hard... Having a balance Druid in the raid is not all of a sudden going to mean you don’t have the DPS to burn down Vael. If you are in a guild that’s wants to push C’Thun and naxx, yeah you have to be mindful of your comp, but even then I remember my guild in classic had C’Thun on farm bringing a boomkin every week. And the game was far less “solved” then it is now. 
---
The difficulty in clearing BWL is getting your guild enough loot to pass the gear checks.
---
If there was an archer class without pets, I'd probably be all over that. But since there isn't, here I am as a warrior ahaha.
---
Teldrassil and night elf zones are so special. Amazing music such as Song of Elune and Moonfall encapsulates the feeling, and the environment and colorful flora is incredible.
---
You have the meme stick as well! Our druid tank recently acquired that one as well.
---
Wyrmtongues are good shoulders, so you shouldnt feel like you need ts to compete, but Im quite confident ts would be a small upgrade. Youre trading 23/29 of a crit for 1 ap and 2 hit, and hit is going to improve 50 to 60 percent of your dps by about 2%, while the crit is going to improve 100- poison share of your dps, but by some factor thats certainly below one percent, even accounting for the fact that 1 crit increases your ss damage by more than 1 percent with lethality. Sc and wyrmtongues are both better than wyrmhides though, if you have the hit cap otherwise.
---
what addon is that?
---
Yeah so why are they asking a random guy whos merely participating in a challenge which already has standards established as opposed to blabbering to the people who actually set the standards?
---
Or better yet they could go attempt to get anywhere even close to the times of these pserver guilds and make their own standards? Plot spoiler: they wont and should probably just be quiet for the same reason fans in the stadium at an nfl game dont try to change the fuckin rules lawl
---
Shit. I didn’t even think about pvp...
---
As a main druid. Give up the hotw/ns spec. It's really good if you want to solo , otherwise,  it's pretty bad compared to moonglow. 
---
I had my heart set on that spec but unless you have the perfect gear it's pretty woeful and you'll find in raids you just cant do a good job . There is genuinely nothing worse than looking at the healing meter and seeing yourself dead bottom last.
---
As for an alt ? At 60 you will find there is wayyyy to much to do and farm to keep up two characters. 
---
You will find yourself switching between chars often, and you will suffer with hear, epic mount and professions unless you are playing non stop every day for 10 hours.
---
My suggestion to you is turn your mind off from having an alt. Turn your focus to your druid main, hey to 60, raid and farm money. Unless you are in a serious guild with ample time, having two characters just isnt worth it in classic !
---
(Coming from a half bis druid with a 55 hunter alt , so much time wasted when I could of been focusing on my main and practising to become decent )
---
I thought Smoking Heart required Enchanting.
---
Except for warlocks, druids, hunters and shamans?
---
You’re 37.  Not exactly qualified to make a statement on the accuracy or inaccuracy of “common knowledge.”
---
It only shows if you don't have automatic re-sub enabled.
---
I have not suffered this experience....at all!
---
Belts are BoE. The real worry is the BoPs.
---
Darnassus :) elves did it right
---
Well you need to be lvl 20 to get consecration first but started dungeons ASAP and had no issues but i took extra steps. 
---
Bought gear from AH to increase mana pool due to concentration take up like 135 mana per use
---
I used armor kits
---
Started out with a mithril shield spike(now im on thorium) for reflective damage.
---
Had stacks of armor potions
---
Had stacks of stamina scrolls
---
Also bought stacks of this food called smoked sagefish which gives you like 15 mana every 5 seconds buff for 10min.
---
Blessing of wisdom is a must
---
Also kept stacks of instant mana potions so i can pull more and keep aggro
---
For dungeon groups:
---
Priest is a must for OP heals
---
Druid for thorns(important)
---
Mage for water and the intellect buff is a huuuuuuggggeeee help and the Aoe
---
Warlock for soulstone/healthstone also AoE
---
Will take warriors too for battle shout
---
Sometimes take pallie for the armor aura because 1 pallie can only have 1 active aura up at a time.
---
I do not take hunters and rogues because single target damage is so good i cannot get aggro back.
---
But for solo mob grinding i just need a shield spike and i was ready to go.
---
Nah, just don't spam rejuvs. Healing touch is more efficient
---
I might just have my coworker whip that up quick....don’t have Photoshop on my computer
---
ALL WoW pvp is boring and slow. Look up ANY other mmo on the market and see how much better it looks.No video or keybinding is going to change thatWow is known as the carebear, PvE mmo on all other mmos.  
---
Point proven everyday as enemies simply run past me
---
hmm, i'll try this then, thanks.
---
what server?
---
thanks, i'll try both of these and see if they work.
---
Pretty sure ElvUI handles half of these addons natively.
---
&gt; anyone doing yellow quests can experience this.
---
I routinely do yellow quests. If a quest drops to green, I usually lose interest in doing it (as I always have more yellows to do). Honestly, my Classic experience is apparently completely different than what y'all are seeing.
---
A lot of guild leaders and officers back down at confrontation even over voice chat to be honest.
---
I've been in a couple of guilds where people used to find it hilarious when I would stand up to their bullshit.
---
We would be discussing in private chat how they were being unreasonable and would always ask me to say something. It's pretty fun provided you pick your battles so you aren't creating unecessary drama :)
---
It’s really hard to explain clearly. The best I can try to explain is like if there are two or more mobs, not close enough to pull,you and I pull them away from their spawn/pat location. Now if I take my mob near you while you’re fighting yours you are in combat with mine, so if I then run away and leash the mob instead of returning to the spawn location it will come running to you. This is especially apparent on aoe grinding.
---
This is not at all how it worked originally through vanilla, BC and Wrath at least. If you don’t touch me or the mob and it’s away from the spawn location you should not be in combat with my mob.
---
Huh hadn't even thought of that
---
You realize thunderfury applies the TC debuff, yeah? That debuff is just a given.
---
I have no idea, as I don't use any add-ons from Twitch unfortunately.
---
I believe neither of those gonna make more money then a hunter by farming. Personally i would level the rogue since both the lock and the hunter are ranged dps with pets. Stealthy playstyle would feel refreshing to me.
---
how about wings and beer and ubrs?
---
Funny, it's the exact opposite for me, can't find the gold one. What is it?
---
Hit Cap is 9% so it's not. But it'll leave you open to have better gear since Rogues don't get many trinkets. I would do it for that reason. HOJ is overrated and barely increases your damage.
---
Spy is not gamebreaking...
---
I like photo shop
---
Edit: Ms paint
---
Also gnome, but female, any plate becomes a chainmail bikini and it's a weird aesthetic on such a short body. Makes you look like a lumpy potato.
---
I would just kill you for knowing you tried to be an elite.
---
I joined a guild around May, with the knowledge that it might end up a dud, but I figured I had nothing to lose. I was genuinely surprised at how well its gone. Leadership was wise and recruited more than we needed, with the knowledge that many would drop off in the leveling process. Many did (a good number of them didn't even turn up on launch day), but we had more than enough dedicated members left to form a solid core of 20-30 guys. We recruited some more while dungeoning in game and here we stand.
---
Individually there is but duo not so much
---
Its 5 days.
---
Thats a stupid tax, everyone has to pay that every once in a while.
---
Mana and health potions haven't been profitable since launch on my server.  That goes for most potions, actually.  I've only been making gold off of Fire Protection Potions and Frost Oil so far.  Looks like elixir of mongoose and stoneskin are both getting close to being worth making though.
---
Buy them. Lots of them.
---
I am, its noted too.
---
Engineering is a must for pvp. 
---
Tailoring has limited use other than for robes of the void. Once you have it, tailoring has no real use till ZG. But you will eventually want tailoring for the bloodvine set and its bonus. 
---
Frankly, tailoring plus engineering is a great choice (not for making gold). Your alternative is to drop tailoring and get it again once ZG is our for the bloodvine set (or skip the bloodvine set if you don’t care about min-maxing raid damage).
---
Same here. Usually more like 8 a week. And my GF still thinks I play too much...
---
The gnomes shall feel the wrath of my meme stick come phase 2
---
I don't even get any response at all. I see "LFM heals" in chat, whisper in literally 5 seconds, and just get no response. It happens every single day.
---
Lack of rez is almost never a problem either because really, people only die if shit goes horribly wrong, and in that case, it's probably going to be a wipe anyway.
---
DBM. Right click the icon on the mini map.
---
You both should solo farm gold. Warlocks can solo DM East and Mara for 50-200gold per hour.
---
Rogues can do brd pickpocket farming/vault runs.
---
You’re likely slowing each other down trying to farm gold together.
---
Whats so unbelievable about that?
---
Nice job bro. You should meal prep come quick cheap healthy meals too. I find when I’m in grind mode I end up shutting whatever’s handy. Which is usually bad food lol.
---
Edit: eating. Not sure what shutting food is.
---
Not directly, but the 1% hit leaves you open to putting on better gear. For example Head of Rend instead of the Mask.
---
It wouldn't mainly be used for gold but i would still gold farm just for a change of pace once and a while
---
I don't think there's any PvE synergy or advantage in that pairing, sorry. Doubt there's anything you can do together that would be better money per person than what you could do solo. Warlock doesn't have stealth, rogue isn't ranged damage and can't kite or abuse pathing. Neither is a healer. 
---
You could give DM:East a shot, warlock can solo it but rogue can just add more DPS. The warlock has to hold aggro, but maybe with some Searing Pain the rogue will be able to contribute decently.
---
I like it. Deviate Delight feels balanced and the community feels aware. I get lots of help from Ally when I'm getting ganked and occasionally you can get a group to go *do* the ganking.
---
Yesterday some Skull Undead helped me mine nodes that had high level mobs around them, then the 3 of us went and jumped off a cliff together.
---
And because it's a low-pop server you can tell everyone is a little less competitive, I get lots of help on dungeons I'm unfamiliar with, and for the most part everyone seems very friendly about and approachable.
---
It really does feel like a great server, very happy to be here. Also being an RP server is cool too, a lot of people are literally just there to have fun. Perfect place for newbies\\slow paced players like myself and my friend group.
---
Ooh nice. How do you make it conditional on combat?
---
What?
---
Is there a pirate costume for getting honored with BB or something?
---
I’m farming shredders for fused wiring.
---
Yeah for sure i love having pets but it's annoying in raids.. think I'll try hunter out though I'm trying to break my old mmo self where u try to be bleeding edge and min max so hard that i just don't have fun anymore.
---
2% hit DM trinket. Cost me 7 gold on my server.
---
Be warned, the spreadsheet is based on wowclassicbis.com. That website is full of errors when it comes to BIS for my own class. I assume it is full of errors for other classes as well.
---
Yea no. For raiding ofc. 1 spell "rotation" but for pvp. o boy
---
You really shouldn't google shit while your driving I had a similar experience I played in vanilla and my wife hated it. I tricked her into playing one day right after BC came out and she ended up being the healing officer in our guild until MOP came put and our core group all put the game down due to disinterest. We are back at it in classic though.
---
Sweet - thanks!
---
Once you get the kiting path down around the ruins it’s not too bad. Hardest part is hitting him every ~4 seconds to prevent him from resetting.
---
So far what i saw in vid not a single of the top 3 Horde guilds were there.
---
Return be afraid of Phase 2 ;)
---
if you enter an instance that had at least one boss killed before - you are saved. Say group lead has an ID and starts raid invites - people will get his ID and get locked on entering the raid.
---
What is the reasoning for you being on the bench all the time?  If you're online on time and someone else is showing up right before show time, personally as a raid leader I'd sit them for a night so they get the message to stop making me wait around for them.  
---
I second the suggestion to go with a pug.  My server is pretty small and we've got two regular pugs for raid content.  I imagine you can find a spot.  See how that works out and you might find a new home.
---
Omfg, did we just become bestfriends???
---
That's weird, Immersion breaking
---
I started a Gnome called Trumpkillu.
---
ayyy
---
Just can't get through to some people. This is why you shouldn't smoke as a teenager.
---
Then how do you explain mages.
---
Careful for the water elementals near the coast because they are immune to frost spells
---
Seriously, one of if not the greatest WoW meme. Up there with “moar dotzz” and “4 str 4 stam leather belt”
---
Arcanist's is better anyway.
---
&gt; A good, well played balance druid can do about as much single-target damage as a deep frost mage.
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/Bk7YNLATQKPCRXjZ
---
Only on a few fights.
---
That's why it isn't in the game yet. It will be added in p5 as it was also late in Vanilla lifespan.
---
It's not.  There's a "new" brd pickpocketing video posted here every day it seems like.  Basic pockpocket runs are around 20g/h.  Climbs to 30g/h if you do coffers and kill bosses.  Ton of rng involved though since you can go multiple runs without pickpocket resists, or you can get 10 in 10 minutes.
---
Hi.
---
Shut the fuck up.
---
Thanks.
---
Hm... that looks like small indie company strikes again....
---
As someone that has a job I love you should really lay off. Not everyone can get what we have, and I'm guessing you dont even have it, just jumping on the hate bandwagon.
---
Me (being a heavy pvper) I am looking forward to phase 3 as the difficulty ramps up for PVE as there's going to be at least 2 bosses which are going to be a wall for many guilds. As well WSG gives us a dedicated place for pvp.
---
Being on alliance at the moment, and the server being heavily unbalanced in terms of population numbers, will be nice to face a 10v10 finally instead of a mess.
---
As well, phase 4 as I really miss the green dragons, they hold a lot of fun gear.
---
&gt; But is it fun? The vast majority of people say no.
---
hum, what vast majority?
---
we're not even 3 month into classic and the population shrinked enough to remove layer, raid logging is already plaguing the raiding guilds and so on.
---
yes, classic released during a content drought... on purpose from blizzard, likely. BFA will see a bump in player when the tier/season comes, just like classic will see a bump when BGs comes out.
---
&gt;I don't have all the BiS benthic gear
---
which only matter if you were a mythic raider pushing progression hard... most of the benthic effect don't work outside of EP/nazjatar
---
&gt;My heart is only 67. 
---
which give you 3 essence slot. lvl 70 is only a cosmetic upgrade.
---
&gt;I've been perpetually behind the whole patch because I missed the first 3 weeks
---
you can grind in a day what people grinded in 3 week, thanks to the  nature of azerite power.
---
&gt;I don't have titanforged gear with sockets because I only have the drive to run 1 mythic+ a week.
---
you largely overestimate the importance of titanforging. Socket is slightly more valid... but if you were a mythic raider pushing progression, you'd know having a wider variety of classes matters way more.
---
&gt;daily system to be maxed out on a weekly basis.
---
there's already big chunk of the daily system on a weekly / biweekly basis : mythic chest is a weekly, emissaries are 3-day ( bi-weekly), rare spawn in nazjatar are weekly, mechagon is weekly, island are weekly... the juiciest group AP quest stay up for 2 days, the world bosses are weekly...
---
&gt;Stop. RNG. Loot. Possibly the worst system in this game
---
this has just been replaced by spamming arena + angerforge a 100 time for your HoJ... bloated loot table with only one or two desirable item in them.
---
So those servers where alliance is mass leaving because of unbalanced population, are going to be completely boned when phase 5 hits? How would they ever collect mats for the war effort?
---
In 5mans it really doesn't matter because nothing in 5mans is a DPS check other than Baron.
---
Looks like elvui to me
---
I didn't play original vanilla, but this slogfest is making me lose all motivation to even raid MC, etc while it's relevant.    The "quests on rails" is so much better than this.   At least it's not anywhere near this much of a grind.
---
There’s a pirate costume for being exalted with bloodsail buccaneers, which you need to be hated by BB to do.
---
The closest inn, because I need that sweet, sweet rested xp.
---
A quick YouTube search will give you plenty of results, you'll be able to judge for yourself which are good or jot
---
Yeah I’m very excited for non dominated horde PvP as well. My realm is 70/30 horde which just sucks. What do you mean a wall for many guilds?
---
I tanked 9/10 using this set:
---
https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/5mXC6BjkKByzcUS2e2zwPS
---
Working on FR gear for rag currently
---
Meh at this point most people have out leveled you and dont have alts high enough level yet to be in STV. Therefor, there will be a fraction of the people there were around launch. It will be much more manageable now. The quest routes are really wonky, though, and require very very very long and repetitive runs from top-to-bottom of the zone.
---
PVP server perspective.
---
We have 2-3 per molten core split which we run 3 of per week. We have a healthy balance of resto and bear. We don’t use cats or boomkin because frankly they are sub-optimal.
---
Edit - being delicate to casual druids
---
what about the membership card
---
So your idea of fun is forcing people to deal with rng and loot rolls before entering a raid that is clearable in blues and greens? You do you bud.
---
Also people are trying to join literally any raiding guild in droves. If that is the attitude your guild has towards raids a lot will leave.
---
\^This
---
No consumes, no enchants (not to brag just to show you what I’m working with). guild is like 20 members and been pugging rest
---
The other faction would have to feed resources to get the war effort done, or allow them to farm for it is basically how it works otherwise the war effort won't progress.
---
Dude ive run this 50 times myself as a tank going for naglering (not even asking to roll on HoJ) and theres always been at least 2 rogues in there for HoJ. Never even saw it.
---
I eventually got nagle and largely stopped running that farm. I wasnt about to farm that bitch for OS. 
---
Then randomly im helping out my guildies with a BRD quest run (theyre all casters), fucking HoJ drops.
---
And honestly this has been the theme of classic for me across the board. Every time im actually farming for an item it doesnt drop. Randomly helping friends or guildies, expecting nothing, and i get fucking diamonds dude. Have had it happen literally 10 times or more just like that.
---
as a hunter? sure. ranged attack don't have the same penalties as melee.
---
on my mage?.. well, if the AoE spot are too crowded maybe.
---
on my priest? it happened several times yes.
---
The likelihood of them being able to complete Thunderfuy is far less likely.  A PUG would need to get the second binding, then run and get the Eternium Ore from BWL - and then kill the World Boss. It has a lot of steps and the likelihood of it happening is very low.
---
Also, Thunderfury on a warrior tank is BIS. A lot of guilds want their main tank outfitted before a random gets an item that greatly helps them progress and can only hope that the PUG comes back.
---
Any time 2-3 players can attack one at the same time, it's a sub 1 second death unless LIPs are used.
---
 I remember you... In the mountains... But you... what is this? Where am--
---
Stratholme, I have always been a big fan of the whole story surrounding The Scourge &amp; Arthas. 
---
I also have a lot of good memories in there.
---
&gt;Herod Horde
---
Wow, how did you manage to make it through STV, must have been brutal with a whole 1/4 of the pop being alliance players /s
---
People are really unfair to the sc four piece; its only a little worse than bis if done in your combination, but you dont have to farm late bosses of dungeons no one runs. Glad to see it recommended.
---
This guy gets mad bitches. I can tell.
---
Gauntlets of Divinity are great. Still using them at 53. The scarlet boots and gauntlets are good too.
---
The Helm and shoulders are ok if you've nothing better.
---
Beyond that not much but that's a far cry from the comment I responded to. 
---
This is also easily looked up public info for a game that came out forever ago...but I don't mind correcting you and the comment I originally responded to.
---
 Also, I'll answer how and when I please.
---
Cant see any addon that changes the textfont, anyone know?
---
How do I give permission to someone to edit dkp points?
---
PvE Realms tend to have little Horde, while PvP little Alliance. Players will have to deal with it... and use neutral AHs to trade goods to the other faction. Also the War Effort has a failsafe and with time will start lowering amount of goods required.
---
It does require it to make, but not to equip. So most people just level it to 265, make the trinket then drop it.
---
Played on a 5 year old eu pserver with 300 people online. Was really nice, alot of deadmines groups going daily, random Naxx runs and a lot of RP.
---
I really hope they at least leave one server on classic forever :-)
---
Dropped on the 101st kill for me. Guild rogue won roll. Still farming for it. :]
---
Hence why I rolled a druid: No having to play the rez drink rez drink game, and only 1 raid buff to manage.
---
At what level do you start doing this?
---
I think my guild is equivalent to a pug. our first mc is in 2 days and i have my doubts.
---
we'll see what it's like though. I would have liked the lionheart helm but im short a bit of gold &gt;.&gt;
---
Bit of a tossup.
---
Lock can summon DM:E for really good gold gains, and rogue can pickpocket for varying gold gains.
---
Lock is much easier to level first without any help or gear.
---
For sure, just ridiculous that I got that first.
---
Probably about the same, only saw the caster belt drop twice. Second time it went to a warlock, which is annoying but understandable, but the first time a resto druid got it. A fucking resto druid. Doesn't even benefit from the hit. 
---
Then in MC last night the loot council gave Mana Igniting Cord to a healing priest. BiS for mages until C'Thun, and priests have a better one in DM, and for some reason they won't explain, it went to a fucking priest.
---
Maybe I just have bad luck with belts.
---
I looked at your profile before I replied the second time and decided what your character is. You're laughable if you think that you have some sort of grasp on what it means to be sensible and logical or funny for that matter. Calling people normies(As if your special. You insult people who actually live with stigmas.) and retarded. I know the exact depth of your character. Criticize but take no criticism. 
---
Your really going to hate this next part. Since it's futile to get you to reflect upon your own character,  I'm blocking you so that you can't get your little last word in that makes you feel like you've won. It's time for you to grow up a little bit.
---
Told a 38 not to kill a 16 on ratchet boat and he then went on a rant about how I should play on a pve server. It made it so much better when a 60 rouge 1-shot him immidieatly after :)))
---
Pretty sure they are timed from the second you pull the first trash.
---
Whats a top level comment...? Anyway, hello reddit sorter pls pick me ty!
---
Scholomance.
---
Thith
---
What server are you on?
---
You need time?
---
this sounds like either a useless or a scummy ass system tbh 
---
scenario one is where you can see everyone dkp on a website somewhere and can math it out anyway making any sort of secrecy useless 
---
scenario 2 is its all hidden which opens up all kinds of scummy behavior from the loot giver/s
---
due to the short CD, I find myself using stomp fairly regularly. it's just a nice added stun especially when dps pulls off a mob
---
Does anyone know of a addon that change textfonts?
---
What is that addontracking the kills?
---
You can, but it costs you 5% of the bid price (the auction house cut essentially).
---
it's a 500 point damage shield.
---
one cleave and it's gone.
---
one caster mob targetting you instead of the tank and it's gone.
---
one boss ( like satyr boss sacrifice) targetting you and it's gone... or wathever hydrospawn do.
---
tank get gouged and you're second on list? gone.
---
mage start AoE'ing but some ranged mob isn't caught in the blizzard? yeah, probably gone.
---
it's a trash ring.
---
Crap video about crazy kewl action! Wow! This is better then vanilla
---
&gt;Who’s geared and skilled in phase 1 to take aggro off the tank??? 
---
DPS differs like 400 in current BIS vs Naxx bis iirc and these rankings are correct (Tips Out has ranking from pservers so not 100%). Thats not alot meaning threat is a much bigger issue now than it will be in later phases.
---
Like people cant be skilled enough in this phase to max DPS.
---
&gt;You’re handicapping yourself trying to match DPS and not using other abilities. 
---
Again, you don't try to match DPS but threat. Hence Heroic Strikes, Sunder armor and Revenge. But I have also explained this multiple times so by now I just assume your a troll or arguementing for the sake lf not being wrong. 
---
None of the things I've talked about is about opinion and there is tons of math in the Fight Club discord for you to go check out. I suggest you do it.
---
I Don't Care if you like better food you're getting longjaw mudsnappers for the rest of your life.
---
Most fish too. I knew a guy who's senior project was a fully automated aquaponics setup. He tested it by leaving it on over winter break. The auto-feeder for the fish ran out of food. He left with a dozen goldfish and came back to one very big goldfish.
---
My favorite place is black rock mountain, killing people on the way into their instance is fun.
---
The Mirage Raceway in Thousand needles was always my favorite place. It had the perfect depiction of rivalry between tinker-mad races (gnomes and goblins) in a way that was silly and fun. Plus, I used to buy the ice cream there and then pretend I was the ice cream man at the Crossroads.
---
Because you can have a resto druid pick it up then just get another fury warrior.
---
Anything that spawns off of specific locations in the world will have a lower price (devilsaur and anything from thorium/herbalism), but anything from instances or random drops won't.
---
Fair point!
---
I am rolling with a 2.7 and a 2.5 timing wise.
---
Honestly, just look at the dps on the weapon and you're fine. Don't overthink it. Just look at the deeps.
---
My priest is spec’d as a healer, which means any quest that the mobs are clustered in a way where you can’t help but aggro 3+ wrecks me. I always appreciate when someone is willing to party up, otherwise I have to out-level those quests to the point that they are gray to be able to do them. I am new to the game, so I may just be missing something, but I find a lot more success paired with a second player where I can heal them and do dmg while they take aggro and dmg.
---
Gandhi was Hindu but your point still stands
---
EU Shazzrah.  We are currently disenchanting the majority of Druid gear because our 1 Druid already got most of it.
---
yeah i did that at the end of the tirion questline. chose the chest instead of the dps trinket(?) which, according to skarm (a yt war), is nigh-on best dps trink (it could be a ring) for the whole 6 phases - particularly if you get unlucky w/ drops
---
-.-
---
worst thing, i watched the vid a week before doing the questline and then forgot to double check when accepting the reward. and than 5mins later im like, oh let's see
---
are you sure? especially as a warlock ( it goes away when you lifetap / hellfire, right?) any ring, even green, with the smallest amount of int/stamina or damage would be better ( eye of orgrimmar from BRD quest comes to mind).
---
heck, the 3 int 3 stamina ring from that lvl 25ish quest in hillsbrad would likely see more mileage than this epic
---
The most xp/h would be if you pull lile 6-12mobs and only use hellfire while your mate perma heals you (with lower rank heal).
---
I helped my lvl 25 mage friend  as a priest and we needed like 30min per level
---
Edit: 
---
obviously you dont want to be in a group with him and pull all mobs. This way you lose 0 exp if he only heals you.
---
No you want fast offhand because you have less chance to hit so more swings means more hits. Main hand should be slow hard hitting to get most out of SS
---
Yup wait till your lvl 50 and still spamming ms with you ww axe
---
10 minute cooldown.
---
Mage: just do jumping jacks while drinking.
---
You think the chances of two people rolling the same number once is 1 in 10,000?
---
We also want a tank druid. We are literally searching for everything right now. As long as it is druid.
---
I kited her and the pet just fine. She stops to cast, making her easy to kite, so just use scatter/concussive to keep the pet at bay while you run around the lake. Was a lot easier than trying to burn the pet down first like a lot of guides suggest.
---
Pretty much haha
---
They fucked it totally and I am pissed. Herod ally
---
"The soldier from the mountains!"
---
It should be in scrolling combat text, just as 'healing'. I see mine, and I'm pretty sure it's not an addon.
---
A boss that is going to stop guilds from progressing past it for a long time, or at all.
---
Vaelastrasz the Corrupt for example is a huge DPS check more than coordination. As you have a finate amount of time before you run out of tanks. As well DPS are getting exploded as well so you're losing people to keep said tanks up.
---
Chromaggus as well is another huge hurdle for a lot of guilds. There's a lot of coordination that goes on, and even more emphasis on cleansing which is a massive part of the fight. Depending on the weekly modifiers (as it picks 2 per week out of 5) it could be incredibly hard, or incredibly easy.
---
I like it because it removes the clutter off my screen. Helps me see more of the game world
---
Like I said man, if this is working for you then go ahead, but I’m 100% sure you’re losing threat far more often than a prot warrior would, and you think it’s because your DPS is doing too much damage. The reality is you’ve never gone prot, you’re not in defensive stance, have any points in defiance, you’re making the game harder on yourself and your healers because you don’t know how to tank properly. But hey, if it works for you, I guess.
---
I seen a post on here where Blizzard allows gold transfers from retail to classic. So I don't see why it would get you banned. They also said if you get scammed it's your fault and they can't do anything about that.
---
Glad to see it's just me then. I never have a problem with druids doing anything, hell I love a boomkin for that crit.  Maybe I ought to give it another go. Those cenarion peices are gonna be going to waste for my guild soon
---
Yeah, there's definitely a shortage of tanks, but not a shortage of warriors.
---
No one wants to be a tank, it's basically looking after a bunch of children that keep trying to get themselves killed.
---
I'm leveling my alt as a balance druid, but focusing on leveling my shammy first
---
Nah I'm good fam. Herod belongs to the horde. It's not my fault you rolled the wrong faction
---
Alliance, but still awsome! GG
---
Ashenvale. These woods are mesmerized.
---
Still one of the best looking sets out there. Thats what a druid should look like. Sadly t3 druid looks so uninteresting (never gonna get it anyways)
---
There's usually options in most UI addons called 'out of combat alpha' which sets the opacity/transparency of the bar when you're out of combat
---
Thanks yes, but I have both of those and I'm pretty sure mine shows timers for others as well, but I will have to check.
---
Your gear icon tells me that isn't the first time it went wrong.
---
&gt;This was the view **back in the day** and it was very disheartening
---
Yeah, I don't think there was as much info available about druid's raid viability in 2004.
---
No you cant reset instance from inside an instance. Or what do you mean ?
---
I triggered her in the forest not expecting the pet to have changed.
---
So if you heal a friend, you see a green number above their char with the amount you healed?
---
A few mages in my guild have rerolled druid, trying to compete with 6-7 other people when like 1-2 pieces drop per run (we have shitty mage drops) is a bit rough.
---
Wtf is that font? Looks like you took a screenshot, deleted the text, and then just typed it out yourself. Doesn't even look like it's part of the game.
---
Are u kidding? He could just dungeon boost u to hell! Ez mod
---
Comments like this are specifically why I chose a pink haired gnome rogue! :D
---
I believe that will only display healing you cast on yourself.
---
Taking min maxing to a new level.
---
How did you handle conflagration on drakki?
---
Yes. Its the one on the right side with no done infront
---
Nah he wants it to pop up above the person he heals not just on your screen.  Afaik there's no way to do it no setting and no addon.
---
Except if you work out more, your BMR is higher so you can eat more calories despite only burning so many calories per each exercise.
---
Indeed, it will reak havoc for the customer service if they do not adress this properly
---
i have completely stopped helping a lot of my guild with anything, there are a few players that i will do whatever with because they aren't selfish douchebags
---
I don't think it's my guild as much as it is that the most common type of player in this game is a selfish me me me me greed goblin
---
You have a naive and simplistic view of the world

Cheers xo
---
I thought if you help someone then the quest cannot be completed?
---
Don't start that discussion...
---
the asshole no, but stupid yes. Why would you even do this? It's not even a good prank, it's just dumb.
---
The bindings are used to make Thunderfury, a legendary quality sword that is amazing for tanking. Like its no joke, this sword is game changing. If your guilds MT has a thunderfury, they generate way more threat (and aoe threat which is HUGE). A Tanks biggest concern in later content is actually threat generation, rather than survivability. 
---
You need 1 binding from Garr and 1 binding from Baron Geddon to craft the sword, in addition to of a bunch of other less rare but still very expensive items. It is genuinely a 40 person effort to get someone this sword. But it benefits EVERYONE in the guild.
---
The bindings themselves are incredibly rare. I ran Molten Core every week for at least 6 months, and never saw a single binding. The fact that someone got both bindings in 1 run is INSANE to me. Some guilds got 1 binding to drop very early in vanilla wow and then never saw the second binding drop.
---
Due to the EXTREME rarity, and the other absurdly expensive materials (we're talking thousands of gold) it takes to make the sword, you want to be very careful with who gets the binding.
---
This is why it almost always goes to the main tank of the guild, usually an officer or the GM. They have more at stake, less likely to leave the guild, and they're usually more committed to playing long term.
---
A pug taking the binding is a terrible idea for a few reasons. Its already extremely unlikely that they get another binding. They would also need a guild to help fund the sword. This means they either 1. Make their own guild. Or 2. Join a guild that is willing to make them main tank and prioritize them for the other binding. 
---
Essentially, with a pug you just never know if that person is going to quit, or even be able to afford the sword if they happen to get the other binding. Its a serious effort and commitment even AFTER you get both of the bindings to drop.
---
All in all, its just a huge benefit to your guild. Anyone joining a pug should assume that bindings are reserved.
---
It works as it did 14 years ago.  If the group lead is locked to an instance ID, as soon as you zone in you will become locked to it too.  If no bosses are killed, you are free to leave before a kill without getting locked.
---
&gt;Myself and others included got completley cucked from raiding with their guilds and is yet to hear something from blizzard regarding this issue
---
Why exactly did you start raiding a pug, and expect to continue raiding with your guild before reset?  Although you can't actually get locked to ony without killing her.... so maybe it's a bug?  Hard to know without all the details.
---
In raids maybe, but 5 man pug groups really don't like the lack of ~~heals~~ rez
---
You should try OPie for mounts and potions etc.
---
If you actually play a lot, and want to play, PM me your email you use for wow and I'll gift you a month of game time when I get home from work (about 1030EST)
---
on mine the devilsaur set is around 300-320g for both, and the Krol Blade is just now settling around 500g - a week ago there were no auctions for it below 750g :) yeah, PvP server.
---
Myriad Pro Bold. I replaced the font because I don't like the default one. But if you think I photoshopped it, you can make an Alliance character and check it yourself. Ask the guards in Darnassus for directions to the enchanting trainer. There's two different possible reactions, this is one of them.
---
This isn't really something that's difficult to fact check lol
---
Undividedly yes!!
---
The issue I would have is getting feared directly away from him and having him reset. Every hunter I know does the curse of recklessness thing for this reason. Doing it without seems like a gigantic pain in the ass.
---
Because people are complaining about pvp on a pvp server. Its like if I joined an RP server and then complained about people rping too much.
---
I agree but if you never patched it then why are you patching it now. If they are going to start making changes now then don't say "No changes".

Shows outgoing/Incoming status effects and receivers name on the right hand side of your character. It's highly customizable; Change Font, Size, Colour, Audio cues etc. It's not like on retail but it's as close as it gets that I've found.
---
Edit: Misspelling
---
My favorite place is First National Bank of Maraudon because of the gold withdrawals my warlock can make at 0% interest.
---
Jesuuuuuus, had to turn it off as soon as I heard the voice.
---
How are u tracking hoj procs?
---
you cant cast it in moonkin form and it only lasts for like 12 seconds.  it is a waste of mana to keep switching back and forth, so you should just have a resto druid keep it up.
---
When I was in the heat of it I was doing IF but not any of the extremes... I started eating at noon and stopped at 8.
---
What it really came down to though was calories. Calories in calories out. Here's most of my process...  
---
* record EVERYTHING. all of it. everything. if you eat it, record it. Use MyFitnessPal. Don't focus on changes at first, build habits. This is all about habit forming. Get used to recording. Start measuring food and servings.
---
* next i cut out extras. no soda, candy, junk, extras. Of course I'd have em from time to time but fat me drank 2 monsters a day and was always eating candy.
---
* next start finding very filling and low calorie options and start working them into your diet. For a while I was using Atkins shakes for like 200 some calories and they kept me full for hours. Now I eat granloa a lot.
---
* next i started breaking up my meals A LOT. During IF i cut breakfast but normally I'll have 200 ish calories for breakfast (you can do that with granola bars or 2-3 large eggs). Keep it under 400-500 for lunch. Another 200-300 calorie snack around 4, then dinner before 8. I'd keep dinner slim on a lot of nights too. The goal of this is to quell hunger by continuously eating throughout the day. It's important you don't drive yourself to hunger, if you are regularly hungry (being hungry is very diff than wanting to eat) then you're cutting way too much and need to bump it up. Nuts are a good choice if you need to ADD calories, but measure them as they add up fast. 
---
* The goal is to get your calories into the right range without being hungry really. At about 250lbs (went 330-180) i started to pick up some actual physical activity. BUT REMEMBER, IT'S WAY EASIER NOT TO EAT EXTRA CALORIES THAN TO BURN THEM. 
---
* the whole process is about building better habits. if you fuck up, just start fresh immediately after the fuck up. Not the next week, or day, immediately. Just work on these habits slowly, and you'll see results quicker than you think. I started in may 2018, stayed stagnant at 215 for about 3 months, but have gone from 330 (pant size 44) to 180 (pant size 32).
---
I’ve been selling devilsaur legs on anathema for 130-150g.
---
I actually used being a raid leader a few years ago as an example of a time I was put in a management/leadership position. I’m starting at the University’s research department soon. Don’t understand things like this that are outside of the typical!
---
Wait so chance to hit doesnt apply for PvP?
---
Fuck me, you had me there.
---
Nice job, OP
---
I have seriously bad luck with drops, so TBH I expect to get several MC epics before I get the preBiS for those slots.  Should have gotten mana igniting cord but for some reason the loot council gave it to a healing priest and refuses to explain why. Even though it's our BiS til C'Thun and they have a better one in DM…
---
These videos are always such BS.... It took you 10 plus minutes to make 6 gold (lockpicking doesn't pause time sir) that's 36g an HR.
---
Yeah, Krol Blade is 150-250g on my server atm. Crazy how pvp do that.
---
Im doing the same! Sick of farming for it. Also, you’re using Assassination Blade and Mirah’s Song I’m guessing? That’s what Im running and wondering if it’s technically better than staying with Thrash and Mirah’s, but nobody seems to have an answer. (Im just waiting to get a Gutgore or Perdition’s to respec)
---
You get the bonus when you're in a full group. No bonus when you're 2-4.
---
The post was talking about a level 21 warlock, trying to level. Not open world pvp at 60.
---
Regular emotes will be read as normal, only custom emotes just have a placeholder text.
---
easier way is just ask your trainer where to level lockpicking they will direct you to places that have locking boxes out in the world that will level your skill
---
Tanaris!
---
I always loved destert zones like the Barrens, Outland and tanaris
---
I remembered STV being a shit show back in the day, so I skipped it completely this time around. At level 25 I swam to booty bay to get the way point. At level 32 I spent all of two minutes in STV...enough time to get ganked and get back to my corpse. 
---
There is a ton of content there but the whole place is set up like a death trap. Between that and gankers I just didn't think it would be worth it. It is a big world.
---
Its judgement and white damage FTW while keeping a couple buffs up on yourself and your weapon. If you really want a challenge get the blacksmith weapon damage consumable so you have another buff timer up to manage
---
The Uplands. It’s east of Lorderon lake with alterac mountains/old city just on the horizon to the south. Lush, quiet and green. The homesteads are beautiful and shaded by vines and trees. 
---
If I could live like this in the real world I’d fight the Syndicate for it for real. 
---
Also I think some elite human noble is shacked up with his mistress in the lake house. Couldn’t kill him faster than he could heal. But I like his house.
---
You're right. I looked into this and it turns out that raid frames differ from party frames.
---
I'm already on it.
---
Added display for the current target today (regardless of being in party or raid). Will upload both upgrades together once ive tested the raid frames.
---
Hey guys, I saw an addon that displays where you can loot and with which percentage chance any item you mouse over. (Kinda useful when inspecting people)
---
Any idea what is its name?
---
Anyone else really hate the concept of these addons? 
---
I get it, profit is good, but capitalizing so directly on the mistakes of your allies... especially when they don’t give it back rubs me the wrong way
---
Well, people keep saying we aren't viable for raiding. That might have something to do with it.
---
It's complete bullshit, of course - the content isn't exactly hard enough that you need a finetuned class composition to beat it.
---
Starting to look like EU has issues with raid IDs being assigned without boss kills.
---
Aside from the fact that I never said there weren’t assholes both sides and this was just a general experience... I said it then and I’ll say it now: if that was me I would be laughing from the grave. Not all of us get even close to that kind of memorable send off.
---
15years?
---
You do get a stealth bar. Put any stealth openings and anything else you might use while stealth on it. I have the prowl hotkey on a secondary bar so i can click out of it if i feel like it.
---
Yes, you should have a stealth bar. That's where Pounce, Ravage, etc. go. (These cat abilities require stealth and to be behind the target).
---
 The level gap will close the closer you get to 60. So maybe you playing a bit more in the short term,  you can be 50 while he’s 55 and both benefit from BRD runs together for example
---
Thank you for invalidating my efforts at a slightly healthier lifestyle.
---
it does, ignore that advice missing key abilities in pvp is not good.
---
Me No speak English
---
Hunters can easily take on mobs 3-5 lvls higher than them without even losing HP. Try doing that as a Warrior.
---
Also, Hunters can solo most elite quests.

---
Farm ogres at deadwind pass. Chance at +150g drop with the strength enchant, shit loads of runecloth and good silver per kill. I saw a rogue farm there from 58-60.
---
It should be under your scrolling combat text.
---
&gt;The starting point of a MC speedrun is agreed upon: When Lucifron is pulled the run has started, Everyone who's competing agreed on the same rule set. They clear the same amount of mobs on their way to Lucifron. This has no impact on competition, it just goes against your personal expectations of what the run should be.
---
"The starting point of a 100m dash is agreed upon:  It is started at the 10m point, Everyone who's competing agreed on the same rule set. They clear the same amount of distance on their way to starting line. This has no impact on competition, it just goes against your personal expectations of what the run should be."

I used to daydrink a pack of beer on Saturdays, but that was causing me to get up and pee too much for WoW so I switched to doing shots of rum and just that has caused me to lose some weight lmao.
---
Thanks for your input OP. I’ve been on the fence about this topic as a casual on Gehennas.
---
Dude frostadamus is literally streaming right now with 16k gold in the bag. It’s not impossible if you play a lot.
---
Lakeshire of Red Ridge Mountain. I would not mind living there in real life and fish all day. Also it was the first time seeing anything dragon so thats pretty dope.
---
Good one
---
Making gold is tight. Tight, tight, tight.
---
Uh, yea. This works way better than strafing using e or q. Both my q and e are key bound to my spells making it much more convenient to utilize all my spells as a warlock. I switch between using both mouse buttons and w to run and that’s how true pros do it.

SERVERS ARE PERFORMING LIKE DOG SHIT. Please use videos like these to bring attention to it, people in the comments are 100% right about AQ opening event and such, it will be really really horrible by the way things are looking right now. This is unacceptable, private servers ran 10 times better.
---
Awesome video!! :)
---
Its an Whoa Unit Frames :-)  U can download his complete UI :-)
---
Nope,  this seems to be a you problem.
---
I’ve had wow token subs for months now but yesterday I did a one month then cancelled it so it didn’t resub me
---
as an ele shaman i can't wait for our raid to get a thunderfury for the debuff. stoked.
---
I wish it was that simple.
---
Supposedly per AtlasLoot, 4.76%.
---
This means at 47 runs, you’re expected to see the trinket AT LEAST once. With a 90% probability.
---
At 94 runs, you see the probability increase to 99%. Essentially, if the drop rate is correct, I’m in the bottom 1%.
---
The chest also has FR, a nice extra.
---
I believe for those you always have to click it twice. Once to switch to the correct stance and again to do the action that requires that stance.
---
Rogues get capped with 1 item.
---
220-250 legs on Herod H
---
Did you kill the higher level ones like 57-59 mobs or is the drop rate the same for the 55-57 mobs closer to Everlook?
---
I had 30 minutes yesterday and then I guess Flamelash isn’t even among the 5 biggest servers, as OP is asking. I guess choosing a server that still has layering is better in that case.
---
Playing disc priest, lvl51 atm. Im gonna try this, fo sure! Thanks for sharing.
---
Well apparently you can solo it as rogue , need some setup though , saw it in a video
---
https://github.com/Ko0z/zUI
---
Nice! What's your scrolling text add-on? The one that shows buffs your target has gained, etc.
---
Even if you ended up with 30 level 7s that would only be a problem if you weren’t having fun playing them. It’s a game, just do whatever is fun for you.
---
As a resto druid, I passed on 15 tier 1 pieces in the span of 4 weeks. Luckily it always went to another druid instead of disenchanting (pugs). Besides bracers I would have had a full set now myself if I opted for it, not seen bracers yet.
---
“Considerably less damage”
---
You’re off your rocker if you think a group doing damage notably higher than a non-mage group would have you actually tanking anything. 
---
The only time I’ve seen mage groups outperform any other group is when the Tank is playing the kite a pack role.
---
Not sure about health, but the major mana pots were nutty on my server (Fairbanks) early on. Was about 3g in mats, sold for as high as 8g each. There were a few people running that market for the first while.
---
Wait... can you even BE a Tauren Rogue?
---
Duskwood! Love the quests and the themeing.
---
Uhhh...
---
No.
---
I still remember the first time I arrived at  Orgrimmar.
---
He didn't get the bindings
---
I know right? An out-of-focus, off-centered picture at an angle with scanlines from a screen  that takes more effort to upload is just as good as hitting a button on your keyboard to produce exponentially better results.  Who needs a clear image? Not I!  
---
I bet you record video in vertical.
---
Good thought's atleast, but that's the lazy way of fixing such an exploit and would create more problems than what the exploit is it self I believe
---
I noticed in a screenshot someone's chat had a class and race icon next to people's names; anyone know the name of this?
---
UD racial can’t break freezing trap, unless freezing trap is a fear/charm/sleep effect, which I don’t believe it is
---
I just saw another thread about a guild desperately looking for druids. So clearly we're wanted :D
---
One thing to consider is that if you roll a mage, you'll have to deal with the bad rep mages have at the moment. So life might be easier as a priest while leveling.
---
Oh shit he gave them!
---
Im a paladin
---
DBM, right click the mini map icon
---
Same and same. I did the math, powerlevelled my alchemy on my abbandoned alt for like 54g, and now make a lot of money reselling pots and transmutes (thank god I did it when I did...)
---
I get away with that by being a Hunter. Pull extra group and FD. Smoke while they run back.
---
The guy forgot to cancel, rip
---
That doesn't make any sense at all lol
---
This.  I use it.
---
Nice haha Druids get geared so quickly! How many of those maces have you guys seen? It’s about 4 for us now.
---
Yeah few good articles about it, works for some, really helped us with a wakey up baby
---
One of the changes I wouldn't mind would be a model update to some of the fancier items- when they updated MC loot I was surprised Onyxia's weapons stayed the same.
---
Wowhead Classic is hard to use.
---
Well yeah 4 &gt; 1 obv
---
pyro (i sap one of the adds, blind the other, burn the boss down while interrupting his casts and then i vanish after i loot)
---
and the guy at the guzzler the lil gnome who drops bar shanker
---
its the run in this guide but im combat spec for raids and i also loot the ale and the food on the table by the gnome guy at the end after hes dead (extra vendor gold + saves u a few silver cause u don't have to buy the ales to throw it on the table)
---
&gt;Edited the post with the information on probability and drop rate.d
---
Hinterlands. The zone is beautiful and the quests are awesome.
---
Is the chance of a flip really 50%?
---
This is not accurate. A more accurate depiction would be an alliance human minding her own business drinking when suddenly a Tauren attempts to gank her
---
Wrong.
---
I'm currently working on an add-on ("Classic Heals"), which solves this at least for the unit frames. As for scrolling combat text in the 3D world, it seems it might be impossible, since blizzard removed most of the related API some time ago.

Weird, I play on Herod. When I was in Tanaris recently, had an alliance priest doing a quest with me since nobody wanted to group up. I'm a warrior and for the most part, people tend to leave me alone.

It's not really FR gear, it's the greater fire protection potions.

Lol these comments.  Yeah if you named your character after a series you like it's pretty odd if you aren't even really a fan.

Found one the first run few minutes after release and sold it for 40g
---
Did you even read the post? You’re AOE farming Mara? Lmao
---
With the lasher nerf, lock AOE farming is garbage.
---
Yeah but F that. I transferred off a larger server and have had 0 regrets about it, been about a month now.
---
Enjoy the smaller community, more laid back people too.
---
Sure there are nice things to both sides but smaller communities definitely fit my style more.
---
Only going for yellow hit cap is also kinda dumb
---
Crazy to me that someone could actually not be able to beat that one. I would almost suspect they had their character leveled for them or bought it.
---
I can confirm, Smolderweb has good STV action.  Ness camp is constantly swarmed by one side or the other and STV chat is a constant stream of QQ over ganking and PVP.
---
Goldshire, always was peaceful :)
---
Was it always like this? I haven't made a ticket in years but I don't recall this always being the case. Hell I remember when it first came out that a GM was going to give me a 2 hour ban for saying a no no word to someone (this was before they were flogged with everyone making tickets for the dumbest crap you see on here).
---
welp, that sucks
---
You think that's bad??? Looks like a good day in brd in flamelash lol
---
You get diminished xp if someone else kills it or does most of the damage. As such killing elites in a group being carry by a higher level kind of sidesteps that. You get higher xp from being in a dungeon and the speed of being carried helps as well.
---
Any of several frames mods.
---
Yellow hit capped. White damage still benefits immensely from hit. Only getting to the yellow cap is a bad idea
---
I rolled with RL friends.
---
Our guild was server first Ragnaros. 
---
What a toxic group of people validating themselves through playing a video game.
---
My guild still cant figure out placing people properly for rag, so 6 ranged are getting blasted each time.  Even with 2 GFPP in a fight the best we've done is like 5-6% hp on rag.
---
If they would just take some advice, it would go a lot better.  Everyone is dying cause healers cant keep up.
---
The details is what did it for me. "5 hours long", "requires shadowforge key to open".
---
* At level 1, run to the troll/orc starting area and do quests there
---
* As you level, focus on questing in troll/orc areas and doing quests from trolls
---
* At 60, turn in a whole heck of a lot of runecloth
---
* Be ready to bounce up and down like crazy. (I hate raptors because of the bouncing nonsense)
---
Jesus dude what is wrong with you
---
wrong sub buddy
---
Dm trinket or counterattack loadstone which is just AP
---
The likeness is uncanny!
---
probably as low as level 35. As a level 60 mage i hit dungeon lockout after 40min and I cleared every mob in the instance.
---
Generally your guild is going to want you to donate your core leather to the guild bank.  It's used to make some decent gear.
---
Not too well versed, what does this mean?
---
If you take full advantage of stv you'll return back there 3-5 times between 30-45.. Huge zone
---
I've always wondered *why* these scams can't even bother to spell check.  They would have so much more success if they weren't so obvious.
---
You could get a couple of friends and do some DME jumps runs. Make sure that at least one of you has mining and herbing so nothing goes to waste each reset.
---
Last I heard my PvP server (Blameaux) was one of the last alliance bastions, where they slightly outnumber the horde.
---
It might not be a terrible thing to put under hobbies in your resume.
---
As a healer that's probably done close to 50 angers, I've never seen HoJ drop. I feel Anger is just trying to flood the market with his brand of axes.
---
Almost happened to me, too, but I was able to salvage it. Funny enough, my first attempt made me think the change wasnt there, yet. Trapped her and was going to kite the pet, then she never caught back up to me. Went back and she had despawned. So the second time I was surprised to see the pet show back up.
---
Looking back, someone clearly aggrod her while I was kiting the pet, but I didnt notice it.
---
Yeah, I wish I did it a few weeks back, but oh well.  I'll still make the money back eventually.
---
Doesnt the bartender (from whom u buy the beer) drop nice loot? How to kill him and still get out of the door?
---
I read over the aoe part, I guess.  You don't run lashers, you solo jump runs.  You can solo a few bosses, including the last one, and mine the rich thorium nodes.
---
Amazing :)
---
They don’t even innervate themselves because they’re trash healers. Why do people play them?! Why! Why!! Why!!!!!!!!
---
I wish I'd known that first now, i could have just made it into a marijuana leaf for true stoner attire
---
Might wanna recommend making a new WoW account? You can play on the same server then and transfer gold to yourself via the NAH
---
he has to have admin or manage server permissions in the server.
---
Farm Shadowfang Keep for the Robes of Arugal and Belt of Arugal.
---
Also, make sure you head to the barrens and focus on the quests for the Crescent Staff I’m Wailing Caverns
---
Those are a good start.
---
I just did a MC run
---
i was the only druid
---
Dropped only the gloves, dropped like the valor set 3-4 times
---
;\_;
---
lol wow that's a lot i think i might drop skinning now i just sold a bunch for 9g per so it's definitely diving
---
Go to the auction house, type in 'of shadow wrath'
---
Go with the market flow. Get yourself some addons that record the value of everything. After a week of scanning the AH, you'll have everything you need to sell your stufd. Dont sell anything undervalue, just wait until the market go up.
---
Hi, /u/liahkim3

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dmnlav/how_do_i_hide_the_questie_log_from_the_main_screen/). 
---
You aren’t going to start getting into that until you pass 30 probably.  
---
Just focus on leveling and if you are a tailor make sure you are grinding out tailoring.  There are some good +damage and +shadow damage that you can tailor in the 40s
---
Ps.  There isn’t a lot of point in min/maxing while leveling until you get closer to hitting 60 since you can replace most things every couple of levels.
---
The biggest problem I noticed was people blowing too much mana. Hard not to get impatient and start tossing in raptor strikes and multishots.
---
When I did it way back in vanilla, I didnt have the highest rank of scorpid sting, so he was always enraged. Was an infuriating few tries before I figured it out
---
Generally they're in focus and centered but people like you just get their panties in a bunch because *phone photo bad*.
---
Again, if all the information being conveyed is present, why does it bother you?
---
How? The hunter joins your group, you do everything solo, and they loot the head?
---
I have not, it's usually always consistent with the spots, I might make an informative picture explaining all of it (all the guides online are outdated and use private server data)
---
Take Improved Sprint and evasion cooldown  Spec the rest like the standard cookie cutter leveling build.
---
Tipsout has a video, search rogue deep dive.
---
shoo
---
Yeah don't get me wrong I run melee groups quite a bit, gotta do what ya gotta do, but of the time it's just not worth it
---
You won't find shadow damage or spellpower till like 38-42. Barring spellpower, locks are surprisingly gear independent.  Just stack any stam and int you can find for now. Worry about shadow damage when you have the mana to spam shadowbolt. 
---
Earliest spelldamge I can think of is your warlock quest item at like 30-something, hypnotic dagger from sm lib, and shadowweave set from tailoring. If you're not a tailor see if you can find one to make it with the mats, as markup is/was pretty high when I was that level.
---
Offer bodyguard services. Nobody is going to fuck with an SL lock AND a rogue.
---
Get a shadow wrath green, goes up to 21, but can be expensive.
---
One can only hope for classic plus.
---
I think it can be a fun spec in phase 3+ in PvP. Something like 29/11/11 or 30/0/21
---
That is literally exactly his point, that it is way too far not to have fast travel compared to the horde locations...
---
I rolled a female pally, still wearing dresses tho
---
When you send an item by mail you can check a box to either send them x gold or demand x gold "Cash On Delivery" so they will have to pay you if they want the contents.
---
The paladin clicked the wrong box and sent money instead of requesting it but the guy on the other end was kind enough to return the gold... Only in the Reddit comments did they realize they were still out the money for the mageweave
---
130 total runs or gorosh boss kills ?
---
Isn't agility 1:1 ap for warriors
---
UHH UHH
---
Jesus I'm not talking about mage groups, just normal groups vs no caster groups. If you really can't hold aggro with one mage idk what to tell ya.
---
This is just normal combat leveling spec.
---
Here's a great resource for rogues if you don't already know about it. https://shadowpanther.net/leveling.htm
---
That schnozz
---
&gt; Taking a photo of your screen with you phone should never happen. Period. 
---
/u/FriendlyTRex 2020.
---
Pally tanks are amazing at holding threat on multiple mobs though. If you wait for the second golden fart you'll almost never pull aggro no matter how much AOE damage you do.
---
The reason why is he’s probably good friends with the loot council
---
Rogue shows up, :)
---
I have brought up in interviews that I do stand up comedy and talk about the skills it has taught me and the lessons i've learned from that. That's done in bars with shows run by alcoholics. 
---
If you're only using professional corporate experience to describe your skills and abilities you're not using everything you could. Hobbies of all kinds give skills that can be used in the work place and it's how you describe them and adapt them and answer questions about them in a job interview that matters more than what the actual hobby is. 
---
If this raid leader has spread sheets keeping track of things, has a website his guild uses, ect... there are plenty of things he could  bring up and relate to skills he used and lessons he learned from the experience. 
---
Will just saying "I led a raid" get him a job, no. How he talks about it and what he gleaned from it and all that could very well impress a job interviewer if they understand the context he's talking in.
---
Haha nice, I saw that post the other day and laughed. You’re the man!
---
Checkmate atheists.
---
I would imagine the clop clop of their hooves breaks stealth
---
But no rez means I can’t be lazy and just go afk while everyone else runs /s
---
Lawl you try that and see how few bother to listen
---
Have you considered a remote login like teamviewer to jump in queue early?
---
It never did but I are getting it don’t worry
---
&gt; Does this irk anyone else?
---
I don't think there is anything I could possibly care about less than what someone names their character, much less how much they appear to know about that name.
---
Perhaps if it bothers you so much why not stop whispering people about their names?
---
130 runs, approx. 15 or so Gorosh kills, he has seen the chest 1 time.
---
Gnomish on all but 1. I hate asking others to craft goblin sappers as they require something like 45 seconds to make 1 so I just afk craft a bunch from time to time.
---
I use this build and it is fun for pvp and leveling. Get your self some nice high damage daggers and ambush crits almost kills the mobs instantly. But this is only good for single targets "improved sap talents helps" but also good for pvp
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bss8ef/dagger_rogue_guide_leveling_talents_and_dagger/
---
Most likely a bug then since I sincerly doubt that anyone had gotten to the point of Lucifron by that time nor did we touch any boss of that matter when we was in there. Aswell as the raid leader confirmed twice to me that I wouldn't get locked upon entering.
---
But it's just sad to miss the raid with the guild for something silly as this, and it's pretty difficult to get some actual feed back from GM's who seem to be dodging the issue for 24hrs now and it's not just my case that went like this there was plenty more people having similar issues being left hanging from this issue :(
---
Funny story I’m actually going for Cadaverous chest right now since I feel like the grind for Savage Glad chest would be a pain.
---
Showmyheal is the addon for you, my friend
---
It's all good, then that wouldn't be canon
---
Are you referring to the tracked quests? If so just open your quest log and shift click on all the ticked quests, that will untrack them so they shouldn't appear on your main screen. 
---
Hope that works for ya
---
I'm not being obtuse nor is there an issue with my reading comprehension.  
---
I understand exactly what they are doing.  I just think it's stupid to call it an "MC speedrun."  It's not, it's a luci to rag speed run.  An MC speedrun wouldn't be skipping content that you cannot skip.
---
Feel free to withdraw.
---
It's your fault for healing us. 
---
Every time I tap down to use Cannibalize, bandage or eat here comes Johnny Holy with the fuckin GHeal.
---
If we aren't in combat and below 50% health don't heal us. Better yet just keep a Renew or Rejuv on us, or throw us a downranked cheap heal now and then if.you absolutely must. We need to be below 100% health at all times or we completely lose the benefit of Demon Armor.
---
The queue just jumped up recently, but its not going to stay around very long most likely.  The past few weeks had no queue, or maybe minor queue after 7pm.
---
What's your raid frame add on?
---
If I remember correctly, Agi doesn't give AP at all to warriors. This could be wrong, as I'm going off of memory only.
---
3g repair bill
---
So glad you pointed that out!
---
Kazzak can be killed super quick but still very easy to grief. If anything I think strats like that for azuregoes will be more realistic.
---
I've seen people mention guild banks a few times for classic WoW, how is this being done? Does the GM have a bank alt that everyone trusts? Is an addon involved? What is usually going on when people refer to a guild bank?
---
Alliance is having WAAAAY more fun stealing your leather BAHAHA [https://youtu.be/4VpUf9e8uuc](https://youtu.be/4VpUf9e8uuc)
---
&gt;Have a game designed to be insanely difficult
---
Wildstar would like to hire you
---
Are people actually making twinks yet? I tried selling a Redbeard Crest on my server but after a week I gave up and sent it to a low level warrior friend.
---
Gold Member
---
If you have skinning it might be Devilsaur farming. Depends on thr server though.
---
Only Strength gives AP for warriors as far as I'm aware.
---
You missed some real content ;)
---
Yup. But typically when I talk about guides I have one in mind when someone asks.
---
See. my problem is i would hate to be puire healing, i want to do wpvp, and be able to hold my own 1v1. Is that possible with a non-feral build like MG? If so im definitely interested, but the feral pvp gamepl;ay is so fun with powershifting.
---
Or better, bring a shadow priest. Shadow priest constantly top the charts in 5 man dungeons and provides a lot of utility.
---
My favorite group for 5 man dungeons is actually: Prot pally, restro/fer druid, shadow priest, warlock + other
---
Prot pally has the best aoe tank ability to let shadow priest and lock dot everything. Restro/feral druid can shift and taunt for bosses that clears aggro. Shadow priests and warlocks buffs each other. Shadow priests can also emergency heal in a pinch. The group has decent cc on humanoids, undead, demons and elementals.
---
The last spot can really be anything.
---
Just buy the Argent Dawn water or ask mage for water in Ironforge and everything is all set.
---
Yeah I'm horde side as well so I can only imagine ally side its even worse.
---

---
My last name is super common so I could care...  LOL
---
I kill greens once, and then leave them be. 
---
Yellow get killed as soon as they come back.
---
Cannibalize. Also regular food.
---
If anything, check the EULA, there is no TOS in classic.
---
I’ve been looking for a healbot like addon.  Anyone have a recommendation?
---
And then look for Necromancer... should be a pair of 29 or 39 twink pants in there that I wore for the longest time. 
---
That said... That is just the gear you are looking for... unless you are twinking out a toon then just follow priorities with gear you find
---
Spell power/Shadow spell+ &gt; Int &gt; Stam &gt; Wis &gt;= Armor
---
Thank you! One of the most selfless dudes to play with, will run anything for anyone if it means getting them a piece they want. Everything from RFC to multiple attunement runs, guy deserves it.
---
Thunderfury proc slows attack speed by 20%, rather than 10%, decreases nature resistance, does a lot of damage and you don't have to go to battle stance and waste 20 rage to apply it. Unlike thunderclap its actually useful.
---
Baldy the rare spawn.
---
The exact same thing happened to me with a character named StoneCold when I replied to his whisper with "what?". He didn't even know that that was the bottom line because Stone Cold said so.
---
Just go to file location there gonna ba a wow launcher somewhere in there. You do have to log in everytime though.
---
Ironforge, so glad to see that place full again.
---
This is good to know! I may make a troll priest and save my UD til i make a rogue/lock i guess? im not toooo crazy about mages i just know them + hunter are super self sufficient  which is a very nice perk.
---
[Same!](https://i.imgur.com/1x2baMW.png) But I farmed a lot of it :) Also sold all BoEs on another char, so that's why that grey shows up as most profit
---
You do realize if this was true there would have never been a necessity for cross-server play in retail? 
---
Nobody is saying you will NEVER do group content on a smaller server, but to act like it won't be drastically more inconvenient is false. We are like 2 months into classic and it's already taking you 30m to find a group as a healer. That's not good.
---
The only thing bad about larger servers is the queue time, but using Google Remote Desktop let's anyone skip the queue with the smallest bit of planning. On Faerlina we are doing like 40v40 PvP every night, good luck finding that after a server transfer.
---
So, basically, the player character just grunts things like "Enchanting!" at random guards.
---
Okay I'm going to call you out on your stupidity now.
---
Spec, 0/31/19 (5/5 defiance). Of course you're in defensive stance no matter the spec when tanking. 
---
You have no idea whats what and can't even seem to read so I'm going to stop wasting my time on this shit now.
---
Mc is turning the druids away
---
I literally cant even imagine.
---
What do you do? How do you do it?
---
Do you even farm any of your own mats and stuff or are you strictly playing with capital in the AH?
---
6,000 good after 2 months seems outrageous.
---
Mooo-jestic even
---
Just a level 1 bank alt for people to send things to. For larger guilds you might even have multiple such characters. Guild bank alts typically belong to the GM or a guild officer.
---
You life tap to 50% health and mana then you eat and drink, its more efficient.
---
Racials means racial skills :D
---
Wait... how am I supposed to get an edge on the healing meters if I res you with more health. You’re being inconsiderate. Low rank res with high rank heal afterward.
---
Thanks but ive tried doing this before and nothing happens still the same arial font, even made sure the files were .ttf this time but nope
---
Same, which is why I think classic+ would be better; would hopefully put a stop to all this mage meta bullshit. 
---
Too many classes are just totally redundant right now, and that’s not fun.
---
Sounds like you're going for an end-game healing build that you will add points to as you level.  Respecs are cheap the first couple times- you will benefit more from being that much stronger damage-wise.  /u/mr_zipzoom said it best IMO,the talents don't *SCALE* as well pre-60 and pre-endgame gear so you don't get as much benefit compared to just speccing for some more all-around abilities and damage potential. 
---
You could even go for a spec kind of like this at level 47 to still have plenty of heal output but a bit more damage potential via wands and by ignoring improved renew (a waste IMO) to get a bit more smite/holy fire potential which is still relatively mana-efficient damage.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/1502301305001-20505003002
---
Righto
---
I hear about this issue a lot from Reddit but so far I have never experienced it myself. I'm on Grobbulus, which might be why. People on this server seem generally nicer and more friendly overall.
---
well it gives crit wich you can convert into ap for better comparison plenty of in depth guides do that ( kind of fucked up to get the correct equation im to dumb myself if im beeing honest )
---
I'll let you know how it goes. And you meant Auctionator not Auctioneer in your last sentence right?
---
I had to download Auctionator from wowinterface as it isn't officially supported but someone made a fix for Classic.
---
I also downloaded the TSM desktop client so I'll have that running. Should work out pretty well. All I really need is good data on item AH/DE/Vendor pricing, so this seems like the best setup.
---
Western plaguelands
---
I'm like this. Bloodmail scholo boots and those have hit but I prefer 1% hit and crit on boots than the bit of str n stam
---
Popping out of bear form and innervating the healer is a delightful move, I love doing stuff like that. Nothing better than a run where you get to use the full toolkit. I'm only level 46, so no UBRS for me for a while, but I did that exact thing at stromgarde keep the other day, and it was so satisfying to have the group go from "fuck we're gonna wipe" to "oh wait, we're perfectly fine".
---
/r/evendumberthanithoughtredditors
---
Mayyyyybe you would be fine with the one armor trinket and something like the mark of the chosen instead of the second armor trinket, and can go without enchanting?
---
(also: I hate to tell you but I think it's 265 enchanting, not 150)
---
Fuck you for this.  I came for this exact type of comment.
---
Obviously, but getting 1% extra hit doesn't allow you to "put on better gear". You're kinda dumb.
---
Lots of comments. Say I don’t care about being top of the charts in dungeons/whatever else, nor am I particularly worried about grinding to be the best of the best Boomkin Classic has ever seen? 
---
I’m feeling a little listless because there’s a TON of druids in my guild, all Resto with a couple of feral, and I’m a bit behind them (most people in my guild are 60 or mid 50s and I’m 48) so I feel like I won’t be able to raid anyway, or certainly not first pick because there’s a ton of druids as is... still a terrible idea to go Boomkin?
---
I just don’t care for feral (cat form is nice for my solo quest mob grinding, but I almost never use bear form,) I prefer my “balance” spells and have a lot more fun using them than I do anything else. I leveled a warlock to 20, thought they were boring, have no interest in playing a mage.
---
Still a bad idea? I want to do it but all of the strong no’s tells me I should just keep playing a spec that I find miserable and boring to play.
---
Get a warlock buddy for silithus and duel him so he can put the immune to fear debuff on you for the fight. The rest is cake!
---
Who even are you
---
The way it's "fixed" is players start rolling alliance on PVP servers so they don't have to wait in 30+ minute queues.
---
Hinterlands.
---
So hecking irked rn just thinking about it grrrrrrr
---
Spirit, spirit, spirit. You don't need shadow damage, you need spirit to eliminate downtime.
---
Shadow damage is not bad to have, but it is much better to have faster mana regeneration because that means faster questing.
---
Stamina is also good.
---
I buy a few things and post my prices. I havnt had anyone try to rip me off but I have had a lot of people who can't do basic math.
---
I'm nice enough to send them back the extra gold though
---
You only need 6% if you maintain that 305 skill but I agree they're a fine alternative. Blood mail is just more desirable since a lot of war pre bis lacks stam (lionheart, true strike, etc)
---
Did you kill geddon?
---
Me and a friend got locked to an MC ID by just entering it. Neither had a ID beforehand (we made sure). We were just farming Elemental Fire in BRD and used MC entrance to return faster to the BRD in order to reset.
---
It's not just a display error, he tried joining a PUG Raid tonight and couldn't enter, because of his different ID.
---
There is also a thread on the US Forum were people claim that they cleared MC and nobody got an ID and that a whole raid group received up to 5 different IDs upon entering MC, essential splitting the raid and them unable to continue.
---
Shits fucked yo. I do hope they fix it till Weekend and not just wait till wed. for the next reset
---
It’s the game and I love it. Half the fun of classic is the struggle and the struggle is real.
---
This, lol. "wtf..." came to mind immediately.
---
Cry more was my guild on Terenas in vanilla. Props dude n GL!
---
I could use that same logic to say that BiS lists are useless because they aren't even close to required to complete the content.
---
9%hit&gt;Crit&gt;agility
---
Nope, gonna stay right here on Incendius. From what I hear from other servers it honestly seems like the best one right now.
---
I should say I dont mind healing, I'm constantly in the top 10% parsing and what not so I'm pretty good too (not that that matters to me really but it's cool seeing it lol) 
---
It's cool being the underdog, not a whole lot to speak of either. The utility is great, people love you or hate you. I'm coming from playing a priest and paladin from Vanilla and BC to every healer except monk up the current.....so I'm just not used to the ire. 
---
I should check that out though, have a great preT1 tank set too in case....might be fun. Going to see what I can do as a chicken first though lol
---
Druid was also the least popular class in Vanilla WoW and it's not without reason, they just don't perform that well. Druids are the least desired healers, good OTs, bad melee DPS and bad caster DPS.
---
Our guild has just 3 druids on the raiding roster and we bring just 1 or 2 to every raid.
---
I play alliance on Kirtonos. Lvl 54. It’s not bad. And the horde suck at pvp so it’s open season if you wanna fuck around.
---
Hey guys, very big noob here. Never played Classic because my parents were super religious and didn't like magic (lol) so now I'm playing like I'm making up for lost time. 
---
One question i have is how do i see the level/race/etc. of a person who whispers me or is looking for a dungeon group? Other people seem to always know I'm a Tauren Druid, but i can never find out what they are until they are close enough to inspect.
---
Agreed. Holy/Disc is much more beneficial to a group than Shadow/Disc. If he were soloing, I'd recommend shadow, but healing as shadow requires an instance group to know what they're doing. A group with a bad tank or low dps wouldn't favor a shadow priest, even with endless mana. 
---
&lt;sigh&gt; nothing will compare to being Disc during WotLK
---
Good for you!
---
[possibly inaccurate, but still a good sign for Horde players](https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community)
---
Unfortunately Myst has not even learned the first lesson of not being seen and has also chosen a very obvious piece of cover.
---
Wow is that even possible?! You mean even til this day in BFA?
---
Horde is the overpopulated PVP easy mode side: Of course they've got huge populations and they are far more concentrated in Org than Alliance are in I.F  vs S.W.
---
Alliance are the underdogs who have to fight tooth and nail to earn their victories against the zerg-army of mindless brutes who win by sheer numbers alone.
---
Scrubs go Horde, that's why it's so overpopulated. Welcome to casualville.
---
Never had it off.
---
Both. Just search bindings on grob discord
---
You're going to get Ironfoe before you get HoJ.
---
You don’t have to be hated by the Cartel, but you could kill lots of venture co in STV to keep rep while also killing goblin guard in booty bay
---
Fuck streamers. This game does not revolve around them the majority of the population is happy with the slow releases.
---
If you are talking about the shit on the screen it's the dbm settings I think.
---
The guild I just left had an officer than was a shaman and it was obvious he was trying to remove all shaman competition by inviting Druids instead. We legit had 5 Resto Druids and a feral Druid in 1 raid. 
---
New guild is great :P
---
Recount does it
---
A 23 lock doesn't really need gear. Honestly warlock may be the least gear dependent class to level. Just go for stam and intellect. Green items are fine. If you must have blues don't buy them run instances.
---
I haven't had this problem at all with mages. Sounds pretty circle jerky to me
---
at least youve apologized, now make sure it doesnt happen again
---
The cave filled with the color crystals in Un'goro Crater.
---
Go prep build, have 2x vanish, unless you're giga unlucky you shouldn't have an issue. You can easily kill a few bosses and reset. I've been getting a solid 40-45g/h, bit you really never reach 50-60 as some people claim. It's almost always in the low 40s
---
Mainhand,and this was just grind for rep so solo.
---
Oh good I’m glad you came out with this.
---
Thanks for making a “moderately inconvenient” situation absolutely abysmal. 
---
It used to be fairly balanced. Then when y’all jumped ship because it was 60-40 in the hordes favor, people like you left behind a graveyard of a server. Now it’s 80-20 and we can’t go anywhere. 
---
So, thanks.
---
&gt; 12 H
---
&gt; 12 H, Jerry!
---
Depends on play style. You can just drain life/life tap. I do both to switch things up. Sometimes I dot and wand then let my mana and health regen. Sometimes I just life tap and drian life back.
---
What do they even mean whats the 11 dollars for??
---
I'm trying to level lockpicking on my rogue but I'm stuck, currently at 103. I'm using this guide:  [https://vanillaguides.com/2018/07/30/1-300-lockpicking-guide-for-vanilla-world-of-warcraft-wow-classic/](https://vanillaguides.com/2018/07/30/1-300-lockpicking-guide-for-vanilla-world-of-warcraft-wow-classic/) . The problem is that the lock boxes in the stonetalon mine are too high for me open still, so I don't know where to farm. The guide listed them at being level 70 but they are still red to me.
---
Druids are pretty good rank for 5mans. I always enjoyed changing it up from raids and going bear. The problem is the healer crying when you roll on their gear lol.
---
I stopped bothering trying to get stuff by bidding. At least on my server so many run sniper or whatever that as soon as i post a bid its instantly overwrote.
---
I know sniper isn't against the tos but it really takes some of the fun out of the game.
---
Another reason why I love this community.
---
thats a nice 8 second root you have there, would be amazing if you had the ability to remove it.
---
Yeah the ‘everything will be fine if we just execute perfectly’ mentality gets a lot of groups killed.
---
Press M to open your map. If Questie is enabled you can uncheck the box at the top of the map (I believe it's at the top..) and it'll remove all the icons until you recheck the box.
---
I think the majority of mage complaints come from people being salty mages are generally in more demand than their class
---
Deadass I ran BRD for the first time yesterday on my Ret pally and HoJ dropped. I got it. I was so excited I was shaking for an hour!
---
Believe it or not, this was on a regular old PVP server! We've had several funny interactions with strangers while fishing.
---
So I've been doing this for the past 3 days on Firemaw eu, more realistic expectation is about 25-35g per hour. Not bad for basically doing nothing and having uncontested source of gold, but nothing too great. Also pickpocketing and lockboxes don't contain greens/blues/epics, so your gph is pretty stable regardless of luck, which can be good or bad.
---
Thats almost 10kg, in two months, thats a ton! (Well, not a ton, but still)
---
Kirtonos
---
You are an idiot. Private servers handled this fine. Also it's the opposite, Alliance are favorable. I'm assuming you getting ganked by the alliance so much prompted this post.
---
I love this story. I'm going to start doing this. I was in the gym every week, 5 days a week, running and what not. Had to stop about 5 months ago due to incredibly debilitating back pain. Found out I've got degradation in my spine and hips. Went to the gym today at work. Did incline walk with some weight lifting for 30 mins. Wasn't long but I felt good. With my meds I don't really have pain anymore.
---
two options.
---
1. Shift + Click on their name as you see it in chat.
---
2. /who JohnnyStan69 to get a result "1 Result - Level 58 Troll Druid - Molten Core"
---
What Ironforge thing?
---
Someone bought Gold with RL money it seems....
---
If you don't set loot rules before a raid that you are half pugging you fully deserve a pug player to roll on it
---
&gt;I just disagree with people making raid leading out to be this great feat that qualifies anyone to actually manage a serious business operation that is endlessly more complex, stressful and challenging than a mere WoW raid.
---
I think this is a strawman argument that no one actually made in this thread. Perhaps you can point me to the comment of whoever made it?
---
&gt;All it takes is basic coordination and communication skills for something as relatively simple and straightforward as planning and executing what's essentially a video game boss fight. 
---
It's far beyond basic communication skills. You're not really addressing the other skills needed to sustain a successful guild. Things like taking initiative to recruit guild members, managing egos, managing loot drama, deciding how to share resources and getting everyone on board, protecting members from being poached by other guilds, training underperforming members, etc.
---
You are also exaggerating how difficult most businesses are to run. Run down the list of the most common type of businesses and the top 50 of them will almost certainly have a smaller learning curve than WoW. I can take a successful raid leader and teach him to run a hotel better and more quickly than I can take a successful hotel manager and teach him how to raid lead in WoW. We take for granted how much accumulated experience and knowledge we have in WoW that makes it seem easy.
---
&gt; it's plain ridiculous to compare it to qualifications for an actual job managing and being responsible for a business and 200 people's livelihoods.
---
No it isn't. The skill translates. It's true there will be a "learning" curve to learn the business, but the leadership skills translates for sure. Managing a restaurant, hotel, or what ever the most common employer happens to be is not "easy" but it just isn't that complex.
---
When I was using ShadowedUI, I turned on Raid pets and always show raid (Blizzard frames). Made an extra area that showed group, but pets were at the bottom.
---
It doesnt seem that bad honestly, the alliance side have some very good guilds.
---
It's at the top....
---
I would assume it’s a large portion know what to do.   Back in retail vanilla I would give this some credit due to actual figuring accouters out.   Classic is a 15 years old game.   Countless videos a click away,  learned in one click.   Keep in mind so streamlined a guild cleared into and MC in a week.  Ignoring the facts never change the facts.    I am not impressed, which is my opinion.
---
Or you could get a druid friend and do DM tribute runs. It's more gold and it's very straight forward.
---
You know healers get yelled at for not healing life tapping locks because it “slows down the dps and instance clear time” right? And I can’t remember a single lock who ate or bandage in classic or p servers.
---
Yeah, call me when rogues can selfheal, offheal in a pinch, offtank, BR, innervate, not to even start on how fun druids are in PvP comparatively.
---
mage meta only exists in pugs, its not that classes are "redundant" its just that people are hyperfocused on min/maxing trivial content
---
find a guild that doesnt care about minmaxing or start your own instance groups
---
I "solo'd" WC with 5 level 18 priests, but I remember when I was leveling my rogue someone said level 18 was too low for WC...
---
yeah everyone has different playing fields but you can choose to be positive or negative about what happens to you. if someone is posting on a classic wow forum they at least arent 3rd world
---
This is so messed up how can they just let things like this happen with no official response whatsoever. For me this is the same thing as stealing there is people paying subscription and expecting to be able to do the content they are entitled too, how can they ignore this ?
---
Yeah dont agree with FFA but definitely grab everything and pass it out on the go. Its entirely asinine to have people huddled over the boss corpse, wasting flasks and buffs.
---
I can’t decide on a main for WoW classic. First time playing wow, I’m alliance westfall server.
---
So far I have:
---
51 warrior herb/alchemy 
---
50 hunter skinning/herb
---
41 mage skinning/herb
---
26 priest tailor/enchanting
---
I like the warrior for how easy it is to get into groups or dungeons. I can tank/dps. Questing is somewhat ok, very gear dependent so that’s a downside, so takes a while to do stuff.
---
Hunter is super self sufficient in not having to rely on groups to do content. Downside is getting into groups sometimes. Though it’s not heavily gear reliant to get things done. Able to solo a lot of stuff with ease.
---
Mage is fantastic for that aoe farming, but that’s pretty much it; though whenever you get into groups, it’s really good dps for clearing mobs, and getting gold. Questing kind of sucks with an aoe spec.
---
Priest was boring af for me lol, just using it as my bank alt and enchanter.
---
I haven’t played other classes yet, though at this point I’d rather get to 60 and do end game content soon lol.
---
Darkshore. The trees in the zone are sinister looking, giving the whole zone a feeling of unease.
---
Dude all the time. 
---
Like for instance in sin city, when the chick had her hand cut off. Mucky rorke came to save the day, and she was like “THEY MADE ME WATCHHHHHHHHHHHHH”. 
---
I fucking love saying shit like that LOL
---
Our guild is Howlers... I’m Thedeep though, Fitchner is the best warrior tank in the realm
---
Just do it late at night or early in morning like me. Less competition
---
Riveting story. Thanks for the share!
---
Only tauren can be druids on horde and only night elves can be druids on alliance. 
---
You can enable class colours in chat as well so people's names are blue for mage, yellow for rogue etc.
---
Is there a way to make mouseover macro's only be able to target players? Kind of sucks to accidentally heal a totem
---
Lake everstill in Redridge has submerged foot lockers that you can pick there up until level 125 ish
---
Edit: you can also go to the Zoram strand in ashenvale for some water logged footlockers
---
[https://www.wow-professions.com/classic/lockpicking-leveling-guide-classic-wow](https://www.wow-professions.com/classic/lockpicking-leveling-guide-classic-wow)   and  [https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/wow-classic-lockpicking-guide-1-300/](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/wow-classic-lockpicking-guide-1-300/) are better guide imo, basically look through them and find a spot that works for you
---
Pve play alliance. Pvp play horde. Just go back to a Pve server, casual.
---
Some, mostly from just selling Mooncloth from what I understand.
---
Kjøttkake
---
Sell these for 2g in-game!
---
Yeah the 6 hour CD is brutal. I know blizzard likes to #nochanges in our face when we request something but this is one thing they should change.
---
I know warcraftlog have a speed ranking but its entirely based on the commulative kill times of all bosses.
---
Paladin and Shaman are both excellent.
---
Yes but more work too gathering materials. Most people use it to make themselves BiS gear
---
I have the feeling if you tell them you were leading a successful corp in Eve Online, they would flock to you xD
---
Ah damn I had to scroll for it prior. RIP
---
Melee starts?
---
Get it
---
I’m glad you can laugh about it.
---
Am I the only one tilted by the cursor clearly being over the ring slot and it highlighting the boots showing the set instead?
---
There's a horde quest in hillsbrad that gives a red hood
---
There is no dot limited to one mob, but there is a curse type limit. For example, multiple curse of agony's can be applied, but only one of them will do damage.
---
I saw that, but I'm horde
---
You can't possibly need that many.
---
I have 15-20 max
---
What’s the quest called?
---
As a hyper casual player, pugs are all I got :(
---
Don't bother. At this stage of the game, gear is nearly irrelevant. Just do your quest and you will get your headpiece eventually
---
56 is high enough to start grinding mobs for epic mount, honor, or both
---
You're a little bit low for elementals (except heavily camped toxic horrors), but jadefire demons/satyrs could be good for felcloth and demonic runes, depending on your class
---
You're just so much better at the game that what everyone else thinks is difficult, is easy to you.
---
Consistently pulling blue and purple parses. Feels fine.
---
Does not work. Guess you need to scale up after your post ;)
---
Bandaging is fine imo since it's universal
---
I'm already a tailor so I can't use that excuse I'm just not interested in such a minor stat gain for such a huge money sink. It's not like I'm trying to parse and, I'm a little conceited when it comes to WoW, I definitely feel like I'm better than the average PUG healer.
---
When I was interviewed for the military they did indeed ask for further clarification about some games I played and what you do there.
---
Lost the roll on four of them then after I lost the roll on my last run it dropped the very next attempt and no one else needed it. Some blessed RNG.
---
Wrong. Guild banks are banks that all mains use and share for the whole guild communities. People put in valueable items like blacksmithing recipes when they aren’t blacksmiths to give to another guide mate who is. GM can set permissions for people to access it. People can have their own bank alts, but that’s not what he was asking about.
---
I’m playing a ret styled holy paladin.
---
Do a /range 15 prior to pull and have people split up
---
I'm not sure the 6 piece is worth getting because the Cadaverous Armor is far and away the best piece you can get before Nightslayer's chest, and it isn't that much worse than Nightslayer's either. Same applies to Bracers of the Eclipse. They're very powerful items  considering they are dungeon blues. 
---
4/8 SC with Cadaverous Chest, Devilsaur's Gloves/Legs, and Bracers of the Eclipse might be your best option.
---
Hmm I never thought of this but it sounds right up my alley
---
So, I often take the leadership role of the dungeons I run. I try to learn the whole thing backwards and forwards so I can be like a dungeon Sherpa when we get in there- get everyone their quests, their loot, nice and fast, etc., and I tank anyway so these are good things to know. However, this takes time- I’ll often announce that I’m unfamiliar w/ a dungeon if I haven’t ran it much/ at all- and it’s really interesting to see how pushy and arrogant people get when you announce you’re unfamiliar with something. It’s like admitting that you don’t have some specific knowledge of a boss encounter suddenly makes you a full blown idiot to them, and they treat you accordingly. Didn’t really expect this game to teach me so much about what good leadership looks like...
---
Right now I have a level 29 Priest with ~20g trained in mining and skinning. If I want to buy a mount at 40, will I be able to get enough gold in time even if I'm stockpiling materials for engineering? Or would it be wiser to just sell ores as I get them and worry about engineering much later?
---
I'm also currently disenchanting about half the equipment I can so that I can level enchanting real fast after hitting 60.
---
And here it is in English [https://www.sewers.dk/HeroesofWoW/?Num=28](https://www.sewers.dk/HeroesofWoW/?Num=28)
---
Imagine you are a mouse in a box, imagine that you keep hearing a beep in a predictable time, then imagine that you accidentally lean on a button while looking for the beep, then something happens and you find some food. Trying to recreate this experience, you press the button again, no food. But eventually you manage to push the button at the time of the beep again, and once again food. Eventually you will realize that if I hear a noise, I should press this button, then I’ll get food. Then after your introduction to the mechanics, imagine that if you hear the noise but don’t press the button you get shocked. Now whether you are hungry or not, you hear noise you press button to avoid the shock. Eventually the food is taken away and all you do is avoid the shock. You could take away the shock, but I bet the mouse would still press that button every time.
---
This is a literal Skinner Box, where is the random? Why would random even be a part of the conditioning? Not only that, but where is the “payment”?
---
Where did you even come up with “pay to try”?
---
You're going to duel a mage
---
The t1 set is okay you just want to aim for the 3 piece bonus on your bracers shoulders head and waist. There are better blue and purple items out there that beat the t1 set in phase 1. Although the set looks freaking sweet!
---
My favorite place is Stranglethorn Vale because it reminds me of my time in Vietnam.
---
Its just like that we can in europe easily live from goverment welfare and game all day  /s
---
I mean some raids will probably take one for the debuff but thats about it really.
---
You should barely be paying attention to your gear at that level.  Best advice I can give you is to just stay focused and keep killing mobs.  Wasting time looking for gear that will be replaced in a few levels is very inefficient.
---
Keep grinding and the gear will come naturally.  Good luck!
---
Mixed reaction. Some were upset, some found it amusing. The sword itself wasn't really useful as a weapon anymore so it was more of a cosmetic thing to show off. I got a good amount of angry whispers about it, but in the end people got over it. I was happy when they added transmog into the game and then linked items to your account so my paladin and warrior could both use it.
---
I think they mean it's fairly common to let warriors get charge, stealth classes get opener, shaman can pretotem, etc.
---
Every 5 minutes you get to feel like everyone else, as a rogue. When you AR evasion bf. Then it's back to single pulling.
---
Yeah, it's great if you can play during off-hours, but if not, you're kinda SOL as far as essence farming goes.
---
If my tank only could hold the aggro.
---
fixed.
---
I would have waved and helped him with the escort quest, killing mobs and the random spawns for him until the quest is almost complete, then killed the escort NPC if possible, then killed him, viciously corpsecamping him until he embraced that 10 minutes of res sickness. Being alliance is already bad enough, but being an alliance hunter? How do you just let that go?
---
You think you want to boom, but you oom.
---
is he using max rank starfire? the resources panel is broken and doesn't really show mana over time so it's hard to tell, but he should be doing more damage than that if he's actually close to pre-raid bis (which is mostly just green arcane spell damage items and spell hit iirc). the mana graphs never even get close to 0 mana when it does update, so maybe he's just not using all of his mana in a fight due to downranking or something?
---
his gear has gotta be wrong. you're supposed to get as much arcane spell damage as you can while also getting hit in every slot you can (iirc, i haven't hopped into the druid discord in a month or so). make sure he isn't following the icy veins guide or something, since those BiS lists they had (at least back during launch, maybe not recently) were trash and included mp5 and spirit over just more damage.
---
but what about 2nd way i said ? high lvl party member did most of dmg but he also warped out of dung and so is in compleatly diffrent map. do low lvl guy still gets dimishing exp ?
---
Thought it was 20.  At any rate they grouped us as range 10 before.
---
What about the RPPvP server? I’m on there (Zandalar Tribe) and loving it so far :)
---
The gnome and undead racial isn’t for all cc...
---
Ahh that's cool. I thought about respec to holy to obtain bis for shadow but with all the warlocks and bussiness about having to roll and even if you win the roll the GM or whoever that random internet person still has to give it to you. I just don't see how that's fun after the first time
---
I see.
---
Man youre so close I feel like this is easy..
---
With a 51 and 50 warrior/hunter, you might as well level the warrior to be a main and then get the hunter to 60 to farm gold.
---
Yeah I figured thats what they meant but fuck that. As soon as I can attack its happening. Im not  waiting for them to charge and I'm popping that shitty rogue out of stealth immediately
---
Edit: spelling
---
I haven’t been able to hold threat over a single shadow priest, ever. Other tanks tell me the same. It’s so common spriests are basically off-tanks to me. So, the problem here is you, but it’s not JUST you.
---
It's interesting that you read my comments like that (presuming you're using sarcasm). 
---
I'm thinking the vocal folks are so much better at the game than me that they feel comfortable taking on much higher challenges than I do -- and then they complain that the radically higher challenges are harder for some classes than for others. Scrubs/casuals like me never push that envelope, so we never notice that difference.
---
Will be fun in a 40 man raid
---
Are you heavily geared in t1? I'm thinking of trying this to get forors/gold but I'm in 90% preraid bis
---
Eh people get a little defensive on here about this stuff. Some people gotta learn the hard way I guess!
---
how is that even a question ? Quick strike is a better version of painweaver band ....
---
best race in the game for PvP alongside Orcs. The meta at endgame for most players that play the game a lot is PvP.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=567/dangerous
---
whatever spec you find boring or miserable to play shouldnt be played at all, do what you like. 
---
Maybe find another guild a little later that is cool with one balance druid in the ranks, in a raid (until aq40 and naxx) you really only need ~35 people, so the other spots can be filled with balance, feral, spriest, etc.
---
find where you belong, dont pidgeon hole yourself to something you dont enjoy spending your time on.
---
I heard it scales with your health
---
It's woah unit frames with another addo. With class portraits it looks like
---
*explosion*
---
Never these methods for horde
---
I am for use all you got, no restrictions.
---
That's an interesting use of exponents. But you're right, there's a special place in hell for people making vertical videos.
---
I certainly didn't, nor did most people I know either.
---
And what? How on earth were you hurting for cash to make repairs in wrath?
---
Gear is irrelevant kek. Yet gear helps you quest.
---
If someone made an addon that projected healing numbers in a 3D environment above targeted party members head they would be a godsend and I will donate to them. Number 1 healing issue with classic, I need to know how big my heals are and where the targeted party member is located that I healed.
---
I think I did the boat off Ratchet till 100 and then was able to open the ones at Durnhold Keep in Hillsbrad for a while
---
Edit: I worked off this guide, as well, and it's not completely accurate.
---
Our raid team is nearly full and only 1 druid who is resto.
---
That battle res is awesome, but alas, no druids looking to join up. We need them bad for buffs.
---
I agree. I clarified that.
---
The part of The Barrens that is the road from Mulgore to Org. My brother came and showed me the way then I was starting out as a young shaman. He was max lvl and dismounted so we could run the stretch together, he even had to un-equip his boots because he had a run speed enchat on them.
---
Afaik you cannot. Period.
---
I have tried and they are attached to the exact same UI frame and cannot be separated or independently disabled. I am sorry.
---
Scarlet Monastery. It's just my favorite place to level. First place where gear actually feels worth while.
---
But there is already an upload feature at reddit, no need to create intermediate links.
---
Yes it does. Its 2%
---
Could be! I didn't look into the actual numbers from the spreadsheet. I was just commenting on the math
---
‘Dodge’
---
‘Miss’
---
‘Parry’
---
“Spam sunders come on wtf are you doing?”
---
To be fair not having a mage in the group is pretty shitty - the damage and utility is nuts - not to mention all the free food. Having a whole group of mages on the other hand? Hell nah!
---
GL GD
---
If you have a ton of druids, especially higher level ones, then you might be de facto passed up on raid gear for a while regardless of spec. I feel there's a risk of a guild potentially eye-rolling on bringing *another* druid, especially an unoptimized spec. I feel like minmaxing can be avoided a lot if you solo or only do dungeons, but if you want to get into raiding you're at the whims of the leaders and in all likelihood they will want to try to be efficient with the 40 they are bringing.
---
You don't have to farm the drop itself. I bought it off AH for 200g, you can easily farm 200g in 1-2 days
---
If you don’t allow consumables you shouldn’t allow engi items. Imo.
---
Although really to me, anything goes in a duel. Warrior wants to pop his 30 min CD’s fine by me. Cause if you try to jump a warrior in the open world, he’s not going to not use them if it means life or death.
---
Those are great fights, and smooth as butter, but they are also all 40v40. The fights on Classic that are this laggy are 80v80 or more. I've been in a number of 40v40 fights and they run this smoothly on Classic (for the most part)
---
whichever one you enjoy more
---
how much runecloth is that dude...?
---
I find pickpocketing in BRD to be incredibly boring. It is my opinion that running dungeons is more entertaining. Since I play this game for entertainment, there isn’t a reason to do something that isn’t fun in the game. Everyone feels differently on this though and I understand your perspective on this. From my experience pick pocketing BRD, I gain about 30 gold per hour, while watching tv, and I know I could make more while focusing completely on the act. Also every time I check the AH the Krol blades are all ridiculously over priced on my server, like over 400g now. So it would take over ten hours at my pace of something that I absolutely do not enjoy for enough gold. At this point I’ve realized that worrying about one item in a video game is completely ridiculous so I’ve decided to play wow less, enjoy running raids and dungeons for the gameplay aspect, and to no longer worry about drops in a video game. I appreciate the advice though.
---
Faster. I've been going for it and saw 6 drops in 94 kills, and I've only been doing it 4 days. Of course I lost all 6 rolls, but eventually I'll be the only one left and I'm sure all the people I helped will return the favor... Right?
---
I personally prefer no rules duels. Everything goes, just like in world pvp. Duels to me are just practice for when you get caught by horde so potions, hour long cooldowns, elixirs, full resets, engineering items, are all fair game to me.
---
How is the faction ratio ?
---
I’ve neglected the use of FD trap for so long because people like you are spreading false info. Its perfectly fine and double trap works fine with practice.
---
Doesn't say you lose durability when you die in the combat log like it does in PVE with the 10%.
---
Got a source for the populations of the servers? I find it INCREDIBLY unlikely, as a fellow Nost player for years. I'm currently on a "lower pop" realm in Classic and it feels more active than Nost ever was.
---
I love the rains down in Elwynn Forest and all to low level zones I have not visited for years.
---
"optional BiS" is the term i have seen thrown around. as there are definitive "This is the best flat damage increase period" and "This is 2-6 spell power off per spell but has this much fire resist to assist healers in a fight"... 
---
My personal opinion is... 10 fire resist to give me a chance to stay alive is worth it to lose a few spell power, but I am a utility type of player instead of raw damage... hints why I am playing a lock instead of a hunter or warrior.
---
And I am guessing you have the standard party frames on default?
---
It looks nice but for me I cannot STAND having my targeting and player frame in the middle of my screen, it is far more obstructing than the too of the screen IMO.
---
I know. But I'm already struggling to get enough to get all my enchantments. I'd rather just go with an easier drop.

Leveled 3 characters through STV, imo its worth it if you can get through without dying a lot. But yeah if you want avoid it you can just skip through by spamming Scarlet Monastery to make up for the exp/levels you have gotten from STV. Could also give Arathi Highlands a try and later on Badlands if youre looking for some quests till you can get around 42-ish for Tanaris.
---
Is 10% per 45 mins a good xp rate for grinding mobs?
---
I am currently level 43 rogue and I am farming rock elementals in Badlands cause I noticed they respawn fast. 
---
However I am only getting around 10.000 xp / 45 mins, which is 10% of my level. That would mean I would level in 7.5 hours if my math is correct. 
---
It sounds too much based on my experience cause it was taking me around 4 hours per level following a leveling guide which took me questing. 
---
Do you guys know any good grinding spots for my class and level?
---
I am looking forward to grinding strath UD for rep+chance at baron mount.
---
My blue set is almost complete pending one piece
---
Tea ironnades and bandage is fine.
---
no 10min cds like prep and coldsnap because that just means you have to wait longer to duel again unless if otherwise is agreed.
---
Opener priority: Rogue &gt; Druid &gt; Warrior &gt; rest
---
No rules or restrictions. You're allowed to use your full kit and whatever else you've farmed or paid for yourself. 
---
That is a duel.
---
Yeah standard party frames. I like having my player frame close to see health and energy in peripheral vision, but each to their own.
---
do you know why he's doing that lol what a dick.
---
Then both Bloodmail and Windreaver are fine, the difference between them is negligible. DPS spreadsheets tells me that with my gear Windreaver beats Bloodmail by a whopping 0.006%
---
Who are the top horde guilds in golemagg
---
It is much easier to get spell power to crank out more damage than it is to get enough int to do the same dps as a lock. 
---
I followed the spell power rule and always saw nice increases when i swapped out a decent int piece for a SP piece.
---
Just pmed you a shopped pic of it
---
You have life tap and drain
---
The issue is that the route is shit and the video quality is poor. You can actually get 50g/hr with pickpocket farming if you do it right.
---
Do you know when guild banks are coming out?
---
That's the thing though; it's not useless at all. All rogues have stealth and pickpocket - so this guide applies to all rogues. You just won't be as effective as the guy that gets the ideal talents to maximize efficiency.
---
I've seen 5 swords and 3 pants, but 6 HoJ. I'd say they're more rare. Per atlasloot, he also drops a tank trinket, which I haven't seen in 94 stealth runs and another 26 non-stealth.
---
how do u use sit macro? sit and walk? since just sitting doesnt work in classic
---
Yes, if the price isn't more than the bandage vendor price on the AH, newer players can arbitrage to generate gold.
---
It's not worth it for a high level player as you'd make gold quicker by fishing.
---
Download recount, go grind a bit &amp; report back. Maybe theres a bug with my one?
---
I have no idea, i just kept playing this is still one of the strangest things i have experienced in wow
---
Everyone seems convinced it is the best trinket until Naxx for combat swords PvE rogue, sword spec fury warrior, and all 2h fury warrior.
---
Yeah just be honest that you’re learning. I dungeoned my way up to 60 most of the way on first tank character and had to learn everything fresh. People are generally pretty cool about it. Consider the ones that aren’t as the trash taking itself out (I can be kinda sensitive, so easier said than done, but really that’s what it is).
---
Also, there may be a billion Warriors, but there sure is hell isn’t a billion tanks. A good tank is the most valuable commodity in the game imo.
---
So you're saying when someone joins that group, they should tell the group they want alternatives to the other players that were already in that group. Ok. "Druid healer? Kick this rog, get me a shaman." Ok.
---
Did the pally have the aura?
---
Eastvale Logging Camp in Elwynn! It reminds me of me home town~
---
I did the ratchet boat, then footlockers in hillsbrad till they were grey and just hit 175 from waterlogged footlockers on the west coast of desolace.
---
Don't want to be starting any fires now.
---
It isnt so bad once you get into a raid team. Other casters have to fight over Mageblade or Staff of Dominance while you can just pick up Benediction, which it or the hunter leaf has a 50% chance of dropping, against the other priests. I know my guild is had more eye drops for thar staff than priests who still need it.
---
Probably stealth tribute runs
---
If you really need money grind mobs for a level otherwise just do quests you get better methods to gain gold ät 60
---
They make a grand total of 1g for every 20 stacks sent to them, which involves 20 minutes of crafting time alone.
---
That's not a lucrative operation.
---
rock elementals are terrible to grind for exp, they are immune to posions and have really high armor. And yes that's awful exp rate. Try the whelps in eastern badlands (north side of the elite dragons. They are really easy to kill and give good gold too since the flame sacs are used for raiding.
---
Just look at how much you wrote in an attempt to gatekeep something like being good at warrior in wow. It's quite sad
---
Probably should petpassive before feigning so it’s not attacking mid feign
---
You actually have a healthy approach to the game, I don't understand the game. Figuring out how a game works from the inside is a great source of entertainment and fun for many people.
---
In a sense you reliving the true Vanilla™ experience because when the original game came out there were no extensive guides and easily queriable databases. When the original players had a question, they asked others in chat.
---
The Molten Core, because Ragnaros is my boy.
---
Shimmering flats
---
Check the abilities being used.
---
?? Allies have been ganking since the dawn of time
---
I wiped on him 5-6 times before I realized that his enrage is on exactly a 15sec CD. Once I realized that, it was piss easy.
---
there was plenty of horde when i leveled in redridge so the faction doesnt really matter , its in the middle of the lake , so grab a water breathing potion and go swim around. also for me ashenvale was horde infested so couldnt do shit there lol
---
Yeah, but at a 30 second cool down and mana cost more than double Flash of Light, it just seems more useful to get Blessing of Sanctuary and be able to tank better rather than get Holy Shock
---
Or most of the people here are just circle jerking about smth that they may have encountered once
---
I feel you man, I’m level 51 and haven’t done Mara once yet because I don’t want to have to go AFK to take care of my daughter. Look forward to those times where she spends time with the in laws! Lol
---
Hit chance does affect PVP to 5% by default but people can have + defense so you will still miss.  Use your hit gear if it is BIS.
---
Lol worry about leveling at that point, fear will follow
---
Yeah I don't speed level or track times so I didn't mean to make it seem like this is slow, I literally meant it just didn't seem fast lol. I completely forget how long 12-16 was
---
Not if the question is rhetorical "my man". You assumed an answer and built a whole argument around that answers, so you very clearly were not asking an actual question.
---
I'm playing a gnome this time around for the int buff and.... you're not wrong.
---
What if your time is worthless?
---
Orgrimmar or anywhere with an Auction house, finding that cheap item you know goes for more always gives you a rush of excitement
---
I'm on one of the smallest servers (EU Judgement) and got dropped a Flurry Axe on my main, mage. Obviously useless for the main, but I worked up a warrior to lvl 38 now and I was wondering how powerful it is? Any recommended uses for it? Get two? Or Thrash Blade to combo it? I've never played classic/vanilla before so I'm clueless!
---
I could sell it for some gold but I'm really not in a rush to get rich. If I ever want one of these the chance is about 0,1% because I haven't seen anyone sell it except once.
---
I'm currently leveling my 3rd 60. As long as you can hit 60 before december when phase 2 is likely to be released, you're not losing out on anything. Getting to 60 only takes 10+ days played if you're wasting a lot of time. Exceptional levelers quest a warrior to 60 in 5 days, your average Joe following their guide quite easily does it in 7 days. So if you're leveling anything aside from a paladin/rogue/warrior you should never take 10 days if it's "focused playtime".
---
I do think its server based as well. I play on a fairly low pop server (Felstriker) and all mages I’ve met knows/manages threat very well. Will let tank get aggro before AOE-ing. 
---
Maybe higher pop servers increases the chances of getting them Magetards.
---
Played a rogue to 38. Half the buttons to press with usage of 1 more skill and an option to stealth. 
---
Paladins always were the unstoppable truck when grinding and relentless in PvP. That’s their purpose in life. You should rarely have down time between mobs/mob packs. 
---
Aim to manage your resources wisely(hp/mana). This adds a bit more involvement with what’s going on. It’s not exciting but it is something.
---
All the vanilla Hunters rolled mage in classic
---
Yes, but since class mechanics are so simple, dps checks are basically down to gear. Since MC is simple, getting gear for BWL is mainly a time sink and has nothing to do with difficulty. It's also something that can be done by suboptimal class/specs, just need a bit more gear before you go in.
---
Yeah! I'm currently looking for a guild to help out and get help with end game stuff. Just having a hard time being alliance on thunderfurry and finding a guild. I made some posts today and tonight my objective is to spend some time in the capitals to see if I can find one.
---
Its not a discussion, if you wipe sitting down you get far better access to your anus and therefore more clean. If you wipe standing up you're demonstrably gross.
---
Yeah, that's a solid point. I've only got the one character so I'll probably go Gnomish.
---
it's because originally there were only two servers one PVP and one PVE and everyone was trying to join the PVP server (Arugal) so they created more servers. The PVP servers are totally fine though, I highly recommend Yojamba as a quality server I've never been camped and have only been in a few skirmishes
---
Well considering I've looted probably over 400 junk boxes and never got a green and wowhead has over 3500 opens and not a single green or better, it's safe to say you're not getting anything of value from it, even if it's theoretically possible
---
Is this an addon? If so, which one?
---
He's right. How exactly is a white headpiece with 33 armor doing shit? 
---
Of course you don't never want to replace gear but you don't need to go out of your way to try and get a bit of extra armor here, an extra 2 main stat there. It's not going to do shit.
---
You picked 5 locks with the timer paused mate
---
Love being a Druid, 7/8 t1, 2/8 t2. 
---
We haven’t seen a chest drop yet though, I’m fed up of looking like a tube of Colgate no matter how great the robe is :D
---
The only BiS lists I’ve seen on wowhead and icy veins contain the very top 1 or at best 2 items.  And these frequently include boe world drops, ultra rare drops (like enhancement shammy list brd epic chest that took someone here 221 runs to get), and getting very lucky with random stats on some pieces (an affliction lock list I saw listed a ton of ST “of shadow wrath” gear).
---
It’s kind of like asking how to farm gold for epic mount and being told to just farm rivendare.
---
Questing in Feralas around your level was quite profitable for me, just required a buddy to be efficient and never die
---
My hero haha. If this isn't classic wow I don't know what is.
---
Drain tanking is for slow levelers. Every speed-runner stacked spirit on launch.
---
Deeprock Salt is surprisingly low in sodium!
---
Also if you do everything right and then go outside the bar and begin fighting the first mob there for some reason they count as bar people and will trigger the flame elementals and elites to spawn in behind you that investigate. If your caster dps or healer is up top by the door they will aggro and wipe group.
---
It's all Runescape memes spilling over here because someone crossed the streams. $11 is the monthly fee.
---
Every time I see this I wonder where exactly these mud huts are located. Is there some secret Horde city everyone but me knows about?
---
What's funny is that for anyone that isn't hardcore they're a great choice.  They travel fast without mount, stealth, provide lots of support, can fill any role in dungeons(without people giving weird looks *cough*shammys*cough*), etc.
---
The biggest legit negative is stigma(and possibly having to be a tauren or night elf).  It's tough being a druid when no one wants a druid because they misunderstand the situation.  Being outperformed on paper is fine when in actuality the druid is going to be geared out to the nines for multiple specs and the mage is going to be scraping by with a mishmash of tiers and preraid bis.
---
69 copper. Nice.
---
What holy spec are you running with
---
What? How dare you switch off raging berserkers!!
---
Blackrock Depths. It is incredibly huge and looks so refined. Almost like a dark Ironforge.
---
Annihilator requires 12 Arcanite bars though? Are those bars better off being used for a Lionheart helm?
---
Rivenspike I think is too slow to be considered. Other people are also recommending Deathbringer that also seems too slow for tanking - both would necessitate windfury to be decent. Correct me if I'm wrong here. Tanking just feels so much more difficult with any weapon slower than 2.2.
---
I'm in the same position as OP, I'm currently using Grizzle's Skinner. Bone Slicing Hatchet seems to be the best value pre-raid bis tanking weapon for Orcs.
---
If he's getting boosted by 60s he's literally just in the way if he tries to help.
---
Seriously, everyone giving OP flack. It’s like cmon he’s trying to be nice and make a connection lol
---
Offset for sure.  I use the spellpower plate from BRD as the base, fill with hit/crit gear.

I'm not *heavily* geared in t1, but I do have 4 pieces so far. Those 4 pieces (shoulders, gloves, boots, bracers) and Quel'serrar are currently my only epics though.
---
If you struggle to two-man it, you could always get a DPS as a third person! You could easily 3 man it with all pre-raid bis gear, and it will go faster with a DPS so you won't really lose too much gold even though you'll need to split it with another person.
---
If you want a video tour of the run, [this video is pretty close to the route I take](https://youtu.be/zVUKcRqesto?t=94). This video was recorded on a private server though and the courtyard trash is a little bit different in classic. The only other difference is that they don't kill Lethtendris in this video, and I think she's really worth doing. In this video they go north after killing Hydrospawn, instead you can go south, kill that one demon with the AOE pack, then walk up the ramp and you'll be right at Lethtendris which is probably the easiest boss of the 4 to two-man. There's a potential dusty tome spawn right next to her too!
---
Good luck if you try it!
---
20g at 29 is about what I had, it ramps up as you hit heavy leather in your mid 30s. If you’re being conscious about buying skills and not indulging in professions or gear on the auction house, you should have it by 40.
---
Also, don’t train to 300 mining or skinning til after you get it, they’re like 4-5g each and not necessary for the nodes/beasts you’ll be seeing.
---
&gt; go reckoning and time your sit/stands to burst mobs down
---
What do you mean?
---
If it makes you feel any better I'm at 134 kills and zero drops so far.
---
You're very confident for someone so completely wrong
---
Puggle and classiclfg are two other takes on the same thing.
---
Bad for melee.
---
he wont see it
---
Any good, secluded grind spots for a level 60 where I can just grind mobs mindlessly until I get a group/friend comes on?
---
Agreed, it’s too easy. #somechanges now
---
Why would you pm and not link it here
---
nice
---
Respecc and then respecc back for raid? If you're gonna farm 30+ hours before swapping back it makes up for the respecc cost many times over
---
"Shockadin" 31/0/20 so i have some points in ret
---
Absolutely agreed, prioritize crit following special hit cap but don't just ignore getting more hit. It still gives more damage, just less than pre-cap. But if fewer white hits miss, your damage increases.
---
Superior healing pots aren't worth jack shit
---
even major healing pots (of which he got 1) aren't worth very much.
---
I saw his inventory, he had about 7g there.
---

Okay cool ill start trying to gather some peices
---
Fantastic idea, terrible execution
---
Very nice photo.
---
I couldn’t figure out how to get rid of it, but you can make the text really small in the addons menu when you press esc.
---
120 runs here. I pretty much gave up. Shit was crushing my soul.
---
I recall there being a site where you could look items up and see what their stats were during various patches in vanilla, does anyone know it by chance?
---
Imho as my rouge who has been my focus for a month or so, just a regular leveling spec is fine for pvp. I have survived many encounters. As long as you keep slice up and get that evasion off you will be fine.
---
Thanks! Will give it a try soon
---
48 is the lowest level that gives honor for 60s, iirc
---
My group was a melee cleave first time around. Excluding cath, we were always clearing fast enough to get locked out for a couple of minutes. Both in GY and armory.
---
Agreed this is too easy but we’ve got phase 2 dropping by end of the year and hopefully phase 3 right behind it. World boss fighting will be good and BWL is a step up from molten snore.
---
&gt;/console SET cameraDistanceMax "50"
---
how do you get the console to work?
---
I installed MikScrollingBattleText this evening just after I got HoJ to see when it procs. You can disable all the text options it has and keep just the procs for sword specialization and HoJ. Bear in mind tho that HoJ proc is visible even without any addon, you notice the effect on your character when it procs, it's subtle, but it's there.
---
BRD up!
---
The problem with this is that it allows certain classes to start AoEing before the duel is active and before you are hostile. 
---
That's why allowing rogues the opener and warrior the charge is seen as the fair way. 
---
It's a bullshit duel if you can start hitting me straight away by casting something before we were even able to fight.
---
Here you go! https://m.imgur.com/gallery/dvC472A

Blood elf camp in aszhara is pretty good

Why? That's not bad at all. Cross-server lfg bullshit because people want instant groups is part of the retail problem.

I have a question that I'd like some opinions on...
---
Context - Picked up Aged Core Leather Gloves [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18823/aged-core-leather-gloves] from MC last weekend. I have Devilsaur set, however I've been wanting to go Daggers for a while now... especially since competition for Daggers vs Swords is better. I do own DR OH, but no MH. 
---
I've picked up Barman Shanker (https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12791/barman-shanker) and Darrowspike (https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13984/darrowspike)
---
Is it worth it to break my Devilsaur set (would miss 2% HIt, would put me @ 8%, but I still have room to get Wyrmhide Shoulders or TS from UBRS). AKA, am I gonna take big DPS loss at all? 
---
My thoughts - I think it boils down to preference at this small discrepancy of stats... basically will Daggers affect my out of raid experience, e.g. WPVP, Farming, BRD Runs, etc

I did not know this route existed. Is there much in Theramore? To my limited knowledge, it is a wretched place full of hostile humanoid NPCs far off on the side of Swampwallow no one ever goes to.
---
Dude. I know. I just think it’s hilarious when people say, “I can’t do X, what should I do?” and the only response they get is, “do X”.
---
You get one real option for anyone that isn’t going to sink a ton of time into the game: be resto. Plus you have all those that cry how resto isn’t the best at healing so they roll something else. 
---
I realize there are ferals and balance out there that play regularly. But they’re few and far between and have a Goldilocks set of conditions that afford them good opportunities. It’s not commonplace. There is no real reason it should be this way but it is. 
---
/rant off.
---
Yea how many people are speed runners in the community? 1%?
---
There is also a guy in retail who leveled entirely by picking flowers and mining rocks. The people who need advice on leveling aren't speed runners.
---
How does the lightforged set fair? Or is it a waste
---
How did you clear MC with "no experience" yet you had enough water to douse all the flames and summon Domo/rag?
---
It only counts as a PvP death if the enemy player gets the killing blow.
---
If you’re 20 points in ret, it may be more worthwhile to get a slower 2H to take advantage of SoC.   And as bad as the first talents are in prot for someone using a 2H, 3% hit (8 points) is big for paladins.
---
I am currently running 31/10/10.  If you’re a healer, BoP improvement is nice to have.  And nearly permanent BoF is always handy if you get overwhelmed or find yourself in world pvp.
---
And you're missing it. It's not unusual to have a reaction when you're staring at a bobbing female ass, pixelated or not, for hundreds of hours.
---
Hell yeah, min-maxing here we go :D
---
(They also look much better than bloodmail)
---
Prep+hemo/blade flurry on a pvp server. Leveling was clean and easy, lots of frontload damage and cc/survival for pvp.
---
Only downside is you've really got to get a slow/high damage weapon to get the most out of that hemo. Don't try to level with daggers until you've mastered the class.
---
You definitely need multiple sets as a Paladin. It can just be pieces from all over the place. A mix of Warrior and Paladin plate might work since not much is out yet.  I always preferred the true hybrid sets though for soloing, especially the AQ T2.5 (when it comes out) that's an amazing set to get.  The PvP sets are also very good for hybrid work. The T1 set is good too, it seems more hybrid than heals. I don't recall much about the T0.5 set, but they all seemed to be set up for soloing, so it should be nice too.
---
I have noticed though, runs go a lot smoother when someone is somewhat of a leader. Whether that be marking targets or verbally explaining which mobs they are skipping, I believe 90% it will make the run go smoother (unless everyone knows what they are doing and what their roles are). 
---
So recently when I've been doing dungeons, if no one steps up to be said "leader" I've taken it upon myself to mark focus targets and just type out what we are going to do even if they've done the dungeon before. I've gotten mixed responses, people thanking me or people telling me to stfu but since I've started doing I've had maybe one group collapse and disband mid dungeon.
---
You have two options, ret gear or spell power gear.  There are quite a few plate or mail spell power pieces.  Those along with a two hander or a slow one hander and shield.  The pally plus heal cloth gear is awful for solo questing/farming.
---
Crazy. I'd buy sooooooo many to prepare for p2
---
You're probably going to be launched at, then impaled, upon one of the many spikes the Horde like to decorate their structures with.
---
I got turtle meat. ... kills me.. lol
---
You do realize consumables aren't required but they make the run quicker? Not everyone wants to spend 3+ hours in raid
---
What do you mean by tracking?
---
Is that the one where they pilots look at some random symbol on the hill and then just blindly bank at the last moment?
---
stv is a fun zone to quest in
---
Ok I was afraid of that response lol. Thank you though for confirming. Hopefully something comes out eventually.
---
It did not. This point was already covered in the comment that they had replied to.

The real reason is that I asked for screenshots of toons from the [two](https://imgur.com/a/ZwfVue8) [redditors](https://imgur.com/a/KtvpGpg) that had this [actual conversation](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dknae9/in_case_you_were_wondering_whether_people_look_at/f4i8tnu/?context=10000) here on the subreddit.

I haven't noticed a drop in XP when people have helped me kill a mob that was about to kill me.
---
EDIT: After looking up exactly how the Tagging system works, I probably still did 50% of the damage to the health. Therefore, was not penalized.
---
I don't know what class you are, but [this](https://classicdb.ch/?item=6720) is the first headpiece with stats that I usually get on my characters. It's the quest chain that starts with Steelsnap in Thunder Bluff. At the end you have to kill a level 37 yeti so you can get it whenever you feel up for that.
---
People also said that a typical raid should have 2-3 druids. So yeah, you need more mages than druids. But we closed off our mage, warrior and rogue recruiting by now and only look for healing shamans and priests, hunters and everything druid.

Yoga with Adrienne is awesome, recommend for anyone who sits at a desk a lot

I could've bought shadowfang for 60g buyout yesterday. I fucked up and bid on something else before that. Shadowfang is about 200g last time I checked :(. I got a kang for 80 gold, usually goes for double the price, i'll probably keep it till phase 3. But my best deal was buying 26 turtle scales for 1 copper each. 1 copper into 1 silver. Not a lot of money, but 100% profit. :D

Sulfuras has a pretty good balance and the wait times to join the server are not bad. My only gripe as Alliance is there's always a 50-60 or a group of 50-60s killing everything near Rebel Camp. Enough griefing that I skipped STV and went straight to desolace.

I think warrior is just tougher if you generally don't know what you're doing in the game. If you're a cautious, thoughtful player, nothing in the game is really very difficult, it just requires time and patience.
---
You're either in the minority or on an RP server.
---
Modern tech cannot overrule math. The amount of calculations increases exponentially with each additional player, which is why games like Eve Online have to slow the game by 10x or more to even have a chance at processing actions.
---
Not a strawman when the OP literally compares it to "almost like district level management?!" in his imagined job interview. No, leading a raid is not like managing a full district of a large corporation. 
---
I fundamentally disagree with you that it's nearly as difficult as you're making it out to be. It's getting people to work together and kill a video game boss. It has its complexities but it's still little more than just that. What you mentioned is all pretty straightforward stuff that isn't at all comparable to actually dealing with serious responsibilities for people's livelihoods and the success of an actual business.
---
And yes, it is pretty ridiculous. Congratulations, you can get a bunch of people together to do a raid, advise noobs and decide on dividing loot. None of that has anything to do with serious things like human resources, logistics, investments, marketing, contracts, accounting, consumer protection, insurance, revenue, staffing, location, market analysis, real pressure and responsibilities, growth, price setting, finances, actual problems that don't relate to simple stuff like who gets what piece of loot, liability, trade agreements, imports/exports, overall corporate strategy, risk assessments, quality assurance, streamlining and cutting costs, sustainability, high level negotiations and presentations, future projections, and dozens of other things that anyone at the upper management level of any serious corporation should at least have a basic understanding of. My dad's a senior consultant and recruiter for one of the largest consulting firms in the world, and I can't imagine he'd even want to listen to someone who genuinely believes that getting a group of people to behave and work together in a game is a substitute for actually being a manager with real work experience and gives them the necessary qualifications, knowledge and skills for such a position. There's a reason why people spend years of their life getting degrees in business, finance, economics and corporate management to hold these positions, and that isn't because you'd get the same skills and knowledge from leading a raid party in an MMO. 
---
That said, I think we just fundamentally disagree. Having held a respectable position in a law firm myself and having worked with heaps of businesses to sort out their problems and help them stay afloat, I've seen what it takes to thrive at that level. Yeah, some general coordination skills transfer, but leading a WoW raid absolutely doesn't cut it or give you the right knowledge and experience to deal with real life pressures and corporate challenges. But that's just my opinion and you're obviously free to disagree. Maybe I'm underestimating leading a raid, maybe you're underestimating upper management, or maybe we're both just wrong. I don't think either of us is going to change his mind here so I'll just leave it at this. Have a great day.
---
Also, I didn't downvote your previous comment. Undeserved for it to sit in the negatives. Peace! :)
---
Maybe it is an alliance vs. horde thing? If I were to play alliance I would defo roll a druid. Because Nightelves just look awesome. Tauren though.... well....
---
Yeah but it really wouldn't help. People *know* when they're on an imbalanced server, they opt to stay regardless. If you're on a PvP server and can quest in contested areas without issue 95% of the time... your faction most likely has a bunch of people killing as many of the other faction as they can. If going in to STV any time of day is death for a 30-40 then the opposite is true.
---
The real problem is that if you want the "magic" so to speak of PvP servers and the truly amazing experience you can have there? Gankers get to gank. The things that stop them, stop PvP.
---
People giving zero shits about others online is nothing new.. people come up with their own imaginary "code" and then work to justify how what they do is the right thing. Common ones are that they got ganked leveling so now they gank others, or "we're at war red is dead" while they corpse camp, "I only kill them once, that's no big deal" (ignoring what happens when every single high level does the same), etc etc.
---
And it's not like I'm any different. I have my own set of rules that I follow because I think they're the best and they're no more or less valid than the cackling asshole camping lowbies in redridge every night.
---
End of the day there isn't a solution. You need enough people willing to play with those that spend their time killing questers who can't fight back in order to maintain the PvP ruleset so that what I and others consider "actual fun world PvP" can happen. 
---
Personally I always wonder if a better system could be designed.. like a multiflag system perhaps. Maybe:
---
* Each zone is given a level range.
---
* If you are in that range or lower, you get flagged to everyone else in that range but *not* to people outside it.
---
* You are also always flagged to people within 5 levels of you, regardless of zone (contested zones only of course).
---
* Usual rules apply where if you attack a high level they can hit you back.
---
This means that while places like STV might still be hotspots for PvP... it's gonna be 30's and 40's who fight it out. Level 60's can come fight each other, but that level 35 who just wants to quest only has to worry about people their own level.
---
It doesn't solve kill gangs your own level but honestly... that's just PvP. You want to play those servers then you should be willing to stop what you're doing and rally the troops to fight. But it might at least help with "yeah there's five level 60's here we're fucked" stuff.
---
No was def the case back in the day. I had a hunter at launch and went for my bow super early before bwl and had my guild killing mobs and watching for griefers. So I wonder if it changed.
---
No, I'm saying there's nothing preventing him from respeccing, grinding gold, then swapping back because the gold will more than pay for the respecc cost... I switch to my AoE spec every week for ZF farm and swap back to Arcane/Frost on raid day
---
im about to claw my own face at 52 gorosh kills and no drop :)
---
Ah, OP, I may have steered you in the wrong direction if you are the rogue who made the post earlier. I had replied to a post suggesting the elementals but have since learned that they are much better suited for casters.
---
Don’t worry I think I got my first helm (which was grey lol) at around level 30.
---
Quality shitpost 10/10, would upvote again.
---
I’ve only got two necks from mine.
---
I live in Maraudon. Class habit i guess
---
I mean, it *technically* is. But totally doable.
---
No, the others get 3% too but on the typical DPS meters this isn't attributed to the Moonkin.
---
Special character is ruining it tho...
---
It's based on damage done to the enemy. This is extremely easy to test and your original advice is wrong.
---
Yeah, exactly, how else are tanks going to come on reddit and then complain about DPS doing too much damage, being braindead, and pulling aggro.  
---
Think about the karma those tanks need to farm.
---
Oh wtf! Haha woops, sorry!
---
It does. Quite effectively too. And if you're still playing retail, you can clone your profile so it always looks the same. 
---
Since setting up elvui, my total list is maybe 8 addons.
---
Addons, or maybe im missing something already built into the game?
---
I think you mean RFD. I usually get them mixed up too
---
I take his statement to mean he sucks at it, not that he isn’t specced for it. He clearly doesn’t understand how to play the class. And again, the answer was as pepega as possible.
---
Grinding is extremely viable in classic especially given how lucrative it can be for gold. Obviously dungeons CAN be as well but it's rng (twice over) relying on lucky drops AND rolls
---
The first 30 sp enchants went for 100g a pop on my server. It’s very believable
---
LOL yeah maybe that’s it. I do think Tauren are adorable and I usually do a /bow at them to be friendly as long as they’re not little bastards but I probably wouldn’t play one... don’t see very many Taurens in the first place come to think of it.

Isn't that the truth..
---
Ashenvale, in original wow that's where I really felt the game's atmosphere. Going back now to the Zoram Coast and seeing the lighting in Classic has been so amazing. Plus I like the music there.
---
Ofc it's a druid.
---
Leatrix Plus can do that (mentioned in the addon list).
---
Consider this, in phase 2 when pvp starts, do you want to be sitting in your bank/Ah all day?
---
Having liquid gold isn't a bad thing at all, I'm sitting on 7.5k in gold, and 4k in investments. The time it takes to sell banks full of materials is ridiculous, trust me I've done it.
---
sit down and right before they hit you stand back up. You'll get crit from sitting, but still get the reckoning proc if you stand at the right time.
---
Where in the open world is a rogue worth their salt gonna fight you if they don't get the opener? Get real dude
---
Pretty sure very close to 50/50, maybe there are more horde. My sources are purely anecdotal. It’s very hard for both factions to get through Blackrock Mountain.
---

What makes you think this is unpopular when we get at least weekly posts about people rerolling from PvE for this reason and also people advising against PvE servers for this exact reason?
---
Common knowledge mate.
---
You realize holding aggro against 4 mages isn't that different than holding aggro vs 1 mage.  It's not like their threat is combined or anything.
---
You forgot the intro:
---
&gt; Bone bone bone bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone 
---
Don't lie, you sang the bone part perfectly in your head didn't you???
---
Unless you are an aoe farming mage questing or in some cases aoe dungeon groups are always better than grinding.  As a rogue you might as well forget aoe groups.  They dont need you.   So just find a quest guide and follow it!
---
Am I the only one who sees someone bending over in the flame?
---
Oh I think I'll have to tinker with Miks for this.
---
side note, as a MSBT player. Have you noticed that you can't disable blizzards combat text?
---
Only if the monster deals the killing blow.
---
Adding on to what others say if an actual GM messages you it will have the blizzard logo next to their name.
---
I like Tirisfal glades. Especially the make in the middle. I like to swim there. So clear.
---
Yeah it was an addon. :) just checked. Check addon "showmemyheal" on curse or twitch app.
---
As a predominately Alliance player, I've always enjoyed Feralas and how it feels so distant from most other Alliance outposts.  Even as Horde, it's still a somewhat untamed zone full of mystery—not to mention that it's also home to Dire Maul, which has its own rich historical lore in the Warcraft universe.
---
You basically described the dynamics of abusive relationships. Someone hurt me, so I feel the need to pass that on
---
I'm a lvl 60 prot warrior and I'm looking to solo Mara Princess runs for the ring. I haven't set foot in raids yet and I have a couple pre-raid BiS items for Prot spec from BRD, LBRS, and Strat Live. How viable would that be?
---
I've seen fury warriors manage this relatively easily but I'm not keen on respec-ing a lot, especially since I have no decent fury gear.
---
You can get it back with item restore man
---
Then your just bad.
---
I don't think consumables or anything engineered should be used. I think that anything that is not inherently a class skill or racial trait should not be used. 
---
Also, I would be fine with any &gt;15min CDs, as long as they are class skill or racial.
---
Unfortunately, our servers ratio has gotten worse since they opened transfers to us, but not away. The wrong faction is moving.
---
Rogues have a harder time getting in groups and raids and have less gold farming potential than locks.  Personally I love Rogue though fwiw.
---
The irony of it all is the point of that "meta" is that it's faster, yet they'll spend a million years looking for the "perfect" group, fuck everything up and take even more time wiping.  They have no idea why it's the meta, or what something being the meta even means.  Monkey see, monkey do.
---
Not if you are using the heroic strike trick. While heroic strike is held down you lose the duelwield penalty, which means your hitcap is 6%. Using a macro to do this you won't miss any attacks (except some mainhand hits in the case where you have to cancel heroic strike to save rage for BT/WW)
---
Not worth it. There is so many level 30-40 questing zones, plus SM farming when you want or if you get bored. Hell, you could do SM from 30-42 if you wanted. I would not do STV on a PvP server unless you want to be ganked. There's a reason people compare it to vietnam.
---
Drivers or overheating
---
Or the card itself...
---
We have warlock gear drop all the time and all the warlocks don't want it.
---
How do I level herbalism effectively? I have gatherer and the data installed so I can see where they should be spawning but they aren't there 90% of the time. I'm at 92 and I'm currently trying to level it in hillsbrad and progress is so slow.
---
Crystal balls?
---
Only private server blowhards thought classic raiding was gonna be some crazy ball buster lol. Everyone else knew that especially in MC, there’s hardly even mechanics.
---
Either that or an Asgardian is about to arrive
---
That as well
---
“Alienware” found the issue lol
---
Darn I'm legitimately curious and it is actual security concern blizzard that should have been on.
---
Great video, you got some skills! I love the arcane crystal at the end, just a little salt in the wounds.
---
Do you mind sharing some of your macros?
---
Okay what was there in vanilla? nothing.
---
im looking to track when the procs happen, that way i dont cut off the melee swings with SS
---
Private server bullshit
---
I did full world buffs for the first time Tuesday. The stress on running through felwood looking for a songflower while running past all the horde and then fighting our way into the mountain made me go grey.
---
Have you tried playing some other games to see if there if the issue happen there? Or maybe a directx test video?

I, Coldgrin, am chief and protector of the Frostmane Trolls of Coldridge Valley.

This is great for experience, but one possible qualm is in later dungeons, when people are serious about pre-raid BiS, the spriest and lock are competing for loot.  If all I'm in an instance for is loot, I ask the priest if they are rolling on shadow gear just in case - not to reserve or judge their build, but simply I just don't want to run a 3 hour instance hoping on a rare drop if my chance of actually using it is cut in half.
---
When I tank strat I usually mark the casters with skull x and specifically tell any melee/hunters to burn the casters first meanwhile I’ll gather the melee and tab sunder so they can be aoe’d. much less chaotic than trying to run around dazed peeling everything off the clothies.
---
No, lol.
---
Which I think is bull, personally. Posting things with a 1c bid and 10g buyout when most auctions of that item are 5g should be punished since it makes it so damn hard to actually put stuff up for auction. I understand a mistake might happen so I think the best way to handle it is to make you unable to take down an auction after it's been bid on, just like how I can't take my bid down after I bid on something.

I’ll tell you what

We had a Restoration Druid

A shadow priest

Protection warrior

Retribution paladin

And

A hunter

And I’ll say this that group could have taken down anything. It was cool as fuck.

Not sure why anyone would transfer off of blammo though.

No queue, decent faction balance, economy/population is fine, etc.

You're not wrong, that's basically it.

Welcome to a 16 year old game.
---
you can access the library from DM North as any class, solo, if you have the key or can pick/blow the lock.
---
zone in, wait for ogre next to ramp to pat away
---
jump on left handrail of ramp down to courtyard
---
jump from there to ledge above courtyard floor on left
---
follow ledge to door
---
unlock door
---
you're in the library
---
Yes, ElvUI used to have a backdoor.
---
The author coded it so that he (and anyone who knew the commands) could make other characters perform various actions without their knowledge.  He would just issue the commands to his copy of ElvUI and the recipient's copy of ElvUI would action them.
---
The author claimed he only added the backdoor for testing purposes so that he could test out features without having to constantly ask people to do things.  Instead, he could just get their characters to do things himself thereby saving lots of time and hassle.
---
I can see why that would be useful so I'm inclined to believe the author was telling the truth.. at least, at first.  But I think over time the author started to have fun (who wouldn't) and that's when it started getting noticed by the community.  After an outcry, the author removed the backdoor.
---
ElvUI is a decent UI replacement if that's what you want but many people just want to enhance the default UI so ElvUI is overkill.  It's also quite frustrating that ElvUI is not available on CurseForge/Twitch App like practically every other addon in the world is.
---
I don't really understand anything about this thread, I'm a dumb cunt asking questions and getting down voted for it, fuck me right
---
People in vanilla didn't go into mc and clear it in one day.
---
&gt; Did you not actually listen to what he said? He said raw gold is about half of what he makes
---
So, it's just the title that is totally misleading.
---
Want to change it?
---
Build your own groups.
---
Don't wait to be invited, use the /who feature to find people and classes you're interested in grouping with. Ill often go out of my way to invite Druid tanks and Shaman healers just to give em some love. I don't mind a slower clear speed, it makes the instance more interesting. 
---
Be the change you want to see in the World of Warcraft.
---
99% chance to hit: Misses
---
I know people that tried to play Vanilla like that, I didn't. 15 years later I'm still playing, and they've been done for 14 years.
---
You'd lose DPS but if you want to go that way for flavor or loot competition reasons you'll still be competitive in raids. Don't forget DM opens up Distracting Dagger and Mugger's Belt, as well as Satyr's Bow.
---
&gt;My thoughts - I think it boils down to preference at this small discrepancy of stats... basically will Daggers affect my out of raid experience, e.g. WPVP, Farming, BRD Runs, etc
---
Combat isn't ideal for PvP, so I'd say unchanged. You'd want to keep Thrash in your bag for farming/questing.
---
A buddy was spending all kinds of money buying gear off the AH, he's in the 20's.
---
"Do you have enchanting?"
---
"No, mining/skinning. Why?"
---
Westfall, love killing defias
---
That would be extremely painful...
---
For that you can use Miks scrolling combat text (you can disable the combat text), that one does big text thing when you get a proc. Alternatively you can make a Weakaura for it.
---
Ya we had one hunter in our MC on my ally guild. One out of 37 people
---
I managed to get 14 on a certain pserver, so it doesn’t quite feel legit to me. I haven’t been flipping much in classic so far, so my current record is only 6
---
Nice work
---
We are farming dm east in a 3-stack. In 17min aswell with 4 bosses and ~30g/h depending on our luck.
---
Totally different, one is IRL other not.
---
It did used to have a backdoor and it was very much in the news at the time.
---
Thanks for sharing your thoughts on Firemaw, I'm looking to start playing but will only be able to do so next month, even though I have friends playing on Firemaw, I thought it would be just like you described (Have heard other people say the same thing about the few MOST populated realms) so I've been considering Ashbringer/Zandalar tribe instead, haven't really heard anything negative about them, only positive things like 50/50 A/H ratio (or really close to it.) 
---
Might just end up on Firemaw anyway to play with friends tho, it's so hard to decide!
---
Sure they did once it was on farm. But if not, then 2 days, does having that one extra raid day really make this game go from "omg there's nothing to do raidlog all the time"   to "wow so exiciting always something to do"?
---
I am a rogue and have read a few times now that you can do dm tribute runs together with a druid. Is this really possible and what kind of gear/spec does the druid need? I am combat specced and have mostly preraid bis except for weapons.
---
Most of my characters are on the PVE server. 
---
I just created a character on Arugal to try out PVP.
---
Having a great time running around on the PVE server.
---
If it dropped in a raid you have two hours to trade it. If not you can have him open a GM ticket but it's unlikely that any action will be taken.
---
If he took it intentionally there's no recourse.
---
The logic remains the same
---
My guild and I have done this a few times, I usually just tell someone to run into him first to eat the conflag and he's usually dead by the time the second goes off.
---
The real trick is a raid never really needs a second resto druid.
---
I thought about doing this! Glad someone is :P
---
Only games I play are classic and league. League works fine. So does that mean it’s an over heat issue?

I don't, which is why I play on a US server- realistically, with the game time I have, I'm never going to hardcore raid, so the time difference doesn't bother me (indeed, often when I play at night I have little to no competition for quest items, rares etc). I save my dungeon runs for saturday mornings, when I have a few consecutive hours, and there are people from the US on (5pm - 8pm eastern).
---
Simple solution - don't. As an affliction lock, I'm constantly spreading siphon life and corruption dots on everything. I tap just to keep my health lower so those dots can tick it back up. If I'm under 20% in combat then I could use a low grade heal. But in between pulls, I have bandages and food, same as you.
---
On longer raid fights, this is a core mechanic of locks - we have shit for spirit and mp5, but we can tap and keep shadowbolt spamming long after a mage goes oom. 
---
It's really funny when you're with a priest who hasn't been around locks much and you get bubbled.
---
Get engineering,  it adds a lot to pally play. 
---
My rotation is gathering around 3 mobs ( I'm level 36) , then drop conscencrate. Throw stun grenade.  Then keep up seal of judgement and whatever level of conscencrate seems prudent.  Judge if necessary. I use it sparingly to keep up mana.  
---
I use ret aura of course and Blessing of Wisdom.
---
Currently using thermapluggs shield and an iron shield spike ( I'm poor) which together add between 100-200 damage a fight.
---
Between grenade cooldowns I grab smaller packs and drink if necessary. 
---
Found this route pretty entertaining.
---
Also an idiot would never admit they have been an idiot.  They would just continue pretending they're not an idiot, thereby making them an even bigger idiot.

AND YOU?

Best to just have the paladin group up and run them around to power through quests.

groan, but still liked it

A hunter class quest that was basically a rite of passage for them.
---
Lots of Horde you're saying? I'll take your word for it as I've not been to too many high level zones yet, but as a Horde in most contested 30-40 zones there's usually a great mix of Horde and Alliance. I get ganked plenty, even when I'm in a group.
---
Last night I was running around in Ashenvale and I was outnumbered by Alliance but we helped each other quest - I didn't get ganked :)
---
The epic hunter questline, it requires you to kill 4 really tough demons without a pet or help from others. Takes alot of preparation and precision, the smallest fuckup means a redo of the kill.
---
If you install and update with Twitch App, not only is it really easy but it also installs the prerequisite addons too.  It's really useful.
---
To quote some guy below:
---
&gt; The hunter joins your group, you do everything solo, and they loot the head
---
As long as there's only one person doing it, the demon is happy, I guess.
---
I got this trinket on my very first BRD run as the tank. Very, very happy about that! Grats on yours! Enjoy!
---
I really get it but you could NOT macro it.

Reminds me of the summer of 2001, on EverQuest I had a 16 enchanter I was dicking around on outside blackburrow and pl'd a necromancer from lvl 5 to lvl 7 while chatting and hanging out. I didn't log on that enchanter again until 2010 when I took a break from wow and decided to check the state of things in eq (I'd heard they might be shutting the game down) and within 30 seconds of logging on, some maxxed out Necro msgs me and invited me to a group. That guy 9 years later remembered me and pl'd me to whatever the high level was. I just couldn't believe he held a torch after all that time, truely it blew my tiny little mind. (I quit quit eq a few months later..  went back during pandaria ((I hated that whole xpac.. fuck pandas we could have had Naga as a race is bliz was so thirsty for China money)) in 2014 and didn't see him, neither did I see him when I again revisited eq at the tail end of legion 2017. Hope your doing good my Necro friend).

"weapon normalisation" is in classic.
---
Your slam and your mortal strike, your whirlwind,... All goes of normalised damage, making both pretend to be a 3.3 weapon speed in calculation when doing any of those, making weapon speed not really matter all that much at that point there.
---
Im not sure if it was viable in vanilla but tbc I leveled as prot paladin. Takes more focus to down 3+ mobs at once and lots of fun. Downside is single Target is even slower than ret
---
your graphics card is on its way out buddy sorry. you gotta replace it
---
Underrated comment.
---
It could be. I have burned through a few cards before in desktops and they did very similar things. I would definitely start with trying to reinstall drivers, then maybe see if you can find a good diagnostic tool to test your graphics card.
---
Yea I do but I was looking for long term bags not ten slots that won’t last that long. Some people helped me out I got some 14 slots I just needed someone with the sewing skills. I just wasn’t having any luck for a week trying to ask high levels and my cash is low so I could only afford half of the big bag on AH. But a nice guy helped me out! Sorry for the post seemed like people don’t like boobs asking for help
---
ElvUI has notes in the changelog that there were license issues with Healcomm (the addon used by all of these UI packets to communicate heals between healers) and that they are working to get the issue resolved.
---
I assume Grid is having the same issue? Give it a week or two and we’ll see how it works out.

You mentioned Leatrix Plus and Wide Quest Log - Leatrix Plus includes wide quest log, it's in Interface menu.
