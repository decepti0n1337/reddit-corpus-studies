Blizzard got a C&amp;D from Gummy?
---
---
---
Hmm I could be have a r/mandelaeffect
---
There is no true 'Disc' spec in vanilla. It is a utility tree designed to enhance both shadow and holy as a sub-tree to spend extra points to gain efficiency and mana regen as well as a stronger fortitude buff.
---

---
There is a PI spec, which does appear to be a Disc spec in that it takes the capstone talent, but it plays just like a Holy based spec with the exception of buffing a caster with extra damage every 3 minutes.
---
Typically you want to spec down to divine spirit in disc, and down to spiritual healing in holy, 21/30.
---
GET IN MAW BELLY!
---
Always say on the main road in Duskwood.  Nothing bad ever happens there.
---
How do you get a beta invite? You have to resub? Is there a sign up list or something?
---
If auto loot existed in the TBC pre patch then that was still apart of Vanilla. Making the #nochanges argument for autolooting invalid.
---
That is simply not true though. I don't like BfA but 15v15 doesn't make stuff crash. Loads of groups were doing world bosses in Legion (only played it early) and it was lagless with 40 people. During a PvP event we had it it didn't start to lag till it was like a 160 man or so brawl, which has always run like a piece of doggo turd stinking in the sun.
---
All of the troll cities I have a soft spot for. Hinterlands and desolace.
---
While horde bases may be smaller, they are 100x more strategically placed. Only real exception is black rock mountain which we still have kargath.
---
All horde starter zones are essentially connected. And even silver pine to the barrens is only 1.5 zones away thanks to how op the zepplins are.
---
Its absolutely trivial for horde to get to both BB and Grom Gol due to the zepplins and the ratchet boat. This also means trolls and orcs can literally jump the wall and get ratchet, BB, xroads, camp T and TB FP at level 1 and hearth back. Tauren and rogues can do similar but takes maybe 5-10 more minutes.
---
Also the barrens is totally uncontested, and horde "control" silverpine, and the northern half of 1kn, while alliance only have neutral tarnaris and salt flats, so far less quests as many horde chains continue down there.
---
Desolace we also have a much easier time getting to and not one, but two towns that are far better placed. It also makes getting to Mara 10x easier. Access to SM, RFK, and RFD too by comparison is also trivial. Dead mines is easy to get to even at low levels by jumping off the zepp and swimming, and for DM we have a town just south of it.
---
Horde 4  lyfe
---
Say no more. Fk... someday they'll find a cure for that.
---
You’re right - I mixed up the name of the two talents. I personally don’t think spiritual healing is a very good talent, as the 10% healing you gain is from the base heal - it does not factor in your +healing. In my opinion, the 10% increased mana is better to have. I do agree that spiritual healing can be good early on when in prebis or below.
---
QUICK, SOMEONE CALL THE HYDRAXIAN WATERLORDS (ftfy)
---
PI/SW spec really guts your healing. I speak from experience. It's too much sacrifice for utility. Pick one and let a different priest do the other.
---
I want classic wow the stay the same. What i want done differently is instead of BC being the next expansion a different expansion comes out with new lore and you stay on azeroth.
---
Depends on the class. Extra adds while running as a mage make pretty much no difference. Aggro 3 extra mobs as a warlock though and it's gonna be a pain (before you get Howl at least).
---
ok I'll bite, how?
---
This is counter productive to efficiently leveling. You want to kill shit on the way to your destination. You have to grind mobs eventually better off doing it in transit from point to point.
---
1: How much time do you have? You're going to lose more time playing on a PvP server due to ganks slowing your leveling progress down if you aren't planning to poopsock to 60. Even if you did poopsock, if you ever created more toons on that server, they will get ganked and camped until you log out.
---
2: Although people are saying PvP brings more hardcore players, PvE servers will have no problem downing raid bosses.
---
So you agree then in classic, based on patch 1.12 that horde is much better in hinterlands with raventusk village.
---
me too
---
This pretty much
---
Yeah, once we’re living the dream, we’ll need a place to talk about Classic while we’re not playing Classic.
---
Right, and the first people downloading it, will be the ones who didn't want it.
---
PI and SW, pick one. Both in 1 priest means they will be a poor healer no matter what they do.
---
PI is overrated, but still worth having. SW is stronger than PI, but there's a limit of one per raid and you are a weaker healer than the PI spec.
---
Ideally you would have a full blown restore ret and a damage based Ele set.
---
The spec heals just fine with good healing gear.
---
Better than what?  The Alliance base at the other end of the zone?  No, that's absurd.  You have to walk clear through the entire zone to get to the quest hub.
---
Yeah, but no one mentioned aoe loot.
---
We talking about auto loot.
---
If you're an alliance Priest, and you're not a Dwarf you have fucked up
---
I do believe it would be like betas for new expansions - make sure you're signed up for it on the blizzard website &amp; im not sure if you need an active sub.
---
Please, this.
---
I mentioned AOE loot, because there is no reason to talk about autoloot.  Autoloot was in 1.9.  Why on earth wouldn't it be in the game?  It's been in WoW for 14 years.
---
I hate that I get downvoted to infinity for mentioning how great classic wow was compared to the Ion shit show going on rn
---
I'm trying to choose between Hunter and Rogue.
---
I will play maybe 70% pve 30% pvp. Now i never really played the raids as i started Classic about 2 months before TBC.
---
* Will i have a hard time getting into raids etc with Hunter or Rogue?
---
* Which one feels more fun in raids etc? (More clicking less AFKing)
---
* Are both Classes good in PvP? Or are Hunters bad.
---
Most of them will fall off pretty quick. A lot of people like the idea of tanking, but dont actually enjoy it.
---
We get nothing new.  If we're lucky we'll get a reworked balanced tbc
---
Sure skinning is not very profitable... But it is profitable.  You can't take herbalism and mining because you can only track one at a time.  And the other professions are money sinks.  So there really is no downside to take skinning, since you will be gathering the mats for free anyways.  Skinning just basically makes mobs drop 10% to 15% more gold, which is good.
---
All I want is my Flag of Ownership.  My wife got it for me for Christmas one year.  It is the most hilarious item to use.
---
Naw if anything that would have lessened kill times in tbc. Bugged bosses in tbc got hotfixed very quickly compared to vanilla. The other stuff you mentioned is mostly nonsense.
---
I imagine it'd be Priest/Pally for Alliance. I'm very torn between Paladin or Shaman. I had a DPS character in one of the first three iterations of the game, and it was still fun, but god dammit it was so much harder to get gear and secure a raiding spot.
---
When I healed, I could more or less just get into whatever guild that was raiding around my item level, and when I tanked it wasn't uncommon to get people asking you to join their raiding group/guild.

As a dedicated 1-60 speed runner I’m going to put down a different message:  
---
  
---
Your ideal levelling pace is what works for you.  
---
It took me a year to get say 1-20 down to 10 hours and another to get it down below 8. That took a lot of route planning and a heap of runs.  
---
I would never expect those kinds of times from a non speed runner. PBs are personal and if you have a PB that you beat that’s plenty enough of a great result.
---
I think the issue is that people confuse AOE Loot with AUTO Loot
---
That is about one of the craziest things I have ever read in my life.
---
I'm glad it seemed to work out for you back then, I would NEVER have thought that one!
---
There will never be too many. Tanks will always be able to find a group whenever they please.
---
Did this in MC and BWL in vanilla. Made bank and geared my alt rogue well. With loot trading in raids it'll be even easier.
---
Funny coming to this post after reading the one that’s supporting developer mental health. Dudes in there saying they’ll gladly wait a month or two extra so guys don’t have to work with an IV going into them.
---
Then you have this dude on a hunger strike until the game gets released.
---
If you do the math it's pretty underwhelming, but it's still useful if you get into deeper raid theory.
---
im part of the 1%
---
minority squad
---
You don't need a ton of gold for naxx.
---
Need some help?
---
No... ? I lost over 50lbs in 2 months while my lifts have gone up.
---
You’re fine: at least we have some documented ideal but achievable times from vanilla. From my own experience though be cautious about pserver times especially for speed running min/max as they won’t reflect what should happen in classic, at least for optimum pathing strats and times.
---
He’s suggesting that Sunwell was much more difficult. The bosses being up over twice as long, despite years more experience from players, suggests that is true.
---
Generally the speed running community doesn’t accept an excessive amount of /rested in a valid fast time.
---
SW doesn’t have a harbor in Vanilla. It was Menethil.
---
Because Memes
---
Dude, this sounds like a great way to make them hesitate on releasing info. We've been spoiled; Blizz has given so much "real" love to this project. Don't bite the hand that feeds. Or I guess anything else if you're on a hunger strike.
---
Pitchforks at the ready
---
Avoid: Hunters, shadow priest, warlocks
---
Skill match-ups: Mages, Rouges
---
Everything else gets pooped on
---
thats literally my point, designing an mmo with the idea being to aoe kill most npcs while lvling is boring design.
---
rather it be 1/2 mobs where you need to avoid their fast aoes, interrupt stuff, use cooldowns etc.
---
Oceanic Hype!
---
Not a vanilla feature, shift loot isn't the same as auto loot, some people don't even know it exists.
---
No QoL changes.
---
No I get it, you're speccing deep into disc not for prayer of spirit nor PI but for 10% bonus to mana rfl.
---
Why would you need another one?
---
a. you forgot to switch accounts. b. Eredar twins not twin emps you idiot.
---
YAAAAASSSSSSSDD
---
Was going to say this. Everything to and from DIES.
---
Mage is by far easier to play, however, locks win the match-up against mages, but mages imo are more fun in pvp
---
Yeah, a lot of those skeletons will definitely be mine.
---
I must be missing something. There's only a handful of corpses. I shouldn't be able to see the ground around Nesingwary's at all.
---
So 100 push-ups and 1000 sit-ups in the first two hours, and then occasionally from then on
---
I pay a similar amount for my 500/500 connection, but that includes TV and telephone. Without TV and telephone it would be €50 for the same connection. I live in the Netherlands, and here the best price/bandwidth ratio that can be had is[€105 for 10Gb/10Gb, followed by €42 for 1Gb/1Gb](https://www.tweak.nl/nieuws/prijsverhoging-2018.html). Both uncapped, though I believe the 10Gb one has got a FUP. Well it's enough to open a number of Ron's Coffee shops (please don't do this to anyone reading). But that provider offers those speeds in a few tiny municipalities in the Netherlands, and wherever else in the country is FTTH offers the regular price/bandwidth ratios I mentioned earlier.
---
Fk people here make me both glad with what I've got, but also depressed about the state of the world. Those 2 Mb/s connections are horrible. I'd rather live in a slum and have FTTH speeds than live in some tropical resort with dial-up.
---
Care to elaborate?
---
&gt; you need to avoid their fast aoes, interrupt stuff, use cooldowns etc
---
You literally don't need to do any of that if you just pull one mob at a time and you never have to to pull more than one.
---
If you wanna make things harder on yourself by pulling multiple mobs, that's fine, but it doesn't make the actual game hard. Again, just because I cannot solo MC, doesn't make it hard.
---
You are never required to develop any particular skills (aka "git gud") to make it to lvl 60.
---
There were more, but when I went back to take a picture some had disappeared.
---
A regular routine that fits into your life before and after WoW - no reason you can't get 30 minutes of exercise that you enjoy 5 times a week

!
---
Auto loot off: shift click everything until you have a few bag slots left. Then single click.
---
Auto loot on: single click everything until you have a few bag slots left. Then shift click.
---
With auto loot available or unavailable you'll be doing the same shit just in a different order.
---
I'm all for no changes but this isn't even a QoL change. It's a "are you going to hold shift to loot first or later?" change.
---
Yeah, the mail shoulders look amazing.
---
Stabimcballz
---
RunningBull as a tauren works because of their culture,right?
---
They hate their pinkies, that's why. They desire carpal tunnel from pressing shift every time you loot.
---
Horde 100% has better city locations for leveling and travelling throughout 1-60. 
---
Alliance gets a location advantage at 60. IF/SW are so close to MC, BRD, UBRS, LBRS, BWL etc. Darnassus is a great spot to fly out to Winterspring/Azshara (I know Horde has an easy time to get here too, but it's not too bad for Alliance at 60 if they grab a mage port first).
---
Yeah ret paladins were not good in vanilla. Prot were not great either. 
---
I'd say ret didn't actually get good until you started playing in WOTLK.
---
You would probably want to play an arms warrior or something like that.
---
Why do you think they added Ultrasafe Transporter?
---
Uh, might help to specify. I and everyone else assumed twin emps because comparing Sunwell to... nothing... doesn’t say anything at all. We gave you the benefit of the doubt and tried to infer a point.
---
I have no personal experience so feel free to dismiss my opinion outright.
---
From what I have seen and read regarding the topic.  It does not really matter how good or geared the tank is for dw fury tanking... But it it mostly on the dps and healer gearing.  You absolutely do not need to dw fury tank so long as your dps are not geared enough to pull threat from you. Since the dps can't pull threat from you, they by definition also will kill the boss slowly so you will need more mitigation to last longer in the fight ( since you need to keep your healers from going oom). 
---
Dw fury tanking looks to only occur once the dps are strong enough to start pulling aggro, so you need to up your own threat.  Since the dps are doing more damage, fights are faster and the healers can spend more Mana per minute keeping you alive without a shield.
---
I'm gonna be too busy playing it

Tfw me playing warcraft 3 and super Mario 3 this week is just nostalgia
---
There is no barbershop in Vanilla.
---
The slim pet is from Wrath of the Lich King, Sholazar Basin.
---
Yeah if you dont like pulling / kiting you are not going to like it.
---
They hate their pinky finger, that's why. They desire carpal tunnel from pressing shift every time you loot.
---
But what you're describing is AoE looting, which is different from Auto looting. Auto looting means you don't have to click every item in the window to loot it, it just slurps the loot into your inventory in one click. It used to have to take holding the Shift key to perform it. I advocate for the removal of that requirement and just have it be a single right-click. I don't care if they do or don't put AoE looting in, just as long as I don't have to hold Shift to auto-loot so I don't develop a sore pinky every fucking play session.
---
Hang in there, bud. There's a lid for every pot.
---
you forgot the magic word &gt;!UwU!&lt;
---
They already enforce this on retail rp servers, no reason to believe they wouldn't on classic.
---
Oh people care about good blizzlike pservers. Don't kid yourself.
---
There's just not enough interest for changes outside of a handful of trolls who can't be bothered to understand this.
---
Simple as.
---
[removed]
---
You're right.  I completely forgot that healing and damage % were treated differently.
---
Imagine being OP when Classic got revealed at Blizzcon. Yikers
---
I remember my server had large Quebecois population and progressively doing dungeons with the same french speaking people. It made me want to study french
---
Probably because they don't know the release date yet?
---
That green slime you're refering to might be the Disgusting Oozling, a rare drop pet / critter
---
Because they are developing classic and 8.2 at the same time. They don't know when they will be ready and they want to stagger the releases.
---
Dang I wanted to RP as my favorite hearthstone player
---
Yeah I'm not talking about speedrunning. Many people like playing efficiently and getting to 60 with a low /played, even if they can only play 1-3 hours a day. These people will be getting to 60 with under 5 days player even if it takes them 3-4 months easily with the benefit of rested.   
---
Getting a low /played isn't really a competitive way to play because if it was it would just who could abuse mob tagging/rested the most anyway. Racing to 60 in real time has a similar problem where if anyone actually cared about it that much the winner will just be a team of 3 people playing super efficiently and rotating shifts, maybe with 3 hours off every 24 hours so no one can tell if it's one person or not. As long as the three players are half decent they would easily beat a Joana or whatever record that has to play through sleep deprivation for a week.
---
give him a quick tug too, he needs it
---
as a regular person, I think I'd rather just go to the furry convention than comic con
---
This is hard because we also have to consider if we talking about undergeared or overheated, group or solo, world pvp or bgs
---
That's the spirit(healer)!
---
Stop. Now the next blue post is going to be about the conventions and restrictions of names in  RP servers instead of release dates.  Thanks.
---
When did they say it would be “early summer?” Or ever lead us on that it would be coming sooner than sometime in the summer?
---
Probably cooler since the game was barely playable the first few days afaik
---
4 str, 4 stam, leather belt Uhh guhhh
---
They gave us the alpha announcement at almost midnight on Good Friday
---
These should be banned for pugs, in my opinion.  You get way too many tickets from these sort of runs (someone couldn't pay up,  leader took too big of a cut, spam, etc) I've seen a lot of abuse on this from pservers already until they were outright banned on a few.
---
No. Rp servers have superior sharding and I shouldnt have to abide by naming conventions to experience it.
---
Right because Twin Emps were up for 2 days. Right?
---
Every class is very different from one another, especially at endgame. But, you do get the commonalities of healers/melee/ranged dps/tanks. Some classes have similar abilities to one another but it is no where near as homogeneous as BFA.
---
Most of us refresh it every hour or so hoping for news, we are all a special breed 🤓
---
Must have been a slow day on a low pop server
---
Quite the treasure!  I’ve been reading the WoW Diary and this feels incredibly relevant to me right now. Thanks for sharing!
---
You used to be able to tame a slime as a pet.  There are/were a few things that would transform from one creature to the next during a fight, and if you were clever and lucky, you could snag them as a hunter pet.
---
That's right. Fuck me.
---
Darkshore was the end of many a night elf for me back in the day. I’d get through the first two zones and Darnassus with relative ease...but with little/no help, Darkshore was an absolute mess.
---
Whether you bring 5 or 20 guildies to Onyxia, the bottleneck will probably still be the amount of loot dropping.
---
Boomkin : Rated E for Everyone
---
I was saying that auto loot does not equal AOE loot, and would like to know what people have against auto loot, it being exactly like shift looting except no shift clicking. No Trolling anywhere in my post.
---
I just want a launch date announced so I can put in 2 weeks PTO in advance
---
Get off vent or I'll have you bent.
---
Hands down one of the raddest things I’ve seen in relation to World Of Warcraft!
---
Because they are from all regions around the world.
---
I mean I spent a fair share of my Vanilla time raiding. I raided on 2 toons in 2 different guilds. Did MC/BWL/ZG/AQ20 with 1 guild and BWL/AQ40 with another guild. But, most of my time was probably outside of raiding, getting mats and such. 
---
Even without the 1.12 Talents/Spells &amp; itemization, the top 10% guilds would have ripped through the content anyway.
---
Oh man, xplay memories. So good. Old games but I still feel like rewatching some eps lol
---
Yes,  but for most launches,  everyone gets on
---
Just send the Voidwalker to grab aggro on each but keep on running, always safe.
---
When announced to be releasing in Summer 2019, they said "We look forward to giving you a Classic Summer." You can't really have a Classic Summer if it releases at almost the end. When I refer to you having an awesome weekend, I don't mean that I hope only Sunday at 7p.m. is awesome for you.
---
Going rogue cause that's what i did 1st last time
---
I loved these. There used to be a wow millionaire on Proudmoore that did these weekly
---
You seem to have missed the part where blizzard will just remove classic from being a thing beacsue they dont have the time / resouces to put into updating the models.
---
I agree that they shouldn't listen to the people who want updated gear but I also dont think they should listen to the people who want updated models since they have BFA, I cant play old models there so why should we play new models here? 
---
&gt;If it's a toggle-able option, it shouldn't bother anyone; even if players whine that the newer models don't mesh.
---
Then how long till they remove the old models entirely like they have with live becasue peolpe who liked the new models kept complaining that people using the old models were not seeing their character as they wished them to be seen. If it was not for the dark past that we have already seen id have no issue with them.

This show was my jam every day after school.
---
Bonus healing doesn't scale with gear only base of spells. It's a good not great talent. Mental Strength scales with gear.
---
It is a totally valid talent choice for a progression guild who has longer fight durations due to weak dps.
---
26 points into discipline has no wasted points unless you really want to nitpick about Divine Spirit being a wasted talent. You are going at least 20 points into discipline regardless in any healing spec.
---
It's not my go to spec, but it's definitely viable at certain points of progression.
---
and yet you still don’t have a point
---
/s is hard
---
Not op but I can confirm that these look a LOT better on the phone than the link before. I think Imgur just doesn't play well with mobile anymore.
---
Laughing so hard I'm in stitches!
---
Ranks will depend on your gear, don't pay too much attention to the rank number. Instead look at the healing amount per cast and adjust your ranks as your gear improves.
---
Typically you want your default tank spam Heal to be around 800-1000 healing done in early gear. This will likely be rank 4 with low gear, and rank 2 with all epic good healing gear. Later you'll want this to be in the 1200-1400 range, and eventually it'll be replaced with Greater Heal Rank 1 I'll talk about below.
---
You also want a flash heal that does around 400-500 as your spam raid heal for early content. It's not as efficient as paladin Flash of Light, but it's the best tool for the job. Later you'll want to make sure your efficient flash is more in the range of 800-900 as people's health pools increase. Also keybind max rank flash heal for emergencies, but resist using it as it costs a LOT!
---
Renew of any rank below max is a waste of a cast and keybind. You won't cast it often, because it's not that great for efficiency and most of it will go to overheal anyway. When you really need something substantial to heal while you are moving though, it's good to have max rank renew in your back pocket.
---
Greater heal max rank is worth keybinding to go with inner focus and for the rare occasion you need to bomb large heals. Rank 1 greater heal is typically too expensive to use in low gear, but becomes the staple heal in higher end gear, especially with 8/8 T2 equipped since you get a free rank 5 renew attached to your greater heals (same power renew no matter which rank of greater heal you use).
---
You'll want max rank prayer of heal bound for fights like Vael and phase 1 Nef (he does a big shadow bolt volley). Whole healing strats can be designed around this powerful spell, but it is expensive and sometimes difficult to utilize well.
---
While not a heal, you'll want to key bind shield, but it isn't great in vanilla. Treat it like max rank flash heal. Emergency only, costs a lot of mana for what it does, but it is the fastest response biggest 'heal' that can save a life.
---
You can complete all vanilla content with just those 8 healing spell keybinds. 1 rank of Heal (replaced by GHeal 1 later), one rank of renew, 2 ranks of flash, 1 (then 2) rank of GHeal, prayer of heal, and shield. You can certainly get fancier if you want, but this will do the job. Keep in mind you have other spells to bind like dispel magic and abolish disease among other things, so don't make it so complicated you can't remember your binds.
---
Don’t be quick to think that just yet, those number will quickly drop after classic comes out

The Legendary Crusaders From Alleria
---
I was 10 years old at the time!
---
&gt; how structured backups a company will have for 10+ year old data no longer in use. 
---
But it wasn't 10+ years when people first started to campaign for vanilla servers. Considering how disk space is basically free to such huge companies it definitely seems weird to that they didn't have at least are major patches saved in version control or a backup of one. I mean fuck companies tend to store even completely meaningless things like receipts of toiletpaper purchases for long ass times, let alone the whole basis of your company like source code.
---
We sound impatient because it’s been about a year and a half and there’s just not a lot of news so there’s not much else to talk about
---
That poor guy on the hunger strike...probably only doing 75% damage by now.
---
But once that news comes, it’ll be golden. They wouldn’t give it all away now
---
N
---
You don't because it's an awful spec, and for the reason you state. You are stuck with flash and renew being your only useful heals.
---
If you want to be PI spec, let a different priest be Holy/Shadow Weaving. Don't try to do both PI and Shadow Weaving in the same character.
---
Gold plated maybe
---
Twink items will sell more when people have more gold and demand for twinkle later on when done the current progression.
---
When you go to sell your items, look up what they are used for and think to yourself if is there a demand now/later. 
---
Swim speed+ water breathing potions (Many guides like Joana’s require you to buy from AH for multiple quests)
---
uhh....by that logic, we should have 41 point talents, Summoning stones, draenei and BE should be in the character creator (but never usable), the Azuremyst isle dock at Auberdine, shaman/paladin gear should drop for both sides, all the spell changes from 2.0.1 should introduced etc etc, High Warlord only cost honor and pvp ranks removed.
---
The prepatch WAS TBC.
---
the only difference between 2.0.1 and the official release is that you could actually buy the expansion. If you didn't buy the expansion you were still functionally the same as the people did, you just could make a Draenei/BE or visit outland and your level was still capped at 60.
---
Oh my God.  New battleground.   100player free for all.
---
Bears don't like bubble either. Bears have exactly two attacks: Swipe and Maul. Swipe is weak on single target, while Maul prevents them from getting rage from auto attacks. They need to use Maul on every attack to hold threat. So if you bubble a bear, then he doesn't get any rage from dealing damage *or* taking damage.
---
Bubble should be an emergency / situational spell in Vanilla. Nothing more.
---
Flash heal is quite useful when down ranked. Often at the beginning of raiding, such as in MC, raid damage will be in the 500-1000 range per person. Winding up a big Heal rank 4 will take longer and probably end up in overheal due to someone else landing a faster heal, or just be too large for the job required.
---
In low gear, aim your flash heal to hit for about 500 and it will be efficient enough to use regularly for raid healing. For tank healing you do want to stick with a rank of Heal that hits for about 1000.
---
Thanks for the response, these were just some of the ideas that I was juggling in my head, basically just to save money on respecing. 
---
I don’t really have a problem going deep holy or deep prot to raid, i don’t mind playing fury warrior either, and I’ll also get prio on the loot 
---
I was just wondering if it was possible because I wasn’t very knowledgeable on the topic. 
---
I know during progression you wanna try to get everyone geared on their main specs first to help the raid as a whole, I just didn’t know how viable using tanking or healing as a means to get gear, or just spec dps and do it that way.  if a raid or guild needs something I have no problem supporting  
---
But like say I’m a holy pally, I could get paladin T1-2 and then when were waiting for the next phase of content to release I could respec and have some fun doing some BG’s or World pvp while we wait. After MC and BWL I might switch my focus to primarily PvP but until then I’m just weighing the options

Got anything for those of us who do physical labor for work?  I already get up at 5:30AM for work, I'm not about to go for a run before going and busting my ass all day.
---
Kind of a loaded question because the reality is that I burn a lot at work, but I over eat because my wife is a cook and makes damn tasty dinner for me every night and fuck me I want seconds.
---
Imagine the game if there were no battlegrounds and only world pvp. can only get grand marshall through world pvp. would be some badass world battles on cities. probably constant opposing factions in each city
---
The side of the bottle says Powerade.  Everything is going to be ok.  /s
---
They're not going to be committing enough GM man hours to classic for silly things like this... would be my assumption anyway.
---
Sounds like a large hill if its only 30 minutes up/down.
---
We did GDKP runs all the time in Wrath. It was hella fun, I'd return to those in a heartbeat. All items had a starting bid of 100g or something and people would openly bid gold - highest roll was given to a "banker" that held onto the gold and kept tally of it all and the item was ML'd over when payment was received. 
---
They were very open about how much was in the coffer - updates after every single boss was killed so no fishy shit would go on. At the end of the raid, everyone (and I mean **everyone**) got an even cut - no special points for top dps, healers, carriers, tanks, girls (yes, someone *tried* this...), officers, GMs, etc, none of that shit. 
---
Everyone was treated equally, everyone had to pay to win items, and everyone got equal splits. It was great. Sometimes you had people bidding on gear that they couldn't even use just to get more in the coffer (which was allowed), and I only saw one time where a guy bid on an item and didn't have the money for it. He was very quickly removed and replaced with someone else in our very long wait list.
---
Maybe I'm just biased because we had such a good group. I really did meet some of the funniest and greatest people in that group (also, some of the greediest and slimiest, but, you know.)

No one finds your autism jokes funny.
---
I am just impatient because I don't want to get blocked out of vacation days -.-
---
That's because this stuff is true.
---
If you arent a terrible player.  Yes you can wipe in instances if you pull more than you can handle.  This is even more true at lower levels because the classes have far less utility.  A mage or rogue at 60 can do so much more to save a group than they can at 22.
---
And a regular PvP realm for me. RP PvE servers are far too lewd.
---
Healing rotations (and breaks as you are describing) are a thing of the past. They were only a thing in vanilla because people didn't understand how to optimize.
---
Now the methods we use are to be casting all the time, with lower rank spells to achieve efficiency. If you are raid healing, you typically just let the spells fly. If you are tank healing, you cancel casts just as the spell is about to end if the tank doesn't actually need the heal. This way you have a moderate size heal ready to land faster than if you were to notice the tank was low on hp, then cast, then land on a tank that might be dead by then.
---
If you manage to chain enough cancels together you can get some solid spirit base regen going, but don't plan on it.
---
All of the Let Me In memes are so fitting for this subreddit, so I thought I'd try to make a parody of one of Vanilla's greatest anthems! I apologize for my crappy voice, I'm just a shitposter

It was rough to say the least...  and annoying as it was, the item-server lag causing your character to remain in the looting animation for minutes at a time, even while moving around, was pretty hilarious.  The ol' Loot Scoot.

---
I'm okay with them skipping a few things personally. Unpopular opinion. A blizzard OFFICIAL wow server with a few bugs still in it is way better than a private server that can and will shut down at some point. =D
---
Let me play officially right now and ill work through the bugs like I did 14 1/2 years ago.
---
Yeah but they've said they won't be committing many (if any?) GMs to classic. That's why there's some issues with what to do with looting, the GMs won't be stepping in to help with that
---
Moonwalk bank hopping was my jam.
---
Spriest at 1.12 endgame destroys all
---
When people talk about auto-loot they mean Auto-auto loot. The option that TBC added. (though in the modern client is this simply shortened to auto-loot, though until Pandaria it was still listed as Auto-auto loot).
---
Rains Fall and Eagle Flies are legit too. Any Native American names should be okay.
---
Lol. I worded that incorrectly. I meant to say I can't get her off my D
---
It's complicated. Balance is the only one of those specs that is close to viable in Naxx, but really all of those classes should be healing in Naxx. Raid damage is much higher and guilds will be scrambling to recruit healers if their hybrids do not convert. Those hybrids will not perform well in Naxx either, so it is in their interest to switch.
---
With that said, if they all end up healers, it doesn't really matter.
---
It should certainly go to a hybrid DPS first over healers if they put in the effort to be a good hybrid and are a good raider overall. If your hybrids are lazy sketchy players, give it to a good healer.
---
Under the right circumstances yeah, but you can respawn in wow so yolo is out and I have reason to believe you are in fact, not a swaglord so I'm sorry, no
---
"Whyyyyyy"
---
2 weeks PTO?  Jealous.
---
I'm back at a job where I get 1 week PTO after 1 year.
---
What? Why? Better itemization and class tuning didn't make leveling 6-7x faster compared to 1.0 
---
Yes, I'm sure 1.12 did speed up by a tiny bit (15% at the absolute most I would say), but it isn't that wild.
---
Interesting question but technically no? But I mean, Baine could be considered an uncommon human name. I know a guy legit called Blaize for Christ sake.

I think more than anything it's envy, they are Cata-MOP babbies and all theyve ever know about WoW was LFG tools and talent less talent trees but then they here us older guys reminisce about the good old days and they get irritated for what ever reason missing the boat, They think their Siege of Ogrimmar nostalgia was how WoW is supposed to be.

Theyre the casual who didnt have time to invest in seeing the late stage stuff and bitched and cried until Blizzard caved in with pampering the little girls puss puss with LFR, titan forged world quests and PVP rewards and it scares the shit out of them that CLassic ***GASP*** might be  smash hit, it might drive the sub numbers way the fuck back up and then what will Blizzard do!? Make their beloved retail amusement park ride more like Classic!? After all the bitching and whining it might return to those old days where they only had 2 hours a night to play but wasnt decked out in full NAXX tier!?

I always wished the best for everyone on Oceanic servers when WoW was a newer thing.  Loved the game and the cries for help were real on the official forums.
---
I disagree. If a hybrid is putting in the effort to perform well, they should be rewarded with first dibs on a quality dps item. They will likely switch to heals for Naxx anyway where the mace is still good until they can get a Faerlina mace or Thaddius staff.
---
One of the best things about early WoW was that things were released when they were ready.  Personally, I prefer quality over an early release.
---
How dare you question the lord of swag!
---
I'm sorry but you're missing the point. The point isn't that you can't make it easy on yourself by doing specific shit, the point is, if you wanted to do at a reasonable pace you generally needed to be good enough to position well, do decent dmg, use hp pots etc.
---
Now don't get me wrong, the examples of interrupts, move out of aoe etc, where stuff new games do and stuff I feel has potential to make it more fun, but right now, most games just don't punish you enough when you fail or it's simply too slow for you to ever actually get hit. 
---
In modern day wow, even if you pull everything, its either double or not double, and finding the magic number of mobs that you can do it, is pretty much the only factor(with some obvious variations based on their spells and stats). 
---
Meanwhile in vanilla WoW, it was generally, pull 1 mob, is fine, pull 2 mobs, is double, pull 3 mob, eh we might die, we might not, its gonna require some kiting, cooldowns and so fourth. Pull 4 mobs, its auto run for life. 
---
Like that aspect of pulling 1 extra mob making such a huge diffrence, made the game way more exciting and engaging, because you had to be careful about your positioning, who you pulled and when(incase of patrols). Meanwhile now, I require nearly zero brain power to kill anything. Even monsters they 'Recommend' as 2/3 players is very easy to do as a solo if you're not completely incompetent.
---
Is RP-PvP an option?
---
I've never understood what makes an RPG. In some RPG games (JRPG and say, Assassins Creed Odyssey) you play as a character and RP them and in others like WoW you make your own character to RP. Is every game an RP game really? If I play Overwatch (pve story mode at least) am I technically RPing in an FPS?
---
Tier lists are kind of hard, because classes scale differently depending on gear, and on top of that some classes counter others. 
---
For example, Warlocks are generally strong, but are weaker on Alliance side (Fear and WotF) and also weak against warriors (can pop fear immunity). 
---
Similarly, Warriors are amazing with R14 or equivalent weapons.  But in dungeon blue weapons they are significantly less powerful.
---
Agreed.
---
I rewatch the original Bladerunner about every year.  Aliens the same.  I love Super Nintendo games.
---
Are they a thing for me because of nostalgia?  Sure.  They're also great and I love them!
---
All ya’ll talking about losing weight, try two things:
---
Don’t eat bread for two weeks. No sandwiches, no croutons on salads, no chip, no nothing bread or breaded.
---
Cut out soda forever.
---
In my WoW heavy days I was also, no surprise, my heaviest (220 at 5’9”). And I worked at a gym 😳 (true story)
---
But I cut soda out entirely, and did the no bread challenge for two weeks. I’ll tell you right now, I’ve never felt better. I don’t drink soda anymore, maybe one a year, and I’ve really cut out bread for the most part. It does wonders fellas
---
It's interesting to see this topic from the horde perspective. I'd also lean shaman, but it is closer than on alliance. Paladins can't use staves so they are limited to maces (and caster dps swords) exclusively. Paladin would definitely get the nod above priest or druid on that faction.
---
Another aspect to this is that the shaman can get use from this mace for solo grinding/farming, while priests can just convert their staff to Anathema for grinding sessions.
---
Shut up and gimme the game.
---
Murderer! Guilty!
---
Haha. Man. It was surreal when I think about it. All that time wasted and the abuse of my health. This time around I won't be nearly as bad. I'll be hanging with the captain a little and maybe the black bat.
---
&gt;This is hard because we also have to consider if we talking about undergeared or overgeared, group or solo, world pvp or bgs
---
Not to mention the context. For exmaple: if a warrior is out farming or mining or whatever and gets caught off guard - he's dead. If a warrior is grouped with a healer in BGs - you're dead.
---
Its true, I have this argument with people ask the time. The pre-patch is the expansion because it contains all of the features.
---
I’m not saying this to be an asshole, but you have to do this research yourself. There’s too many things to consider such as leveling ability, group PVP, world PVP, dungeon PVE, raid PVE, farming, etc.
---
Ahh, gotcha thanks.
---
Druids can equip staves so they have more options than paladins. All else being equal I'd give it to a paladin over a druid over a priest.
---
Typical path for each class is this:
---
Paladin: Aurastone/Jindo - Lok'amir - C'thun/Faerlina
---
Priest: Benediction - AQ quest - C'thun/Faerlina/Thaddius
---
Druid: Aurastone/Jindo - AQ quest - C'thun/Faerlina/Thaddius
---
On horde side I'd agree that shamans and druids should be about equal since they can both equip staves and their upgrade path is identical.
---
Yes, very common. Nihilum had a list of items for sale on their forums.
---
Spiritual Healing (+10% healing) or Mental Strength (+10% maximum mana)? Does anyone have insight into what they prefer?
---
I'm leaning towards the +mana, because it means more heals cast (vs. overhealing wasting mana - although I guess this is addressed by casting the right rank heal).
---
One of my favorite moments from vanilla wow was coming over that Hill and seeing gadgetzan for the first time.
---
I was inspired [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/bh6qll/i_made_some_westfall_stew_from_the_wow_cookbook/), so I decided to try and increase my Cooking Skill.
---
This is why I think anything past 1-10 sharding will be horrible. I get that 1-10, it’s a concession we have to be willing to take. But I want to see the people in The Barrens and Westfall that I end up grouping with for a Deadmines or WC run.

What is the interaction with auto loot and pickpocketing?
---
I recently experienced this on another server where I created a mage and played the role of the SJW. I actually built up a reputation to the point where I had some people wanting to invite me to their guild and offering carries, while others would immediately kick me out of their group once one of their members recognized my name. I'm not quite that "woke" in rl but it was fun to challenge people's assumptions.
---
I can think of a couple reasons. The beta isn't out for testing and summer is one month away (this is not a good sign). Ideally the beta should be live right now... 
---
The least blizzard could do is announce a date. People want to no-life it for 1-2 weeks when it comes out which means taking time off work and scheduling around it. That's increasingly difficult to do for obvious reasons...
---
I remember the days when asking about legacy servers on forums would get you laughed at.  Waiting a few more months is easy.
---
Thanks for the info. It had been so long I couldn't remember and couldn't find a definite answer elsewhere.
---
Probably easier if you describe what sort of gameplay you're into then we tell you which classes/specs are closest to that
---
Just give us a fucking date. I’m not 12 like I was with true vanilla wow. Most of us are grow men dammit, and we need to request vacation time. I’ll take a few bugs, and hell vanilla still had bugs going into BC. I want a date so I can request time to play the game like most other people. We need to get a date!
---
There's nothing competitive about it, anyone putting the same amount of effort into a pure dps class would do more than double the dps of a paladin.
---
I sit at a computer all day, basically.
---
* Getting into raids with either class is difficult due to high number of players that play those classes. Generally, raids will bring a few more rogues to a raid than hunters. The amount of level 60 hunters on a server compared to how many of them gets brought along for raids is very disproportional, you really have to stand out at your class to get picked up. The same applies to the Rogue, but to a lesser degree.
---
* Rogue is slightly more difficult due to being in melee range. A hunter mostly just stays at safe range shooting away. That being said, Hunters have some responsibility in removing enrage on certain bosses. 
---
* Both classes are good at PvP.   
---
Hunters are considered by many as the kings of world PvP, if played at a high level. They also do very well in premades, often brought along to keep the mages of the opposing team in check.   
---
If the Hunter is king of world PvP, then the rogue is probably the prince. They can pick whichever battle they want, and simply skirts around those that are not in their favour. The only thing that counters a good rogue is a good hunter, and the broken orc racial :)
---
Fear ward is as good as advertised. It's unfortunate that it is only on one race, but that is the situation.
---
People often say you can just stance dance it, like you did, but many fearing encounters fear more often than the cooldown of berserker rage, leading to reliance on tremor totem on horde, and nothing at all on alliance side if you have no fear ward. If that fear is just 1 second too early, the tank my flee right into the raid and get half the group killed with a cleave/breath.
---
Fear ward is also strong for allowing tanks to focus on generating threat rather than dumping their rage for a fear immunity, swapping back and still not having rage for a second or two. This has huge implications in a focused high dps guild, allowing dps to continue pushing when a stance dancing guild might have to limit their dps.
---
The aspect you probably have not considered about fear ward is that if you have extra dwarf priests in the raid, you can cast fear ward on melee dps (rogue/feral), which will keep them on the boss instead of fleeing for several seconds, then running back, then resuming dps. This is a big pick up for personal dps and can be noticeable for total raid dps and clearing pace.
---
Undead mage is the most populated Horde class/race combination.
---
It was 382 days and the guy went from 450ish lbs to 185ish. Nothing but water. You won’t die as long as you have stored fat to live on.
---
A resto shaman will get geared by his guild in no time.   
---
Hunters are on their own, many people wont even bring you along because you will need on the same pieces they need. (Truestrike shoulders etc)
---
ele shaman shines in every aspect of pvp and contrary to popular belief, even without aq gear.
---
mage probably too, but imo it has some rough matchups.
---
warlock is the king of 1on1, but is not that versatile in bgs. spriest is kinda the same.
---
priests and warriors rely on each other, they are monsters together but weak alone.
---
druids are cool.
---
rogues and hunters suck.
---
Human spirit is a weak bonus. Even in Naxx BiS, the bonus is on the order of 30-40 spirit and 10 healing. I'd easily trade 30 spirit and 10 healing for a fear immunity on a 30 second cooldown that can make an encounter much smoother.
---
You guys are all starving to death, [meanwhile we're over here making Westfall Stew](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bkg0ii/passing_the_time_until_classic_release_so_i_made/). Just saying.
---
Wish I would got 1 of the old server blades when they sold them
---
You're making a ton of assumptions, and creating a "sky is falling scenario" with your "what if's". The bottom line is, it doesn't matter beyond the point of Classic release. People can complain all they want, what we get is it.   
---
And even if they did decide to cater to the people who are complaining about something that revolves around a "TOGGLED OPTION", it shouldn't concern you at all. Because it's not being forced upon you.
---
Also:   
---
\&gt;You seem to have missed the part where blizzard will just remove classic from being a thing beacsue they dont have the time / resouces to put into updating the models. 
---
The hell does this even mean?
---
all nerds loved Morgan Webb
---
I really like the later iterations of shadow priest in WoW but I guess my closest bet to that in Classic will be warlock? (I prefer DPS over healing but have nothing against healing every now and then.)
---
My biggest worry with priest is the constant respeccing that I would need to PvP and PvE, while with warlock that would be less severe. I do not really mind healing but I much prefer DPS in the long run, and this is for the best since my ADD can act up and getting distracted as a DPS player is not as bad for the group.
---
My MAIN focus in Classic will 100% be PvP and I will look for guilds that raid close to reset so I can have the most amount of days in PvP spec.
---
Play the healing class you want to play.   
---
If you need to earn money you can pick up professions like herbalism/alchemy and farm that way.   
---
You dont need to kill stuff to make money in vanilla.
---
I will absolutely be doing this. Making playlists for each zone and everything. Still working on it but it's something to help tie me over. 
---
I'm also a little scared it will somewhat overwrite the previous memories though. So... I still have my reservations. 
---
Or maybe I'll find some new albums for each zone and make some new memories that I can look back on fondly the same way I look back at vanilla days. Go through a different route / class combination with that...
---
Ahhhhhhh, so many options.
---
That's not necessarily true. Priests have high base damage but don't scale well. Priest dps is solid until fight length gets long and everyone else starts getting crazy gear. The only truly poor shadow fight before Naxx is Nefarian because it's typically around 6-8 minutes, and a priest just can't maintain a normal dps rotation for that long no matter the consumables.
---
This is why I suggest in my shadow spreadsheet notes that people should expect to switch to healing for Naxx, either a hybrid spec like you mention, or a pure healer.
---
Lol
---
Surely you can see how insane that argument is.  Blizzard has spent millions of dollars in salaries recreating classic and their going to cancel it and destroy their public image over new 8 character models?  This sounds a lot more like clawing for an excuse to try and force people to want the game you want it to me.
---
Priests start out reasonably competitive, but don't scale well. Later they should switch to healing anyway when fight length gets beyond 3-4 minutes and you can't sustain mana for the rotation.
---
rogues and hunters are pretty great in world pvp
---
Im sofaking fat from playing wow the first 10 years it was out that I could actually survive the summer on hunger strike
---
No not any more. I think they stopped that back in 2012 ish.
---
yeah, try that on skulk rock looting the oozes. your inventory will be full with shit in no time. silly suggestion
---
From murlocs. But not every one - drop rates weren't fixed until several expansions later. 😜
---
I miss G4 TV. I used to watch the shit out of that channel when I was a kid.
---
A skilled rogue is something to be worried about and I'd place them somewhere between Mage and warlock. These casters can easily outplay a rogue in a fair fight but with rogues it rarely is a fair fight.
---
Top kek!
---
dont tell him! azeroth has enough of that scum.
---
true, still hate them.
---
Pick hunter or shaman if you want easy mode levelling.
---
whyyyy?
---
See, this is what I'm thinking. And people saying that bear is sub-optimal, while warrior is certainly better for some fights, they underestimate what a bear is capable of doing. And I'm definitely willing to farm MCPs and even do a little bit of other farming, if necessary. Plus, we could afford to, like you just said, funnel most of our consumes to our tanks and then let the DPS just do their thing.  
---
Somebody below said "What's the point of carrying a bunch of dead weight? And how can it be reasonable to expect the others to carry that dead weight?" That wasn't the point of the post at all. The point was to ensure that the margin of error is wide enough there's a possibility of progressing with a fresh guild without having to constantly farm up consumes and world buffs, assuming that guild has a few hybrids and gimped specs, as well as plenty of the standard... which is not unreasonable, considering some people are going to want to play optimal specs, and some are going to want to play hybrids. It's not like these other specs contribute \*nothing\* to the raid, they just don't have the same numbers.  
---
Why "expect the others to carry" the gimped specs?  
---
Um... I don't know... maybe so that everyone can play what they want to play and have fun clearing content, both optimal and sub-optimal? Assuming that the margin is wide enough for that to actually possible?  
---
I really don't get what people find so offensive about that.... again, with this caveat, which was the whole point of my original post: Is it or is it not possible to progress content in this way?
---
;)
---
HO! HO! HO!
---
hey it's me a dev I need this back
---
lol
---
Where are all my Troll Rogue brethren?
---
that water looks delicious
---
No pants all day err day
---
Here fukin here, man. Thank you for that. That's exactly what I wanted to know. As long as the margin is wide enough that it's \*possible\* to complete the content, and the difference isn't "Have every single consume or everyone fails and you waste real people's valuable time," but rather, "Have every single consume and you'll be able to progress more easily and begin speedrunning faster," then that's all I care about.  
---
Which is why I wanted to get a sense for what the reality is before I started dreaming of clearing endgame content. If it were literally impossible, then I would just content myself with trying to get Dungeon Set 2 as my ultimate end goal. Work on those sweet, sweet Rivendare clear times.  
---
It is incredibly ironic to me that people complain about how retail has railroaded people into certain boring, pre-scripted ways of playing... oh, but feck you for trying to mix and match, make a more ragtag group of heroes in order to complete content.  
---
I'd say that's a beautiful game if Blizzard has made end-game raiding content where the top end anal-retentive e-penis lords of d00m can get a lot out of trying to race for world firsts and fastest times, and then the rest of us can just sort of, you know, do something else.  
---
Which is \*again\* why I wanted to actually check and see if people felt like that was the reality. If I were playing a different game than what I thought I was playing, then I wouldn't want to get 40 or 50 peoples' hopes up in a guild, waste all their time, etc. I'd just do dungeons, endgame pvp, etc.

...though, as a final note, I think that the coolest thing to find would be 40 or 50 people who were adventurous enough to be willing to give it a shot just to SEE if it were possible, even if we didn't already know, like we do now, that it really is :)
---
Looks hearty!!!
---
Because retail and classic share the same sub, and they want to add value to keep people subbed over time. There will probably be a very long drought of content for retail after 8.2 is dropped, which makes me think we will be hearing a lot about classic just before or soon after it drops. As much as I don't want that to be true.
---
There's a reason all top guilds on private servers use loot council. It is the best for optimizing raid performance. 
---
And don't bring up corruption as an argument against it, corruption can happen with any loot system. If the gm/officers want something to go to one person for whatever reason they can do it, no matter what system you run.
---
I would really love a youtube video montage of a ton of wall of no posts

Pornstars have olympian levels of endurance.
---
If you are Obese you will survive else you are gonna develop some serious problems like ulcers if you are used to eating properly on time.
---
If weightloss is the goal starving for few days is great but for a long run you have to watch diet and exercise. Staying with zero eating is dangerous.
---
Where did you test this at?
---
as a shadow priest you will melt faces in pvp

What’s this reference please

I can feel it.

I just said fuck it and will only eat one meal a day and drink coffee and water the rest of the day with maybe a cheese stick here and there.

These videos are amazing. Keep 'em up.   
---
I don't know if you plan to do it from 1 to 60, but that'd make for one hell of an awesome series.

What DO they sub for the eyes?

hahaha nice

Wow I miss G4

Melderon did a great Shaman video where he breaks down the weapon buffs: [https://youtu.be/szkScab2iOQ?t=1174](https://youtu.be/szkScab2iOQ?t=1174)
---
TL;DR: They're all pretty much normalized to do the same dps regardless of weapon speed. Use whatever is newest while leveling, use firebrand or frostbrand if you have +spell power, don't use rockbiter if you don't want to pull threat. Windfury may still have a slight edge for enhancement due to increased chances to proc flurry.
---
Let's just sit back, relax, and wait. We want Blizzard Quality, not a botched release :)
---
You’re literally ignoring what I’m saying.  That’s fine.
---
centaur have high armor, so yes 1h flametongue would be better.
---
She made a few now deleted twitter posts about how one time she raped a teenager (she was teenage aswell) who didn’t want to do it..
---
The post was something stupid like “he kept saying no but I just hopped on it anyway and took his virginity”
---
There's always the downtime during flight paths.
---
I’m just reading some of the changes to windfury now and holy shit how was this even acceptable to the community? By 1.12 I had switched to Alliance when frostmourne was released so I shelved my shaman. 
---
I distinctly recall enhance levelling with eagle gear because windfury Ap bonus was sufficient to not need to stack any strength. Now it hits like a wet noodle.
---
Send this to [/u/NO\_EAT\_TIL\_CLASSIC](https://www.reddit.com/user/NO_EAT_TIL_CLASSIC)
---
or herbing/mining works too.
---
this pretty much. Horde has the town advantage while leveling, but Ironforge is a zone away from Blackrock Mountain while the Horde is stuck humping across half of the EK every time they want to do something there
---
Yes windfury is not great for leveling, but it never really was.  Leveling you want sustained, reliable, dps, while windfury is more of a burst proc.
---
I think most guides suggest rockbiter weapon for leveling.
---
Yeah sick and tired of no release/gag order on the date. I don't like to be that way, but it's grown overtime.
---
Definitely saw these back in the day on my server. The best horde guild and best alliance guild would host these on off nights for MC/BWL/ZG/AQ20. I dont recall the split exactly though I got invited to a few of these as a merc. One of the reasons why they even had mercs join these was so they could target possible replacements. I always enjoyed these to be honest and it allowed other people or even whole small guilds the opportunity to experience content and grab loot that they would have been unable to get on their own. Small, close knit guilds towards the end of vanilla would actually hire out a group of high level raiders just to help them clear content. This was one of the many great memories I had in WoW and I made quite a few friends because of it. Hell, I was basically the priest class lead for 3 different guilds thanks to this, lol
---
After a few of those I actually became a healer for hire on my guilds off nights. I played vanilla and TBC so much it was CRAZY. That's how I was able to get my epic mount on my main and 2 alts
---
True that! Sorry I should have made it clear that I totally agree with you; going for PI is a big decision with a lot of tradeoff even if you are fairly deep into the disc tree for sure.
---
you always want to have both options so you need either gear anyway.
---
I mean, I am definitely not here because of the memes. When I hear a release date it will go on my calendar and I probably wont return until its out..
---
There is nothing on this sub to learn that I haven’t already heard / don’t care about.. i’d be more interested in specific guides and so forth - but nothing on this sub is informative, its just the same questions, memes etc reposted over and over.
---
If we were discussing say, Gold-making strategies or something else I might be inclined to stay.
---
Pearl onions. But we're not a big fan of onions so I just used potatoes.
---
I just bought the cookbook because of your post. #classichype
---
Wetlands mostly.
---
Yeah, I suppose I was counting raid prep and farming for raiding as part of raiding.
---
Up to you man. PvP servers mean you can't opt out, and that comes with both good and bad. If you have time and energy to deal with it, I'd recommend it.
---
Wetlands mostly
---
Pantera, Slipknot, Linkin Park, Disturbed, N.W.A, Korn, Metallica are all in my current classic playlist. Adding more as I remember them
---
The modern WoW has a weekly sticky called Phat Lewt Friday! It always seemed meaningless imo because modern-WoW gives no merit to gear anymore..
---
But I could live vicariously through a Vanilla Phat Lewt Friday page. “After 300 runs I got the Rivendare mount” “OMG the last binding dropped”
---
I never played on a PvP server, myself. I'm considering it, come Classic. To this point... can anyone who played on a PvP server give me an answer as to the ratio of compelling, satisfying WPvP fights they had versus frustrating roflstomps? Was it like... 1 to 2? 1 to 5? 1 to 10?  
---
I mean realistically. Not just cherry picking the "oh man that was awesome" moments, but if you think about your actual experience while leveling.  
---
The fantasy of WPvP really appeals to me, the idea of \*sometimes\* having to just hide out like a hobbit from a nazgul and just outright dodge a much higher level player, but \*most\* of the time finding engaging, relatively evenly matched fights where you both have a possibility of winning depending on how you play it.  
---
If the reality is just, "This is a PvE server and everything is pretty much exactly the same except I have to constantly avoid skulls coming and gunning me down," then I'm not interested.
---
Oh yeah, it was definitely nerfed into the ground over the course of Vanilla. But even as a life-long Horde player, I've got to admit it was too overpowered. Especially once people got their hands on good, slow 2H weapons at level 60 and could just delete other players if they got a proc.
---
My warlock could delete people in tier 2/zhc seduce shadow bolt into a burn. Required no lucky proc or anything I just found you and dropped you.
---
Shaman nerfs bs.
---
*You taste some of the stew as it flips over and rethink your life choices*
---
My frost bolts keep destroying them
---
priest utility isn't close to paladin utility, priests are just good at what they do
---
Exactly, only guild members and mercs get any of the money. These also never happen in progression. At least not in my experience. Only raids on super farm status where no one needs the gear were ever run this way
---
Their shareholder meeting they just had hinted that classic wouldn't be released until after Q2, so earliest, July 1
---
This is actually what got me into Warcraft. My parents then got it for me on Easter.
---
Huge mistake.
---
You forgot the Lord of The Rings part, so just add a Sauron or Gimli in there and you should be good

---
I think it'll be great in the long run
---
I'm going to get rolled by a lot of people, I'm going to play a 20/31/0 holy/prot paladin. My raid spot is going to be earned entirely based on cleanse, Blessing of Sanctuary, and mediocre at best healing. I'll be haply just to get my dungeon set 2.
---
Classic is just a nostalgia trip for me. I dont give a fuck how good or bad i perform.
---
Thanks for understanding, so many people go out of their way to comment stuff like “Oceania is an unimportant region” when requesting anything regarding location..
---
Call of Duty for example releases with about 15-25 playable modes and in Australia the lists are populated for no more then 2 months then suddenly the only gametype you can play is TDM and FFA..
---
I avoid games with extensive mode-selections because i’m sick of it. Even Overwatch right now I can only find games for the 2 main modes...
---
[Skeletal Fiend](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/a/ab/Skeletal_Fiend.jpg)

Natural selection coming through
---
Filling this out gets you about a minute closer to Classic's release, I highly recommend it.
---
Blizz: We hear your concern. At this time we can no longer offer additional support, and hope we have helped you the best we can with your issue! Feel free to open up another ticket, and a GM will try to assist you! 
---
May the Earth Mother guide you.
---
Make sure you save any of the elemental earth you get in the badlands and other leveling in your bank until people start getting the elemental sharpening stone patterns on your server because they become worth much more then as that is what people mostly use them for.
---
I have often had those same feelings on a meme spec friendly guild. I definitely would join one. I think people would enjoy a guild based around that. I also think people would feel inclined to stick around a guild like that. 
---
I’m not saying it needs to be a guild full of balance Druid’s shadow priests prot paladins etc but would be nice to have a guild that didn’t call you an idiot for wanting to play them. 
---
In the end if the raid is killing every boss, who cares what spec someone else is. Let people have fun the way they want to have fun.
---
Gear plays an important role. However,
---
A: Mage, Priest, Rouge,
---
B:Warlock, Shaman, Paladin, Warrior
---
C: Hunter, Druid,
---
Also consider the fact that Hunters and Druids counter the A tier group hard.
---
True, pets make it pretty easy.
---
amen

If it's white hold on tight. If it's grey throw it away.

---
Just wait until Tuesday we will get the beta then
---
I thought on it but I want to save it to each time I enter those zones
---
that should tide you over
---
Perhaps [this list?](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MsDWgYDIcPE_5nX6pRbea-hW9JQjYikfCDWk16l5V-8/pubhtml) I googled "vanilla WoW top consumable list" and it was a link in a nostalgic server's forum.
---
scuse me, i add butter not sugar to my coffee
---
Smaller groups is less people locked out.
---
Yes your brain will stop producing the chemical that makes you feel hungry as much after a while
---
it's why when you wake up after a long sleep you don't usually feel starving but going 4 hours without eating during the day you might feel hungry as hell
---
that being said full on water fasting is only really recommended for super obese people who can't do anything else, if you have any exercise or weight lifting in your routine it's not for you
---
Forsure. Id play on rppvp as my forst choice, but if that ist available, I'll play on a pvp server, andnonce the rppvp server gets added, I'll be too entrenched to switch over most likely.
---
Wait, really? What is it about 50 hours that makes you stop feeling hunger - do you know?
---
&gt;I burn like 2000 calories a day just working
---
No, you don't
---
&gt; anyone remember this? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHI3\_a5rjo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPHI3_a5rjo) 
---
Pat, Laintime, George, Swifty, Maydie - those are names I remember as being Grails for Warrior pvp. I was a 60 Orc Warrior during that time. Never hit rank 14, but I did make it to 10 and had semi-decent gear up through BWL and early AQ. What a time that was. I can't wait to do it again.
---
How does one get the required gear tho?
---
Like I said, this is endgame. Alot of your pieces will be little things from bwl/mc once that becomes a joke, pvp gear if you plan on ranking, and pre raid pvp gear as well.
---
I ran GDKP runs in Wrath for ICC. We would compose the comp of a balanced amount. Needed a good amount of over geared people to carry, people who have literal garbage that any drop would be an upgrade, and a few who NEED one item (Dislodged Foreign Object from ICC as an example) and will pay through the teeth for it. The mix of low geared people, people missing one item, and the rest to carry makes decent cash and is fun.
---
Exactly. And if you find out that you're \*not\* clearing content quickly enough, well, try and make a switch. See what you would need to do to make it happen.
---
flag of ownership please
---
I remember wishing I could've gone to the orange county fry's... Ended up buying mine at the San Diego fry's, a mile away from my house.
---
This is how I made most of my gold back in Wrath. I made thousands of gold a week just showing up for ICC25 runs. I never bid on anything so it was pure profit.
---
You forgot 5 man PvE as an option for what to do.
---
The age ranges seem pretty broad too. 18-30 is pretty big and very different phases in life and the 18 y/o was probably not playing WoW vanilla while a 30 y/o might have been in prime playing age during classic. I’d probably split it into 18-25, 25-32, that’s at least what I commonly see in surveys. 
---
Anyway, cool idea to make a survey. Looking forward to see the results
---
Chicks always find dudes easier than vice versa. Don’t take it personally. Lol
---
I will be making a video analyzing the results soon. I am so pumped for classic :D
---
I think a fair few of the logitech gaming keyboard have similar extra buttons.
---
I meant like isn’t it hard for shadow priests to get raid gear ? I want to roll one but I’m worried I’ll never get the required gear.
---
Low on the priority list.
---
It can be very very dangerous though, it's not like burning fat is as easy for your body as digesting food.
---
And also include RP-PVP at launch. PVP servers are the worst for shitty names.
---
It’s really not dangerous. It has a lot of health benefits. Our bodies are designed to burn fat like this and run on periods of no food. Now 300 days is pretty extreme for most people but when you’re almost 500 lbs, being that fat is far more dangerous than fasting.
---
priest can heal the shit out of 5 man groups with prayer of healing when everyones taking heavy damage like in stratholme. they are pretty epic and never fail. pally can afk with a good tank though and flash of light rank 1. priest are much more interesting. It's kind of fun to actually watch your mana bar from time to time and focus up.
---
Seriously it fit perfectly
---
The mana strudels and now this amazing looking stew. My cooking skills are limited to breakfast burritos and spaghetti, but I'm tempted to buy this book.
---
Y'''r' r'ght, th's 's p'rf'ctl'y 'cc'pt'bl'!
---
Plaguebloom would like to have a word with you
---
The Sodapoppin thing was a one-off, though, *specifically* targeting him. It's otherwise completely unenforced.
---
While I agree it isn't necessary, why is it terrible?
---
Youll have to get it by healing raids and getting offpieces that people wont want. pre raid bis will be your friend. later on when everyone is letting you screw around in mc/bwl (maybe aq40) if everyone has naxx gear theyll let you play shadow. Or your guild will want shadow weaving late AQ40 into naxx and let you in that way. Since warlocks dont shine until AQ40 and on, shadow priest is very underwhelming during bwl/mc progression even with the added raid dps with shadow weaving
---
I'd be on board. I'm keen the rpg elements, the older style of leveling and class builds, and the old sense of community. Upgraded graphics would be fine for me, though Classic using the original graphics is quite fine to experience the old feel again.
---
This is the type of content I like to see.
---
Nope! I'm not trying to waste time, but also not trying speed to cap. When I played back in the day I was a kid who both sucked at the game and couldn't care less about the lore. This time around I the RPG experience. Even if any class quests as the best exp/hour I still wanna experience the lore and class fantasy related to it.
---
No clue about the skipping stuff part.
---
My insight is purely based off of leveling 3 priests to max on 3 private servers since Nost. With that said I prefer to start off with a Mental Strength build early on until AQ (when I finally have t2 8/8) where I'll then usually switch over to Spiritual Healing or even PI.
---
It's honestly just a preference thing though. The extra mana early on really is huge to me. That + flasking makes the first few MCs a breeze for me.
---
Solid judgement literally knowing nothing about what I do on a day to day basis.
---
I burn about 2000 calories a day just existing, and I eat around 4000 calories a day and I don't gain or lose weight, and I don't work out outside of working and the occasional yard/house work when I get home, so basic math tells me *on average* I burn 2000 calories a day at work.
---
Still gonna be 50-100 people in a single quest zone with sharding btw so I don't see what this argument is about
---
It's theoretically possible to handle such a large launch with sharding, but there's a reason many people are apprehensive to the idea of a sharded launch.
---
For real.
---
Unlikely on launch accord to Blizz
---
That makes no sense...
---
Quest givers have yellow question marks for completed quests in vanilla.
---
I thought Kyle was the dog.
---
Freaking Westfall music just started playing in my head just looking at that picture.
---
The game isn't even out yet and people have already started doing unhealthy things. I see another wave of bad mainstream news media about gamers in our future.
---
He could just roll ret paladin on a pserver and get told he can't raid
---
Alliance probably wished they hadn't seen me in the same leveling zones I was leveling in. I was a prolific lowbie pvper. Would frequently get camped by their friends as a result. 
---
I do miss running into the same people though, forging friendships. Had a lot of that in vanilla. BC too.
---
Yeah unless you run marathons for a living you're not burning 2,000 calories per day at your job, I don't think you realise how absurdly hard that would be to do
---
&gt; I eat around 4000 
---
"Around", key word here
---
Skiping class quests? No chance, and I wish there were more, much more
---
Utility maybe, but I said toolkit. As in, they have a lot of heal abilities, and even if only a few are efficient, you have a wide array of oh shit buttons to save somebody, whereas a Pally literally has 3 heals :/
---
Fasting is actually really good for you and has tons of health benefits.
---
BWL and MC runs yield 10000 Gold?
---
Sometimes you *really* just wanted to get where you were going, though.
---
I absolutely loved Xplay. Thanks for posting...
---
Madseason/Frost are the only youtubers who've been keeping me genuinely occupied before Classics release. Cant get enough of their content.
---
Yea but when you start gearing you're going to want to target specific gear and I assume that will start off with Mitigation gear.
---
Yea but you're targeting specific gear at first so I want to prioritize the right gear
---
Don't...the ptsd was finally starting to go away...
---
Next make crunchy spider surprise. Just need 6 spider sacs and a few crunchy spider legs!
---
I find people are odd about graphics. I want to play Vanilla for the game itself. Graphics are generally meaningless to me. If I have to play with Classic models, ok. But if there is the option for higher definition models, I don't see the issue with allowing people this choice.
---
Well, I am going off the labels on the food packaging, so I'm only going to be as accurate as they are when I'm counting.
---
I don't think you understand how strenuous physical labor on a construction site is.  Yeah, I'm not running a marathon, but marathon runners also aren't digging ditches, lugging material around, and climbing up/down ladders and rigging shit all day.
---
I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but running isn't the end all, be all of calorie burning.
---
&gt;  But I think you are overestimating how structured backups a company will have for 10+ year old data no longer in use.
---
As a storage admin for a healthcare organization (which has extremely long data retention requirements), I would have to tell someone wanting a functioning 10-year-old version of one of our apps that they are SOL. 
---
That being said, I can’t imagine someone not having a copy of classic stored away if not just for the nostalgia of it.
---
Boomkin are actually great pvp. No worries abut OOMing, and that's their biggest problem, plus all that druid utility.
---
On the one hand, any company of this size really, really should have redundant backups.
---
On the other hand, companies actually having reliable backups is a relatively recent phenomenon. Pixar nearly lost the entirety of one f their movies (I want to say it was Toy Story) because someone wiped their only production copy. They still consider the phrase “rm rf *” an unutterable swear word. The only reason the movie made it is because one of their animators had a copy on their home computer when they would telecommute.
---
Blizzard have killed before, you my ugly young friend will just be another statistic in their murderous rampage!
---
The blues care not for the demands of the pixel slayers :P
---
One required setup that could be trinketed or silenced, the other is an autoattack.
---
TOTALLY comparable.
---
I will be cool with any version of graphics that they choose. I am not one who cares much about the music side as i am usually either talking on voip or have something else going(music or show). I just want the gameplay and love the idea that it never progresses past 60. Just need to find a good group of people to play with and I'll be happy
---
Yeah I def have a lv 1 human female named Hasapeepee on a retail rp server, so im pretty sure its safe to say that its not enforced currently
---
My guild would split the amount. People usually paid 3000g minimum and up. Could usually bring five or more depending on their competency. We would maintain and active list of people who came to heroic achievements but didn’t actually buy anything and never take them again. Fairly lucrative for alts or geared guilds
---
Frost is more efficient and defensive, but I love to level with pyroblast. :)
---
I would love a remastered classic which had expansions that expanded in WoW going in a different direction that what retail went in.
---
Spiritual healing is far better.
---
it's actually extremely dangerous to not get some of the basic vitamins/nutrients that are normally supplied from food. the guy who did it was medically supervised and was still given vitamins and nutrients as needed.
---
Blizzard does not negotiate with terrorist
---
You are drastically over estimating the required “setup” of a seduce nuke vs being able to stay in melee range as an enhancement shaman.
---
There is logitech keyboards with extra buttons. You may also like an Orbweaver or similar-style 'gamepad' products? I myself am eying the Ergodox-EZ however
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
you´ll learn while playing!
---
&gt; I just want the gameplay and love the idea that it never progresses past 60 
---
I was thinking about this a lot the other day, I wonder what WoW would be like if they didn't continue the leveling thing... like even introduce new zones, but have you experience it for reputation, gear, and fun... leveling to 120 and being able to 2 hit old raid bosses is just weird...
---
It’s not. You get vitamins and other nutrients from your fat. It’s stored like that for a reason. You do need some sodium but sprinkling salt into some water is fine. Fasting has been done for millennia. It’s in every culture and religion. The most dangerous part is the re-feeding after breaking a long fast.
---
you can. most chains aren't related to each other.
---
But some chains can be pretty long and give multiple rewards. Like the pally level 20 quest awarding Sense Undead first and then leading to the quest to make Verigan's Fist.
---
Some of the very early quests that award items can be good if you haven't found anything better but can feel a bit lackluster if you did.
---
A completely personal opinion, but I feel PvP servers allowed me to have a few more signals of "when it was time to have a break". Often one of my biggest struggles with MMO levelling is just not knowing when to stop and have a breather for a bit and I feel PvP did that, especially when you have some 60 or just a bunch of twats (stranglethorn i'm looking at you) camping a spot for hours and it makes you question if you should really try going back there for hours or just let it breeze over while you go do other things.
---
Aside from that, PvP is honestly personal preference. As stated above, there can be severely cancerous moments, but nothing feels good when you get ganked and manage to fight off the enemy. A few things to also look out for in PvP servers are:
---
* Tagging. Unless in a party, you will always be battling people to tag mobs, whether they're the same faction or enemies. Some of my highlights during questing was having a group of allies and horde just sitting at a boss waiting to tag, both not wanting to fight each other until the other faction tags, then it's war. 
---
* Rogues, enough said
---
* Having to traverse in foreign land and dieing, which will result in the beautiful long walk of shame to your body.
---
One thing to note is that people will often associate PvP with people just wanting to solely PvP, but you'll find a lot of players are somewhat respectful and docile unless harmed or tagged. Give it a try, while PvE will have a more fluent experience, something about the uncertainty of PvP servers is just amazing
---
First paladin class quest is at 12 and gives the Resurrect spell.
---
I don't plan on doing group content until 60, it can wait. Sorry rando dead guy in Feralas, I can't rez.
---
Are we talking about quests like for mages, like come to me or do some other shit and you get a new wand? If so HELL YEAH! I gonna skip those! Back in the days never done them, also never learned pig form for sheep.
---
&gt;Why are they hesitating so long to give a release date announcement?
---
Are they tho?
---
&gt;a time in the game's life when night elves were considered to be the best race for leveling because they had faster corpse runs.
---
That was a troll, man.  Like carebears pick NE, die a lot, therefore fast corpse runs are op.
---
&gt; but didn’t actually buy anything and never take them again
---
What about in cases where nothing they want/need drops, or if they were outbid every time?
---
Just be like "Paladins can do that?" when people ask why you didn't res them after they died right in front of you.
---
This might be one of the questions least likely to yield a fair and unbiased answer when you ask it. Especially on this subreddit. People can get very attached to class/spec combos, even class/spec/race combos. At the end of the day you just have to  jump in and try and piece it apart for yourself.
---
3 things whoa. Diablo mobile doesn’t affect Blizzard staff because they aren’t the ones working on it. Why would you expect them to keep supporting HoTs when it has been dying in popularity and monetary gains for years now?
---
I've got all my spells from the trainer. I have no rez. Maybe i get it later?
---
What is this recipe book called? I’m intrigued. Your meal looks delicious.
---
I'm not eating until classic either so I can get the true 15 year old twink experience of 2005. If my laptop isn't situated on my pelvis bones with a gap of space between it and my stomach I'm a piece of shit who doesn't even deserve to play this game anymore
---
Not enough skeletons, send more alliance
---
I hear people say you should skip water totem quest for shammy. I think they’re crazy
---
1h + flametounge is a VERY viable way to level to 60. Also windfury shines though it's ability to boost the dps of melee raid groups. Is complaining about level 30 content really relevant when shamans have equivalent alternatives?
---
priest has what to save someone else besides shield?
---
Oohhh... Not good. Post Classic content. I'm going to need your Classic card.
---
hey! what a bunch of bullshit!
---
Yeah, sustain is a big issue for shadow priests (like elemental shaman or balance druids). Still, they have their place and *some* utility.
---
Also, this is a game, so people should be allowed to have fun. Most casual guilds would be fine with it.

It's just tough to believe that he couldn't have pushed her off. Impossible, really. If the roles were reversed, you could believe that maybe she couldn't have gotten out from under him. As it is, it sounds like he was just unsure.
---
According to the frequent reposts I see, they’re all over thrift stores!

---
You dont dictate how anybody gets to RP.
---
Your missed the part about the trinket and silence. You can't trinket or silence an autoattack.
---
Now you know!
---
But you can snare/kite/stun enhancement. Anyone who stands near an enhancement shaman for 3.8 seconds deserves a wf proc.
---
NO CHANGES
---
Hahaha tell them you didn't train anything from the holy section because you are a ret paladin.
---
Right but around SFK you kind of need a few talents thrown into the role your fulfilling. A pure Arms Tank and Shadow Priest probably means people are gona be running back, doesnt mean no way it cant work but the further away from 10 you grown the more you dont want off specs, BRD is definitely make or break
---
If you want AOE plus disabling, your only real option is mage.
---
Fwiw paladin has terrible CC.
---
If you already get enough of a workout at work maybe focus more on your diet, sounds like intermittent fasting might be a decent option for you. You can still have those big dinners but you essentially would avoid eating later at night or in the mornings.
---
If you're interested: https://www.dietdoctor.com/intermittent-fasting

Thanks!

Yes, unfortunately 1.12 is the lowest point for windfury. Patches before it you could chain proc, and it had more extra AP, and in patches after you DW it, but in 1.12, you weep. It's so tormenting because in 2.01 you get DW and each hand has an independent GCD for WF, you could absolutely blow people up in pvp, it felt great. In earlier patches massive chain WF procs are the stuff of legend. The AP nerf was just insult to injury. Still, nothing else quite like it.
---
Just pick up dps sets as you gear up as there should be alot of cross over.
---
Vanilla raiding is pretty easy but what people forget is that you can still mess it up. A wipe can cost you 30 minutes worth of farming (more if you grabbed world buffs).
---
Skip it until you have a mount.
---
If this was the one off the 91 near Anahiem/Fullerton, I remember going there with my buddy to get him a copy of BC (he didn’t pre order) and they had people out front signing copies and two huge projectors inside playing the cinematic on repeat. It was awesome.
---
Diablo 3 on my switch. I can chill with my GF while she watches whatever on Netflix, and I can dungeon crawl trying to find just one primal that actually goes with a build I'm interested in
---
For AOE disabling Druid doesn't have much in that regard. I think it's either mage or priest (I think it's priests that have that mass fear? or was it warlock? I think it was priest with psychic scream). Between the two of them, mage have WAY more options however.
---
vitamin c and all the b vitamins aren't fat soluble and aren't stored in your body (besides b-12, which is stored in your liver). you can't live healthily when you're deficient in these vitamins. there's a reason the doctors provided him with supplements in order to make sure he stays alive during his fast.
---
Reeee
---
i think this is the reason i have such bad eating habbits. hours or pushing that hunger pain away as an 8 yo to just keep playing
---
Class quests are some of the most fun parts of WoW! No way in hell I'm skipping mine!
---
Mage/Hunter/Rogue all have very strong CC in different ways. Mage and Hunter are great at locking down melee and kiting them. Mage is great vs casters with counterspell and polymorph (warlock is ok too but relies on specific pet and has little kiting ability). Rogue is the stunlock class that completely shut down 1 enemy for 20+ seconds, but is fairly weak in group combat.
---
you are clueless. Unbuffed pre bis 380? lol freaking rogues and wars cant even do that unbuffed prebis. You are taking some hearsay as fact, where i have seen the actual meters in actual attempts with actual player and decked out gear.
---
There's a difference between intermittent fasting and a hunger strike.
---
I don't think the OP would ever starve themselves to death, but even doing it for several days at a time as a meme is a needless hazzard.
---
That was an awful review by todays standards and it certainly didn't sell the game to me, but man was it entertaining.
---
I hung onto the "WHYYYY?!?!?" meme for years after I even remembered that it was part of this review. I feel so satisfied now!

---
The same cherry picking argument can be made against a paladin.
---
* What HoTs do paladins have?
---
* What ranged damaging spells do paladins have?
---
* What multi target healing spells do paladins have?
---
A classes toolkit is all encompassing. This is why the two classes play differently. Priest have their advantages while paladins have their own.
---
And it gives such a sense of community. What was just questing in STVietnam becomes a 5v5 slugfest, or a battle of the 60 mains. You get your guys in from world chat or guild or whatever, they do the same, and it just becomes an impromptu battleground for domination of the zone. I love it.
---
Tankards ™  will be the new meme
---
From left to right.
---
Hunter  hunter, hunter, hunter, hunter 
---
My job is done here
---
True, but fasting starts a process called autophagy. This is where your body breaks down dead and older cells and replaces them with new cells. It’s a process that is maximized during fasting. When your body breaks down these cells, it uses the minerals and vitamins stored in them. 
---
Fasting also actually creates stem cells and repairs your body with them. AFAIK, it’s the only time in your adult life when this happens.
---
This had to be Naxx-era... I’d guess it’s late summer of ‘06. I’ve got T3 helm and shoulders so we’ve definitely at least progressed through Thaddius.
---
It already is a remastered version...
---
Classic looks way more up to date than 2004 Vanilla.
---
Hahaha, well it was good enough to make a thott go two years before cheating on me. Some guys would call that a win.
---
First thing people are going to complain about is some game breaking bug and ask for reset.
---
People were borderline retarded back then. Very few people knew how to setup warlock burst. But every moron knew how to press stormstrike and nobody could stop him because again they were retarded.
---
Now freeze it into 20 batches so when wow comes out you don’t need to cook.
---
Do you mean PvE or PvP? 
---
Do you consider roots disables?  Snares? 
---
Warlocks have 2x fears, seduction on succubus, banish, and enslave demon, along with a short duration death coil.  They are the most versatile and most disables I think.  
---
Mages have polymorph for long term, and roots with frost nova and frost spec. 
---
Rogues have Sap for long term out of combat cc, and then gouge, kidney punch, and cheap shot for stuns and cc in combat (short duration).  
---
Hunter has ice trap (works on everything) and a variety of snares (wing clip / concussive shot).
---
Those are probably the top picks.
---
It's like when facebook started copying myspace ideas when that was growing.  Facebook has it's own issues right now, but at least they had the sense to drop most of the useless garbage after myspace sold out.
---
I bet there will be a lot of questions from people that never played vanilla. Which is fine.
---
never fall in love with a thot, or former thot. they will always rip your heart out and leave..
---
10-12 miles per day is roughly a half-marathon, so it's pretty believable that you can burn that many calories.
---
i think what they were trying to say is not that running is the only way to actually burn calories (passed just existing), but that heavy, extended cardio is the key there, and it sounds like you do a fuck ton of cardio, haha.
---
Sadly those sorts of people often create this type of stuff for the kicks alone.  They don't care one way or the other, and now they'll be the quickest to say "well blizz must have just decided the effort was worth it lul"
---
L0ok.
---
It doesn't matter what everyone says.   Classic will be 90% Night elf rogues and hunters.
---
I know it.   you know it.   Just admit it.
---
These surveys are a good measure of the  omunitkes degree of self delusions though.
---
Horde don’t use weapon stones, as it stops windfury being applied. You can use it on offhand, but as I understand it, it gives just crit to the offhand weapon on auto attacks, which seems fairly low impact to actual dps. 
---
I think for not top guilds/players who are progressing in raiding, melee often use more consumes due to often people dying on trash or to cleaves on bosses. Get over that and they aren’t bad
---
I don’t mind stealing bread, from the devs of decadenceeeee
---
The nochanges group isn't interested in letting other players have more choices, even if it doesn't affect them in any meaningful way.
---
Isn't Reilly Reid a pornstar ...
---
yeah, i'm not saying fasting is bad at all. i fast regularly, and there are definite health benefits. but if someone wants to fast, they need to take care that they're doing so healthily and with the right knowledge. and fasting for 382 days without medical supervision/intervention and without any supplements would kill someone from some kind of deficiency, like scurvy.
---
Dear Blizzard, please enforce regular naming conventions while you're at it. I report ~5 every time I log in. I'm so freaking sick of it. They don't do anything about it.
---
Well I say regular, but the RP naming policy was the everything naming policy before.
---
15 years ago I fell in love with a thott... she was one of a kind. 
---
Thott bot, you never let me down
---
Wait, they have food in Westfall?
---
you forgot the undead rogues... really its like 40% nelf and 40% Undead. :D
---
I'm going to be severely impacted by this post.
---
I know.. that was the point.
---
Female troll warrior ftw
---
Eh, not if they made it look like retail which is exactly what they'd do. If it started with vanilla styling then sure, otherwise hell no
---
Ouch
---
Thottbot is clearly a sheboi
---
Did she cheat on you with a male troll in a non classic WoW?
---
Show off them boots
---
I'm not sure what that means, but you're welcome.
---
Meanibgless no. Less important, yes.
---
Nice aesthetic touch with the head of garlic there man haha. Tasty looking stew too
---
Oh that server named Florthquail
---
Also keep in mind that not everyone uses reddit very often. i myself have been checking it only once a month or so. Classic really will be big i think.
---
Server pop cap was like 5k in vanilla
---
Mage fits your description in everything but healing. Incredible CC between polymorph being able to lock down a single target permanently, frost nova able to root a LOT of enemies for 8 seconds with a 24 cool down. You have AoE blizzard that can lock a lot of enemies down by slowing them immensely, then kiting them around.
---
Healers don't really have much CC. Druids can root enemies but it can only be used outdoors, and the enemy can still do stuff just not move.
---
The gift of free time is the best gift of all. 
---
Hopefully, you’ll get made redundant the day before launch day.
---
It took two years before you found out
---
I didn't specify intermittent fasting. Several days is nothing to even approach beginning to concern.
---
The toggle eventually became such a hassle in retail that they got rid of it altogether. Therefore it's safe to assume that the release would have to be postponed would they know start working on the new character models.
---
He means you are wise...
---
Like wisdom teeth, impacted;
---
This is my haiku.
---
Well on the bright side at least you won't be around someone who isn't a good person or right for you amigo, you dodged the bullet still
---
*Palestine
---
Of course they're going to enforce them. That's pretty much the only difference between an RP and a normal server, isn't it?
---
&gt; I'm not going to be optimal
---
&gt; I am going to play as a dwarf rogue.
---
Should we tell him guys?
---
Way smaller than 5k I believe. Most devs say between 2.5k and 3.5k. 5k isn’t necessarily unplayable, but still a very different experience from an authentic Vanilla.
---
I used to merchandise for Pepsi so I get where you’re coming from. If you’re already burning off those calories I’d say maybe crank out some push-ups sit-ups and squats. I started just doing one full set until you get muscle exhaustion and can’t do anymore. It gives your muscles a good work but doesn’t overdo it right away. Start slow or you’ll hate work. If you’re up for it pull ups in the same thing- just as many as you can in one set- is also good. It’s all about just taking baby steps, see what’s working for you and what’s not. Adding and dropping stuff to fit your schedule. It takes 10 minutes to crank out enough push ups sit ups and squats to make you feel it the next day without killing yourself. I also switched over to healthy dinner ideas. I have a website with 80 good recipes if you’re interested. I hate health food and they are a good in between.
---
I’m pretty sure it was 5k dude
---
Upon seeing that baller ass lone garlic on the table, I was almost tempted to pinch my thumb and index finger and raise them to the edge of my mouth while puckering my lips.

FAAAANTASTICO!
---
Depends on whether you get reported or not. If I'd seen you I would have.
---
Flash heal, a fast heal that heals for a lot. A Pally can just spam holy light and pray they don’t die in that 2.5 seconds. Also, a priest has a groupwide AoE heal, where a Pally can’t save a group from AoE damage very well. 
---
It just comes down to priests being the quintessential healer, while pallies just have a healing spec .

---
I play there and your not anonymous at all. I kno alottt of the people on the server. Still kno people ive lvled with. You do get the community vibe 100%. And if your playin there and not meeting people thats your social skills and ull have the same issue on classic.
---
feel better and enjoy your life. nobody deserves that betrayal. I hope you can find some solace in Azeroth man.
---
FYI your swing timer is still ticking even when you're not in range.
---
Yea its is not an easy task because now we are changing the meta-game in pve. I would have preferred that Classic be as close to Vanilla as possible but with talents, debuffs and gear all getting "buffed" in the early game it no longer makes sense not to buff the content aswell. 
---
So i think you are right changes to mobs and bosses could be any kind of mix: More armor, more hp, more damage and maybe a new ability?
---
You can substitute with spider eyes if there are no murlocs in your area, I hear Jarl has a surplus.
---
Will your video be 10:01 in duration?

Hmm? Are dwarf rogues low key amazing? I used to get a lot of flack for it

I haven't played any of the call of duty games in many years, do the new ones really not offer a campaign mode?

Oh, I see. But Trump is a real life last name. Although I have seen more German versions of the spelling. Politics aside, I say it is an acceptable real name. Just as acceptable as Smith, Jackson,or Washington.

I always would listen to celldweller, skrillex and progressive house while leveling in Cata but nothing beats mulgore music
---
Damn, really looking forward to receiving my copy.
---
Makes me sad that we won't have a physical release this time around. Even without any major events it would be good to go down to the local gamestore.
---
Why are you calling the argument cherry picked when I'm not even the person making it? 
---
&gt;A classes toolkit is all encompassing. This is why the two classes play differently. Priest have their advantages while paladins have their own.
---
Please just leave the internet.
---
Interesting reply since troll warriors are very good tank candidates.
---
That name is on reserve though so plx dont even think about it.
---
Was not my intention to put down Retail wow, i am sure it is a good and challenging game for the people that like it.
---
No, I like it the way it was.
---
Dazdingo
---
For the reason you picked it.  Stoneform is considered the best Alliance PVP racial for rogues.
---
Truly profound
---
Yea well I'll use it mostly for the color changing benefits
---
Maybe if I start at hour 1 and don't stop grinding until 60, maybe PvP servers would work for me.
---
But everytime I tried on a server that already had level 60's, every zone had a ?? level Rogue that just griefed. Then there were always the passing level ?? that would just oneshot you with a Frostbolt just because why not.
---
I feel like that was the majority of what I saw. I didn't see a whole bunch of level 30s-40s fighting in a server. It was always 60's roflstomping a zone and then  you'd have to leave and hope a different zone had questing opportunity.
---
Once I was level 60, it was actually fun, because the skirmishes felt equal or you had the advantage because you were level 60
---
It’s safe to say all of the nay sayers was a bunch of hard core cucks

I mean if flash heal counts then I don't see why divine favor flash of light wouldn't count. Then there is still bop, shock, lay on hands, and using your utility to not be in the situation in the first place. Priests excel at aoe healing, yeah, but they're worse at almost everything else. Paladin just has so many abilities that priest can't compete with at all, and that's ignoring the fact that they're the most mana efficient healer in the game.
---
A bit niche but glitch/ exploit areas (under SW, Crystal room under IF throne room, under Orgrimmar, Secret Troll village, Dalaran crater, under Karazhan, Karazhan crypts, tiger cave in STV and the grand daddy of them all, Hyjal and witnessing the Archimonde Skeleton and the Blizzard construction sign).
---
On a side note; does anyone know if the trolls over in the secret troll village hostile or attackable by Horde members, I remember being able to as an Alliance... Asking for a friend O.o
---
I think classic should stay in the realm of classic or live quality graphics, no more. 
---
If there was to be a top to bottom overhaul of the graphics system and engine, I’d hope it would appear in a WoW2.
---
Patience is a virtue.
---
hell naw
---
For one, that's not how WoW, Classic or otherwise, has ever been. Also, most people self-regulate naming on RP servers. It's rare to find a high level, non-troll character on an RP server with a non-RP game. If people came back to WoW, and had characters in Classic named like Bewbies or Swagmaster, it would feel completely foreign to come back to a game where you *have* to be named Falimor or Thalrias. But maybe most important, it would be a huge resource suck for Blizzard to actually enforce it. They'd have to devote a ton of labor to that. And people would get pissed and just change "Spongebob" to "Spongusbobus" and say it's Roman. It would open up a huge can of worms, and realistically Blizz wouldn't actually enforce it
---
But this time around we'll have sharding. If the starting areas are too busy I wonder how long the cities will use sharding.

great post, where can I read more of your blog?

What lol?

Ovaltine!!??

Won't matter in the big cities. That's not where you interacted with other people organically other than to trade.
---
If he is a fatty boom boom IRL I guess he will last for quite a while
---
Right, so it would just be terrible to enforce and people wouldn't want that change. I guess what I was imagining is if this rule existed from day one. I think it would've made the game better if it had always been enforced.
---
wtf?
---
Orgrimmar Ovaltine , new recipe
---
You really showed them!!
---
Imagine choosing race/class based on stats or what will be meta or easier to level instead of picking what you think is coolest. Just imagine.
---
I'm between a rogue or a warlock. A lock will be easier to gear and I feel like I'll still be good at world pvp. But raiding seems like just shadowbolt spam and I've already mained a mage for 300+ days. Everyone talks about how many rogues there will be, but honestly I expect less of them than mages/dps warriors and I enjoy their class professions a lot.
---
At first you purely go for mitigation. Won't be until late BWL (ish) DW fury tanking is viable.
---
Just make sure to pick up some pieces making Aoe tanking easier. Engineering shield, Drillborer disk, Naglering, preferably the Ragnaros trinket and always carry Oil of Immolation and grenades.
---
I have 2 laptops, 1 personal, 1 for work. I can right click mobs every 30 secs and keep the game on mute and finish my work just fine. Sure, there may be times i get busy and afk time out but thats not a big deal.

not all people QQ  over a women. I bet it's a relief lol
---
Can anyone identify the signatures? I see Pat Nagle in the bottom left.
---
I would suggest a lock, even though SPs are amazing for pvp locks aren't bad, if you plan to raid on priest a little and don't like to waste money bouncing between pvp pve specs more than other people it won't be a super smooth ride
---
Ah ok, I thought there was some super secret thing to stop afking out.
---
For twelve years, you have been asking: Who is kandigurl? This is kandigurl speaking. I am the woman who loves her life. I am the woman who does not sacrifice her love or her values. I am the woman who has deprived you of victims and thus has destroyed your world, and if you wish to know why you are perishing—you who dread knowledge—I am the woman who will now tell you.
---
You have heard it said that this is an age of Classic World of Warcraft. You have said it yourself, half in fear, half in hope that the words had no meaning. You have cried that man’s sins are destroying the world and you have cursed human nature for its unwillingness to practice the virtues you demanded. Since virtue, to you, consists of sacrifice, you have demanded more sacrifices at every successive disaster. In the name of a return to morality, you have sacrificed all those evils which you held as the cause of your plight. You have sacrificed justice to mercy. You have sacrificed independence to unity. You have sacrificed reason to faith. You have sacrificed wealth to need. You have sacrificed self-esteem to self-denial. You have sacrificed happiness to duty.
---
You have destroyed all that which you held to be evil and achieved all that which you held to be good. Why, then, do you shrink in horror from the sight of the world around you? That world is not the product of your sins, it is the product and the image of your virtues. It is your moral ideal brought into reality in its full and final perfection. You have fought for it, you have dreamed of it, and you have wished it, and I—I am the man who has granted you your wish.
---
You ideal had an implacable enemy, which your code of morality was designed to destroy. I have withdrawn that enemy. I have taken it out of your way and out of your reach. I have removed the source of all those evils you were sacrificing one by one. I have ended your battle. I have stopped your motor. I have deprived your world of man’s mind.
---
Men do not live by the mind, you say? I have withdrawn those who do. The mind is impotent, you say? I have withdrawn those whose mind isn’t. There are values higher than the mind, you say? I have withdrawn those for whom there aren’t.
---
While you were dragging to your sacrificial altars the men of justice, of independence, of reason, of wealth, of self-esteem—I beat you to it, I reached them first. I told them the nature of the game you were playing and the nature of that moral code of yours, which they had been too innocently generous to grasp. I showed them the way to live by another morality—mine. It is mine that they chose to follow.
---
All the men who have vanished, the men you hated, yet dreaded to lose, it is I who have taken them away from you. Do not attempt to find us. We do not choose to be found. Do not cry that it is our duty to serve you. We do not recognize such duty. Do not cry that you need us. We do not consider need a claim. Do not cry that you own us. You don’t. Do not beg us to return. We are on strike, we, the men of the mind.
---
We are on strike against self-immolation. We are on strike against the creed of unearned rewards and unrewarded duties. We are on strike against the dogma that the pursuit of one’s happiness is evil. We are on strike against the doctrine that life is guilt.
---
There is a difference between our strike and all those you’ve practiced for centuries: our strike consists, not of making demands, but of granting them. We are evil, according to your morality. We have chosen not to harm you any longer. We are useless, according to your economics. We have chosen not to exploit you any longer. We are dangerous and to be shackled, according to your politics. We have chosen not to endanger you, nor to wear the shackles any longer. We are only an illusion, according to your philosophy. We have chosen not to blind you any longer and have left you free to face reality—the reality you wanted, the world as you see it now, a world without mind.
---
We have granted you everything you demanded of us, we who had always been the givers, but have only now understood it. We have no demands to present to you, no terms to bargain about, no compromise to reach. You have nothing to offer us. We do not need you.
---
Are you now crying: No, this was not what you wanted? A mindless world of ruins was not your goal? You did not want us to leave you? You moral cannibals, I know that you’ve always known what it was that you wanted. But your game is up, because now we know it, too.
---
Through centuries of scourges and disasters, brought about by your code of morality, you have cried that your code had been broken, that the scourges were punishment for breaking it, that men were too weak and too selfish to spill all the blood it required. You damned man, you damned existence, you damned this earth, but never dared to question your code. Your victims took the blame and struggled on, with your curses as reward for their martyrdom—while you went on crying that your code was noble, but human nature was not good enough to practice it. And no one rose to ask the question: Good?—by what standard?
---
You wanted to know if kandigurl received a beta wow key. I am the woman who has asked that question.
---
Yes, this is an age of moral crisis. Yes, you are bearing punishment for your evil. But it is not man who is now on trial and it is not human nature that will take the blame. It is your moral code that’s through, this time. Your moral code has reached its climax, the blind alley at the end of its course. And if you wish to go on living, what you now need is not to return to morality—you who have never known any—but to discover it.
---
You have heard no concepts of morality but the mystical or the social. You have been taught that morality is a code of behavior imposed on you by whim, the whim of a supernatural power or the whim of society, to serve God’s purpose or your neighbor’s welfare, to please an authority beyond the grave or else next door—but not to serve your life or pleasure. Your pleasure, you have been taught, is to be found in immorality, your interests would best be served by evil, and any moral code must be designed not for you, but against you, not to further your life, but to drain it.

Generally I agree, but weaving between mobs outside the road isn't that hard once you get the hang of aggro distances relative to the mobs level and your level.
---
It's actually good practice for late game dungeons where you sometimes need to run between two packs of mobs to skip them - having an entire leveling progress of experience to draw on for that is quite valuable.
---
Rogue it up then.
---
Though they still gonna want items like Onslaught Girdle and Band of Accuria. No way they waste it on some PuGs even if they pay.
---
presumably it was a hassle because you'd need to check every piece of new gear to make sure it wasn't fucked up on the old models, somewhere like a classic realm you wouldn't need to do that because you aren't really adding new stuff
---
I agree about Madseason, but Frost has always urked me with his rags to riches videos.
---
Instead of getting to the point, he extends the duration of his videos by slowly explaining the lore of the zone he’s farming in... I just want to know where to kill basalisks in STV, not the reason why the nearby goblin npcs evacuated the mine the basalisks are in.

I ran them all the time during the TOGC/ICC days. They were called GDKP runs. I'd go on my already geared character and just rake in the gold. They were great but for some reason I never saw them outside of WotLK.
---
All starting area mobs are non aggressive, level 1-10/12- ish, but struggling to think of good grinding spots where there is non aggressive mobs at higher levels.  There are some areas in the barrens with non aggressive mobs, but they soon turn red. 
---
Would be interested in this too....😂👍
---
I like your idea. I’m getting a gaming laptop for wow classic. I’ve not played since 2012. I need a laptop so I can be sociable with the wife as I level.
---
My plan is to play a little in work too, maybe level fishing and cooking while in work, do my vendoring / AH stuff while at work, or even the long runs for flight paths.
---
Then when I’m home, once the kids are in bed, I can level away without wasting a lot of time.
---
Non issue.

200 IQ move. By cutting now he'll be in peak condition for the launch window bulking period.
---
You can make gold as a Shaman. You can do DM East jump runs with Ele. You can also get to mining/herbalism nodes easily with ghost wolf/mount and taunt totems. Not to mention you could make gold with even stuff as simple as fishing/cooking.
---
alrighty then
---
“I never meant for it to happen Scott, but when he promised to pay for my mount how could I say no?”
---
I too am a nerd in my thirties and have this cook book. Recipes are legit.
---
No defo not. I plan on leveling shammy and the class quests are great. Some of the totem ones are long with tonnes of running about before I get a mount. But they need to be done.
---
broseph, this has been done a dozen times in this sub. search please.

As you said, there are 9 days of summer in June and they've only said summer-release, so June 25 was just as much a possibility as any other date during the summer.
---
You're making up feelings about peoples desperation to make your self feel better by being "above them", just stop that. THAT if anything is desperation. Because people having hope for a June release IS NOT desperation, it's being hopefull.
---
It’s going to be a load of 30-somethings spamming it desperately trying, and failing, to be funny
---
True
---
Well obviously.
---
It would affect them to a small degree! An example: Modern water is see-through, while the vanilla water is not. Meaning you can’t hide in water if they have graphics turned on max.
---
&gt;Hi James! You guys seem like my kind of folks. I'm a very busy person these days but I'd still love to play WoW Classic with like-minded individuals. Thursday's raid time falls within my work schedule but I would love to join you guys for the Sunday night raid, grind to 60, instances and PvP.  Other raid times on Monday or Tuesday nights would also work out wonderfully for me. I'm a very experienced lock, having raided in vanilla and TBC.  We server-firsted Ragnaros back in the day and I was always top DPS. :) I was the warlock class officer and led many MC, Ony and 20-man raids (ZG and AQ). I also have experience progressing through BWL and most of AQ40, bowing out before seeing much of Naxx due to moving and focusing on my own life. I'd love to raid again and make some new friends!  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Feel free to PM me on reddit and we can discuss this further.  
---
&gt;Thanks!  
---
&gt;Sneeosh
---
I love your bench top!
---
I love you both
---
Not if I sEe you first. ⚔
---
Gotta get those stretched and pushups in!
---
Benediction
---
Well you are competing with other no-lifers in your realm. If someone is putting in 20 hours a day, you have to put in 21
---
Amazing! Bro you're so lucky I'm pretty much ignoring my GF when classic comes out I've told her.
---
That’s your only reasoning ?
---
Yikes
---
If they had a release date they would give you one.
---
This is amazing. Both the cookbook and the actual stew in the pic.
---
How does it taste?
---
No, because besides us having more knowledge, MC is going to be numerically easier than it was in vanilla. 1.12 talents, itemization, and nerfed that occurred throughout Vanilla make MC a joke compared to when it was the only raid....and it’s going to be like that from the beginning this time.
---
We have this magical weapon called hindsight. I remember being a little teenager raiding and still being moderately successful, I only killed cthun once, never cleared naxx beyond a few bosses... but I was just a kid. With all the information we have now it will be a lot easier.
---
Yeah I tried a youtube search and with how many people are making videos to cash in on the hype and making leveling guides, no one is talking about this real issue "best routes to level up while working".
---
Thanks for writing this, otherwise I would have had to do that!
---
That sounds extremely similar to my plan, but I'll be getting Eng instead of Alchemy on my main. Will be getting a bank alt to 35 so I can have Alchemy/Tailoring maxed on it for the CDs and to make cash off of bags/potions.
---
Oh you’re in the #poor group

Dude. That isn't okay.
---
Switch the roles. Say a guy presses his girlfriend into sex after work even though she really doesn't want to. Is that okay? Of course not.
---
It's coerced sex, and that isn't okay. That's sexual abuse. Get yourself into a better situation, PLEASE. You don't deserve to have your wishes, desires, and moods ignored like that. It's okay to not be in the mood for sex. She doesn't seem to understand that, and that isn't okay.
---
As long as people report you, they'll handle it.
---
And gromsblood would like a word with you
---
Tell her to be more direct! If there's a gap in communication, work together to fix it. Communication is key in a relationship, after all.
---
It will be a lot easier. That I agree with.
---
However - it will be a very hard game becoming just a hard game.
---
It still won't be easy
---
What program(s) do you use to animate these?
---
The 1-60 in BFA is completely different to the 1-60 in vanilla
---
Not a shit post/comment: it’s okay to be sad. It’s okay to feel like shit m, be angry and everything in between. 
---
Don’t know the nature of your relationship, so I’m not gonna make assumptions, all I know is I was in a similar situation about eight years ago. I had the same mentality; good riddance, this doesn’t affect me.
---
Turns out I developed major trust issues, anger issues and treated every potential girlfriend as a disposable body. 
---
Looking back I really regret not dealing with it. Not saying this is your situation, but if it is that’s my two cents.
---
I mean, some people just have very low sex drives. Doesn't mean they're sleeping around or that anything's wrong with them.
---
RPG is mostly a term for character development. It's a game where you have a character you lvl up, skill up, gear up and what evs. 
---
For example, Fallout started out as an RPG, but is now an "Action RPG". Same with Assassin's Creed and Farcry now, they're "Action RPGs". Which mean they're more focused on action and fun fast gameplay, and have some character development on the side.
---
Has nothing to do with if it's 3rd or first person.
---
Btw is there an PvE story mode in Overwatch? :O
---
Yeah, I know. I’m just being facetious.
---
And on that day Ayn Rand bot was created.. 
---
bad bot
---
Shit, you call THAT warcraft?  Just another Wowbaby who doesn't understand that only Warcraft 1 models are truly warcraft.
---
Beep boop I am the Rayndroid
---
Many developers have said its not, its closer to 2.5-3.5k.
---
Epic song!
---
That's a pretty easy break up. Far worse if something happens that doesn't involve her being shit, like if she had been erased from existence in a horrific road roller accident.
---
Ehh. If the memories of your time together were good, the end is in consequential.
---
The best relationships, the best, end with you or your best friend and lover dying in front of you. The best.
---
Take the lessons learned and move onto the next. Yeah it sucks, but if you’re looking for it, you’ll find your wife, 2.5 kids, dog and a picket fence. 
---
At least that’s how I tried to look at the world as my conception of manhood crumbled around me when my gf told me she had cheated on me.
---
People also have to remember that nicknames are used IRL just as much as online. During a few years I was actually called Askyl and by some Tord (TordFish, my other nickname).
---
So if I create a character called Shadow, a human rogue. It could just be the nickname. Or a dwarf called stupidface, because dwarfs are stupid.
---
Having nicknames are okey. But random gamertags or stuff like "PalaDAYM" as a Paladin is a bit off.
---
Not sure if there's anything scientific or anything but I'm just speaking from personal experience, I get really hungry around the 50hr mark and then after a few hours and thereafter I'm fine
---
Haha I hear ya!!! Hopefully one of the veterans can help!  I’m sure there are many old farts like me (not calling you one 😂😂😂), who’d love a guide to grinding non aggressive mobs while pretending to work! 👍😂
---
I'm pretty sure those cons outweigh your pros.
---
but it wasn't funny then either so it will be authentic
---
It's pretty gnarly on private servers. Without moderation it's a bunch of the dregs of society spouting Nazi, racist, fascism shit either in earnest or to be "edgy trolls"
---
One of the hardest bosses I remember was Firemaw, and having to run away outta LOS with the debug. 
---
We wiped for weeks on him.
---
i think it might have been because the classic demo didnt have a few hundred thousand people playing on the first day
---
&gt;The only people who level a character to level 60 on a private server 15 years later are hardcore people who have played the same game for 15 years.
---
My brother did not play WoW since TBC and recently leveled 2 char lvl60 on L1ght's Hop3(can't write the real thing apparently).
---
Do you have similar numbers for gaming subreddits for non blizzard games? And probably most importantly, do you have handy stats for r/wow?
---
I'm playing a gnome warlock and I'm just going to take my time and have fun with my friends
---
Oh no! Barrens chat is now Facebook
---
Right but that’s utility, as opposed to the healing toolkit. Also, as far as divine favor goes, it is awesome, but not as good as inner focus, a potentially instant cast full heal. I do love pallies utility, but their non buff utility isn’t always very life saving. So I’d say priests are better at 5 mans, but I’d rather be a Pally raiding, which is why I’m maining Holy Pally in Classic.
---
Also, a crit flash of light probably is still less than a non crit flash heal, and flash heal can be spammed.
---
Only thing it's missing is my grandma posting misinformation political memes
---
Dwarf rogue here too, rolling dwarf is ready minmaxing
---
Yeah, TIL Nat Pagle is based off a developer.
---
I agree with your point, people expecting to faceroll everything are in for a big shock. I don’t know why you have to shit on private servers though.
---
Chaos crystal? That’s legion
---
When does it come out?
---
I wouldn't go as far as calling that a review. Some random ad for the game maybe, but not a review.
---
HOWEVER.... Lord of the rings, done by Tim Burton.. That actually freaking nailed it a bit, didn't it?
---
Yeah it’s awful on pservers lmao.
---
If you make the assumption that they would intentionally upgrade graphics with the intent to change gameplay, sure
---
define women
---
I believe (I haven’t done the math myself, going off memory) if you come in at standing one, you can jump from rank 0 through rank 3 and start your second week at r4.
---
It takes 12 weeks minimum to hit r14. And r14 takes multiple weeks. So it is definitely possible to skip lower ranks.
---
Barrens chat in 2004/05 was pretty lighthearted and innocent. Todays Barrens chat on pservers is straight up racist. I doubt the two can merge in Classic without a lot of warnings and bans. But it'll be fun to report people.
---

Then check the time stamps. I for one enjoy the RP aspect he brings to his videos, it makes the world (and farming spots) feel more alive and natural.
---
You mean Hunter and Warlocks
---
I'm thinking more of changing the trees so they have more than 3 2-d sprites
---
Remember it’s not your fault that they cheated, they didn’t respect you and they don’t respect themself. Some one who cheats is usually very unhappy with there own life.  Your EX showed her true nature and you get the fun process of removing her from your life.
---
Please remember, once a cheater always a cheater. Please do not “try to make things work” every time you are not together you will no longer think,” I wonder what she is up to” it will become “I wonder if she’s cheating on me” 
---
Delete the gym, hit Facebook, lawyer up, block that bitch on all social media.
---
Very sorry to hear about this. One thing i've realized about being human is that it is a miracle that we are even able to function at any normal level given how much shit we have to carry around in our day to day life. Obviously I don't know why your ex-gf did what she did, but she is fundamentally a broken person or has something wrong with her, otherwise she wouldn't have done what she did. Now to top it off, she will always have to live with her betrayal of your trust.
---
Obviously we wish all the worst at first instance for people like that. But in reality, I think you may agree that it is better for us to hope that she gets help for the issues she is suffering from and that she learns, however far down the road, to atone for her actions.

Best race for dagger rogue pvp

You could do that. But you wont get past aq40. And that's a stretch.
---
Dont greif your raid by not stacking up on greater prot pots.
---
Whole new levels of dad humour will be achieved.
---
I think I'm misunderstanding you because inner focus doesn't make something instant. 
---
I'd personally just rather have a paladin in almost every single situation. It's not like priests are bad but paladin has so many useful effects that are unique to them. Priest is obviously fine but if I don't need a shackle or constant aoe healing, just give me the paladin.
---
Sorry I must have misunderstood you somewhere along the line. But I think we may have different interpretations between toolkit and utility.
---
&gt; Please just leave the internet.
---
No need for the hostility though...
---
From what you state there is only one option: Mage
---
Oof
---
Gonna die soon™ *
---
I'm not aware of any good or up-to-date guides, but if you need some specific advice, you can ask in the [Mage Classic Discord](https://discord.gg/ASD4DK). They were pretty damn helpful when I had questions.
---
First stage: denial
---
I mean I understand what you're saying, I usually skip the first 3 minutes of all his videos because I am similarly uninterested most of the time. The real issue I have is the validity of his farming spots. If hes using a private server as an example it makes me wonder if the loot tables will be the same or drop rates in general. Makes me wonder if these spots hes using are even usable or accurate. I enjoy his profession videos moreso.
---
Is Friday over yet?
---
Why not? 500g+/item.
---
1.12 MC is pretty easy compared to what it was before that but I agree, I don't think it's going to be as easy as people think. Especially once we hit BWL I think people who never experienced it in vanilla are going to be in for a shock. Atleast I hope so. I remember the content being pretty tricky which was part of the fun. I actually wouldn't be against blizzard using the older version of MC until phase 3 when we get access to BWL.
---
Where can I get one of these?
---
Yes, definitely.  I'd prefer a remastered version but will play it anyway.
---
Ah cool, doubt I’ll ever get higher than 10, and even then that’s a big ask.
---
I got to 12 back in vanilla, but was pvping nearly everyday and running in a pre-made, but that was like 2007 or something like that. 
---
Hoping I can rank up a bit for some pvp gear, with only playing 3 hrs a day or such. 😂👍
---
Mar Kern has confirmed that it was 2500-3000
---
Love it
---
&gt; 1) Private server values and mechanics are not close to being correct.  
---
How far off are they exactly?
---
Wow, and even “Pat Nagle” as well. Amazing!
---
Flimjitsu checking in
---
Not sure why you're "Yikes" about it. I explained in the main post. All previous announcements have been 3-4 months in advance, sometimes even as far as 5months. Unless they plan on waiting until the end of September they have no real reason to keep waiting on announcing it.
---
If they aren't ready, they should stop beating around the bush and pretending they are. Come out and say "We probably won't finish it during the Summer" that's fine too. But pretending to communicate and then just giving out obvious posts every week as "communication" isn't really helping anyone.
---
That and not feeling sad because he's got wow suggests some seriously dark avoidance problems.
---
If you want to be bad then dwarf is not a good choice since they have great racials

They are overtuned and still piss easy

Don’t forget the copy paste status that protects you from mark zuckerberg stealing your account.
---
My grandma literally posted a copy paste meme today that was an essay about why trump is a good president with an analogy about raccoons in the basement.
---
It was signed by Steve Harvey.
---
You’re right about Inner focus, mixed it up with natures swiftness lol. I tend to have different tanking esperiences in dungeons with priests and Paladins. They each have their own pacing. With the priest, I might be able to try a slightly less efficient pull that could end up being faster, than with a Pally. But they would have to drink 80% of their mana back afterwards. Meanwhile a Pally can do a while dungeon, and never have to drink. When shit does hit the fan I’d rather have the priest, but when it’s smooth sailing, you can’t beat the efficiency of a Pally.
---
Lmao the internet was a mistake
---
No they're not. The same people who are against auto loot advocate for massive realm cap changes.
---
&gt;I've gotta say, I'm with 'blakez19'; your message came off as quite agitated/irritated. :S
---
Luckily, I don't give a rats ass about what you think, my friend.
---
&gt;but that they also simultaneously like to push their limits and test their abilities as a player,
---
The game is 14 years old, that ship has sailed.
---
And besides, I could train a neural network to play any class in a raid setting as simple as classic to play at the mathematically possible maximum efficiency. What's the point in trying to be best-at-show in something, that a piece of code can do better than any human ever could.
---
You can model edit(As long as it's not bannable) to whatever you want.
---
Only massive game changes like realm sizes right?
---
when i played the demo there were a ton of people. just my experience but i had to compete for mobs and quest items. maybe it had to do with when i played or something.

Just FYI shaman and paladin gear always dropped for both sides.

Do that, and get kicked.
---
One thing people dont consider is the skill factor! Eben with best equip if the player suc.s
---
there will be no place in the raid for him.
---
Gear check is normal behavior but skill check same.
---
Even with min/max people need time for bis because guilds will use dkp system. this cost time and even the best players must wait to get equip/dkp points.
---
40 players wach 8-12 items from mc means 450 items with only one raid id per week. speedrushing means nothing because its cost time to equip each player with 8-13 items.

To be fair, you guys absolutely dominate the Eastern Kingdoms:

I'm not shitting on them. They are the reason we even have classic wow coming back.
---
The fact they were even able to emulate such a complex game like Vanilla WoW as closely as they did is...amazing. They were able to prove that even a recreated version of vanilla was so good.
---
But...it just isnt the same. And the people talking about week 1 Rag clears like its gonna be so easy are going to be stunned. The people who think everyone is gonna face roll the content and vanilla wow was easy are going to be in for a surprise
---
I'm with you. I only care about the gameplay but I'll prob play with the updated graphics just because I can.

Though for some reason I still prefer original human models and animations. Running like I shit myself.

I'm always impressed by how humans cling to that ridiculous notion of sexual fidelity.

You are aware that all primates, without exception, are promiscuous? And so are humans, by nature. The idiocy that is the belief in "fidelity" isn't our instinct, it's 2000 years of getting your mind poisoned by men wearing dresses and silly hats, pretending to be spoken to by an invisible man in the clouds while fiddling the altar boy :D

Because there is a boatload of entitled children out on the internet, ready to start the next shitstorm when they do that, and then it turns out that they cannot make the deadline due to some difficulties coming up.

Blizzard is essentially acting like an experienced mom in her late 40s: The way to deal with idiot kids is to ignore them.

Amen.

There will be a lot of warriors but the majority of them will refuse to tank

You say that now...

i mean i liked having it before but the stream totem is trash especially if youre moving around its only okay during boss fights otherwise  nah
---
You're posting on a forum for a game with no release date. There's not a whole lot else for people to talk about
---
You don't need to sell 20 slots though, you sell the kill for the gear/head/bag and such to 1-3 people. You could make at least 200g a person if you could 3-man it.
---
For Classic’s sake, I hope they, in the future, will add a graphical improvement option for those interested. The only unknown at this point is if enough is going to be playing Classic. I wouldn’t want the missing option to e.g. choose new models have any say in that matter.
---
Don't burn yourself out. Save yourself some of the excitement for the actual game.

Get rid of those fungi and it would be good.

Where can I get this book?

lmao youre probably some shut in who chose video games over building a good relationship.

I get 188 hours PTO every year. Been saving good chunk for classic WoW.  Did you say you only get 1 week and that's after a whole freaking year?!?
---
I smiled at this :-)
---
I must be taking crazy pills. You're the third person to respond thinking that I am against buying bags. I said very clearly to buy bags. I said to buy them from a tailor instead of a vendor.
---
&gt;I would not buy bags from a vendor if you can avoid it. You should be able to buy Linen Bags from Tailors for 3-4s.
---
It's right there
---
Yea some quests arent all that great. If they give a worthwhile spell or gear reward while leveling then im going to get them done right away. If theyre not worth doing then they will be skipped. As far as warrior goes, the quests that unlock every 10 level intervals are not chained together. Meaning you can do the level 30 berserker quest without a problem even if you never do the defensive stance quest which is available at level 10. Im assuming thats how it works for all classes.
---
this looks so awesome... i bought the book instantly ;)
---
Check out some of the research linked in r/fasting or r/intermittentfasting
---
i hold my breath untill i can play !!!! ;)
---
Tldr, but I'm willing to bet you're a legend for this treatise
---
At 60 I definitely wouldn't count on it. 5 mans were pretty hard back then.
---
I'm not saying it couldn't be done, but you'd probably need a pretty good team for it, and the first one to break in an emergency would be you. You are the weakest link.
---
On the other hand, if you're doing dps, you're the healers best friend.
---
I'm with you on this one. I'm older now and when I find the time to sit down for a session, I don't want it wasted because a rogue is bored and feels like ruining my day/bleeding my gold by killing me while I'm in the middle of a mob fight.
---
Damn, that looks delicious

I hope this sub takes even more after /r/2007scape

It’s a good time.

---
Haha. I still have that picture in my collection too.
---
Dangerous thinking mate. One right does not a company make. We need to be cautious in our optimism, lest we further develop the culture that says it’s okey to screw with good games. Besides the people who made blizzard good have mostly all left over the last years, they are not coming bk for classic.
---
Great is a bit of a stretch. They’re ok against warriors and hunters if they don’t have dispellers/healers around. Boomkin is a complete waste of a 31 pt talent against any caster.
---
Well expecting anywhere close to the same numbers is unrealistic in my opinion. Not everyone is hyped about playing a game they played as a kid, not like us anyway. I have lots  of friends who played WoW alot (we pretty much all played it), but not many of them actually wants to play classic wow. I know this sub makes it seem like "of course I'm going to play classic wow", but not everyone out there feels that way.

Stormstrike helps, but it's more of a late term skill after stacking str/crit and such. Grab that Unstoppable Force and 2 shot Scholo mobs. 1h+shield is good for leveling with shocks/totems.
---
&gt;Sorry to hear about this  [/rectal\_rocket](https://www.reddit.com/user/rectal_rocket) . Shitty thing to happen to anyone. Superstar nails it though:

Champion. Congrats ser

Glass cases of emotions are not a place you want to find yourself.  Truely, that gnome must have been a so called 'scorpion-woman'.
---
I remember equipping my first 'full' helm on my shaman. You know, the kind that covers the entire head. I immediately regretted choosing trolls. I was looking forward looking like an absolute unite once I got some gear then reality hit me hard. Trolls were so damn, incredibly, unreasonable ugly back then. I grew to love it but in that moment I felt nothing as I suddenly realised I would never look like a Chad.
---
the millions of  people they had playing during that time disagree. Didn't stop any of us
---
This is why im going priest :)
---
Plus shadow sounds fun for some pvp :D
---
If they don't have right click reporting it'll be alive and well 👌

Nice I want to make those redridge pancakes.
---
That's why I'm playing Horde
---
&gt; Nope

*September 29th*
---
Is there a source for this statement?
---
I wouldn't say July 2nd as that's ffxiv's expansion release date. Can't see blizzard wanting to launch the same month against their biggest competitor.
---
June I can see to try and lock in people or late August / early September to grab people in the content delay imo.
---
Pure speculation on my part though.
---
Devs had to buff content on private servers to make it more challenging, even doing it wasnt enough, all raids are cleared the 1st week when released.
---
A famous private server tried to not buff content and be as close to blizzlike as possible, guess what happened? Well, it ended up dying because it was just too easy.
---
Yup. People claiming it will be harder in Classic this summer will be in for a real surprise. More often than not those kinds of comments are from people who barely played in either Vanilla or end game raiding on a private server. 
---
People like Tips Out who are totally clueless.
---
Ha ha what a salty sack of shit you are /u/cantchoselose
---
Which Pservers did you play at end game exactly?
---
1. it had FP
---
2. as small as it was it had more quests than the "entire" base of the alliance on the other side LOL
---
3. the quests were much more fun as well. it was pretty fucking annoying to climb up and down in Aerie Peak or whatever it's called
---
You don't like RNGing your LFR, dungeon, or quest reward gear into titanforged and it suddenly being better than mythic gear?
---
How long did it take for all the goretusk livers to drop for you to make this?
---
From memory there was only the one in Tanaris originally, then Booty Bay &amp; maybe Winterspring? were added later in Vanilla.
---
This looks amazing
---
I don't understand why we would need a dedicated server for better graphics. It seems like it can just be an in-game option (think Halo Master Chief Collection), that would only effect you (client side).  
---
You have your settings low to high, but you have an option, Vanilla/Classic, or Remastered.  
---
Personally I will be playing for the game play, but if given the option, I would choose updated graphics and audio any day.
---
&gt; At the end of the raid, we would split the money, and often times, earn over 500g per person. 
---
Sounds a bit too much in 2005-2006 doesn't it?
---
Me three! Music that you can never tire of..
---
I'm sharpening pitchforks over here guys, still blaming the hunter
---
Being downvoted on twitter means you did something right.
---
As much as I'd like to object to that there's some truth to it. When Tipsout is complaining about auto loot (not having to hold down shift while looting), something went wrong somewhere.
---
\*Katrana
---
Why only RP servers? Why should we have to suffer idiot names just because we don't want to RP?
---
Why is everyone making westfall stew? Isnt there anything else good in dat book
---
So you think there won’t be week 1 Rag clears? I’m afraid the only one in for a surprise will be you.
---
Funeral arrangements. We should have a like a money jar or something. Throw in a dollar. Let's make it a good one!
---
Model editing has been bannable for the last 14 years of WoW, including a ban wave last week (that was changed to a warning because people got super upset over it but it's still 100% against the ToS and bannable still).  
---
It seems very unlikely anything would change for Classic release.
---
When I first logged on in 2004 I looted a boar on my level 4 hunter and got stuck in the kneeling position while I ran around trying to kill things. I still played and enjoyed every minute of it.
---
Around 1-3% difference depending on fight and gear.
---
It would have to jump to like, BDO level graphics for me to play it over just straight classic.
---
I have that exact same roasting tin.
---
Call me crazy  but on the private servers i would change my res to 480 because that was the best res back in the day and it feels so nostalgic and doesnt bother me at all
---
But what if you’re wrong and you’re the one who’s gonna be stunned? 
---
What if MC gets cleared within 10 days of Classic release and BWL within 40 minutes of release. What will you say if this happens?
---
&gt;You could idle in Orgrimmar for hours and meet familiar faces
---
Tell that to OP.
---
No banana for scale?
---
Way more Awesome than the original box haha
---
I am impatient because I am a teacher and get summers off. I really want Classic to come out during actual summer, not August....
---
Hitting 60 on a pve sever.
---
Honestly I don't think we're ever gonna get back. Look at the world chat in retail WoW right now. While the overt racism isn't there in the same sense as private servers, there are still some strong political undertones and whining about SJWs that are way too prevalent in the gaming community.
---
Also to note, seeing as we are getting items in their 1.12 state, I would be safe to assume you no longer have to switch between them?
---
I'm surprised nobody has thrown Shaman into the mix. Not really an AoE leveller, but I'd say they're the best disabler class in the game, between interrupts, slows and purge spam.
---
This is why healing turns me into the saltiest, crankiest motherfucker. I still enjoy it though.
---
&gt;You can catch your wow gf cheating on you in Goldshire
---
Chances are, somewhere out there, someone randomly strolled through Goldshire and noticed his IRL girlfriend getting intimate with another guy up at the inn. Then he probably threw a real fit at her for 'cheating' and they broke up IRL...
---
Eh, whaddya gon do?
---
I'll comment on the ones I played during Vanilla.
---
1. Paladin - Can adapt to alot of things while remaining simple. Seal/aura/buff for every situation, but same basic rotation for everything. (relaxed gamer)
---
2. Hunter - Lots of micromanaging but can shine if you're good...or accidently wipe your group. (involved gamer)
---
3. Shaman - Can change roles to fill in gaps, even tank to some degree early on. Simple or complex when needing micro. Imagine Pally but sometimes doing Hunter micro. (supportive gamer)
---
4. Mage - Everything is hurry up and wait. BAM BAM BAM, gogogo. Ok, let's all wait guys. I need to drink, let's take our time. I'm fulll on mana let's go already. (impatient gamer)
---
5. Warlock - Either a fair bit of micro or straight up automation. Spam dots, fill your rotation or just spam 2 buttons all day and summon your demon after boss. (confident or confused gamer)
---
6. Druid - Can adapt to everything and do everything, but people will also expect this of you. Not really a low bar for Druid. Either you are trying to prove you can do something or people are wondering why you didn't do something. Another way to say it, people will expect more out of you because you are viewed as worse than the pure choices. (stubborn/dynamic gamer)
---
This is how I see some of the various classes regarding their gameplay styles mixed with a little bit of psychology.
---
&gt;  I'm pretty much ignoring my GF when classic comes out
---
You are in for the same surprise as OP then.
---
That's because people weren't so goddamn sensitive back then and took offense and got triggered to literally everything they disagree with.
---

Wow. So the bluetooth permissions are going to be used to track you as you walk around the event. There will be bluetooth beacons hidden in places and your phone will detect them and the app will know where in the venue you are located even if your GPS is off. The same goes for Wifi Connections at key locations at the Venue. This is fairly common for medium and large venues. It gives the venue information on what was popular, how long people stayed in various areas, etc. But just because it is common doesn't mean this type of tracking is "ok", especially when that information is given out to companies that are not hosting the even. Most people have no idea this happens or how common it is.
---
The "Adjust System Settings" permission allows it to do things like... Turn on your GPS, turn on your wifi, turn on your bluetooth. Run at startup ensures it's background services will be up and running at all times, which can be used for tracking. Full network Access allows the app to send all of the tracking information out to the internet, including a list of every one of your contacts, your location history since the app was installed, the history of what wifi networks were in range since the app was installed, and your history of all of the bluetooth beacons placed around the event that you walked in range of. It can take pictures and videos, which gives it access to all of the pictures and videos on your phone, which is great for data harvesting based on meta data from pictures (time, day, location, etc). 
---
Edit 1: The Full Network Access Permission is listed twice, which is odd. Additionally, you don't need "receive data from the internet" when you have "Full Network Access". 
---
Edit 2: Blizzard... seriously what's going on here? Of all the ticket apps you choose the worst one with the most tracking?
---
Edit 3: [Blue Post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/bkd5ew/you_need_to_have_a_phone_to_attend_blizzcon_this/emfswea/) says you can use the "Solutions Desk" if something is preventing you from using the App. I suggest using the Solutions Desk! 
---
Edit 4: Final edit for today, I'm going to bed. I did some searching around and found numerous articles about what the app takes, and who it sends it to. In short, the most thorough [write-up](https://theoutline.com/post/5628/how-a-concert-ticket-steals-your-personal-data?zd=1&amp;zi=muhwfsvq) I found in about 30 minutes of searching states that the app scrapes of ton of data from your phone, including your first and last name, precise location (as determined by GPS, WiFi, and other means), how often the app is used, what content is viewed using the app, which ads are clicked, what purchases are made (and not made), a user’s personal advertising identifier, IP address, operating system, device make and model, billing address, credit card number, security code, mailing address, phone number, and email address. It doesn't say that it also takes your contacts but it would be trivial to do so. AXS's privacy statement says that they share/sell the information with a LOT of other companies (more details in the article I linked).
---
DO NOT INSTALL THE APP, GO TO THE SOLUTIONS DESK.
---
Sure.
---
Pretty low drop rate for raptor and tiger meat out here.

That's not true, in this case she had him on hold.

---
Right now the game ain't out. So the most important resource currently?
---
Sweet sweet reddit karma!

---
Great video as always plat.
---
Groug finder icons??? Reeeeeeeeer
---
So you don't have information confirming a 2500 cap.
---
That’s fine, it’s not about being the best like no one ever was. It’s about the vibrant alive world feel.
---
Put it to you like this, I personally think that sense of danger and excitement is one if not the main reasons to play an MMO at all. It takes it from a cooperative online game to an actual world. The added immersion is worth any frustration
---
&gt;I just want the gameplay and love the idea that it never progresses past 60. I was thinking about this a lot the other day, I wonder what WoW would be like if they didn't continue the leveling thing... like even introduce new zones, but have you experience it for reputation, gear, and fun... leveling to 120 and being able to 2 hit old raid bosses is just weird...
---
Actually, you just raised a great point. I don't think there's been a game or MMO (within the RPG genre) which completely ignores the actual 'gaining a level' as a core progression mechanic, but rather focus on things like rewarding exploration, deep and intricate quest lines, a plethora of factions and reputations as well as other unorthodox things.
---
I think it might be very refreshing to play a new type of RPG where the progression isn't strongly tied to simply gaining more levels and putting a point or two into your talents. Yet, I have no idea how that would work and if it would be as rewarding as the standard RPG formulas.
---
Either way, I love WoW (Vanilla/Classic) for what it is. That said, I would LOVE to experience a WoW set in a much, much darker fantasy setting, similar to the feel of Diablo.
---
Idk who decided this was the time to do some sketchy shit lmao.
---
Sometimes i wonder if execs really understand what they are doing.
---
I assume not, as I would say 90% of the execs I have met...are completely standard retarded humans that talk themselves to the top.
---
Tanks have always been needed, even in the DK craze where EVERYONE had a dk tank. Societal pressure gets put on the tanks to lead, be knowledgeable and so forth, so expect it coming in. It's not exactly fair, but I actually like that part of tanking. Leading the group to a succesful efficient run while educating the masses in proper mechanics.
---
Tanking isn't hard persay, just remember the 3 goldens rules. Fire bad, adds bad and dragons cleave. That will take care of 90% of trash/boss fights. If you're Horde, Wailing Caverns is good practice on rotations and proper pulling. Deadmines is less forgiving as a started dungeon to learn tanking on.
---
I guarantee you will get into groups as a tank, the question is whether or not you will find a healer. Healers in wow have always been hard to find. Healers will have to push through not doing any damage outside of dungeons.
---
Roll a D20 to try and catch the stew mid air
---
Honestly, I don't agree. During the last fifteen years gaming as a medium has exploded and is enjoying a hugely increased audience which leads to studios being able to produce some of our favorite games. The "gamer" isn't anymore the white western dude like me and (presumably) you, it's all kinds of people, who enjoy diverse stories with characters to match. It isn't people being "so goddamn sensitive" but rather showing an increased demand for experiences not just tailored to the "pasty dude"-audience.
---
The "real games for real gamers" crowd is a relic of times past; guys who spend their teenage years in basements playing games and being bullied for it, who don't like seeing people like their old tormentors enjoying their favorite pasttime, even if it means that the industry as a whole grows. This bitterness I just cannot stand, because it means that the discourse ends up being a small number of people dancing on the edge of being straight up offensive while calling those who react "sensitive". It's the same as the guy at the office party who gives off an inappropriate comment or slaps someone on the ass and tries playing it off as a joke.
---
Got a link?
---
I'm with you brother. Except I'm gonna drink plain black coffee as well as water.
---
No. I love the original art style. Current Blizzard can't design better so it would be pointless. (Even though Warcraft III is not exactly the best looking game, Warcraft III Reforged looks worse, regardless of high polycounts and high res textures.)
---
I just decided to continue killing and not loot
---
I agree.  I mean, this will be the almost easiest vanilla incarnation of MC.  But it's still going to take a degree of coordination from 40 people who are all realistically going to have to have somewhat decent gear.  People who think 40 man pugs will waltz in there with questing greens and no FR and clear it are going to be in for a surprise I think.  
---
When MC started to get pugged in 1.12 in vanilla it was because people had epics from other sources (AB, WSG, AV, Darkmoon Faire), and if not epics, blues from Dire Maul and UBRS.  
---
I feel the same way about everyone saying "you don't need to be [heal spec/tank spec] to [heal/tank] dungeons."  Like, yeah you don't need to be, but if you're in shit leveling gear at lvl 47 trying to tank Maraudon with no points in prot, you better hope you have a ridiculous healer.
---
"I come from a long line of BBQs. I'll have you know, the BBQs came over on the Mayflower."
---
aside from very good SL warlocks untrue, mage is one of the few classes that can even dream of beating bad SL warlocks.
---
Mage is very dependent on the Game state, in blues you are comparable kinda weak, yes thanks to the toolkit you can still do alot but as soon you get gear shit gos south for the most classes because mage just scales so good.
---
And everything besides a decent SL look and a Rogue that out skills you alot becomes your pray, this stage is mid bwl/late bwl.
---
R/peiceofshit
---
mage absolutely destroys shadow priest, it shouldn't be remotely close
---
mage should also rather easily beat hunters
---
mage should beat any non soul link warlock easily as well
---
rogue and SL warlocks are the only bad match ups mages have at all until you really get into everyone popping consumes and reflectors
---
its weird, i know my friends are going to read this post and think that i wrote it because i have said everything you have written here to them over the last month!

Just please give us a release date Jesus Christ my pto is burning a hole in my pocket
---
Yeah, no. Jocks who used to bully nerds like me played videogames back in the day too, they just played games like Madden. I would know because I joined the HS football team and became a jock. Guys like me don't give a shit either way about "diversity" (AKA non-white) if the game is fun, the graphics are cool, and the story is interesting we'll play it.
---
You have this group of "people" who instead of just playing what they enjoy, make it their mission to tear down, shit on, and destroy anyone or anything that isn't them and how they think. That is the problem with SJWs, they want to decide what other people say think and do. They want control, and as far as I and anyone with a brain is concerned, they can go fuck themselves.
---
&gt; Iirc it was an old development version of 1.12 that was saved on a personal computer or something, correct me if I'm wrong though.
---
It is talked about in the BlizzCon panel on classic wow. They found the 1.12 data on an off-site backup on tape drives (a fairly common way off handling backups). It was INSIDE the backup for a backup of a version of The Burning Crusade expansion from 2008. IIRC it was just called something like "Final 1.12 Data"
---
Thats easy... There is no paladins in the horde
---
You don't pour 2 years of your emotion self into another person, have them betray your trust, and then NOT feel negative after that. That is, assuming you aren't a sociopath. Being cheated on is not a relief for anyone. It's fucked up.
---
Happy cake day. Maybe tomorrow :)
---
I know it’s just opinion but the Cata music kills so many zones for me. It often feels unfitting compared to their vanilla tracks. I hate the music we got in zones like Elwynn and Westfall 
---
Updated graphics are no biggie for me but the soundtrack being changed to Cata’s would be a dealbreaker
---
&gt;Shit, you also a vegan? You sound like a vegan.
---
Wow, that's the lamest attempt at being insulting I have ever seen.
---
Come on try again. Maybe ask your little sister for help, I think shes meaner than you.
---
Makes me smile... and it hurts. Been healing since vanilla. Probably will again in classic.
---
Then stay and watch me not care at all :-)
---
\+1 You know it's funny when people make a weasel word infested claim, and you ask for a definitive and quantifiable number, they don't deliver. Didn't we just find out private server bosses had 500-1000 extra armor??
---
Cant wait to buy gear for my ele shammy
---
Sorry I don't have a phone.
---
N’aru is not a playable race in vanilla
---
While I wasn't specifically saying that the exact same people now play games, but rather people *like* them, I realize maybe I didn't make that clear enough.
---
Are there people in games media that are self righteous twats? Absolutely. The problem is that the "gamer" crowd often mistakes anyone with a differing opinion as a SJW. 
---
&gt;  They want control, and as far as I and anyone with a brain is concerned, they can go fuck themselves. 
---
Gonna be real honest my dude, this is bordering into conspiracy theory territory. While I understand your concern about people saddling their high horses trying to beat down on people with differing opinion, you need to realize that the people who are like this is an absolute minority. Most of us just wanna play games, and many are asking for experiences other than the traditional model. Just like some are asking for hardcore experiences like Sekiro and Dark Souls, others are asking for experiences exploring non-traditional relationships, diverse characters, or other themes that have yet to be explored. That isn't being a SJW, that is being curious.

Weekly repost

As I go reading thru the comments I was reminiscing with peoples Glory and failure in the WPVP... which got me thinking... When I was a young lad I played on a PVE server? how do I have the same PVP memory's more or less? I think its because you guys are not remembering the exact mechanics of PVP on PVE servers. On a PVE server you could flag your self for PVP whenever you wanted with /pvp and could only undo it in a rested area, so if you committed to PVP anywhere far from an Inn you were fair game for a long while. Also certain zones auto flagged you for PVP from the top of my head I have memory's of Tanaris and Stranglethrone vail. Raids on city? Auto flag, any organized WPVP everyone was flagged..... As someone who moved to RP-PVP server in retail for the last 10 years my first thought were I'm definitely going PVP server this time. Im no little kid anymore I know what im doing. But now that I think about it im really not really sure. I always walked around flagged back in the day as a matter of pride. the only time I would turn it off if I was being camped and was willing to deal with rez sickness to turn it off.....IDK Please tell me if im wrong here. But the more I think about it the better and better PVE sounds. My real concerns in this new vanilla era am I going to find a Hardcore crowd still on PVE? Is the overall skill level of my server going to be effected? With farming so important am I going to want to farm at times with peace of mind? Any thoughts on this are much appreciated.
---
It's quite impressive to witness the grow. When I subscribed, 10-30 upvotes were high for this subreddit. Now, you commonly see 500+ upvotes on a post.
---
“How dare you... not make him pay for my mount as well!”
---
I never played vanilla whatsoever. When I tried a p server for vanilla about 2 years ago, I was hooked because of the game, not nostalgia.  (obviously)
---
Hunters are not great for raid DPS, but they are often used for pulling because of Feign Death and like you said they need to be there for tranqs.  
---
They're really strong in pvp though.
---
Cringey and savage at the same time, I'm conflicted.
---
Let's be honest mate you would've brushed the mrs aside for classic anyway
---
Reminds me of the time i lvled a priest to 60, shadow the whole way. Was rly fun actually. You can heal all dungeons up till brd np. Then i went holy at max and hated healing in raids.
---
Ending up making a lock lol..
---
As horde for the very first time in Ashenvale. God I hated that place for the longest time!
---
Hell no its not usless especialy in the beginning. Example is UBRS where the hunter kites the last Boss while the others DPS down the 2 tough elites. Also its quite useful later it has interrupts and yea me having been a rogue/tank myself know how nice it is while ur tsnking and ur interrupt is on CD for someone to interrupt the mob. But thats my positives about the class in PvP i know not much but its still something!
---
&gt; Amd without the shadow damage on lupos you cant farm mara since lupos cant get through princesses armor quick enough

---
Question: why are you putting quotation marks around the word "people" when referring to those you disagree with?
---
I used to religiously put on the 3 hour long original soundtrack from Vanilla and just reminisce, but ever since Classic announcement I've retained myself from doing it. I sort of broke that a few days ago when I logged into a *[redacted]* but I quit after making my character and got the biggest blue balls ever.
---
It's not much longer folks. The more we withhold from it, the bigger the dopamine hit we'll get on launch day. I am 100% realistically expecting to cry like I've never cried before as soon as I press Play and see that main menu and hear the drums of war thundering once again.
---
Holy fuck the goosebumps are unreal.
---
You could tank maraudon in bad gear with **no** spec just fine, a simple glance at the prot tree shows it barely increases your survivability. Gear might reduce physical dmg by 10-20%, stam could reasonably be 20-30 points under, or 200-300 hp, even a whopping 50 stam would be only 500 hp, a good team could easily work around those deficits. It's a balance of gear or skill, one counteracts the other, but a little bit of skill counteracts a lot of gear. The margin of error for those dungeons is literally that wide. Most pulls could literally be solod by a single mage, even the elites.
---
Wasnt meant to be an insult. 
---
Just that you seem to think you need to insert all these beliefs of yours as if anyone online gives a damn what you think.   
---
Congrats bro, you got your diddle fiddle by a priest and you probably cant hold a relationship hence the belief of open relationships.  You want a prize?  No one cares.
---
Don't you guys have phones???

I said in a raid setting but okay

I wonder if this app will be required to play Diablo Immortal
---
Before my wife, I’ve only had 3 other relationships (and one was a friend-with-benefits situation) - the first 2 gf’s I was constantly paranoid that they’d cheat on me. Idk if that may have drove them to do it or not, and I don’t have certain proof, but I have strong hints that they did cheat.
---
I just wanted to come to give reassurance - play your fill of WoW and when you’re ready go out and date. When you find a person you can trust, you’ll know. I have absolute confidence in my wife and wish that you will find the same some day. And don’t listen to people who make it sound like the problem is you (like my ex gf’s told me) - I was a jealous person but I was reasonable - the jealousy was not unjustified, but with my wife I have no doubt that she would not betray my trust, so you’ll know when you find someone like that because they won’t give you a reason to feel paranoid. That’s my two cents, and hope it helps

Whats the difference between a noob and a rogue.

Well i told you above UBRS you will be needed 100% and you won't start classic doing naxx, and the interrupt you got is on a shortish CD tanks will apreciate it

This game is incredibly easy, 2 mechanics per boss, usually. Very little in the way of quick reaction time needed. The ability to rehearse and plan your moves beforehand. Fortnite is a more challenging game.
---
In their relationship they had an agreement and she broke that agreement causing OP to feel betrayed. That's hurtful regardless of what your sexual beliefs are.
---
It’s why I’m not.
---
You both die probably.  Him first then you.  You are definitely on the hate list by MCing but I also dont think you get the primary aggro after MC ends/he dies.  I didn't do a lot of MCing players vs NPCs as usually I just made people jump in lava or off a cliff, however I did manage to MC the MT in a green dragon raid once and it proceeded to kill him first and then continued to wipe out a portion of their raid before an OT picked it up for a bit before dying.  Dont think I died to the dragon and we managed to wipe the raid.
---
Bruh im talking like MC and BWL
---
Im not saying hunters have no spot or are worse then ele shamans. They still bring stuff to the table but its no longer competitive dps especially horde side in a 40 man raid setting
---
I used an obscure druid name from Asterix, and got reported, mod-kicked and banned for 1 hour, until I changed my name.  Fair dos.  What wasn't fair dos was that in the pub in Elwyn forest there was a Thörin, and I pointed this out to the mod when he was lecturing me, but they said that that was irrelevant, and the chap still had his name a month later.   My guild had a Fafhrd, so the mods obviously didn't worry about Fritz Leiber's excellent novels, and so on.
---
As a result of my name change, in a nice bit of serendipity, the way I modified my name led to a nickname that stuck with me through a decade of WoW
---
Enforcing RP rules is extremely hard for the mods.
---
You talk too slowly when you aren't clipping words at 1.5x speed.
---
No this was the one in Fountain Valley, off the 405.  Totally forgot they had on in Anaheim/Yorba Linda area too.
---
You don’t need a hunter for ubrs lol. It’s just commonly used strategy, it’s perfectly doable with any class combos of 10 players.
---
Why use mc for your example? Mc was and will be an entry level raid. Whit entry level encounters. Almost all ppl on a server in a guild who wants to raidwill be able to clear it. Probably at the latest at zg patch. And server first on all servers will probably be 14 days after release at the latest. If you want to talk raid difficulty you should talk about aq 40 and nax the difficulty really scales in the game
---
Hey dude, a piece of advice for the future...

Please try to erase this chick from your brain, do not let this affect your future relationships. We all deserve to be happy

18-30 is a huge age gap....

Well let me put it like this you as a hunter will be often seen like the kid who isnt good at sports but gets picked no matter what near the end and its like ... *sigh* fine give me the huntard... and on my server back then vanilla/bc i was a rogue and prot warrior later on and i had trouble getting a spot on my rogue even let alone if i were as usless as an ele shaman shadow pries dps pally or a huntard
---
I was trying to make the hunter look useful for him bro... now the jigg's over lol
---
&gt; That's not formula for hit that Nost used.   
---
&gt; I'm curious what the source is for that classic wow hit calculation. Is that what's being used on ND? 
---
No idea who's right, I hate uncertainty !
---
I had a plan to compute (I'm a software dev) all possible combinations of kit for hunter and see what's better but if I don't have the right formulas to calculate DPS, crit and hit it's useless.
---
&gt; Blackcrow's damage range is better, before you even calculate DPS from  AP and arrows. 65+122=187 (flawless arcanite) 77+117=194 (blackcrow). 
---
Why do you add the min damage to the max ? I thought it was the max that was important ?
---
You're right for the clipping, I thought I read otherwise [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20150430054110/http://forums.elitistjerks.com/topic/8267-hunter-damage-cycles-breakdown) but no, clipping is best on the rifle. Pity they don't have Blackrow too. I like this source because it was made on the original game not on a pserver so we're sure the values are correct.
---
If you have any reliable sources where I can educate myself how to properly calculate the final DPS of a hunter I'll take them. I really want to dev something but without reliable formulas it will be pointless.
---
Wow, you really are a sad little figure.
---
I made the dragon breathe chilli from that book. Amazing
---
Our guild on an rp server solved a murder mystery in orgrimmar.
---
On p-server we would build 3 ubrs groups and speed run against each other.
---
Everyone would put gold into a pot for the winning group. 
---
Was a great thing to give newer guild members equip, farm flask of the titans. People had a lot of fun.
---
Man, doing these as a warrior with no ranged pull (didn't have a gun or bow yet) was an early (and fatal) lesson in body pulling mechanics....

ah so you're not good at any actual games. Well thanks for that, that's all I needed to know :)
---
I dont get add revenue so probably whatever it takes. :) but I tend to be long winded and get distracted into anecdotes. so maybe longer.
---
It has nothing to do with beliefs. It has to do with what I am. I could pretend to be a vegetarian, wouldn't change the fact that I have an omnivores teeth.

Not me. 
---
Her Man-Jaw really threw me off.
---
Time for a burner phone.  Dang, these conventions get expensive.
---
its smaller than the others. :)
---
A good hunter who knows his rotation well is always there or there abouts on the DPS charts. I raided hard core on the US Servers before tBC was released and our guild was well into Naxx when tBC was released. We ran with 4 hunters in raids.  
---
If you are in a good guild with loyal and above average players, then you’ll have no issue being in a raid. 
---
Wolves has furious howl, which brought a lot to raids too. 
---
But unless you are in one of the top guilds, who min/max everything, then you’d have nothing to worry about.
---
Leveling Pala is mind numbingly boring... First 10-15 is decent then after that it feels soooo boring, just seal judgment auto attack... But I did ret, and obviously stopped at 20 because I couldn't be bothered anymore. So take what I say with a grain of salt

Man I hate gnomes so much

Sounds more like coercion was the issue here rather than actual physical force.  I’m not educated on the subject matter so this is pretty much the extent of my 2 cents.  (~1.5 pence for the English rabble)
---
oooooh dude! I'm a chef and you just gave me an amazing idea! I should totally prepare some 'chefs choice' warcraft themed dishes in the week leading up to Classic! Not this one tho, not very seasonal. Great stuff though, is that book still available somewhere? :)
---
That's how you see the silver lining. Good show.
---
&gt; Some **guys** would call that a win. 
---
You misspelled spineless worms. Sorry about the shitty situation, it's time to ask why you didn't know for 2 years, that's not doable without some contributing factor on your part. Most people on reddit will just do the girly-powwow thing and say sorry and comfort you, no introspection is toxic. Not sure if it's a self-worth thing, or lack of making real connections, but somewhere a redflag should have gone up. Check out Stefan Molynuex's call in videos on relationships, some of it can teach you a lot.
---
I've definitely been more productive, but that's probably more due to the fact that I don't really care for playing any other game. After finishing reading up on the subreddit I just go... do something useful... or I get bored :')
---
I want that corn staff from the dragons for my druid.
---
It's looks so bad but so iconic for Druids lol.
---
For alliance vs horde the biggest difference is of course shamans vs paladins.  Paladins are the premier tank healer which means priests are relegated to mostly group healing with a priest per tank so they can get the inspiration procs/renew/PWS(if necessary).  Shamans are great at raid healing with chain heal so horde priests are the go to tank healers.  So if you like healing the tanks you are better off being horde, if you like group/raid healing mostly then go alliance.  Obviously you can still tank heal on alliance or spot heal the raid on horde but there are just less spots for it.
---
Yes
---
You know whats even higher than that? Giving Nightfall to your off-tank Warrior and replacing the shaman with a real DPS class.
---
Look, whatever floats your boat, man, but don’t act all high and mighty by acting like you’ve figured this shit out and telling others they are stupid for not following your methods. You forgot to insert the part about alphas and how alphas (and in some species betas, etc.) have preferential access to mating. They are often the ones to father offspring in a group. So if you want for your bullshit “instinctual” relationship to ACTUALLY be natural, then you’ll either be a high rank alpha/beta making every hot piece of ass your baby mama without letting others touch them, you’ll be a low-rank nobody who’ll either find a similarly low-rank, undesirable chick to bang for as long as you can keep her, or even more likely simply never get laid.
---
Monogamous relationships aren’t natural. Neither are open relationships. And neither is NOT stealing and murdering. Some people prefer civility and monogamy, and if they do, it’s their choice, and their partners should respect that or not start relationships with them.
---
I'm sure they existed before group finder
---
I'd be all for the idea, but ultimately I want the game that I played in 2006.
---
And the sad part is thinking about those that have passed in the meantime and you know you wont meet them. :(
---
Straight up ptsd
---
&gt; That is, assuming you aren't a sociopath. 
---
Or you are emotionally numb for one of hundreds of reasons, but be a toxic ass trying to corner people's identities/motives. 2 years is a long time, but if it was always dysfunctional you might know deep down something is wrong but avoid that pain and discomfort, eventually it boils over into this. Just one example.
---
I think part of the confusion, may be that you are looking at the wrong quotes. What you quoted from Kaivax was actually in a post from early march talking about the content release plan. [https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-plan/120346](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-plan/120346)

Kaivax posted a specific topic about Itemization a little over a week ago that sounds much more inline with Ion's description. [https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/itemization-in-wow-classic/160757](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/itemization-in-wow-classic/160757)
---
In general, they focus on 1.10 when talking about phased item releases because that was a patch that had a lot of additions to existing content, while other patches introduced items primarily through new content. I didn't get the impression that ONLY 1.10 items were being held back.
---
This post is pretty ironic. No one here has access to any more information than you do.
---
If you'd spent 10% of the effort you put into this post on trying to find out the information you need (the same way anyone else would who might help you here), you'd have already arrived at the place you want to be.
---
Obligatory "men who cheat are pigs" "women who cheat are victims". You didn't say that, it's just a really common sexist trope. +1 on the "atone for her actions", she is responsible for those actions even if she has a bad history.
---
please dont do sit-ups. they are terrible for your spine and back. If you want to engage your core and train dem sixpaxs tryo holding a plank for up to 60s or check out r/bodyweightfitness, they have a decent sidebar/wiki or you can just ask over there.

tl;dr sit-ups are shit

That would make it her fault for cheating.

perfect :D

Demand for dank memes are so high here we had to re-issue an older version.

For priest, not at all.
---
There are two viable healing specs, 21/30/0 and 20/31/0 
---
Here is the latter https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#bxRhsVZfLxcc0qx
---
The only difference between the two is the Divine Spirit. It's usually taken by one priest in raid and rest go 20/31/0
---
That guy is a joke though.
---
Horde: better early leveling experience due to zeppelins, better flight paths, less quest chains which make you travel through the world twice, easier access/more quests for low level dungeons. This is a huge advantage until level 30-40 or so, after that it’s kinda equal. At level 60 Alliance has it better as they don’t have to set their HS to Kargath to access most of the raids.
---
Rape is equally a part of human/animal nature, so is murdering you for your piece of meat. But I bet you get all upset about those crimes, unlike with cheating??
---
Imapwnu of Azeroth is what got me into WoW all those years ago, and ofc my first character was a night elf priest
---
This needs more visibility. This was one of the most defining features of vanilla WoW. Sharding everywhere will be a huge mistake. Retail WoW feels so empty, even with the huge numbers of people in the capital cities.
---
It´s all nice and dandy until you realize that all good names get taken on RP servers. When I switched to Argent Dawn-EU at the start of BfA, it took really long time to come up with a name that was not taken and in some cases, I simply had to give up and change "a" into "á" and I know of many RPers who used their character´s surname or completely random name and then changed it in TRP3 addon.
---
Of course, if someone names themselves "Bigballz", please, be my guest and report them, but asking for Blizzard to strictly enforce names that don´t sound like character names will only harm RP community (which uses TRP anyway and doesn´t care about OOC character names).
---
&gt; **Kaivax**

Developers have scoured through vendor lists and treasure tables for items that were added in patches, and then attached them to the staged content unlock plan. This means that if a new item was originally added to a dungeon boss’s loot table with Ahn’Qiraj, you shouldn’t expect it to appear in WoW Classic until Phase 5, which is the phase that contains Ahn’Qiraj content.
---
So maybe this is the clarifying paragraph then? This quote gives me a lot more confidence, and I somehow missed it when I read it in the first place.
---
&gt; it’s not your fault that they cheated 
---
It's almost always to some degree, both people's **actions** that lead to that outcome. Sort of like walking down a bad part of town holding a huge stack of cash right out in the open, you aren't really the criminal, but you kind of helped yourself get mugged in a world that doesn't owe you protection, and isn't perfect enough to give it to you if you were owed it. How did he not know after 2 years? You would get red flags, lack of sincere intimacy, distance, anger, avoiding confrontation.
---
They're high key amazing lol
---
You're kind of a dick.

I know I am. That doesn't change the fact that I'm right.

He did investigative work on his own, appears to have gotten far, but still came here to ask someone else to do it for him. Why? No one knows.

Third Stage: If your distraction ever goes away pester them to remake it for you 15 years later. 
---
Fourth Stage: Play until you die probably.
---
I don't like how your post implies that this is normal. This is fucked.
---
They're pretty solid until AQ40. Once people start getting fully decked out in T2 and AQ40 pieces hunters fall off a cliff on the dps meters never to return. With that said, a couple always have a place in a raid. The problem is hunter is one of the most played classes so getting a spot can be rough at times
---
I really despise sharding but in case of a launch I find it ok because it makes the leveling playable. But I would still be cautious I don't want them to configure sharing in such a way that I would only say 10 people around me. That would really kill the hype at launch for me.
---
Yesterday I came home after a damn long week in the office and a good concert in vienna at the evening. I couldn‘t sleep because I was to pumped but then madseason showed up on youtube and I knew: the evening was saved. Love this guy

Whatever you say swinger sex master internet man.

Maybe get your little sister to help you with your insults. 
---
Also, your mentality on humans being promiscuous and polygamist is shit.
---
This meme is going too far
---
Wrong, it's more like that demographic you described was the largest contributor and builder of the industry, and once they made the gaming scene worth something even the main-stream would want. Instead of coming in peacefully and joining the club, people joined with complaints and accusations of racism or sexism. Gamergate is a great example, Sargon is literally running for a political office these days in GB to boot.
---
These crimes make for a less efficient society, that's why we scorn them.
---
How is sexual fidelity making us stronger or more efficient?
---
Romantic and conservative, you sir, are a nasty cocktail in politics.
---
Obviously I felt as though I was missing something and decided to ask the community if they noticed things from a different perspective. Somehow you think I'm being an idiot because I'm asking for another perspective.  
---
Guess what? My post paid off, because I failed to see a quote that /u/TheKrafty provided in his reply. It helped me with my problem and cleared a lot of things up.  
---
You're trying really hard to look like such a superior person, but you ended up looking stupid instead.

&gt; Some people prefer civility and monogamy,

Yes, and how is that working out for us as a species, you know, with all the wars, genocides, gang rapes, and whatnot? Doing fine?
---
Do I need Shadow focus talent in Shadow PVP at 60 lvl or i will grt hip cap using gear only?
---
FYI, no it didn't.
---
If you were horde, paladin specific could not drop, period. And vice-versa for shaman.
---
Though you could get non-class specific gear, but those were allowed to drop because anyone could use them. 
---
Gear that ONLY that class could use couldn't drop, if your side didn't have it.
---
Ah yes, the ultimatum. Always a solid strategy. Works every time.
---
With proper focus on stamina gear and improved immer fire, you become more of a force to be reckoned with for most rogues.
---
Just cleanse the salt debuff
---
Please answer someone who KNOWS EXCATLY, not just guessing. Thanks.
---
I saw some topics where people say 3/5 Shadow Focus for leveling, for killing mobs not higher than 3 levels of you. But what's about 60 pvp??
---
Amen!
---
Depends on your gear, but I don't see any reason why you wouldn't put talents in it. There isn't really much else to pick as far as talents go early on the shadow tree.
---
I'm not doing your research for you. You have nothing pointing to a non vanilla change, and there is no reason for them to do so.
---
I thought I understood Blizzard itemization plan. This was before your post ...
---
Now I'm as lost as you ! Thanks I guess ? :p
---
Congratulations my friend, you dodged a bullet and you deserved someone much better. Enjoy Classic!
---
Bruh, you either go UBRS or you won't step foot in MC, Brah.
---
Well glad to see you’re doing something about it. You and your wife fucking people other than each other is really making a difference in the world.
---
Seriously, how did you draw relevance between the two?
---
And for the record, someone advocating the things you do because “we are primates” should not have a problem with any of those horrible things you’ve mentioned. Primates are not bound by morality (other than humans who choose to be).
---
When I was leveling to 60 on nost, I healed ST as a level 48 shadow priest and we did everything in the instance, including the event. I also healed some dungeons at 60 with shadow spec and healing gear. It wasn't a problem at all.
---
Read /u/TheKrafty reply here in this thread. It cleared it up for me. He saw something I completely missed some how.
---
Brah your missing the bro point of what im tryong to say bruv bruh
---
Can you post the original thread link plz? :)
---
&gt;but losing half or more of your potential raid spots from 4-5 down to 2 is a pretty big gut punch.
---
A guild has 40 Raid spots to fill.
---
Most guilds will have problems finding that many members to begin with.
---
If your in a guild that cant fill a roster and are looking to raid why are you there?
---
Meanwhile on retail you can stand in whatever the fuck you’d like and it’ll maybe do like 2% of your health
---
That's because you aren't saying anything.
---
You are worried that hunters won't have raid spots. They will.
---
You tried to explain that hunters are useless. They aren't.
---
And when it is explained to you, you stick your fingers in your ears and go lalala instead of listening to people who, other than you, have played Vanilla and know what they are talking about.
---
So, here are your two choices: Either trust those who know more than you, or don't and be the upthmillionst idiot leveling a fury or rogue or mage because they **ITSTHEONLYVIABLESPEEEEC!!!!**. You know what there isn't a spot for in any guild? 20 furys in one raid.
---
But you didn't ask about the earlier post saying white-western dudes are trying to hold on to their monopoly on gaming and can't stand to "share space". This is literal SJW rhetoric. His post is literally angry white males resentful that their bullies now enjoy the medium they used to be tormented over while building it, how is that a good framing for the gaming community? How about we reverse the roles a little bit? Too scary to think about?  I think avn085 is correct in calling them sensitive, when you are part of a demographic(color and gender) that is literally blamed for every ill the world has ever seen you have no choice but to learn the difference between words and real action, they expect others to be able to repeat the same mantra about sticks and stones(oh look at that, true equality).
---
I like something like this :

But not sure for all talents in chosed.
---
"If we give blizzard the impression that we just want to play it right  now, they may rush through and skip out on things, meaning the game  itself isn’t as great as we wanted it to be."
---
If you know the very basics of the way Blizzard operates their business, you should know that they have *never* rushed a game through despite the majority of the playerbase crying out for a release. Thinking a vocal minority on subreddit has any impact on their release-schedule is blind.
---
What makes hunter so bad? Seen a few people saying its good in pvp
---
&gt; Primates are not bound by morality 
---
And we are?
---
Because, I can open any history book or newspaper, and it will say "Nay."
---
arent you too squishy as a priest? even with the tier gear
---
Losing a roll on bis/prebis item to some random fucking shitter who contributed nothing to the run.
---
Is–Ought man, that shit is 300 years old.
---
can u fit a point in holynova for DM farm?
---
I regularily cook from this book, and there are pretty good recipes. Dragon's Breath Chili and Beer Baszed Boar Ribs are both usual weekend lunches at my place. Only thing I could not make work were the Ogri'la Chicken Fingers, they turned out really dry for me.
---
Did... did you not read the post? This is bait right? Ehh ill take the bait
---
 I said they will have raid spots
---
I did say that they will have a tranq shot duties
---
I didnt say they will be barred from raids
---
You seem way more butt hurt about this then i do and without any credibility other then i plaued the game 15 years ago, you kinda come scross as a jerk 
---
My point is that there damage is meme spec teir without lupos damage
---
My point is that the class that falls off hardest out of all 9 as you progress and that not having phase by phase pets is gonna really hit hunters hard
---
Because this is most guilds. This is the reality.
---
Classic won't be like Retail, where everyone and his dog gets to raid, get that into your head. There is no cross server. Gear is limited. There are only so many tanks. And you need to organise somewhere between 35-40 people if you wanna raid.
---
That is a HUGE barrier of entry.
---
At the same time, raids are not difficult, and there is little pressure to optimize everything. So when faced with these challenges, and trying to fill the roster, most guilds will not care wheter they recruit a hunter or a mage, as long as they get people at all.
---
You will be able to heal in comfort in shadow spec till , may be 50 level. It's not theorycrafting, but my OWN EXPERIENCE...
---
As i can recall some moments it becomes harder to heal in shadow spec since Zul'Farrak.
---
&gt; you kinda come scross as a jerk
---
And I should care about what you think about me because...?
---
Depends on situation. Against undead rogue with cooldowns without trinket is one thing.
---
Getting the said rogue out of stealth with rank1 holy nova or just simply dotting him before he can stealth severel ruins his day.
---
Against warriors: totally gear dependent. PW:S while holds prevents rage generation from autoattacks, so chappy geared 2H arms warriors are wandable to death.
---
BWL geared warrior probably dominates all classes, so it isn't just priest.
---
Against casters: renew, PW:S and fakecasting. Most casters rely on magical buffs which can be easily dispelled. Manaburn when holy locked, heal when shadow locked. Easiest are paladins, Manaburn has static values, which drain average retri pala mana in two casts.
---
Every class except geared, prepared, rogue who got the opener is a fair matchup. And overheated warriors, but they are a problem for all classes.
---
Hello :) All the animation is done in Maya, rigging too. The models are pulled from an old wow modelviewer program, and the backgrounds are either recorded in-game or through the old map-viewer
---
Thank you! :)
---
Okay it *is* bait my bad
---
Sweet! Thanks buddy :)
---
On the real, it's cool to be upset. You made this post, cause you felt upset and shared with the community you feel connected with. Deal with your emotions however it is that you do, and have fun with it. Good on you for feeling positive too.
---
When it's done (TM)
---
Thank you! The expressions are difficult, but always fun :) You know, I actually haven't decided if he has levelled up or not - he's not the most efficient quester!
---
And that makes sense... But a 18 year old and a 30 year old is the difference of one going to parties every weekend and one that drives his kid to school
---
Thanks buddy, I'll try :)
---
godspeed.
---
Yeah, I wasn't clear in pointing out that this assumes that they are "done" before release and decide to release a bit later for tactical reasons.
---
They will release Classic long before 8.2 (if 07/02 is the correct date) for 3 main reasons :
---
- TESO Elsweyr is set for 05/20, and since TESO is WoW’s main competitor Blizzard will have to react, otherwise they could potentially lose market shares since a lot of players disappointed by BfA will want either go to TESO or Classic. First come, first served.
---
- Releasing Classic after 8.2 would lead these 2 new products to cannibalize each other. And it’s more likely that some part of the people currently playing BfA are waiting for Classic than the opposite.
---
- People starts their holidays at the beginning of June, for most of them (especially university students), so in sales terms this is the best moment for a release. And apparently, Bethesda perfectly knows it.
---
Tell me if I’m wrong, but it seems rational to me
---
The only bait here is your pointless thread, which isn't about discussion or asking a question.
---
YOu only look for confirmation, so here is a proposal: Find a mirror, and read out your opening post while nodding. That way you won't have to deal with opinions other than your own.
---
I don't see blizzard releasing Classic while the latest raid is less than two month old. So mid-september would be my guess.
---
That's actually a lucky coincidence! I was looking for high-res vanilla maps online, but didn't find one, so I took a screenshot instead of the map screen on the character I use for backgrounds, and he, like Gorak, hasn't really moved! I'm really happy it happened though!
---
Haha, thanks a lot ! :D
---
Thank you, and you're welcome! :)
---
My post was not entirely meant to be taken seriously ;-)
---
if you wanna solofarm pick a different spec/ class. 
---
Holy nova is garbage: terrible damage, healing, efficiency. The only use for it was rank 1 spam to de-stealth rogues in pvp.
---
You are better off finding a group/ getting a friend along to dps DM while you heal him. Any class can do that easily with priest heals.
---
Just realised: I take DM to mean dire maul.
---
Hey thanks a lot! :) Hope you liked them all
---
You forgot to read the part where I said “except humans who choose to be”. No, we are not BOUND by morals but most of us choose to have them and morals supersede instincts.
---
Look, this is just pointless dick measuring - you are not wrong in having an open relationship, I am genuinely glad that you chose to do that and it’s working out for you and your significant other. Where you failed (and the reason I argued) is that you attacked people who chose to lead a monogamous life. You and your partner have a mutual understanding and agreement - you aren’t hurting anyone, so do what floats your boat, but OP had a mutual understanding and agreement with his gf and she betrayed his trust - our emotion intelligence has evolved enough that this kind of betrayal is painful. In our current evolved state, it is natural for us to sympathize with him, especially people who also believe in monogamous relationships and would not want the same to happen to them.
---
Yes, wars are still a thing, and yes, the world is full of dicks (literally and figuratively), but that is a much more deep-seated and complex issue than having a monogamous vs open relationship. You can either be nice and supportive or be a dick - your choice - just know that other will likely reciprocate whichever you choose.
---
Oops Kyle is the dog. Ahab is the Tauren
---
Yeah totally, I unsubbed because the game was too easy. 4/9 LFR btw.

What’s the book called and where can I get it lol
---
Ah no worries at all! Thanks for clarifying. :)
---
Hi. SJW here. I just want you to not drop slurs, make rape jokes.
---
That’s literally it.
---
You really did capture that spirit, that's for certain. I got some real 2005 vibes.
---
yea maul
---
the only question is if its as viable on new classic as it is on pservers cuz otherwise I have no idea what to expect and its a big factor for me
---
Shadow priests are very mana hungry, so you definitely need meditation for both PvP and PvE. 
---
If you're going strictly PvP, I'd either go for:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxzGs0bZZVMGuctRt
---
For premades. Improved mana burn.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bx0GsZbZVMGpctRt
---
Solo play. Healing Focus for survivability. 
---
If you want to PvE a lot, you probably want to invest some points into threat reduction or limit your mind blast usage.
---
&gt; you attacked people who chose to lead a monogamous life
---
In what way did I attack them? Not showing sympathy for something is not an attack, it's indifference. You are at your leisure to dislike that, and call me a dick for it ... no problem there.
---
But calling that an attack is intellectually dishonest, and you are smart enough to know that.
---
so u would say priest pvp sucks more as ally?
---
Don’t need to kill mythic Jaina to be informed about the game. The wonder has been completely sucked out of the game. It used to be exciting just to be able to see a boss. Now you can go in LFR and experience it very easily. I shit my whole diaper the first time I saw Kael’Thas. Would have been a lot less interesting if it took minimal effort and all I had to do was queue from an interface tool. You’re completely missing the point but I guess at this point people like you are doing it on purpose. Unfortunate.
---
Well, I mean, we don't argue about _everything_. Sometimes there are things we don't argue about. Are you not being a little categorical here?
---
:p
---
Thanks a lot! :) I haven't decided yet how the progression will go, but never say never!
---
Wtf
---
It's all animated in Maya :)
---
There's probably historical data to show what % of a GM's day was spent resolving lott issues.
---
With that out of the way, actual issues can be dealt with
---
Haha, I'm glad you liked it! :) I am fond of that one !
---
Graphics is an aesthetic question. I want them maximized and as fresh as possible, the game itself doesn't change whether it's 2004 pizza feet, or 2019 buttons on your boots, grinded leather feet.
---
Hooooly Shite...there are NSA surveillance programs less nosey than that thing...
---
:D He's happy to hear that!
---
That's not really the case. 2.1 or faster speed weapons like Blade of Hanna and Crowd Pummeler with Shadow Oil gives the spec the ability to gear for SP due to excess spell coaficients, and deminishes the punishment from ignoring hit and crit, as you just attack more times to get more vengeance and shadow oil procs, both have a flat % to proc, so opting for a slow weapon doesnt make much sense. The spec can do well above 300 dps in prebis with a very reasonable number of consumes for over 5 minutes without ooming. It's no warrior, but it's beating a large number of dps specs. Nightfin Soup, Mageblood Potion, and Shadow Oil is all the build needs to be more than effective in raid, but the build can take as many melee and ranged consumes as you can afford and get good benefit. 
---
The build is blowing past dps checks at every phase of the game and remains upper middle of the pack through most of the game by hitting steady powerspikes throughout the entire endgame. It doesn't really ever take gear anybody else needs. You transition from prebis into tier 2, like many casters do,
---
True wow players are skinny as fuck though.
---
&gt;Sometimes i wonder if execs really understand what they are doing.
---
They don't.  
---
Their performance is evaluated by other execs. Their pay is decided by other execs. They only talk to other execs about their decisions.
---
Being an executive means you don't actually know anything other than how to wear a suit and pretend to be important in a boardroom.
---
I vehemently disagree - you should re-read your original comment. You attacked the idea of monogamy, calling fidelity an “idiocy” and through other language implied that people who follow this notion are dumb sheep who have been fooled into it by religion and society. If that’s not an attack, I don’t know what is.
---
Step away from the crack pipe

Had a buddy I knew IRL who played wow during cata. He was a big pvper, never really did much pve content. Me and another buddy were in a small semi-casual raiding guild and the other guys liked us a lot since we were reliable and fun to play with. Well we were short a dps on an alt run for Dragon Soul I believe, so we invited my PvP buddy. Well, he was an arms warrior most of the time, and arms was pretty trash for pve at the time, but with my suggestion and a donation of a crafted epic, he rolled fury. It was then that he discovered berserker stance which, in cata I believe it gave crit chance, increased damage taken and you gain rage from taking damage.
---
We let him take some time to get used to the new rotation and gave him the brief rundown on how the fight worked. Then we had him meet us at the raid so we could get this run moving along. He did pretty good for the first boss or 2 but then we came into a boss that had a 'ground fire' type mechanic like in this post. My PvP friend is a very competitive and resourceful person, but he's not what any of our friend group would describe as intelligent. He was annoyed that he was pulling such low dps on the charts, even though no one else really cared.
---
His, frankly genius, solution to boost his dps was to pop berserker stance and stand in the fire to maximize his rage gain and in turn boost his dps.  My other buddy was the healer at the time and he noticed PvP friend was standing in the fire a bunch so he called him out. When PvP buddy explained his plan the whole raid started busting up. Needless to say we wiped that boss, but goddamn was that not one of the funniest moments I experienced in a game.
---
Release won’t happen until Q3 (July 1st and onward.)
---
Release date is likely July 18th.

So when is dinner?
---
&gt;1) Private server values and mechanics are not close to being correct. 
---
What mechanics are wrong? What values are off? By how much are they off?
---
You won't answer because you're just making shit up.
---
Quit saying bruh and maybe someone will take you seriously
---
This is an attack:
---
_"You are an idiot for living a monogamous life"_
---
This is a statement:
---
_"The notion of monogamy is idiotic."_
---
Notice the difference between the two? One is designed to make another human feel bad. The other is an observation or opinion about something.
---
If someone FEELS attacked by an idea, that's not my problem. There are people who say they feel attacked by Medicine (Anti-Vaxxers) or Astronomy (Flat-Earthers), and we don't take them seriously.
---
No it isn't bordering on conspiracy, it's a fact. They did it to Magic the Gathering, they tried to criticize other communities similarly. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNazVPH6VcY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNazVPH6VcY)
---
* Look up gamergate. 
---
* Look up feminism/buzzfeed criticizing gaming as enabling of patriarchy fantasies in GTA5 when you have the option of killing a female hooker, but are forced to torture a male to advance the story. 
---
* How about the batman cover showing the Joker holding batgirl hostage being taken down, while the cover of the joker ripping batman's face off his flesh is left up. 
---
* That SC2 player who when asked about his match against a female opponent was given an auto loss after winning because he said "shes going to get raped" a phrase commonly said to males, who are 50% of rape victims, and possibly some of the worst forms of rape (prison), proving this reaction was biased and based on faulty morals.
---
* All/most of the baddies in star wars are "white westerners" while the good guys look like a 1-of-everything group.
---
I could go on but this isn't an essay, To keep it related to the subreddit and topic at hand: WoW is going to have this same split in the community because one group gets demonized and PC culture approves of it, when they don't respond the way that community prefers it's "racist/bad". My family/myself have encountered racist people, even blatantly illegal racial profiling at airports. The last thing I care about is a white dude using slurs that he hears about himself said on the mainstream every single day, Florida passing anti-1st amendment and racist legislation that advantages one group over another legally is far more disconcerting to me than some 4chan edgelords on a grinding simulator. Also you let something slip, representation is important to people, so when other demographics like gay people or black people want to be a leading role, that is good and important, and I agree it is. But that also means every group is going to want to be the star of their own show. Gamers want new games, they will want to be the star of the show in the games they play, does sharing space mean literally no more healthy, good, white, and male leads?

It's good to see other vanilla enthusiasts looking forward to playing on PvE. I had quite a bit of fun on a PvP private server, but I don't think I have the constitution or patience to play perma-flagged when the game drops.
---
The internet is SRSBSNS. NO FUN ALLOWED.
---
Just play a night elf or rogue. I don't think you'll find a huge amount of neutral humanoids to kill. Mostly animals like boars, owls, kodos etc.

I mean when you are going to be found guilty of being a Nazi for voting for a certain president, you might as well "enjoy" the "fruits" of the crime you are going to be punished for anyways.

One time when leveling my debut character (a dumb,  poorly optimised, human paladin) in Redridge,  I arrived at Lakeshire to find something very wrong.  Corpses everywhere,  guards running in confusion,  and then I'm dead.  I'm too stupid to check the log to see how I died  so I corpse run and spawn in the inn.  Big mistake.  There's four or five of us holed up in here,  four or five survivors.  I ask what's going on. 
---
There's a warlock on the roof. 
---
I realise now how stupid this was,  and how there were plenty of escape options available to me.  But it felt real.  The group of us trapped in an inn with a undead demon summoner keeping us hostage. My hearth on cool down, I started to think about how to escape. First I decide to run.  I attempt to exorcise his demon.  I'm a paladin,  this is my lightsworn duty!  I am quickly eradicated.  Respawning in the inn,  I witness in horror as one of my friends runs into the inn with a demon following him.  It chases him down,  executes him,  and then leaves the rest of us.  This is true horror.  I have to escape.  I bubble up,  and run for it. 
---
One of my former innmates yells:
---
"they're following you."
---
A shadowy figure,  purple and ghostly atop a skeletal horse is crossing the bridge,  closing the distance.  Cruelly,  he /laughs at my desperate attempt to live.  He follows my clumsy escape,  all the while my bubble is ticking down.  Suddenly my movement isn't my own. As if being controlled somehow,  I'm steered back towards Lakeshire.  Back across the bridge.  Back to the inn where I'm left to helplessly stand.   Seconds after control returns to me,  I am again dead. 
---
This was fascinating.  They never chased inside the inn.  So long as we stayed put,  we were permitted to live.  We were literally hostages. I logged out,  not understanding until later that there were two gankers there that day.  I was complaining to my friend who got me into the game and who played a warlock about how ridiculously op his class was,  demons,  powerful magic and worst of all,  mind control. He explained that was priest, and much later,  because of this experience, my next character would be an undead priest,  and become my main for the next 6 expansions. Amazing how that moment would influence me so much.  I would later continue leveling in Redridge,  and while on the hills on the far side of the bridge,  I see an Infernal tearing up the town.  This time,  I head in the other direction.
---
&gt; I don't like how your post implies that this is normal.
---
1. He didnt imply it, he outright said it.   
---
2. It is what it is. You may dislike it, in fact its good you do, but that doesnt alter reality. Complaining to people who tell you the truth is even worse than ignoring the topic.
---
It's all situational. Night elves got Shadowmeld to drink safely, dwarves got Stoneform vs poisons and Fear Ward, Humans got perception vs stealth.
---
On horde we got WotF and Devouring Plague as extra DoT. Trolls are probably weakest from purely theoretical point of view.
---
That said both racials and priest racials are incredibly niche abilities that may help in very specific scenarios and be useless in others. The rest of priest's kit is way more important.
---
Are there any items from the Darkmoon Faire worth getting?
---
Wholesome as hell, bring back times like this
---
This kills the gamer.
---
adsl?
---
His general claim is correct though, but his reasoning is nonsense.
---
Obviously, people who played on PServers will find no challenge in Classic. They will breeze through it in weeks. Unsurprising because, well, when you walked a road a 100 times, you can do it blindfolded.
---
However, most people are not PServer Players. Most people either come back into this after years of being absent from the game as a whole, or switch from retail, which is an entirely different game. To them, the game will not be mechanically difficult (because, well...it never was) but they don't know ideal leveling strategies, what to get, where, when, how to prepare.
---
And most people are not informed. They make it up as they go. Learn as they go. Or don't learn at all. They smash their heads against the game until something happens. If in doubt about that, go join an LFR raid and see for yourself. This is most players. What is here, on this r/, is not representative.
---
They are also not organised into, or used to, having big raids. Groups will need to form, come together, schedule, fall apart, form again, and so on.
---
All that will take time, and be a difficulty in itself. And some (not most) people underestimate this.
---
I would never consider giving up a single point for Holy Nova, least of all Imp Renew...
---
HoTs get 100% of spell power at 15 seconds duration, so Renew is your most mana efficient heal, why would you sacrifice it? 
---
Drop one from Holy Spec, 1% crit is netiher here nor there, if you want it that badly.
---
Chuck Norris doesn't need to ask where Mankrik's wife is.
---
If you're a melee you probably can auto attack green mobs and be just fine (I heard paladins were especially good at auto attacking \^\^) making it very uninvolved.
---
However I don't think you can find enough non agro mobs to reach lvl 60.
---
A BM hunter with the pet set on defensive might work if only one mob is attacking you while you're AFK. Not sure for warlocks I heard that their pets were not as tanky / damagy (? :D ) as hunters.
---
Or you could get 2 accounts, the second one is a healer that stays in a safe place not too far from you and rez you when you die, avoiding long corpse runs.
---
You'll have to go PVE server too \^\^
---
I am not 100%, but a combination of things I believe: persistent technical issues, difficulty tuning being a bit high, some server issues, and the relaunch as F2P didn't catch enough of a wave. Then devs were moved off it/fired, and then the downward cycle began. I am not sure if the publisher had an effect too - i.e. whether another pub might have seen enough promise to keep it going.
---
Nothing better than the feeling of getting yelled at by the rogue who didn't look up the fight and doesn't know what DBM is.
---
R vs K selection theory, because at the very least most women want children. because behaving like a mouse and shooting out babies and moving from person to person causing trauma to children who need a stable environment is subjecting them to abuse you don't have the right to subject them to. Because humans have conflicting instincts with wanting the best mate but also needing to pair-bond in order to cooperate in building a life. Because moving from partner to partner is not mentally healthy and produces all kinds of adverse side effects. Because it is the number 1 cause of spreading diseases that "reduce efficiency" (what a weird goal post to set, and a hill you chose to die on?)

Did you know slavery made society more efficient for a period of time? You endorsed slavery by making your goalpost "efficiency". I assume you might have other metrics you judge by as well so I assume you'll come back with them, otherwise you will be fed to the **utility monster.** [**https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=utility+monster**](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=utility+monster)

Ok, go on believing that, and in the idiotic idea of open relationships. You do realize it’s not a “natural” type of relationship for primates, right? The idiocy of open relationships comes from know-it-all “intellectuals” who seem to think that’s a typical form or relationships for primates in the wild and push that moronic idea on others, yet choose to ignore other ACTUALLY natural behavior of primates when making their illogical arguments.
---
According to you, you should not feel attacked by this and we can finally end this pointless argument.
---
Between the tanking pet and good kiting abilities, the hunter is probably the best class for soloing. Back in vanilla hunters didn't use to be very desirable for group content, though, so they had a hard time finding groups. The pet side of things was also a lot more involved, with happiness, loyalty, training and the pet leveling separately from the hunter, and thus always behind.
---
A rogue would probably be a good choice for what you want. They have good utility and reasonably good survivability, and were reasonably in demand. The rogue population used to be quite high back in the day, but I'm not sure what the numbers will be like in classic. As a rogue, you will need to level lock picking and you will have a poisons crafting pseudo-profession. It's a good bit of fun, but like all things it will take time to level. It's not really critical to level it while you're leveling, though, you can catch up on that stuff later. Although if I remember correctly, the poisons didn't stack with enchants. Though I may be wrong.
---
When it comes to raiding I don't have much experience there, so I couldn't help you.
---
LOL
---
&gt;What if MC gets cleared within 10 days of Classic release and BWL within 40 minutes of release. What will you say if this happens?
---
I will congratulate the guilds doing it when it happens (notice: **when**, not **if**, because I have no doubt this will happen).
---
And then I will go into the same raid, with my guild consisting of 95% people who never played on PServers or in Vanilla, and start the day wiping on Lucifron, because wtf is decursing.
---
And I will have fun doing so. Because...just because someone else is breezing through the content, doesn't mean I either have to do the same or not enjoy the game.
---
I agree we should get post naxx content once molten core is cleared
---
Why goblin? That doesn't make sense. They have such disproportionally large hands.
---
Wait what? If we are talking about upgrades, a druid gains a bigger upgrade going from jin'do &gt; Lok'amir than a paladin does. Thats why loot council prios them. Paladins benefit from crit way more and thats why they should go for jindo mace. And idk what staves got to do with this because as far as I know no staff comes close to lok'amir before AQ is released. But if ZG is not released yet I can see the argument.
---
I like the idea of using a virtual ticket like this to prevent dupes, fraud and ticket scalpers but the app they chose seems to be terrible..
---
Are you sure it's undead mage and not undead rogue?
---
yikes
---
Technically hunters have AOE. Realistically they're a single target class.
---
Great CC though, I'd say seconds after mages.
---
Better laugh than most memes!
---
Post hog
---
&gt; is subjecting them to abuse you don't have the right to subject them to.
---
There is this thing called "protection". Also, last time I looked, people are free to chose whether or not they want children.
---
&gt;but also needing to pair-bond in order to cooperate in building a life. 
---
No, they don't. Our ancestors lived in small groups, where nurturing the young was an activity the entire tribe participated in. Pair-Bonding is an invention of christian pseudo-morality, not an inherent modus operandi of humans.
---
&gt;Did you know slavery made society more efficient for a period of time?
---
No, it didn't.  
---
All attempts to found a society on slavery ended in disaster, either because of revolt, or because an economy founded on slavery is f\*ed the moment you no longer have territory to conquer and the influx of new slaves stops.
---
So phase 1 is patch 1.2 items only as I thought ?
---
It's actually pretty great your guild wasn't too serious about it. I used to be in a lot of prissy guilds that would scream at you and gkick someone for something like that, even if it was a joke.
---
Id play a classic with the talent trees fleshed out
---
like it was in wotlk
---
Lol, better than most of the humor just based on how absurd and stupid it was.
---
I know we all have a raging strong justified hate boner for BFA but that said the cinematic was fucking amazing and when Sylvanas scream "For the Horde!" A fucking tear would spring up in my eye every fucking time I hear it.
---
I'm leveling with a warrior, so I have a few questions.  Which spells can I skip ranks for?  Which of us should take skinning while we level?  Am I more helpful leveling shadow or a healer spec? Should I level tailoring?  Or will we just end up fighting for cloth? 
---
I intend to go enchanting tailoring endgame,  but can go skinning/enchanting/herb  for early game cash.
---
Sorry for question spam.
---
I don't feel attacked. You present your opinions, and I presented mine. You did not insult me, and I did not insult you. What we agree or disagree on, and why, is an intellectual puzzle, not an emotional issue.
---
This is called having a discussion.
---
Skeletal horse is already in the game tho.
---
&gt; But it wasn't 10+ years when people first started to campaign for vanilla servers. 
---
Almost. Like I know people have been wanting it for a while, but it didn't really kick off big until 2015-2016 I think. Before that their thinking behind it was basically the "rose tinted goggles" thing, which is fair considering how much shit is coming from the WoW playerbase at any time. Don't think it was until nost blew up that they started taking it seriously.
---
I'm retarded.
---
Dude those raiding days are my white whale. We had such a damn good group of people, most of my old wow friends were still playing, and cata endgame content was really fun (imo)
---
thats a game you retard. obviously im good at wow too  but whats your point? smiley face

Everything about bfa was pretty nice until we actually got to play it. Tore down that drywall of fancy cinematics pretty fast.

Names are just the most visible problem. No GMs no enforcement, so guess what happens.

Seriously, I never was a big fan of most of the streaming scene.

But I really start to hate the attention whoring of all the guys trying to make their stuff work with literally nothing left to talk about anymore.

May I ask you if you were satisfied with Razer reliability ?
---
I have read a lot of bad reviews about their products failing after 6 months (particularly the mice) and it always stopped me buying their overpriced stuff.

But the Razer Orbweaver is the only game in town nowadays so I hesitate ...

The feels are strong with this one

Love this meme.
---
&gt; Not sure what I’m going to do now. flametongue and a 1h?
---
Rockbiter for your 2h and flametonge for 1h and windfury in pvp and dungeons.
---
For me the difference is simple: RPG= You play as the character, not the player. You decisions are not mhh what do I want to happen? But what is my character gonna do. 
---
It's a fine line.
---
Or do they?
---
Ah so Kingdom Hearts falls into that category too then. It's more like a temporary PvE mode rather than an actual story mode. Every now and then they release a short, scripted co-op pve mode that tells some of the story before Overwatch disbanded. There's 3 of them playable in game right now (they remove them and bring them back every few months afaik)
---
Man this is so me rn. I've been listening to it omw to work and what not
---
Everyone keeps saying this like its something that even 1% of players will do.
---
Shit's never gonna happen.  I do my 4 hours of gym a week.  Im not doing pushups at home.  I'll poke around my spotify, or BS with friends.  Get up and go slap the wife in the butt while I grab more water, somethin.  But not pushups, lol.

It's in my daily habit to open r/classicwow as one of the first things in the morning. Even before my coffee&gt;  
---
Been doing that since the sub was under 10k.  
---
God, I need a life :(
---
Never actually understood how people can be so active in the Barrens chat. When I'm in the Barrens I'm busy leveling.
---
If you’d don’t group up for those quests,.. you’re gonna have a bad time haha
---
Spiritual Healing, thats a no brainer here. Youre assuming encounters will last more than your mana pool, wich should not.
---
I always felt like this became a general response to anything vanilla related and I was so glad to see it finally retired.
---
Oh crap haha, bad example. I just picked a random item from a search query I made on itemization.info
---
I really want to be able to find groups for dungeons while I level, so having the ability to do something other than DPS would be incredibly useful to me. I really enjoy healing too. I am so ineffective in other parts of my life that I might as well do something useful when I am in dungeons. =P 
---
I have considered playing druid as there is the potential to fill any role with the right gear, and I actually love the their HoT-heavy healing kit. But the lack of a standard resurrection spell makes me hesitate. Priests get so many cool healing toys (shields, AoE, racials!) that I am seriously considering leveling priest in Classic. I also like the thought of taking advantage of the high population of warriors at the start of the game (I imagine that will drop off over time as people give up leveling them) and just asking if any warriors want a pocket healer when I get to a new zone.
---
Has anyone leveled a priest in Discipline spec? I was considering going Discipline until at least the late 30's, with 7 points in shadow for spirit tap and improved SW:P.
---
They will not release Classic earlier than July. In their latest earning call they talked about Classic. It was not listed for Q2. They also said it's coming in the second half of the year.

Earlier they also (re)confirmed it's coming "summer 2019". Combining the two means July or August. (Or at the latest, September, if we take that weird "astronomical summer" as "summer".)
---
Did you make this post just because you thought the title was clever?
---
I never said anything about 9-5 eating or whatever. I specifically asked a question about fasting. There's a difference between not having breakfast or literally **not eating for 48 hours**.
---
A marketing ploy? It just seems like common sense to me. Your body needs fuel to work throughout the day. If I wake up and eat a few bananas or whatnot, I have enough power to do hard cycling by 6 AM. If I skip breakfast I'm simply not able to do that. Either way, as a bodybuilder I have to eat breakfast because I need to get enough calories in. Skipping breakfast would make no sense for a bodybuilder.
---
Unless you're morbidly obese I don't see a reason to skip breakfast assuming you are (slightly) hungry in the morning. Your body needs the proper fuel to work and starting the day with fruits 'n stuff is great for your health.

'Normal' is a fairly subjective concept. https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/normal
---
Here's yours:
---
*conforming to a type, standard, or regular pattern* I wouldn't disagree here, as I already know that more and more people are giving their privacy rights away.
---
Here's mine:
---
*according with, constituting, or not deviating from a norm, rule, or **principle** * It will never be normal in principle to expose oneself's privacy to such an extent that outside entities have a database about what you've done and how you think. If I see somebody calling that shift normal then I'm going to ask them not to take the stigma off of it because it's a bleak future if regular people aren't spreading awareness of the implications and are, instead, saying that it's fine to shrug our shoulders.
---
Oh yes, I totally forgot the deep satisfaction when you finally decide to put a damage dealer on heal ignore and let them waste away while they are desperatly screaming in chat that they need "MOAAAR HEEEEEEALZ!!!!!"
---
Good memories. 😁
---
I made a practice shaman on a pserver but at level 15 i stopped because I was getting way too excited and wanted to save all those feels for the real thing.
---
Id play wow with 8 bit pixel characters.

Yep.  Mainly because of this company's benefit structure.  Earn more time off the longer you're there and I just started with them recently.
---
lmao go back to your private server

Listening to it since days!
---
Yea, I was a kid back then and was basically doing what I was told. Go kill 8 vile familiar. Everything else was something I didn't want to deal with. Im 30 now and I understand the value of efficiency.
---
Thanks alot! But i would like to ask for two moments:
---
1) I am really "hungry" for inprover Mind Blast in first PVP spec you linked. (Here 3/5). Do you think it's fine?
---
2) I PVE i want to be a healer, becaude, as i know there only 1-2 spriests in raid because of high mana dependance.
---
I still can remember the legion of Dkarthasdk on all his possible variations back in WotlK
---
Lmao thank you for this
---
Congrats you just summoned a primigen God
---
They did indeed.
---
I am sorry, which roles are being reversed? What am I supposed to be finding scary? I do not think I understood your post at all. I am also not sure what any of that has to do with quotation marks around the word "people"?
---
If you want improved mana burn, there isn't really much room for 5/5 imp mind blast. 1 more second CD on mind blast doesn't really make a huge difference. You could take the points out of imp vampiric embrace, but I like the extra heal.
---
Played a Pala in classic. Disliked the endgame, I wasn't even allowed to heal most of the time in raids, but was only a buff bot/dispeller.
---
Try not get burned and listen Diablo 2 zone music for a sweet change
---
This is bigger than the 10 char/realm update!   
---
HUGEEEEE!
---
What point? You didn't imply any of the things from your last post (things which I mostly agree with), you just said "lol retail easy" (which is definitely NOT)
---
And I'll repeat:
---
8 new character models, Having to update all old gear sets (which would take away from my experiance since gear texture models are not optional) and then in the end removing the old models becasue like in live people dont like you seeing their character different to how they made them. 
---
Then what about people who want old models new animations? Or HD textures of the actaul old models? Where does it end? 
---
Lets get the game out first before we start asking blizzard to turn classic back into BFA.
---
Did you think about right-click report? 
---
Lets say an epic item dropped and you wanna bid on it using DKP but then rivals report you and you get muted just before you can bid on the item and lose it.
---
I'm about as stridently against changes as anybody here but that is primarily because the slippery slope is real, dangerous, and consistent. 
---
Neither of these elements bother me much. They've clarified:
---
1.) Sharding is intended only for the first zones. Phasing is not announced so I don't know why you bring that up. Sharding will alleviate a major issue: way more players are going to try it out than are going to stay. With sharding in the first few zones they can allow for the 1-15 (or whatever) tourists who will disappear without those people taking up server slots from people who intend to stay. 
---
2.) We got them to do loot trading correctly: * two-hour loot trading system in WoW Classic will only apply to soulbound gear that drops in raids. Soulbound loot that drops in five-person content will not be tradeable at any time.*  [link](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/loot-trading-in-classic-updated/131586)

There's a lot of walking in between objectives
---
Jesus, stop beating this dead horse, we've seen every iteration of this meme
---
What is sharding
---
He said "16 grandparents" and "resto chaman tank"
---
&gt; There is this thing called "protection". Also, last time I looked, people are free to chose whether or not they want children. 
---
No idea what you mean by "protection", but children need a stable household preferably with their 2 biological parents, statistically proven to be the safest place to be for children. So your tribal shit doesn't hold water and was phased out for just that reason, people prefer to pass on their selfish genes. **MOST** people choose children freely, our planet has over 7 billion people not counting the aborted ones. Choosing children is the norm, it is the status quo, the college kid lifestyle into your 50's isn't normal and doesn't last. Wanting your own genes to succeed + capitalism = innovation = your efficiency. There are still communities, they just aren't exactly as you describe them or think they should exist, IMO. Science has taught us better.
---
&gt; No, they don't. Our ancestors lived in small groups, where nurturing the  young was an activity the entire tribe participated in. Pair-Bonding is  an invention of christian pseudo-morality, not an inherent modus  operandi of humans. 
---
Appeals to ancestral traditions is not an argument, our ancestors were also extremely untrusting of other races and had far stricter rules in place over women. Pair bonding is real and exists throughout the vast majority of cultures. I'm not sure why you are singling out Christians(I know why) when China, Bangladesh, and Atheist Euro countries seem to adopt monogamy and shun cheating/Polygamy. Also, if there is no God everything from nuclear bombs to suicide is "natural" so your argument defaults back to humans being just another part of nature itself, born from nature, which they are, God or no God. If humans are natural, forming monogamous cultures is natural, even if it goes against their feelings.
---
&gt; No, it didn't.  
---
All attempts to found a society on slavery ended in  disaster, either because of revolt, or because an economy founded on  slavery is f\*ed the moment you no longer have territory to conquer and  the influx of new slaves stops. 
---
Arguable, but we could come up with thousands of examples of things humans do that you would find morally objectionable but are more "efficient" you're trying to wiggle out of the principle of the argument by arguing the specifics. Also you didn't need to invade, I think the US took in 400k African slaves and ended up with 4 million in under 120-150 years? 
---
Society isn't more efficient with a giant single motherhood state, mashing people together into government owned education centers won't replace independent families because the outcomes are degenerative to society and crumble over time.

You still haven't explained something, efficiency towards what? Just technological advancements?

You ignored the fact that multiple partners = breeding grounds for STD's, not efficient

There's a yearly (ingame) holiday called "Overwatch Archives" where you play missions Overwatch did in the past. They only put out 1 new one a year, so there's only 3 right now, but they are all pretty fun and have a lot of replayability.

It's still pretty shit that they want you to get it in the first place.

3. Fixing all bugs and exploits because without them vanilla isn't vanilla.
---
There are 2 kinds of trolls on this forums:
---
The first want something from retail to be implemented in classic.
---
The second want vanilla in its purest original form.
---
Very true. We killed god and people, seeking purpose, now find religion in political affiliation. Similar structure.
---
Tell me please, why do people like imp.mana burn? Are there a lot of moments i can use it? I thought it's optional and situationable. Am i wrong?
---
At least there's ways to avoid it by just not downloading apps or being careful on the permissions that each one requests.
---
&gt;People can complain all they want, what we get is it.
---
Yup, But do you think this new model argument will die once the game releases without them? Hell no.
---
&gt;And even if they did decide to cater to the people who are complaining about something that revolves around a "TOGGLED OPTION", it shouldn't concern you at all. Because it's not being forced upon you.
---
Just like in live! Oh wait what? We cant use those in live anymore beacsue people complained about others seeing their characters in a way they did not intend? Hmmm. Again its a sky is falling situation becasue for people who prefer the old models we have literally already had the sky fall on us so now I have no trust that it wont do it again. 
---
&gt;The hell does this even mean?
---
You cant use the old models in live wow anymore... For the most part this was due to the 3-5 posts per week complaining that "Iv chosen my character to look the way I want it to look and people using the old models do not see my character they way I see it so remove the old models" I thought it was kind of clear. 
---
The problem is you give and inch soon people want a mile. You give new models next year they want the old ones fully removed.
---
Me. In a nutshell.
---
lol hes one of those sad people that no one ever agrees with
---
I don't think item color rarity has ever changed. Retail has the same colors vanilla had to my knowledge.
---
I dont disagree, that wasn't the topic I was replying to thou xD
---
Why? Now she got laid and a mount.
---
I really wish ull be right although I know ur not
---
No
---
This may not be exactly what you’re looking for, but I think it would serve a similar purpose. My Quest Completionist Guide puts you in a position where you’re frequently at the upper level ranges for each zone, so you can casually complete green quests with minimal interference from surrounding mobs and even players of the opposing faction. Aggressive mobs effectively become non-aggressive once you’re 5-6 levels higher than them. And the battles that you do fight are usually against green/grey quest mobs that will pose little threat to you.
---
It rarely gets frustrating leveling in this fashion and can actually seem like a refreshing change. Quests are completed quicker, unintentional deaths rarely happen, group/dungeon/PvP questing is encouraged and gathering professions keep up with your leveling pace.

The wait will be even more excruciating, counting every second, with the question being more pressing... What class am I going to main this time ! 
---
Can't wait :D we finally get our game back !
---
Classic will probably be launched in late July or early August, so you still have plenty of time to figure that out.
---
Why don't you just come out and say what you think he may have meant by that, or why else would you bring it up.
---
Perfect! You already realize that out of 7 billion naked primates she is just one, there are many more to come. On the important side... WoW Classic is going to be lit!
---
Yeah it also increases demand for RMT. It enables people to buy anything in the game with real money. Glad GDKP and RMT is banned on my server, so I could have had the full vanilla experience without the RMT cancer that classic will be.
---
I think the word you were looking for was autistic
---
The Defias in Westfall are even worse.
---
Pls, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe Blizzard haven't clearly stated anywhere that sharding will work only in starting zones.
---
&gt; So your tribal shit doesn't hold water and was phased out for just that reason,
---
It held water for 99% of hominid evolution, and is still the norm in native societies.
---
&gt;MOST people choose children freely, our planet has over 7 billion people not counting the aborted ones.
---
No, they don't. Most people in the world choose to have children because they are the only way for them to not starve to death when they get too old to work.
---
I could go on with pointing out why your post doesn't hold up, but I really can't be bothered to read the entire angry rant, and so I'm just putting you on block.
---
Hunter is not a popular class. There are few raid spots, but also few people to compete with for those spots. Whether that makes it harder or easier than classes who have more spots but also more people playing the class (like warrior, mage, rogue), I don't know.
---
Small virtual servers within a larger server, basically. They only ever want X number of players present in a given zone so that it doesn't become overcrowded.  
---
Easiest example is Star Wars: The Old Republic. When you take the shuttle down to Coruscant (a zone, a la Barrens or Westfall) you get put into Coruscant 1, Coruscant 2, Coruscant 3, Coruscant 4, etc. Each of those shards is designed to hold perhaps 100 people to create the right population density. So your server might have 367 people on Coruscant right now but, since you're in one of those shards, you only ever see \~100 of them.
---
They're waiting for us
---
Pls, people don't upvote this comment.

If you're going to be useful in a premade, you're going to use mana burn on the enemy healers. A lot of the time, your dots will just get dispelled, so you may as well spend the mana for mana burn and dispels. 
---
disc/holy priests are generally preferred for premades, but if you want a spot as shadow, you may as well make yourself as useful as possible.
---
It's also quite good in 1v1 matchups vs good geared healers.
---
slavery held water for 99% of hominid evolution. and LUL on the block, run back to the bubble while I listen to a leftwing person as we speak.
---
My favorite is when you say OOM and sit to drink and they run off to the next zone without waiting on you.  Listening to them bitch after dying while I'm enjoying a nice cool drink always makes me laugh.

You know she is dead right?

Blizzard always has good cinematics. Though I definitely think the WOTLK one was BY FAR the best. That cinematic had the essence of perfection.

&gt; Pls, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe Blizzard haven't clearly stated anywhere that sharding will work only in starting zones.
---
Getting to the lotus first and some mage pops troll racial and/or bwl trinket and picks it in my face..... best feeling is when your second to the lotus but got your dancing flute ready to go &gt;;)
---
They haven't clarified yet. I wouldn't be shocked it it was also used in the second tier zones like Westfall and Barrens. I wonder how they'd do it in Barrens, though, since it's such a range of levels. Hopefully not just shard everything.
---
Sorry to hear that, dude. On the bright side you can push those WF clears now. Good luck future Scarb Lord!

In this episode of people saying the weirdest and most easily falsifiable claims that seem logical but obviously have no basis in reality, we go to our News Anchor EthicalPiranha with today's story.
---
You are trying to bring in a "should be" argument into what is an "is" topic. Normal isnt subjective, its relative given the range of your contextual scope. You are basically saying "it is not normal for people to be that lenient with their security" - which I would agree with. However the level of abstraction modern technology brought with it made it possible to make it normal. Modern society in nearly all its facets is abnormal in the context of human history.   
---
Either way, while being an interesting topic, this isnt exactly helping the initial discussion. I think on a factual level we can agree that this is common practice, regardless of whether or not we agree on the application pf the term normal in this context.
---
I've been pretending to be a vegetarian for 25 years now and I can assure you I'm perfectly Capable of denying my teeth their full function. Naturalistic arguments are dumb, we're natural rapists, murderers and worse.

About the hunter:
---
* There are usually a low number of spots for hunters in raids, usually in the 2-3 range. Since hunter is also a class that fewer people play, you'll still have a reasonable shot at finding a slot.
---
* Hunters do have one of the more interesting damage styles in Classic, where you have to pay attention to your auto shots and insert other damage abilities (mainly Aimed SHot and Multi Shot) when it will not interefere with auto shot.
---
* Hunters are not great in PvP, being kinda dependent on being far away from the opponent. If melee get close to you, you're in trouble. This means that the difference is big between you getting the opener, and you being opened on. Their damage is reasonable, but not great, and is better vs low armor targets.
---
My girlfriend told me that she'll let me enjoy my "stupid game" because it means so much to me. 🙄
---
name + server?
---
We should be so lucky, goddamn.
---
Agree with what you said on ninja looting and loot trading but not with sharding.   
---
There was never an instance in vanilla WoW where a fresh server launched and mimicked the launch of a private server. It's fun once to do the launch on a private server once but honestly.. just once. Competing with people over mob tags isnt really a measure of skill or anything of the likes, it's just patience and concentration as you spam instants right over the top of a spawn. It's not fun or good gameplay in the slightest. Also, please stop fooling yourself that it's "Vanilla", it's from private servers.
---
How does someone determine what is and what isn't a roleplay name?
---
Go back to raid finder
---
Running to the opposite side of a zone and remembering that you forgot to pick up the essential quest where you're routing towards. Good times.

This is why you play naxx and not MC, that way if someone fucks up they instantly die and do they can't blame healers

He may not care.

I definitely want to have updated graphics as an option, while leveling I love seeing all the new particle effects and graphics of spells etc.
---
 I would also love to see at some point a some what re balanced wow, where all tank, DPS and healer options are viable. I think it would just be interesting to play the classic game with different compositions. Obviously everything can't be the same, just smaller margins between would be nice to see maybe as like 1 single server type or something

---
I'm not sure if it will work or not if you do that. I have a feeling it wouldn't work.
---
Too deep.
---
Worth trying before blowing it out of proportion. It stops a lot of scalping/duping and means more fans can get to BlizzCon for the original price. It's shit that it's a known terrible app but if you can deny permissions without the app stopping working it shouldn't be an issue.
---
Not specifically starting zones, but more like "in early levels", I don't recall the exact phrasing, basically we don't know exactly when sharding will end but it won't be like all the way 60 or anything like that.
---
That’s all fair. I just miss the days of having a big company who’s games I would actually look forward to. Used to be every blizz game was a sure thing. Now we’re left hoping for indies to keep our hobby entertaining, which I certainly love them for, but is still a bitter taste.
---
Scotty doesn't know.

---
Yes because when a company says Q1 release, they generally mean the earliest possible time in that window right? Right??
---
Since we're all just master psychologists I guess I'll be one too. 
---
I think you're so offended and willing to have this conversation because you are desperate and have nothing else in your life important. Classic WoW will be the highlight of your existence. 
---
Am I doing it right?
---
I just find the original graphics to be part of the classic experience for me.

Every time I see some software accused of being spyware recently, it's literally just a bunch information that you gave them and in 99% of cases you have given out before to some other app or program.

I removed a bunch of comments because they fell into the "no politics" category of our ruleset, in case anyone was wondering. No one was banned, just had their comments removed.

---
But if I could toggle the models I see to be updated, how does that  change anything for them?
---
Pservers have to buff values not nerf them. So if they're stomped on pservers imagine how easy the shit is in classic.

GW2 ignores level and gear progression past a certain point. You have the usual level and power progression from the core game, but each expansion  has been without raising the cap or gear power.

Yes the head developer gave a statement saying, there should always only be 1 kazzak, or 1 world dragon.. never sharding for multiple he said they are looking at sharding "and dont get mad" he said as a way to answer early cluster for the first few levels.

Its ok if its 1-15, there was light sharding in vanilla wow just not the same way/style as it is in retail.

Just let it happen citizen. There is nothing you can do. We have assumed control.

I would doubt it. I don't think they would pay the E3 bucks to announce something like that. Most people who are interested in classic are already listening.
---
Fuck her. You deserve better. 
---
See you in Azeroth
---
I am really hoping it is just the initial 1-10 zone they are sharding
---
They will not drop Classic without more than 1 month notice. It's in friends and family testing -- and it takes weeks to level 1-60, so we probably won't even see an alpha until the end of this month.
---
There's nothing wrong with not liking, or advocating against big data collection (Though there would definitely be drawbacks to stopping it)
---
But it's silly to point out this instance as out of the ordinary, because it's not.

I seem to have survived an incredibly devastating ganking party by the moderators, I can still see my own comments here. I am literally unkillable.

I'm still smh at all the naive people who dont know loot trading was 100% possible and a thing that happened in Vanilla
---
Where are you getting "a week in the starting zone" from? Nostalrius launched without sharding or dynamic spawns and with probably double or triple the population of a WoW Classic server, and it took about 2 hours for people to spread out enough so that you could progress normally.

Spellpower didnt exist in Vanilla. Healing and DPS stats were separate.

"Damage and healing" buffs did exist in Vanilla. Several of the Shaman tier pieces have it, along with the [ZG mail set](https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=476).

this is litereally the reason rp servers exist. let the rest of us play the game however we want

I remember in vanilla running into a female troll warrior in a BRD run and it kinda freaked me out. On Deathwing, despite the absurdly high population, I never seemed to see troll warriors at all. Guess people just didn't like how lanky they were. 
---
Fine for me, my troll mage was quite happy being lanky, rolling in on my emerald and then swift blue raptor.

I'm not.

This deserves a downvote

Very considerate of her.

Wrong thread for that my dude

It isn't unordinary for apps to do this, no, but that doesn't mean it's right for Blizzard to force it on people if they want to go to Blizzcon.

Still an investment regardless. Hope op can find peace

yeah people outrage as if its for something sp00ky sc4ry stuff
---
It might be a generic one, but I'm going to guess that you have a black and decker slow cooker?
---
Yes....thats what I said
---
They could, sure. It won't happen though
---
Post update photos please?

REEEEEE
---
Women aren't worth it, my guy. Ignore bitches, acquire epics.
---
I want classic game play but the current art team to redo all the visuals. Imagen getting all the old gear in stunning high red? (with a toggle of course)
---
Can I request Beer Basted Boar Ribs please
---
Raid healing for me is still the bread and butter Rank4 heal.  I don't touch flash.  
---
Talent points help with the gheals, and inside MC, no one uses Gheal4, most of us use 1 or 2, depending (again) on the gear of the tank.  Now, if asked to watch and maintain the main tank on boss fights, yeah, I'll let a few Gheal 3 or 4's fly.  But on private servers, your holy priest can solo heal many of the tanks in an OT position and cast some renews on those who need it.
---
I mean it would be dope if they added modern casting animations as a toggle-able setting in the menus
---
Someone on this sub told me they don't want better visuals becuase how would they know which gloves the rogue is wearing so they can change thier pvp engagement strategy... I can't even...
---
it's time to start dating men

Back when I played from 2004 to 2007, I always had an Ethernet connection and my latency was about 20ms on average. I feel like the past 10 years has been a shift to WiFi only gaming with higher latency. What do you guys think ?
---
Cocksuckers killed the flightmaster today. Fucking why?
---
True, but it still felt like a big improvement coming from pure holy.
---
jealooooous
---
I still remember my 17/0/34 frost spec I used for pvp. It was probably pretty optimal but I arrived at it on my own.
---
Honestly just new sky boxes would make a massive improvement.
---
take this time to improve yourself and not fall into a void. pick up a hobby you'd otherwise not think of doing. For me it was hockey
---
I think if I had 20ms I wouldn't leave my house.  Where do you live man?  I've never had substantially under 100 and I've lived all over the US.
---
Nah.
---
My girlfriend could be happier when I play games but she accepts it. It's perfectly fine.
---
But if my hobby is to spent ALL of my free time into a game she sure as hell will not Accept that and that's understandable.
---
I will play classic and I am really looking forward to it. But I would be no lifing it without her and guess what? She's absolutely right that I shouldn't do that with nearly 30 years old and other shit to do (that I would certainly ignore)
---
That's only your ghost after your spirit released, the rest of us only sees [deleted] and [removed].

It sounds like she came out ahead here tbh.

Casual Warlock healers are good with their void walker tanks my dude.

Kinda surprised they require every single attendee to have a smartphone. I mean, sure, it's pretty likely at least 95% of them do, but still.
---
If you grab Spirit Tap then all builds are about the same leveling speed. I'm going to have a priest as my main and I'll be leveling as a smite-spec holy. It'll be the same speed as if I were leveling shadow because the rotation is the same: damage spell (mind blast / holy fire), SW:P, smite / mind flay, then wand until dead so you can regen mana. Rinse, repeat.

Tauren Druid has Stun Racial, both Druids have Bear Bash, Charge and the Cat Pounce. Druids have a big arsenal in terms of stun/disruptive and mobility.

But yeah Mage seems to be the best choice, there is no better AOE Damage dealer and one of the best CCs in the game with polymorph.

This is **retarding** my brain.

You mean like melee? Huh. Never knew they had to stand next to someone else to deal damage.

Casters? Grounding, tremor, earth shock, purge, etc. Shaman have an amazing anti-caster toolkit.

Seems like you missed out on a lot of vanilla. But now you know!
---
in the Q and A part, someone asks about sharding, and they answer!
---
If you can't pick pocket cloth, then what are those made out of?  Something edible?
---
Who’s to say they won’t release it with 8.2 just to look back at investors to say “ told you it would bring more subs” wink wink
---
The gif is not actual classic wow graphics, its from the world of konosuba where you could pickpocket cloth of high quality.
---
They've pretty much stated it:
---
"realm sharding is one of the best tools we have to keep realms stable when hundreds of players are swarming the same initial few zones and killing the same few mobs (like they will be at the launch of Classic). To that end, we do believe that some form of sharding may be helpful, especially in those early days."
---
Blizzcon is garbage anyways,tbh. No new games, and the eSports venues are rushed with substandard production.
---
I wonder how the bis items (e.g. from [http://www.wowclassicbis.com/](http://www.wowclassicbis.com/)) change depending on you spec. For example if I put 5/5 in Spiritual Guidance spirit becomes a lot more valuable and I assume there may be different bis items. Just wondering if there is data out there that takes it into account.
---
I imagine that some items, like Thunderfury bindings and other high end items like you mentioned, would be reserved. As long as this was out in the open and agreed upon before the run, I don't see a problem.
---
meanwhile, your Tauren friend watches you terrified as you gulp down the *beef* stew
---
&gt;Naturalistic arguments are dumb, we're natural rapists, murderers and worse.
---
No, we are not. Cooperation and what you call morals are hardcoded into your behaviour, because we developed as omnivores with high investment in offspring-care, living in small groups, not solitary predators.
---
And may I point out the irony of you calling naturalistic arguments dumb, then proceeding to make a naturalistic argument in the very same sentence.
---
That wand was the best low level wand in the game and lasted untill 60 basically lol.
---
I pass you the detail of the system but it works like this in very short:
---
* the top 0,2% player of the week gains 12'000 rank points, the top 0.8% win 11'000 rank points, etc
---
* each week you decay 20% of your rank points
---
* rank 14 requires 60'000 rank points (rank 13 - 55'000, etc with early 4 level being smaller than 5000 increments)
---
So yes you can jump up multiple levels at the very beginning but as soon as you reach rank 8, it becomes impossible. Here's a simulation of the fastest way to reach rank 13 assuming you're in the top 0.2% player each week which is obviously really hard to get)
---
----
---
Week 0: 0
---
Week 1: 12000 (rank 4)
---
Week 2: 21600 (rank 6)
---
Week 3: 29280 (rank 7)
---
Week 4: 35424 (rank 9)
---
Week 5: 40400 (rank 10)
---
Week 6: 44700 (rank 10)
---
Week 7: 47000 (rank 11)
---
Week 8: 49900 (rank 11)
---
Week 9: 51900 (rank 12)
---
Week 10: 53000 (rank 12)
---
Week 11: 54800 (rank 12)
---
Week 12: 55900 (rank 13)
---
....
---
Week 16: 60000 (rank 14)
---
Note that when you hit rank 13  it becomes even more difficult as 12'000 point is barely enough to cover for the decay, the only way it to reach the top 5 players (more or less depending on the population of the server) to gain up to 12'500pts. Even then it's roughly a 4-5 weeks grind without ever stopping 
---
Also note that numbers changed multiple time (notably patch 1.8 I think) so take my number as indications and not as ultimate true.
---
&gt; Which spells can I skip ranks for?  
---
up to you, go plan it yourself, write down what ranks you need to go to a class trainer.
---
Just let him take skinning and you tailoring, so you wont fight over any resource. Spec is up to you, healer/wand makes most sense in duo I would assume?
---
It's some weird wireless fiber solution, but many still have equivelent to adsl here in Norway, yes.
---
That's odd, I'm pretty sure I"ve heard from an interview or blue post that this was confirmed. Maybe I misheard.
---
So do I and now everything recommended on YouTube on my workstation is about World of Warcraft..
---
Precisely. People don't look any further either. If you look a little more you can see the void storage ui got a new ID too, it doesn't mean anything. Alensexual started this rumor yesterday on his channel.
---
Thank you for letting me know :)
---
I don't like troll females. I tried to make a troll female warrior back in vanilla and I deleted it at level 20 because I hate the way they run.  
---
Back in vanilla, I hated troll MALES even more, but then recently I saw a troll male with turquoise hair and my mind was immediately changed. Now I like troll males and I leveled one (shaman) to 60 on a recent project.
---
Once they have the technical possibility to use it, there are no limits except the ones they decide themselves and can then "forget" when they feel the need...
---
I am very curious to know how they intend to handle servers that will likely be more than full in the first days / weeks / months and will for sure loose population gradually afterwards:
---
If their servers are too big initially, they will need to use sharding a lot else everybody will have a terrible experience, waiting in lines to kill any mob but people will be mad because of sharding
---
If they limit their servers size to something reasonable, no need for sharding anymore but after a few months, some servers might become ghost towns and nobody wants to end up in such a server.
---
My guess is that they will try to find a compromise where they allow servers population to reach 150% of ideal population size (I trust Blizzard knows very well what population they allowed on their servers back in the days, what worked), use sharding really in limited areas (only starting areas for each race, for lvl 1 -&gt; 10 for example) and shut it down as soon as possible because nobody likes sharding!
---
Here's Ion's' Blizzcon transcript:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/asvwjq/transcript_ion_hazzikostas_on_sharding_blizzcon/
---
Pretty safe to say they're using the technology reluctantly and will aim to limit it.
---
Taking notes...
---
private servers have it higher drop chance then vanilla :p
---
Elemental fire is probably a good idea in phase 1
---
Yes, during the Q&amp;A session of last year's Blizzcon. 
---
[Here's a link to the question (and answer) regarding sharding in Classic.](https://youtu.be/Q-GobXQTf6w)
---
1. I don't want it, but I can comprehend why it's necessary. The other option would be total chaos in the first days or even weeks, to the point of collapsing realms - or they make way too many realms with some ending up as ghost towns (since predicting the amount of tourists is impossible).
---
My hope is that sharding only affects the starting zones, combined with a strict time limit (2-3 weeks, maybe a month).
---
By the time people enter Westfal or Barrens there should be no sharding anymore in my opinion.
---
2. Yeah, it's weird. On the one hand, they clearly said that they don't help with loot transfers anyway, but on the other they need loot trading so people don't ticket them about it. I would have preferred them to just communicate clearly that they won't be transferring items, maybe even in a header in the ticket-topic selection, but whatever.
---
The sad thing is that this will affect pugging raids to some degree, because the reasons against loot trading are still valid. But it's a compromise i'm willing to accept at this point.
---
If you wanna compete with 1500 ppl on a starting zone go ahead and have fun
---
I've been looking to order this but I see it's out of stock on Kickstarter and Amazon. Do you know if it'll be available again? Is there a digital version?
---
What are you hiding lol.?
---
Doesn't involve gender so they wouldn't care.
---
Ofc it is, it's their show.
---
Enjoy yourself
---
What if they just release Classic with only a small blue post announcement a week in advance?
---
Not until I get to her
---
Thanks for this but this post alone will reduce profits from this spot.
---
I never said bad
---
I had to change the command to !release because an other bot used !classic command...
---
The next Expansion, like TBC and so on.
---
That’s a Blood Elf
---
u/RoeJaz
---
And if you roll on an "unofficial" RP PvP realm that everyone else who want to PvP roll onz expect it to be dead when RP PvP is up.
---
Also, expect a major dip on the regular RP servers as well. 
---
Instead of having a few servers with stabile population, they will make all RP servers suffer.
---
People who don't have phones don't want to buy one? People who have a phone don't want to install additional spyware? This is toxic masculinity all over again! /s

what allegedly happened on an illegal server means nothing to me
---
When a new expansion is announced for retail, people who stopped their sub because they got bored/disappointed by previous expansions often resub months before the new expansion, to catch up and prepare for next expansion.
---
But when they announce Classic release date, I doubt people will resub until the very last days before release because basically, they don't care about retail!
---
Could be even worse and announcing Classic release date could cause Retail players to stop their subs to spend some time offline before it's too late!
---
Personnally, I doubt I will even DL retail client as I just dont want to see my hunter with new  models and ugly WOD armour skin! (I stopped at BC and just gave WOD a short try before stopping again)
---
Blizzard will kill a person, knowingly. D:
---
You pick your class/race/profs but because classic is taking so damn long to come out you keep second guessing yourself and changing your mind
---
Awesome thanks!
---
&gt; What’s a furry rpg server?

I think OP is just trying to shit on RP servers.

Just feel lucky you didn't get out in the 31-50 gap 😭
---
Man, fock off blizz
---
Press "x" on your keyboard.
---
Well it seems counter intuitive, right? Isn't most spell power gear lacking in defensive stats like stam/int/armor? Dont get me wrong, sounds like an awesome spec to fiddle with, but I don't know if spell power is the way to go with it
---
Hated the escort quest though.
---
I beg to differ. It's an undercover night elf that stole High Inquisitor Whitemane's gear and now she's proudly displaying her earned gear! :)
---
&gt; Company does shit thing
---
&gt; Fans and paying customers call them out
---
&gt; Dumb as fuck take in comments "wELL jUsT dOn'T Go"
---
Activision would never make that up to save face.
---
Reduce, Yes. But the spot has good amounts of grey vendor items, it will still be viable.
---
I've managed to find a decent amount, especially from the tier sets. A maximum spell power build would leave you quite squishy and wearing a few non-mail items, but you can still get a decent amount of spell power while wearing almost all mail with a shield.
---
no changes

How is it dumb as fuck to vote with you wallet?

We're talking about ethics and morals, not legally. No one is saying they can't do it, because they already fucking did it. We're saying it puts a bad taste in the mouth of their fans who also happen to be their paying customers.

If fans want to critique them, they can.

what if they just sneak it in without telling anyone and then make a blue post about it once it's already live

that's how I'd do it

Then you aren't their target audience.

I mean sure that could have happened. But don't you think that a more likely scenario (Hanlon's razor and all) is that:
---
* They didn't think they had the backup
---
And
---
* They gave so few fucks about classic at the time that they didn't even bother to check whether they actually had it or not
---
Moon Guard, Alliance here.

no they don't enforce it. non-RP names running around everywhere. roll a free trial character, go to Stormwind, and read the names in trade chat if you don't believe me.

Frost thanks for another video and holding my insanity at bay for 10 minutes and 59 seconds. I love the effort you put into explaining the lore in each spot.

As a vanilla vet I had no idea about many of the things discussed. As for the people who complain about losing profit from their secret spots, tough titty. Keep it up!
---
Do you guys not have [spyware on your] phones?

It's not, but this is a take _everyone already knows about_. Everyone knows you can just not go, you're not diving some new knowledge on everyone, your comment brings nothing to the discussion.

The resto tree offers better stuff than ele or enh. If you go full ele pvp your still going down the resto tree 21 pts for natures swiftness. This is why resto pvp is the best. What you lack is reduced cast time bolts/chains, reduced cooldown shocks, and increased range and crit chance. What you get is survivability. Ele and enhance can burst but lose most 1v1. Resto sham rarely lose 1v1. The most op class, hunter, is a flee to a resto sham. Any1 without a spell lock ability is toast. No one can outrun you once u get r6 boots. You still get full damage shocks and instant cast ability so can burst amazing dmg as a healer. You got the right idea, resto sham in spell power gear is good times. In bg/group world pvp mp5 prio pry better as you spend half the time moving totems and purging anyway.
---
Rack up those points brah
---
WoW is not going to solve any of your personal problems. You are delusional and with time you'll realize.

It wasn't loot trading. It was called asking a GM to fix a miss looted object which could take days to fix.

---
Very novel post, OP. I don't recall anyone bringing these up every day since we knew about sharing and loot trading. /s
---
Your main problem is you only have one natures swiftness, so you are vulnerable to interrupts. The main strengths of more talents in elemental is higher critt damage, longer cast range and more shorter cast times lightning spells.  It is alsow hard to justify spellhitt in the resto tree when making a healing spec. When playing vs a shaman it is the burst that kills you. If he/she gets to jump you lightning bolt chain lightning and frost shock hits almost the same time and if any of them critts you are dead
---
Sorry, on mobile right now, but if you go to the desktop site, you'll see on the right side bar a link to all the past LFG posts, and we repost one every Monday (that stays stickied through Wednesday). You can also search for "LFG Monday" and it should pop up.
---
Just going to have to hard disagree. I love hearing about the lore of the zones. It’s not like you are on a time limit to know where these farming zones are, Classic ain’t here yet bud.

No worry Tauren friend, my belly full !
---
Thats my internet now. Australia sucks
---
It's not rushed if it's within the release window they announced and then then confirmed.
---
This is by far my favorite rags to riches so far. There’s little to no discrepancy in level or gear he is working with that won’t be used in classic, there is no emphasis on potential rare item drops I know I’ll never get anyway, and the transparency regarding item prices and loot tables was excellent as well. Great video Frost, keep ‘em coming.
---
Because everyone knows that owning a smartphone is a prerequisite to being rich. Dumbass.
---
I’m gonna use all 50 character slots to replay through Teldrassil over and over again

I just want it so i can play it.... That's all. I'm playing every other mmo in the market (FF14 is actually not bad!) to pass the months... Trying to fill the void after I got so fucking bored with retail wow.
---
I literally have a discord of people just waiting for this, just come out already!
---
I remember in my raids for progression people played strictly what was best. But for farm, ZG, we were very lenient. Fury 2h dps, moonkins, people healing in balance, arms warrs and ret palas and non-warr tanks it didn't matter too much
---
Indeed,
---
Option to toggle auto-loot instead of pressing shift, fine. Zero problems.
---
Option for AoE loot, which like you said CAN and WOULD have large impacts on gold per hour especially for aoe grinders is real and should never be added.  Being able to instantly loot all ~100 elites if you do a SM Cath run by aoe'ing the whole place down would *dramatically* speed up run time and by consequence gold per hour.  Same applies to any other aoe grind spot (Northern STV trolls, WPL farms, SM aoe runs, etc.)
---
no u

Im sorry... what?

Skipping air totem quest so you can add that 30% movement/casting/melee buff to your world buffs for your first 60 raid is the real madman move

You don’t have to be hiding ANYTHING but willfully giving up your rights is beyond being just braindead.
---
False
---
They only started dropping in TBC prepatch. The only **Exception was light forge and the elements, which did not actually have a class restriction.  I.e. you could have a paladin in full wildheart or a rogue in full devout, and more often you'd see ret paladins in full valor (or at least valor shoulders) as it gave more dps.
---
Maybe I'll see you fishing sometime
---
Yours looks better.
---
This is great thanks for explaining. I have no aspirations of getting beyond rank 10, but hopefully I can get there at some point 👍😂
---
Won't do shit, have fun with your masochistic self harm
---
They’re waiting to give a date so that when they do they’re confident it’ll be released in time. The only thing more annoying than not knowing when it will release is requesting vacation time to play it and have it delayed by a month. 
---
I get that we all want a release date, but a little bit of patience goes a long way over these next few months.
---
Healed from day 1 release and just leveled a priest on a large pserver. No one died in sfk on my watch in full shadow and it wasn't even close. I know what you're saying, but a lot more people know how this game works than you think.
---
Sound logic!
---
I can only imagine this sub come release day. Its going to be beautiful. We all have been waiting for so long....and for it to finally be here... it will beyond words. The sub will just be one collective nerdgasm.
---
Gatta admit, Plat's videos are pretty damn entertaining.
---
It doesnt matter, I have a right to hide it because it's my shit.
---
Waiting for it to come out is probably the worst thing I’ve felt
---
when wow came out, i was 13. i bought gold by borrowing a credit card, it was 100G. As soon as i hit 60 ( wanted to buy an epic item) i got banned 3 days later. perma banned. my first 60. gone, had to explain to my parents that i needed to buy the whole game again and pay for the subscription all over again because what i did was against the game rules and they didnt buy it for me. i had to save up for another couple of months to do it all myself. i wouldnt buy gold again
---
Lots of people have denied access to these apps from the beginning. Now Blizz is compelling them to grant the app access to their data in order to enter Blizzcon. That's the difference and that's why it is abnormal.
---
My Razer Ornata got bricked and I have no clue why.
---
Razer does one thing well and that's RBG.

Other than that, total shite. There's so much better stuff out there. Just visit mechanicalkeyboards.com
---
As someone who quit after TBC, this is actually an interesting read.
---
I keep seeing complaints here about retail, like "Man I'll be glad to play OG WoW again, back when there weren't motorcycles and auto-raid healcast jargon flim flam".
---
"Yeah, they totally ruined the game with hyper toy box specializations and the account-wide auto unicorn finder."
---
And I'm just sitting here like "what the hell is all that".
---
But what if I'm the son of a video game nerd who named his son "XxxGnomeSTompperxxX" and I RP as such?
---
I also have the vanilla soundtrack on repeat at work. It keeps me relaxed and more productive!  Trust me guys you will not burn out. I have played on a pserver for the past year and currently raid 2 nights a week. Vanilla is just that f'n good, I still get feels everytime I  log in haha. I'm so stoked for Classic, zero burn out from me!
---
No apparent reason
---
Let me guess, you want them to change the realm sizes instead and ruin the community aspect of the game
---
That's not true. Source: my C levels are competent as fuck.

I was thinking about this today. Could you elaborate on this? Do the bombs etc actually do a decent amount of damage so that they speed up leveling? What other items are useful for low level characters?

It took me a hot second to understand the title lol

im sure you will! haha

---
Hey guys,
---
 I played from TBC to end of WotLK mainly as a Resto Druid and Affli Lock. I am wondering how those will fair in classic raids (no pvp). I hear lock can only have a few dots on at once and only spams shadowbolt while druid is a lackluster healer who is an innervate bot and only 1 res. Anyone else have any input if I will be wanted in raids? 
---
Thank you
---
Let me repeat what I've said in other sharding posts.
---
 **Never in Vanillas history did it involve 800 people in Northshire. You are confusing what was Vanilla with what your Vanilla pserver experience was like.**
---
&gt;Gameplay mechanics are just really important to a lot of people.
---
Of course, but if you like swinging a sword up front, you aint gonna like casting healing spells from the back, you understand? 
---
That was my point, but i can see from the downvotes i apparently didnt make myself clear on that. 
---
Peace out.
---
What a dumbass thing to say lmao
---
This may be the way to go thanks a lot.
---
Gee wiz, a totally unmoderated zero cost entry game with 4-7x original population sizes leads to far more ironic and inflamatory shit posting?

In my opinion it's possible to get up to rank 10 without giving up your life outside the game so if you want it, you'll get it.
---
That being said, it's not a walk in the park either: I'd say that as soon as you hit rank 7 (which happen rather naturally if you PvP a lot) you have to join a BG team or PvP guild and dedicate a month or two of regular playtime.
---
I'm sorry bud. Whenever I'm down and out, depressed, I turn to games and it's been almost exclusively WoW for the past 12 years. It's important to take care of yourself however, but it sure is nice to have free time!
---
Nah

#NOCHANGES
---
This is the most Chad post I've ever seen. Are you trolling?
---
U dont have to spec prot to tank/holy to be viable in low level dungeons.  Something to keep in mind.
---
Wow. she talks to you like you’re a child.
---
What is RBG ?
---
The problem is I don't want a standard keyboard, I want a pad but Logitech doesn't produce the G13 anymore.
---
Its just like one big happy family now, its the best time for any game subreddit.
---
Thanks

_"water doesn't boil at 100°C, I once saw it boiling at 86°C!"_
---
The thing left out from that story: That was at base camp II on the side of Mount Everest.
---
I actually don't think it's gonna be as bad as it is on pservers.  Reasons:
---
1) Less populated
---
2) No honor system in the game in phase 1, therefore no rank 3 discount for mount, no incentive to kill other faction.
---
How would you recommend getting gold as a shaman in phase 1?
---
No, just ignoring trolls.
---
And every choice you finally think are set in stone could be completely scrapped once Classic is released lol
---
Full enchanted twill set (the highest lvl grey armor) and a broom with crusader
---
We want release Ash that’s what we want
---
I'm not alone, thank you
---
Spirit guidance is 25% of spirit as spell power/healing .. the difference is insignificant, since your deviation from the bis list will provide so little power at the cost of all other stats most likely.
---
That's not [universally] true. Of course there are shitty execs. Being incompetent is not a requirement though.
---
Hey Mooshieeee,
---
Grinding spots with beasts. Mobs that have grey items in their loot table. They stack and go for a pretty price on the vendor.
---
As a shaman having skinning will also boost your income/hour as leather sells decent on the AH, at least thick and rugged. If not, the early leather can be vendored for a good price.
---
As an engineer, it was always Gadgetzan, fuck Everlook
---
Bring it in for a hug brother.. *whispers* "You ARE gonna play alliance tho right?"
---
I think with the amount of new people playing this will be a bigger problem then ever! I’m lucky enough to have a pro tank in my RL friend group. I really feel bad for others having to find one it’s going to be tuff. Best bet is make friends with good warriors and hope they will run 5 mans with you.
---
He hates gnomes
---
fucking laughed in my cup of coffee, thanks for this lol
---
Back in 2004 when it first came out, awesome!
---
What are you on about... ? Who the fuck doesn't have a smartphone in 2019?
---
And roues, the armor really does help against rogue, who are honestly a problem for a lot of caster.
---
As you said, the druids simply outlasted my mana pool by bearshifting and having HoTs up all the time.
---
As for rogues, if I would outlast their first stunlock they were dead because I was undead. PWS myself, then plague and SWP, then vampiric touch for sustain and mindflay for extra stuns. I was in blues and beating full-epic rogues.
---
20min ? That long? Omg I need to farm :-)
---
Oh I see, you can't substantiate any of your claims. You're just spouting bullshit like every other moron on reddit.
---
Dear Blizzard,
---
I know you'll never read this letter because you're actually just a corporation--a fictitious person.  You're not actually going to read this letter.  Given these circumstances, it's a wonder I even addressed the letter to you or am still continue to write it now.  Since none of that makes sense, I'm going to post this letter on Reddit for others to see and talk about without asking the obvious question as to why I decided to write "Dear Blizzard" on a post addressed to a bunch of anonymous folks on a WoW-related subreddit.
---
I love this guy's videos - one of my fastest subs ever.
---
There's a point you reach where it goes from being a hobby to being a weeb lifestyle.
---
&gt; It's like a novel about a game dying a slow death.
---
I can't wait until it's revealed Classic's fanbase is way smaller than Retail's so we  can do away with this hipster shit.
---
I’ve never been in a 40 man raid with more than 3 hunters tops, their literally carried to kite, buff mele groups with trueshot aura and to tranq shit.
---
My list goes: Hunter&gt;rogue&gt;mage&gt;warlock&gt;sham&gt;pal&gt;priest&gt;druid&gt;war.  Bg/grp pvp is warrior&gt;everyone else.
---
Clearing a bunch of mobs around a node or a chest. Then as you are killing the last mob someone runs in and takes it.
---
&gt; I find people are odd about **graphics**. I want to play Vanilla for **the game itself**
---
What if I told you good games have both
---
Damn that UI is clean. What addons do you use?
---
&gt; Modern water is see-through, while the vanilla water is not. Meaning you can’t hide in water if they have graphics turned on max.
---
You can mouseover people, see their names, or nameplates.
---
And how much pvp do you do in water anyway.
---
Basically pick pocket loot tables are different than regular loot tables.
---
He made an alt to ask
---
I agree, honestly I'd prefer there was an option for the new models.  But for all the game systems etc I'm 100% #nochanges.
---
There is just something special with old box art. They had to be good, just like a book cover it's what sold the game.
---
Haha perhaps, ive played myself since vanilla but i were like 10 y/o and Only made it to 40 before tbc came out. But Yeah might be fun being s tank.
---
Greater rage potions
---
People of all ages cry all the time, for a variety of reasons.
---
The funniest part about this post is that you will gladly give Blizzard $15 a month for one update every 5 months but then bitch about microtransactions in other games, hahahahah
---
Because some people actually do remain monogamous for their entire life and they actually enjoy that bond with one person.  It’s a choice... it’s not impossible. 
---
If having one exclusive sexual partner at a time is not for you then that’s ok! 
---
However, there are many behaviours that primates exhibit that if all humans did would be quite negative and destructive in a human society. 
---
So, What you’re proposing above is a logical fallacy.
---
Only when my bags are full at like level 7 and I gotta go sell stuff by running all of the way back to a vendor and can’t just throw things away because cooking, silver, first aid...fuck I’m getting all choked up just thinking about it
---
I think in most cases both sexes are victims, often of their surroundings or of circumstances. It’s really easy for people to say “X cheated therefore they are a bad person” and gloss over the emotional issues that may have led to that.
---
I have no doubt in my mind that some people are remorseless twats or psychopaths that do bad things. Once again, this applies to men and women. Everyone ultimately must deal with the consequences of their actions, but I believe that most people are good and with proper therapy and help probably could avoid situations like OP.
---
Lmao
---
When you just hit max level, wouldn´t you then have mostly gear with +int or a large mana pool that % mana scales better of? And lateron when you get +healing gear switch talents?
---
2 Humans and a Gnome.

Good luck finding a raid spot.

Chuck Norris knows what Mankrik wife was doing alone in a tent far from Crossroads...

That was taken into consideration, I was speaking about obvious loot BIS upgrades dropping and then making no attempt to bid

Best item to pick pocket. . . Pet rock from a mob in Azshara. https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Timbermaw_Shaman
---
I will be buying one of these since I won't have a rouge of my own.
---
What is the second t for?
---
Personally I believe this is the best way to play. the main issue with classic I feel is that everyone is so attuned to play as optimally and min/max as possible from current WoW and all other MMOs. MMORPGs have changed and adapted to that mindset. 
---
I plan on reading every quest log as story is my favourite part of a RPG, I will be exploring as much as possible as well. 
---
I will be doing whatever I want, whenever I want and I hope to fish along side you, OP!
---
druid too, + easy dungeon invites as tank, dps or healer depending what offset gear you wanna collect!
---
Never understood why people are so deadly afraid of companies having their data.
---
They already got all your data as long as you use any social media at all, and its not like they kill you with it. I honestly could not care less if Blizzard could see my photos or what I browse etc. For real
---
shockadin spec for 60-70 is interestingly fast, strong and smoother than retri. You can also heal in dungs. You were ahead of time back then
---
lmfao I know your pain friend
---
Do you want to become the grand marshal? Then you have to min/max your golemagg rotation. Best spec for that is shadow word pain. Also if you want to make fast gold then you have to AOE farm the flightmasters. They dont always drop but when they do, jackpot. Just some tips from the year that I played legion.
---
Wait, are you saying if I'm in a guild and there is a roster, then your roster will go from 4 slots to 2?  And if so with Lupos are you thinking the raid viability will take a clear hit from the earlier iterations and you'll be left in LFG chat without a shoulder to cry on?  Is that what you meant?  
---
If so I agree.  PM me and we can discuss more.
---
Wait, what? You should be able to get 20-50ish literally anywhere in the US as long as there are game servers in your region. What games do you play that you're nearly at 100ms?
---
If you want 2h melee the best option is horde war. And yes wars do amazing dps and groups will invite dps wars as often as any other dpser. Very fun class to play you wont be dissapointed.
---
thinking a company like blizzard doesn't have backups of their biggest game is beyond naive.
---
Yeah basically everyone got into it already.
---
Patch 8.2 is already in motion and even if we dont have a date, it's close to being ready. It's up on PTRs and getting ready for deployment. 
---
They mentioned that classic will be released in their earning statement in Q2 still so there's still that evidence as well. Which means July or later time frame. 
---
I'm fully expecting a late may early June for 8.2 release which would give them a month or two before classic launches. This means it will happen after world firsts and the hype dies off.
---
No one thinks everyone will. But everyone knows some will. 
---
Beyond that, mechanics in mc/ony/bwl/zg have been rehashed a million times.
---
If upon starting a new encounter you’re not reading debuff a as they get applied to you you’re bad. If when you see curses go up as a mage or Druid and your first reaction isn’t to de curse you’re bad. 
---
All you have to do to beat the t1 and t2 is read. Compare to mythic bosses, read the dungeon journal all you want, you will need to develop your own refined strat to beat the boss. 
---
Magmadar is literally tranq shot + don’t stand in fire
---
My boss still has a Nokia phone. He is def not poor
---
Going off their tax brackets I would be taxed at 52% so while you are right it's not 60% there is also a high social security which the employer does pay but I imagine it's like the US where no one gives away money for free and that amount is calculated into your pay somehow.
---
That’s not right. 
---
Q1: Jan-Feb-March
---
Q2: April-May-June
---
Q3 July-August-Sept
---
Q4 Oct-Nov-Dec
---
It’s called a quarter because it’s a quarter of the year. Two quarters is one half.
---
I definitely support this idea. I would love to see an option to use updated models on classic... Also, it would be a great add to implement updated loading screens (same art, but wider resolution).
---
I've never had to enter an event where the installation of an app is required.
---
Is it's normal, please let me know of any place that requires that
---
Here is a link to my Spotify Playlist w/ 500+ songs all taken from Vanilla PvP vids. Some of these should take you back. -  [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3VWLlCjtAR0mFtDUYZ1eKI?si=JXgTCT7RSnK6ckRmeyN\_ug](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3VWLlCjtAR0mFtDUYZ1eKI?si=JXgTCT7RSnK6ckRmeyN_ug)
---
this is bullshit... let me borrow your time machine!
---
Wont happen.
---
They want to make a big splash, im sure they'll trumpet it and probably have some sort of 'come back for classic' free play time limited deal for ppl who have previously subbed but don't have a current sub.
---
In the early years, they were freaking impeccable. The keyboard I had lasted 8 years before a dog chewed the cord in half, and I chewed the dog in half. By then they quit putting them in stores, and I hadnt started shopping amazon.
---
I went through about 4 Naga mice in 8 years. They develop a sticky left click button that can only be occasionally improved with careful surgery and alcohol cleaning. It always returned once it started.
---
The software was always superb. And I always went back.
---
I would go out of my way to use the alternative.
---
Sure.ive got a smartphone but I only install apps I WANT on there. Not apps that I'm REQUIRED to have on there especially to get into an event I would have paid for.
---
There should always be a browser based alternative for etickets
---
7 figures botting? lmfao. sure
---
Which is why they truly are the greatest race in my opinion. The rage induced when you gank someone is amazing
---
Decent racial for warriors against frost mages
---
Cry more.

I used this to go to a hockey game in March, didn’t have any of that nonsense on my iPhone. Must be an android issue.
---
Locks scale great and are top tier  DPS when Naxx hits. You will pretty much just spam SB though, and keep a curse up. Only 2-3 Resto Druids are taken to raids, and they are wanted for buffs and utility.
---
better be after July, as i'm unable to take time off  with other co workers taking time off in it. I'm hoping late august so i can take time off. D:

The horse... it’s... it’s just a pile of meat chunks at this point.

Everytime she says "it's been said you cant go home again" I immediately have to stop a tear from forming because my brain immediately zooms through this whole fucking struggle since even before 2014 when I got involved that people have fought to bring this to a reality.
---
Let's see if those same model citizens can play on a shit fiesta pserver one day and the next log onto Classic and be saints. Chances are a few will meme out and get banned.
---
I made buzzards bites it was alright just don't make it a main dish. The people who ate with me didn't like it. Tons of veniger in it. :)

Is.. this a shitpost? I can’t tell anymore.

I remember one joke when i saw your comment abot polymorph.

Three wives talking about their sex life with husbands:

#NoChanges
---
Well we've all got to do *something* until Classic releases.
---
The thing to take out here is  -  ***especially*** *in those early days* \- not ONLY on those early days. Blizzard are not stupid, so of course they're going to give a vague definition when they want to use it. 
---
Somehow, this sub seems to have gotten the impression that Blizzard has confirmed that this will only be used the first x levels, or first y zones, or first z days but in this case there really is no limit as to how they will use it.
---
Totally agree once we had it on lock we were much more lenient as well. From my perspective though, once WoW classic comes out everyone will be focusing on progress for months. That way if he wants to be in those progression raids he probably should look at using one of the meta’s.
---
Sorry you got cheated on, but if it's gonna happen, is there a better time?
---
\[Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian\]
---
This joke is still relevant, change my mind.
---
City of Heroes took this route.
---
I wonder if Blizzcon is really worth going to this year. Chances are its probably going to be mostly mobile games (guess people have to have  phones now) and classic will probably be out by then so what will they be demoing?
---
I could see them adding or changing loot to all level of dungeons/raids to make all specs work better similar to what they did with 1.10.  Maybe a way to upgrade the T0.5 up another notch?
---
/ignore Bitch
---
This doesn't look like EPL to me...
---
So much
---
Played a progressive prot warrior in vanilla. Was supposed to be the “one” who gets to work on thunderfury. First binding we saw drop was off of baron, and it got passed to the GM’s brother who was a fresh rogue. 
---
Continued to play “hardcore” until about 4 months into cata. Lost plenty of roles. None hurt nearly as bad as the binding.
---
there hasnt been any new posts in r/classicwow for an hour but you keep updating.
---
Any idea what gathering proff would get most value from vendoring while leveling? since I don't think that stuff will sell good early on in classic since everyone will be dirt poor
---
I know what class (warrior all the way) but not what build
---
You should check out Replicant if you're into free software :)
---
Yeah, that was just a response to him saying that he realized that he wouldn’t have to work anymore.
---
"Summer 2019"

Looks like you aren't playing Diablo, kek.

My ideal desire for this would be a new graphics engine. I also am not a huge fan of the rather cartoon-ish graphics. If I had any say in the matter, I would release an alternate version of classic WoW for the $60 price tag, $15 a month subscription, except this time it would be way better graphics on a new graphics engine, and the announcement would be "the direction for any future expansions to this version will go in an alternate timeline".
---
I know many people who are doing pretty good for themselves who don't have smartphones.
---
speak for yourself graphics are meaningless to me
---
Where do you see the vanilla prices across time?
---
So I agree with both of you on this... for example, "Nightsong" on the album is amazing. The endgame music is really great. Where I think they went wrong is changing the starting zones to EPIC sounding music... it's not epic to kill plainstriders... really jenks up the "just a no-body but I am going to be a hero" feeling.
---
What exactly is barrens chat &amp; why are u rolling hordr for it

&gt;  I’d hope it would appear in a WoW2.

You really think they won't shard STV or HBF?? all of these retail snowflakes crying about ganking and mob tagging. REALLY???? DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT????

I agree, I am really excited as well.
---
Idiot
---
Very interesting opinion. I didn't play WCIII so I don't get to fairly opine on this... however, I think the newer one looks great.
---
That is totally true. Great point.
---
Nostalgia is a real reason to play. A lot of people use it as an insult to Classic WoW, however I still play a private WotLK server on and off and it's for the nostalgia.
---
Ugh the gear back then was SO COOL
---
Eat blizzard employees. One a day. That'll get us an announcement within a month.
---
Horde has near exclusive access to just as many contested zones as that, plus the much easier means of travel provided by the zeppelins.
---
We expect pictures of those bites.
---
Also how is the book? I have been considering getting it myself.
---
Ah yes, the good ol' **front flipping** Blood Elf.
---
What the fuck are you even talking about. A skilled hunter can top on the meters even in AQ40. Sure, at that point a geared mage will do more damage than a geared hunter but you gotta remember there are usually less hunters competing against eachother than there are mages. And mages share gear with warlocks too. Hunter dps is no joke, even in early AQ40 progression.
---
check out Platinum wow. Frost recently had a video where he recommended other WoW video creators, and Platinum was one of them.
---
You do not want to be playing a twitch / fast paced game on WiFi ever.
---
The UDP packet type they use for game data in almost all online games means a packet lost is truly an input lost (no confirmation of delivery so no resend if drop occurs).
---
WoW is not as twitchy, but it would be possible for a player input to not get an ability usage sent to the server because of WiFi's inherent lack of reliability compared to a wired connection.
---
This is totally different from latency, and far more important when we're talking 10-20ms on a server type that has been confirmed to use a type of "spell batching" that makes inputs more likely to happen at the same time on the server side of things.
---
Some people's children
---
The answer to that question and to whatever info this app wants is the same: it's none of your fucking business
---
Someone not having a smartphone in no way correlates to said person being poor.
---
They’ve doubled down on ‘summer’ again and again (including to their major shareholders) I don’t know what gives you the idea it’s going to be November other than guessing based on nothing at all.
---
Skinning will slightly slow down the leveling process but is one of the most easy to level and easy to make gold professions.  
---
Even if the leather market is down you can still vendor it for nice amount of silver, making you just about the right amount of gold to purchase spells and mount at level 40.  
---
You might have to focus more on questing and grinding in spots that have beasts.
---
What do you think blizzcon is, some pc gaming convention?
---
I meant it genuinely I somehow could've sworn that I read that whole comment chain including yours before.
---
Any WoW pserver right now is 110ish ms for me.  I live in North East Ohio, my friends scattered around the state also have 100ms.  I had 90+ms when I was in Texas as well, but I had a friend in Austin with like 15ms because he basically lived next to a server.
---
I lived in South Korea for a year and that was the only play I've ever had great ping.  Just really unlucky I guess but I always assumed 80-100ms was the norm.
---
Running to catch that boat and having it sail off just before you can have any chance of making it
---
Clearly they are just helping their presenters so they won't have to ask awkward questions like "Don't you have phones?"
---
I still take plenty of issue with it’s use if I’m honest m8.
---
I don’t know a single person not using Ethernet.
---
Regardless, WiFi is much better than is used to be and will have minimal effect on ping which is based largely on your geographical location compared to the server anyway.
---
how does that help while fighting? or prevent the mob from running away and aggroing more? Did you even read the thread?
---
I'm going to have a big bushy pink beard on my gnome :)
---
Couldn't I install it and remove my phones battery/sd card?
---
Nope just use 8 debuff slots, restrict addons, and implement proper itemization
---
This is a great point as Ethernet won't drop packets. I guess the addendum to this is laptops with Ethernet ports would be Superior to USB Ethernet adapters ? Or with 0% packet loss and latency below 50ms, adapter vs Ethernet port is not relevant?
---
&gt;However, there are many behaviours that primates exhibit that if all humans did would be quite negative and destructive in a human society.
---
The same is true about a lot of the behaviour that human society by itself spawned, so by itself, that statement, while true, isn't an argument in the topic at hand.
---
I don't mean to say that people should give up monogamy if it works for them, same as you did me the kindness to respect my choices in life.
---
But I am challenging the view, that monogamous behaviour is actually beneficial to our society. If you have an argument supporting this or disproving it, I'll be happy to hear it, but don't use blanket statements like the above.
---
I can answer that you smug asshole.   
---
Mechanic scripts are guesswork. They aren't 100% accurate.   
---
Values? Armor, Resist, and Hit%. These are also guesswork. They are not 100% Vanilla source code.    
---
Anything else?
---
Global warming is making days hotter
---
How else would they one up the shitshow that was last Blizzcon?
---
Couldn't agree more my dude
---
That was my thought too. I'm mostly out to make sure I have mount at 40. and playing a mage I could also just aoe farm beasts, skin them and get a decent profit both gold and xp wise
---
Thought about it.  
---
I can't actually give you a good reason why I didn't go for it...unless you count laziness as a good reason :D.
---
I may be giving it another glance with my next phone.
---
How can you tell if something is a class quest without looking it up? Just being given by a class trainer?
---
Blizz needs to get the vanilla feel correct. So whatever it takes.
---
Gnomes were Pandaren before Pandaren, Change My Mind.
---
Evolutionary psychology isn't that black and white. Just because cooperation and morals are sometimes adaptive doesn't mean that rape and murder isn't also sometimes adaptive. Warlords like Gengis Khan did just fine begetting children. To call cooperation or morals hard-coded is vacuous, there's no shortage of people not cooperating and not applying morals.
---
And I guess it wasn't obvious, but you're suggesting that because polyamory is natural that we ought to practice, I'm pointing out rape and murder are natural and that we ought not practice those. If you think that makes my argument naturalistic then that's many things but not ironic.
---
Or save a backup, reinstall fresh for the convention, the reload backup?
---
Dumbest point you could have come up with.
---
Sharding in Classic will kill the very thing you are hoping for.
---
.... lmao
---
They are always doing cheeky shit like this, too. Even if you're allied. There was a quest item I needed once in Loch Modan, I was killing troggs waiting for a window to pick it up without them aggro'ing me. When I finally had a chance, another trogg spawned and I was forced to fight it. Meanwhile a gnome rogue pops up and takes the item while I'm fighting 2-3 troggs at once, /lol's at me and runs off while I die.
---
I was so pissed.

This is done on pservers fairly often once you get a month or so into the patch. Usually it isn't a guild doing it for their main runs, but they have 15+ alts or off night raiders (going for extra tfury binding helps get people there) so you have a solid core of tanks and healers usually and fill the rest with pugs. I know it was done for Mc and bwl but I think aq too tough for pugs usually.
---
hahha get it we use the same few phrases over and over again?!?!!!11111!!!11!
---
If someone asks a legitimate question like "what's inaccurate" and your response is "it's just inaccurate" that's not a valid response.
---
*Which* mechanics aren't accurate? *How* are they not accurate? *Which* armor and resist values aren't accurate? How far are they off by?
---
If you don't know the answers to these questions then I have no obligation to trust your feels over the years of research that these developers have done.
---
Especially if your argument is that these servers are *so* inaccurate that the Molten Core we get in WoW Classic will be essentially unrecognizable to the version available on private servers. That's a substantial claim, that requires substantial evidence to back it up.
---
Agreed!
---
Word. We can sneak into orgrimmar and fish from within.
---
It really isn't. Most people don't know what that means. If this was a pure troll post I would have done worse
---
thanks!

Guild drama like this would be one, too. Just shitty GMs/officer cliques in guilds that just create politics and other bullshit. Shoutout to all those horrible husband/wife GM guilds out there
---
Crying is a normal reaction when you are emotional about anything really.
---
I wish, sadly the only actual news from them on this front seems to be that they consider modification to the 1.12 database, which includes mob armor, hp, damage values, etc, are off limits to changes.
---
I shall tell you how: they do understand that. WoW however, as it has been with so many things, is a special case. It’s a game that is 13 years old, and many changes have occurred. This means it’s community is split: those that want the older stuff, and those that like the current version. To the latter population, the notion of a new wow of any kind is a hostile situation. It means resetting their years of effort, and so they naturally defend themselves from those notions with whatever excuse they can. It just happens they choose Nostalgia.
---
That was actually a pretty short answer if ya ask me.
---
Group: Arms warrior with paladin healer. Solo: mage.
---
&gt;apostrophes are perfectly acceptable as a substitute for creativity. 
---
Fixed that.
---
Worst feeling: logging out
---
Or getting MC'd/feared/whatever'd off a boat on a PvP server just before the load screen
---
There's no indication they plan to, and I don't expect that'll change. I agree that MC and BWL will be easier in Classic than in Vanilla, but I don't trust Blizzard to retune it well... So I'd rather them leave it as-is, with the known Classic changes.
---
No. But if they were to retune MC, they should also retune most of the loot, because its garbage.
---
Ticket scalpers are the worst for events that instantly sell out. They purchase max amounts of tickets and inflate the price screwing over tons of people who now have no choice other than pay the mark up or don’t attend.

---
Or just say you don't have a phone.
---
Yup this 100x. I already have a time management plan so I can spend time with the fiance while getting enough time to raid at least twice a week
---
excellent
---
Yes it does.
---
No drugs for you anymore little bud. You alright?
---
You'll get the "MC and BWL weren't difficult we were just bad and discovering the game"   
---
**It's true**, but Vanilla difficulty was based on ours attributes too. 
---
That's why no matter how much skilled you are you can't pull more than 2-3 mobs during leveling.
---
**We can't deny** that doing MC with 1.12 gear/talent/debuff make us more powerfull than in 1.1 and therefore the earlier content is "easier" for this part.  
---
But well, let's see how Blizzard handle this. But i think that they won't do anything to deliver a raw 1.12
---
That’s just karma for me. I’ve MCd more people to death than I can count kek
---
“Do you guys not have phones?”
---
What in the hell?
---
A year ago I'd have been skeptical. I've come to believe that, for whatever reason, they're trying to put out a quality product here.
---
Considering how short a time characters can be underwater in classic, drowning people with Mind Control is an option.
---
These threads pop up all the time and people always seem to be missing the point. Even if the raids will be doable, you still have to get people to go with. You still have to form those bonds that allow you to raid at all. Thats what vanilla was. It was a sense of community and forced relations. 
---
There will be no raid finder, anyone who wants to raid has to experience what vanilla offers. It's not JUST about the content, it's also about how you access that content. In bfa you press a button, q and leave. In vanilla, you have to form relationships, join a guild, earn your spot and rejoice together.
---
Can't you just delete the app once you get in?
---
We will see. I hope You're right
---
You think you don’t, but you do.
---
Running a dungeon for a quest item and forgetting to pick it up
---
Literally the only thing I remembered about the review without watching it. They were so hung up on the fact you could kill critters
---
Thanks but given that there was a recent ban wave for people that modified game files I wouldn't risk it :s
---
Was it any good on a rogue?
---
Legally, no.  Ethically, yes.
---
According to the guys at the Diablo Immortal panel last year, everyone has one.
---
Been playing Grim Dawn to pass the time.
---
That's fairly similar to my 2015 laptop, and mine can run retail just fine.
---
“Spending a week” you’re quite the moron aren’t you?
---
And recently with City of Heroes. Though that may have been due to a rogue dev instead of them just sitting on a backup.
---
We will be getting classic animations and graphics (as close as they can recreate it as they are creating classic from the legion core) there will be the option for updated graphics all what you prefer
---
Patch 1.12 is what the are basing core mechanics on. With progressive content releases
---
Hunters are solid in vanilla, are they some big dick warrior?. No, but they certainly hold their own, and with good effort on your part can do good dps
---
It'll be similar minimum specs required as retail is currently.
---
Bet this guy was one of the “wall of no” idiots
---
Those necks are really nice, not sure where they stand on bis lists though.
---
Bringing back Barrens chat is on us, not on Classic. See that as the first community quest you have to achieve.
---
As I said, for businesses the fiscal quarters are seasonal. Most companies either end their fiscal year in May and start the new one in June or end in November and start in December.
---
You should be able to run it, as long as the requirements don't go up, you might have some drops at some point, but the only thing that falls behind is the graphic
---
Shadow Priests
---
Fear, Mind Control, Silence, Healing, Mindflay(Slow)
---
New animations and models? No.
---
Patch? Essentially 1.12. There will be some gated content to emulate the full timeline of Vanilla. For example, only two raids will be out in the first phase of Classic, but those raids will drop the same loot as they did in 1.12.
---
Hunter DPS? Its always great in PVE dungeons and raids. In the late game (T2/T3) other DPS classes catch up and surpass the hunter, but the DPS is never bad.
---
HAHA ITS FUNNY CUZZ ITS TRUE
---
In terms of towns that are either large or fortified the Alliance have, in 30+ areas:
---
Theramore Isle
---
Feathermoon Stronghold
---
Nethergarde Keep
---
Aerie Peak
---
I think the Horde have:
---
Grom'Gol
---
Hammefall
---
Stonard
---
Arguably Freewind Post
---
Brackenwall Village
---
At least these are the ones I came up with, and the criteria are somewhat loose. But it's about the same. Your opinion most likely stems entirely from Grom'Gol which is a major settlement in the middle of a big zone with wide level range. Grom'Gol is a very well placed town.
---
Is there a way to load a historical price database (i.e., a collection of that old representative AH data you referenced) into an AH add-on when classic launches? I'd like to have that available, just as a reference point, on item tooltips.
---
I wouldn't care about a 100€ + price tag if and only if they lasted.
---
I still have the original Logitech MX518 I was playing Vanilla with, this has been my only mouse since 2005 or 2006 !
---
I just replaced it by a G600 because I want more buttons for Classic but I bet she could have taken Classic too.
---
Damn I missed this meme😢
---
I don't like using USB adapter anything if I can prevent it.
---
Weird issues once in a great while that can really be frustrating.
---
No it doesnt. Plenty of people use crappy phones to avoid all the spying going on or they are like me and use their phone as a...phone.
---
This might look like druid is something to stay away from, but no. I mained a Druid from TBC to BFA (see name). Just being open about the challenges you might face. Druid is a fantastic class for people who like to constantly change (fill any role) or who like to be self sufficient in nearly any scenario (alot of tools).
---
A Little bit of googling yielded this video: https://youtu.be/LSgjGTsBLzk
---
Based on that my guess is you should be able to get at least 30fps on low settings/resolution.
---
There's a decent chance the game runs at playable fps at 1080p which is IMO the resolution that you should be shooting for. 720p on a Retina display does not look great.
---
and my axe!
---
Priest regeneration scale with spirit, not int.
---
Anyways when it comes to prebis gear, the optimal prio is +healing&gt;spirit&gt;int.
---
All theorycrafting can be goggled, hundreds of guides out there
---
I had never seen this before but it is pretty in line with the snarky attitude you'd get from these people who opposed legacy servers so adamantly. I wonder how they felt when Blizzard announced Classic.
---
Black Desert Online, it is absolutely beautiful, the leveling is great, the professions are fun, and the combat is fun. But the endgame is a ridiculous grind, a completely RNG upgrade system (you can guarantee upgrades for a while, but it isn't worth it statistically at any point in time), you have to drop a couple hundred dollars to be competitive (you have to pay $ for inventory space, weight, pets to auto-loot, armor skins give you extra XP and give you more durability to farm longer, maids can bank stuff for you, minimally you will want the pets/maids for serious farming), and you can "pay to win" but its in the 10s of thousands of dollars.
---
&gt;Warlords like Gengis Khan did just fine begetting children.
---
And what happened to the Khans people after his death? They scattered, ravaged by infighting, and facing superior opposition by more cooperative tribes the further they tried to go west.
---
So in the long run, cooperative behavior won out. You cannot dismiss evolutionary truths based on isolated observations that you stripped from their context.
---
Keep in mind, a lot of people on this subreddit are retail players. They will defend sharding, loot trading, pet battles, LFR and whatever Blizzard does.
---
Only thing you can do to preserve the classic "experience" is to increase those things, but its still far from a good solution. You say adding new abilities, but you'd have to add specific anti-melee abilities because else you'd still end up hurting range more, its the same kind of problem retail has, you can never balance range and melee to be equal in dps and then not either camp penalized by being forced to do mechanics. 
---
Just having to move is kind of a mechanic in classic because every class is low mobility, and melee dps just follows tank so they should have somewhat same activity as him on the boss. 
---
Adding higher hp and damage isn't a good solution as has been shown on other projects, sure it makes pve a lot more fun, but you "know the future" which means you also create either a character that stays good entire way (in vanilla I'd say rogue/healer classes, not sure about mage) or you pick a class you know gets better later if thats how long you play, or just make alt/change main if you have time for that. No one in their right mind would play early warlock, the class was just busted and bad and broken in every aspect sadly
---
dm is phase 2 though :/
---
This is why the people advocating for the WoW token are so fucking wrong. Gold and farming is an important aspect to vanilla WoW
---
Easy : boost every raid mobs and bosses with +50% HP, +20% damage, divide by 2 their enrage CD, up the armor by 30%, resistances by 20 then watch the army of angry nerds walk on Blizzard HQ with pitchforks ! :D
---
My brother mained a hunter in our semi-serious raiding guild in vanilla. He was a very strong dps, but the best benefit is outside of raiding. A decently geared hunter can start soloing/carrying everything outside of raids. Bad pull in 5 man? Trap, kite, 2shot squishy and pet tank one. Not getting focused in pvp? 3 shot the priest healing in the back.
---
In raiding you will be roughly 5-7 for a dps score and mainly brought for tranq shot and various niche things; however, you will become very strong in 5 mans and pvp with raid experience/gear. Also, get the wolf pet :)
---
Anyone want to explain human emotions to this confused anon?
---
&gt; Are we going to play with the new animations / updates racial graphics from BFA, or the classic ones?
---
So far we've only seen old models and old animations.     
---
Classic graphics are confirmed to be present, but both the Blizzcon Demo Client and internal "alpha" Client have some settings for improved graphics (Note: no improved viewing distance). It remains to be seen what really stays for the final release, but an option for updated graphics seems likely.
---
&gt; What patch are we playing?
---
1.13.    
---
They'll use Patch 1.12 as base and fix some bugs. The content will be released in phases. Some items will also be added later into the game if they weren't around in early vanilla. [This should give so some idea of how stuff will be released.](https://i.redd.it/96r6wxuk79t21.jpg)
---
&gt; Does Hunter make low damage in PVE raids? It was my first class back into 2009, I don't know how balanced it was in classic.
---
Hunters are stronger in the first few stages since they depend less on gear than some of the other DPS classed but they drop off a bit in the later content stages. They are still quite useful though and will be needed in raids for their abilities (Tranquilizing Shot for example) even if they're not top DPS.
---
Remember that in a few months when your first epic will drop in MC and you will rage because it will be attributed to someone else :p
---
Well humans have the edge for swords in PVE  and will most likely have priority over any other race due to sword specialization. Dwarf rogues should have no problem being dagger spec as a result and getting daggers. Stoneform can be used to get out of blinds, devouring plague, serpent sting, rend, rupture, etc. great to use to get a vanish off.
---
You must be a fatherless child ?
---
+1 i'd really like to know
---
All I see is hunter weapon.
---
Could you just download it. Walk through the gate, then uninstall? I mean at that point they've already got your data though.
---
Sorry this happened OP, but for every door that closes another door is opened. Hoping your new door leads you to a life where you can have both WoW and an awesome SO.
---
Frankly warriors build are very easy.
---
Go arms for levelling and PVP, fury or prot for raiding. 
---
There's not more than 2 or 3 points that are not set in stone but that's about it.
---
Well, this looks to be the europe release which iirc was in 2005. still very awesome
---
seems legit
---
How ya doin buddy?
---
You spend all your available time on Classic WOW but the game isn't out yet.
---
So I dunno about this “most companies” claim.  Every company I have worked had quarters aligned with the months split as I listed and the fiscal year ended with Q4. Also I think you are confusing fiscal year and quarters. But regardless of all that, look at Blizzards actual earnings [reports](https://investor.activision.com/financial-information/quarterly-results). Q1 2019 end: March 31, Q4 2018 end: Dec 31, Q3 2018 end: Sept 30th and Q2 2018 end: June 30th. A report out might be a month or two later than that but for purposes of a product release w.r.t. quarters it will be within those dates.
---
Im just amazed people actually think the # of players playing private servers  will even come close to what classic will be. 
---
For every player who plays on private server I'm sure there's 3-10 people who say, "waste of time, it could be deleted at any moment." "Not authentic."
---
As far as warrior class quests goes, yes they will be at the class trainer in a major city but only from the same race. For example human warriors go to stormwind, dwarf warriors go to ironforge warrior trainer etc. Also the level 10 warrior quest is available from the first town outside of the starting area. Goldshire warrior trainer for example. The level 10 quest is the only quest not starting in the major city of your race. They are generally 10 levels apart for each new warrior quest chain to unlock. Not sure of the other classes but heres the link. https://classicdb.ch/?quests=4.-81#0-3+1+2 at first it seems like a lot, but half of these quests are faction specific and then another is race based for each starting zone.
---
Don't remember ever getting cloth on my rogue, but there's alot of potions and gems. Humanoids are pickpocketed so it kinda goes hand in hand. Pickpocket then kill for respawn. Get boxes and cloth same time :)
---
what? my dude, you may be technically correct but mostly wrong. 
---
If /u/DonnyDingo straight up ignores his girlfriend for days/weeks/months/years where does the fault lay? her or him? If your priorities are video gaming than being with another human being then you deserve every bit of whats coming to you.
---
Although it can't ruled out (because they haven't 100% confirmed it won't happen), I'd be *very* surprised if there were any updated graphics in the form of actual content (models, animations, textures, etc.).
---
Classic is using the same engine as retail. So a few optional "freebies" will be present (mainly improved shadows, water and ground clutter distance).
---
I would rather request the time and have it pushed back than having it be too soon to make the request. Most companies want a few months ahead of time so they can prepare for your absence. With people requesting time off in the summer it is harder to get what you requested off unless you do it far in advance
---
But hey....the price is right
---
Really interesting thanks for the information!
---
To date, Blizzard have never stated sharding will be removed.   
---
Now, I challenge you to contradict this - with an actual source - literally stating “sharding will be removed.”   
---
Stick to this argument - not your fabricated “literal” generalizations.
---
My first character was a human hunter. I remember leaving Elwynn Forest and heading into Redridge Mountains. It was a nice, quiet day. I was excited to be in a new zone. I got to the bridge leading into the small town there (forgot the name) and see someone standing there in the middle of the bridge with a red name and a skull and I’m thinking “ohhh a boss!”. 
---
He chased me down probably 20 times and killed me. That was the first taste of pvp I got and it was so frustrating but looking back at it, I miss that feeling. Can’t wait for those days again!
---
What would that prove, exactly? Regardless of classic's success retail has been dying since wrath. That's why the sub numbers went from 12 million to 2 million...
---
Hey everyone!
---
Debating to go either Female Orc Rogue or Male Undead Rogue for the racials.
---
Orc = Great vs stuns + slightly more dmg, but looks worse than undead.
---
Undead = Great vs fear, can pretty much skip pvp trinket and have 1 extra trinket slot. Looks better imo.
---
What would you have chosen if pvping 80% of the time?
---
Also how hard will it be to get into a decent guild, as rogues are quite popular?
---
Wait is city of heroes an official launch of a private server? Always wanted to try it but never got into it when it was popular.
---
It's preraid bis iirc.
---
https://youtu.be/0jmdBA9nK0c
---
Here is the other song they made :)
---
And your changes have still not changed anything, you will still stack melee if you can, especially with that big hp buff. You just made casters even worse early stages
---
&gt; What would that prove, exactly?
---
That the game's downfall is not due to quality.
---
Greed.
---
Ah yeah, that's true.
---
classic wow will have modern wow core.
---
so just test a trial modern wow version on your pc, its free.
---
if it can run retil it will run classic, if it cant run retail it won't run classiс either. simple.
---
I had this mentality alongside I don’t need to delve in the past just to have it ripped from under me again. 
---
But now that classic is coming I hopped on a private server to get a refresher on things I want to do.
---
How would classic failing prove that....? 
---
Never mind. I don't care.
---
There wont be a guild with a full roster of 60s within the first week. It takes 5 days played to reach 60 and that's if you're the best of the best of speedrunners. And even then do you realize how long its been since these speedrunners have run their route on a blizzard server? 14 years.
---
So let's say you get a guild that happens to have 40 of the top speedrunners in one guild. Its 5 days played. Not 5 days period. And then you have to grind hydraxian rep. And then grind consumables. And like I said in this thread you arent downing rag in level 50 greens so you need to get SOME gear.
---
TLDR; even if you manage to get 40 of the top speedrunners in one guild you would literally have to have them all stay awake for 7 days straight which is impossible unless you are on copious amounts of drugs
---
As a priest, I cannot relate to this.
---
&gt; &gt;Amd without the shadow damage on lupos you cant farm mara since lupos cant get through princesses armor quick enough
---
&gt;This is just... really..
---
Eye-opening!  I was planning out a warlock build and had everything mapped out but neglected to consider that my imp's firebolt will do less damage in MC/BWL...welp, back to square one.
---
Why not just go into the game like a pure noob again with no addons or guides? That us what Ima do.
---
The only reason why I bothered installling a Private Realm was to prepare for classic. 
---
Well I guess I wouldn't call it "prepare", but you know, tinkering with character creation options and so forth. I don't want to spend an hour on that when Classic hits!
---
At first I was kind of scared that going on a Private Server would "disenchant" my memories prematurely, but gladly the opposite happened.
---
Spirit's stat weight is highly variable depending on gear, talents, and playstyle, which can cause some minor shifts in BiS lists.
---
For example we can see the difference in value by changing some of the assumptions in [my spreadsheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mG8IlEdbUGukRWfZdWxth42zcsyN1OoD/view?usp=sharing) to toggle spiritual guidance and the 3 pc t2 set bonus of 15% mana regen while casting. Without either of those factors spirit had a stat weight of 0.55, with them it's value was 1.14
---
This is pretty much the exact reason I stopped using in game sound. Rogue would start hitting you and you could do nothing. So you're stuck there for an eternity while \*tink tink tink\* goes on for what seems like 5 hours.
---
have you not tried barrens on any blizz like freeservers? others mentioned authenticity in this thread, now those barrens chats were authentic
---
Sounds like the holy spec detailed in my [priest leveling guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7iieiw/priest_leveling_guide/) is what you want.
---
Really? I thought that was really cheesy.
---
Looks like Skyrim Food.
---
You're an idiot.
---
&gt;is likely a fundamentally broken person
---
what the heck are you talking about dude? Honestly, I don't think you have enough life experience to make any kind of judgement about human behavior. Please stop giving misinformation. People cheat for many many reason but to say solely because they have a bad history is very short sighted.
---
To each their own, I say; there's no right or wrong way to play the game in my opinion. For me, I'm not about guides that force you to quest from X to Y to Z. But I do like tracking gear upgrades as its something for me to work towards and gets me journeying to different areas.
---
You should be upset about it.
---
Indeed. I want to try and capture that initial wonder I had to whatever degree possible.
---
Just export your messages and contacts and delete them off your phone. You can bring them back on when it's over.
---
Yeah right about when Sunken Temple pops up is when offspec tanks and healers start feeling a lot weaker.
---
It was a legit question if you could delete the app after getting your ticket, but cool.
---
&gt; \- Does Hunter make low damage in PVE raids? It was my first class back into 2009, I don't know how balanced it was in classic. 
---
Your primary role is utility, tranq, pulling certain rooms, and kiting. As with any class you can do well at dps as a hunter, but you will likely not be above the mages/locks and warriors/rogues who play at the same skill level as you
---
I want RP-naming rules on ALL serveres! I dislike gamertag-names or names that's just an unpronounceable string of letters
---
Ive tried other multi-button mice and hated them. I have big hands and a big thumb, and its the only one with enough buttons, where I can actually comfortably hit all of the buttons. And it also has great software. I tried Corsair's similar one and hated it. The naga, even having to replace it every 3 or so years, is just the only gaming mouse I like. 
---
As for keyboards, everything has gone to only 5 or 6 macro buttons on the left side. I havent had an Anansi in 4 years, and I still struggle hard without the 7 additional buttons on bottom. For classic, with as many macro options as you need (downranking, etc) I will never be happy without them.
---
I have a 2013 macbook pro that runs private server classic with zero issues whatsoever.  Was able to manage playing Legion on that same one (albeit with some toned down settings), you shouldn't have any issue at all assuming there's nothing wrong with your comp.
---
You can always do a clean install of the OS if you want - that almost always can buy a little performance if you're ok with losing files and such.
---
hehe, I understand :) it's inconvenient in some ways for sure. But for me the inconvenience is such a small offer to get a 100% free OS in return :)
---
You will be able to play it, but it won't be too enjoyable. You all run into scenarios (especially densely populated by people or spells) where the integrated GPU just won't be able to keep up and may crash. You will most likely have to run most detail and shadow settings at the lowest.
---
My god. They haven't officially announced where the Elder Scrolls 6 is taking place. There's rumor it could be Elsweyr...but what if it's KALIMDOR
---
And I'm more into these OSes from a philosophical perspective. I don't tinker with the software at all. Possibly Lineage is better from that point of view, IDK :)
---
I have not
---
No update? Where were you when op was kill??
---
bannerlord.
---
Enjoy eating on the sly while you're behind a computer because it's no where near summer yet.
---
It was long enough to encompass all required information.
---
My worst feeling in WoW is current.  Right now.  I can't get into playing.  I have my main, I raid so I can talk to mates... that's it.  I can't get motivated.  The wait for Classic has been so long and feels like it'll go so much longer since we haven't had **TRUE** communication about anything meaningful in months.
---
&gt;should they re-tune these earlier raids 
---
&gt;would they re-tune these earlier raids 
---
Hell no.
---
The Barrens is a humongous zone where horde typically level from 10 to 24ish. A lot of people in the same zone for a long time. The chat that happens in 1. General chat is... Colorful.
---
Does the Quiver work with wands in Classic?
---
Your reading comprehension needs a bit of work.
---
Wifi just needs to worry about noise from other WiFi and over saturation of cheap Access points. If you have neither of these then the difference is pretty much just 5ms of ping.
---
I was watching some Joana's videos a few days ago. 
---
When he was in Silithus with the same mobs his pet took much more damage than Frost's pet, I think it was the Scorpid poison that did most of the damage.
---
Basically Joana had to sit every 2 mobs (which is not the case in other zones, so I believe the Silithus mobs have more DPS).
---
We can't compare the damage between the 2 chars since Frost is much better geared, but the 2 pets should be about equal.
---
It seems we really can't compare pservers with Blizzard's.
---
OKay, I had to lol =)
---
I was thinking more long term cc like warlock fear, sap, and polymorph. Every class has crowd control
---

So many people seem to think the former determines the latter.....

Hi, I'm a WoW GF. I'll take your gold, and rare mats. 
---
But my group's all full. emoji.
---
It's highly unlikely that they are having F&amp;F level 1-60. Alpha testing tends to be very targeted at high risk scenarios and specific parts of the game. 
---
The theory behind Classic is that they really only have to test 1 of each instance of things.
---
I.E. 
---
Can you turn in a quest and pick a reward? Ok that works.
---
Can you craft linen bolts without the correct materials? Ok cool.
---
That's not to say that Alpha won't last a few weeks, but it won't be as extensive as some may think.
---
You’d be better of just buying gold. Also, don’t buy gold.
---
That’ll teach those filthy peasants to demand Classic!
---
Oh, I leveled to 15 on a pserver 2 days ago but that doesnt mean we're actively playing it. Then again we're of those people who might play it not those who dont but want vanilla.
---
Depends what your playstyle is. We can't choose for you just based on you wanting to shit on people for PVP. Every class can do that.
---
I thought the implication was you would be afk often and didnt want mobs to kill you
---
So you plan on hiring a Chinese worker to level a gold farming account and then want it transfered?
---
Why not have two separate accounts?

Is this a good mage build 31/20 for Ice? Where should i focus during early levels.
---
looks good
---
buddy, you don't know what you're talking about. I'm sorry but you really don't
---
This would kill any mana users and sway it towards rogue and warriors.
---
Why so serious ? \^\^
---
If you don't like melees I'm sure we can find some cleave ability that would solve the problem ;-)
---
It was Toy Story 2
---
I find 79k to be a pretty low number.
---
I noticed this when playing on private servers as well. There’s plenty of proof of spells being reflected back at the source of the spell, for instance rogues reflecting succubus cc back at the pet, not the warlock. 
---
The spruce of the spell in this instance is the trap, not the hunter. I played hunter for quite a long time in vanilla and I never experienced being trapped by a reflector. On the other hand, people swear this was how it was, 
---
I still believe the trap would reflect back onto itself, and being immune to any damage and cc it would just expire once triggered.
---
Some say they're still out there farming that last drop.
---
Taking the wrong zeppelin, or taking the right zeppelin but realizing you forgot to do something in undercity the second you walk into org.
---
Pretty sure I'm going priest, but now I'm circling back and considering shaman. I want to mainly be a pve healer and I know both classes do this very well. As far as pvp goes, I know priests are very good in support with healing, dispells, and some cc with MC/scream. I know shaman has the 30/0/21 spec but that's more of an offensive healer thats much better in 1v1 wold pvp. I guess my question is, what class would be more sought after in premades and organized world pvp?
---
I always thought that when you find a good device you should buy multiples so that when it's discontinued you can still use them. However it's hard to put 3 to 500€ upfront just for devices.
---
Btw I have the opposite problem of you : I have very small hands and the G600 feels too big in my hand. I'm not sure I can PVP with it, I might misclick too often.
---
I meant to say RGB, which is the multicolored backlighting system.
---
If I were you I'd purchase an MMO mouse and have a regular but quality keyboard.
---
Fair
---
Dont the blizzcon events sell out instantly?
---
You're asking us to help you break blizzards TOS?! 
---
Nice try ISIS, not today... not today...
---
That was probably the best trailer i have ever seen.  The emotional blow alone... it was put together so well.  Towards the end when the screen goes white, then fades into the beginning of the original WoW Trailer... tears man.
---
This is inevitable for me, barely remember anything other than bits and pieces, I actually never even raided so I'm clueless when it comes to that. One hand, its a good new experience, but on the other hand ill hardly find a group or guild like that lol
---
After my 2nd naga replacement I started buying 2 at a time. My anansi never failed me on its own. I also figured refurbs would be everywhere. I have a feeling they just sell out quick.
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
Do you know if you can use Thistle tea and the energy trinket after each other on the patch that will be on retail?
---
She was replaceable, Classic won't be.
---
For a paladin, 84 healing and 18 int is considerably better than 51 healing 1 crit 9 int.
---
It is true that by coefficient, druids will use more of that +healing that paladins will, but as I said druids have more options.
---
I'm not sure what is confusing you about staves altering the decision. The AQ staff is superior to Lok'amir for druid, and the quest item drops with some regularity, whereas paladins have no upgrade until a rare drop from C'Thun, a boss that won't be killed until later. If you get no C'Thun maces, you have to wait for Naxx to get a Faerlina mace, all while every druid in the raid has an AQ staff by then.
---
It makes no sense to keep a paladin wearing Jindo's Hexxer until Faerlina in Naxx and give Lok'amir to a druid who can replace it with a fairly common drop in AQ.
---
Yes but it is not needed, at all. Have fun taking tailoring just so you have 1 more crit in MC and 2 more in BWL.
---
Isn't that just ModUi with player frames moved?
---
Dont trust woman trust WoW
---
Lol, oh, do you not know how warlock pve works?  If you are assigned a curse, you put it up and then you spam shadow bolt.
---
You can use other affliction spells more frequently on trash pulls, but no, you don't get kicked for spamming shadow bolts at a boss.  It doesn't seem like you know what you're talking about.
---
Ah I don't care about the leds, I deactivated them on my mouse it was distracting me ;-)
---
I have the G600 (Logitech 12 buttons on the side like a Naga) but it's not enough buttons.
---
I can't reliably reach CTRL and MAJ with my pinky, I might get ALT to work, I need to try.
---
I played a warrior back in Vanilla I didn't need that many keybinds since a lot of spells are stance dependent.
---
I 'll probably play a hunter this time and there are much more keybinds (11 just for the pet alone !).
---
Because supposedly pre cata WoW was God's gift to mankind
---
I know I am in a minority but I dislike the art direction of modern WoW. i think the older graphics are much much better as they have a darker tone and feel. I also find the graphics to be quite timeless - they fit perfectly with the style of game imo. Maybe that's just nostalgia goggles though.
---
That being said, because I don't like the newer graphics (looks like Hello Kitty with everyone bounding and bouncing around with every step) BUT I would be fine with updated graphics is they were more like the graphics in Vanilla (just higher rez) than the graphics in retail.
---
(My comments regarding graphics in retail do not extend to the cutscenes. Those have been pretty great)
---
Data collection on thissl scale is whats normal.
---
&gt;No honor system in the game in phase 1
---
... and then?
---
Thats not very nice.

You know that until (I think) about 36 hours of not eating, your body actually ramps up your metabolism? 
---
Most of what we deal with are psychological conditioning effects that tell our body when to eat rather than it actually being necessary. We have been conditioned to eat at a certain time and so our bodies got used to that.
---
I've never been to a BlizzCon but I imagine they search you
---
Oof I feel for you man. My gf just broke up with me and I was hoping to share classic wow with her. Now I just want the damn thing to come out so I have a distraction.
---
Fuck what ya heard, there's a lot of us waiting like Cartman for this game.
---
That's not true
---
I use a 49.95 drug dealer Android burner phone. For three simple reasons. It's simple. It does what I want. It doesn't have any of this retarded spyware shit that's become prevalent in our technological society lately.
---
If I want to play games, I use my tablet, which is much better. And I don't play games on my phone when I'm not at home because if I'm outside? It's to get something done. So I can get back home. And recuse myself from society, like the good little introvert I am. So I can play video games with my son. =)
---
That's a good point actually.
---
Shamans. Better survivability, windfury totems and chain lightning. You're a warrior's best friend!
---
On the earnings call it was again stated for q2
---
Can't you find an electrician / electronics guy to repair the keyboard ? It's probably just 5 minutes of work to solder back the cables.
---
I would assume you could in World PVP
---
This is the most wildly incorrect take on shaman pvp I have ever heard. Resto passed 21 points provides minimal survivability and sacrifices your primary offensive tools: quicker lightning spells. Spellpower will not be particularly valuable, as you will only benefit from it from shocks.  
---
Resto shamans can still purge, use totems, and interrupt, but you won’t be able to pressure your opponents at all with 3 second lightning bolt casts.
---
Yes, I've been testing all classes to level 20 so I can make the best decision on what to pick. I dont want to put in too much work, because I want it to be fresh and I dont want to burn myself out.
---
Chat is pretty much the same in retail as on pservers in my experience for what it's worth.
---
Yeah good luck getting it as a rogue whole it’s current content lmao
---
It was ok in pvp or solo content, but it's a tank weapon. You'd never be able to use it in a dungeon on a rogue.
---
HEAL HIM! we must unite before classic is released! horde will not show you the same mercy! they will pile on 10 if they can!
---
For the Alliance!
---
All i want is a million on the bank so i can play classic all day long for a whole year without worrying about the next 10 years i am going to play without a job.
---
The bloodvine set is best in slot for a long time anyway, so you might as well be tailoring to get the free 2% crit. I suppose if you don't care about your dps contribution to the raid you can do whatever you want, though.
---
I quit WoW, from several server firsts, one world top-20 heroic raid kill &lt;19&gt;, one Cutting Edge &lt;Last one in the WORLD to get it. Got it literally 1 minute and 35 seconds before they turned it off worldwide&gt;, and a TON of achievements and amazing things like Mimiron's Head, and every Legendary possible for a warrior to acquire..... and I quit because of the following.
---
Guild wanted to take a break. Several needed real life for a few months. We all understood.
---
I told the guild I would hold the guild, the bank, and all the stuff to resume raiding until we reformed in six-seven months. I was the guildleader, so that was fine with everyone.
---
Everyone left the guild, reformed under a different tag so that they could play together, those that were sticking around active, and be able to invite/remove on their own from the guild. I, as the guildleader, was taking a break too.
---
I just wanted everyone to have a home to come back to once the time was up, and we all came back to play together. I put capped gold &lt;1mil, I believe it was&gt;, several Shadowmourne quest drops from the final turnin, entire tabs FULL of max stack consumables, flasks, potions, etc. Basically tagged out to, at the time, around 8 million gold or so.
---
Street value for RMT people: Somewhere around 2 grand to 2.5 grand. As it stood at that point in time.
---
I spoke directly with FOUR GAMEMASTERS. FOUR. I got told by ALL FOUR directly. Specifically. Unambiguously. "We will make sure your guild leadership is not jeopardized by you taking a break and unsubscribing for six months. Nobody will be able to mess with the guild." I told them I'd be back at the 6 month mark. On the nose. And I was going to. So I said cool. I unsubbed. I went to handle real life.
---
I came back six months later on the nose.
---
No guild.
---
No guild. No guildmates. No nothing.
---
Because someone had somehow gotten control of the guild. And raided it. And kicked everyone. And sold it all for cash.
---
And my guild was left homeless.
---
The GM's reasons: When presented with screenshots, they said the following when it was proven I was told my guild was safe from this sort of thing. ---- The Grandfather rule lets people take over after a 3 month absence.
---
Even though I'd asked specifically to four different GM's and they all told me they would not let that happen. I asked SPECIFICALLY about that rule. Was assured nothing would happen.
---
I quit. Their customer service cost them 13 accounts that day. JUST from my friends and family. 7 out of the 10 raiders of my 10man guild cancelled their accounts too over this happening. Drop in the bucket, but clearly representative of how much their customer service gives NO fucks about their customers.
---
It's been years since I played WoW. We will see if Classic deserves the paltry amount of money I will put forth to give it a chance.
---
wrong. help your buddie.
---
what is the meme of this weapon about, is it not actually a good weapon?
---
The funny thing about this Twitter account is that it's still active and people comment this meme on her replies all the time.
---
I've been listening to countdown to classic podcast with Josh Corbitt
---
&gt; And what happened to the Khans people after his death? They scattered, ravaged by infighting, and facing superior opposition by more cooperative tribes the further they tried to go west.
---
I have no idea why this is relevant. We were talking about adaptive behaviors and whether or not things are hard-coded. Despite what happened after his death, Gengis' behavior was an evolutionary win because his genes are prolific to this day. 
---
I'm very happy that "cooperative behavior won out" but it did so culturally and not evolutionarily or genetically.
---
Next retail wow expansion reveal is most likely to happen. Then there's of course the fan favorite Diablo 4 but quite unlikely. WC3 remake might release there. But yeah apart from the retail expansion not much is guaranteed. Maybe something bigger for Overwatch.
---
I am still noy completely decided myself.
---
What I like most in Vanilla are the 5 man instances.
---
So definitely a warrior tank seems indicated.
---
But at some point I want to do some 40 man raids too and I am affraid due to limited play time I would have a hard time finding a slot in raids.
---
I can't candidate as MT due to my limited play time, is it usually easier to get a slot as offtank?
---
How many tanks are there in a 40 man raid?
---
Or, asking the question differently, how many  tanks should a guild stuff for healthy raiding?
---
My guess is 4 max for fights such as the 4 horsemen in Naxx but apart from this fight, most of the time only 1 tank + 1 offtank are needed right?
---
So I assume most of the time only 3 tanks are  needed and likely one of them would be a feral druid for the utility it can bring?
---
Every other day I chznge my mind between warrior, shaman for the many raid slots and more limited competition and hunter, because its the class I played the most during vanilla (and loved it!)
---
Yea it is but you don't need the bonus. I'd rather be making money with other professions than worry about 2 crit. My DPS is fine without it, never had issues on any p-server being in the top 3 mages.
---
snake trap used to either attack unflagged enemies or would attack flagged enemies while leaving you unflagged, this makes me think in old wow it would just reflect onto the trap
---
Wow, thank God there is this weekly thread. Good Lord, the spam of "ehehe what shud i play" was so annoying.
---
Be prepared for some of them to come the next day and complain about right-click reporting and how they did nothing wrong.

I think getting a second account just to idle in the Barrens is inevitable.

Maybe I can put some water on this flame. These apps are a common thing at any given big tech conference. Understand that most of this information you have already provided to the company running the event simply by registering and paying for your ticket. There are multiple reasons why this app is important, the top among them being that they clearly have had issues with people faking tickets to illegally gain access. Another big reason for this is to do analytics on the event itself. This involves tracking what you do with your app (literally every website can track what you click and see, and what website you were at before you came to their page) to better understand your interests. They could spend a ton of money on a booth that, based upon their data, didn’t gather much interest from the attendees. This app helps them to make a better conference next year by better understanding their client base and eliminating the stuff that people don’t care about. 
---
As someone who works in and with big tech firms (not gaming companies) the reasoning behind this isn’t some evil conspirator who wants to steal all your information, it’s an IT development staff who is trying to make the most out of understanding their customers to put on an event that is fun and engaging. 
---
If you don’t want companies to have your information, then do not have a phone or use a credit card, because everything you do is already being tracked.
---
Hope you don't have;
---
The Reddit app
---
Twitter 
---
Instagram
---
Discord
---
Snapchat
---
Aswell on your phone if you think this is a huge issue, because all of them also have similar permissions you're granting them when you download the app.
---
Could they have chose a better rated QR scanner?, Sure but if these permissions are your issues then you must have close to 0 apps on your phone
---
I think that's a very high number, lol... Especially considering how many people play private servers simply because they're free
---
Shit like this and people are still hopeful about classic
---
Always wondered why its considered a tank weapon. Has a on-hit proc that does damage. 
---
Isnt it a good weapon for rogues or fury warrior?
---
This sub may be active, but it's the same shit every single day for months. Obviously there isn't much to talk about, but the quality of content here is fucking garbage.
---
thank you
---
Yes, see [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX7RuUcd-3Q&amp;t=8m26s) at 08:26. No idea when they changed it to immune only though
---
Yeah, that on hit proc spreads to multiple mobs and does a thunder stomp debuff. That creates a ton of threat. You can't do that as dps in vanilla. Or at least you shouldn't unless you have a way over geared tank.
---
I make this joke all the time and in other games. You can not contain [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker] for it has transcended the boundaries of normal memes.
---
It's not about being serious, its just that there is a pretty massive elepehant in the room thats not being addressed when you just say flat out buff hp of mobs. If you would go far enough as to add abilities then people will cry slippery slope bfa retail lfr blabla, the point here isn't that about melee or ranged being liked or disliked, its that by simply just buffing content you affect the weaker camp a lot more than the strong camp (range vs melee) whilst all you did was make boss fights with one or two mechancis just take longer
---
You’ll probably be able to run it, but the settings will have to be a bit scuffed.
---
One thing you may want to look in to as an upgrade path once funds become available is some sort of [external GPU enclosure](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CQG2K5K/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_nRBZCbE93NAQ6) and an external GPU- your two biggest bottlenecks are probably going to be your integrated graphics and the actual heat of the CPU. 
---
You may also want to look in to cooling mechanisms now- I would keep an eye out for a lot of thermal throttling on your CPU. 
---
Realistically, download the starter edition of retail WoW and give it a test drive. Performance will probably be similar.

Near BIS DPS weapon for my pally. True fact.

---
because it doesn't matter. that's why these "business tactics" are rolling out undisturbed. you vote with your wallet but then a whale comes and substitutes 1k like you. seller is declaring it a huge success and moves on doing the same shit. or pushing deeper.
---
plus there is always a new generation coming along that doesn't know what's going on and think: hey, this must be the norm!
---
Restrict addons?  LOL addons in vanilla played the game for you.
---
Pretty sure blizzard hires a 3rd party company for security with metal detectors and all that. The security team isn't going to check if you have the app. There is no way to enforce this unless they just don't allow people in who don't have phones.
---
Aq 40? If we are talking that far in on the lifetime of a server all logic about BWL loot goes out the window. I doubt anyone will give a crap about who gets what item from BWL once you have AQ 40 "on farm". When you start clearing BWL, AQ will be 6-9 months away from even releasing. And thats assuming each phase lasts about 3 months. Could be even longer. You can't give people loot based on what upgrades the will get in 9 months lol thats why i specifically said BEFORE AQ is released.
---
&gt;Lol, oh, do you not know how warlock pve works?
---
Oh sorry, I wasn't aware that you have no idea how a Warlock is played correctly in 1.12. I will leave you to reading up on some guides.

neither can you.

---
Well youre wrong and living in a fairy tale world. Most people put themselves first and then think about being good 2nd and then decide to do a fraction of those things 3rd...
---
Doesnt say anything about additional threat. Is that something it always did?
---
I mean... this is a dumb move but I highly doubt high tier execs are involved in what specific app is going to be used for the tickets. 
---
&gt; completely standard retarded humans that talk themselves to the top.
---
Are we going to pretend that most people that make it to that level are just retards that stumbled into being on the board of a billion dollar company? Give me a break dude. This is retard speak for people trying to convince themselves that the only reason they aren't on top of the world is because they didn't get lucky.
---
The vast vast majority of people that make it to those positions did so working 60-80 hour weeks for years on end.
---
thanks for answering the question instead of assuming the worst like reddit always does
---
&gt; I have no idea why this is relevant.
---
Because you tried to use it to explain how uncooperative behavior is hardcoded, and that is simply nonsense.
---
&gt;but it did so culturally and not evolutionarily or genetically.

Your on a classicwow subreddit trying to start shit about relationships in the real world... youre an idiot lol...

Poorly, and only once.
---
so true, it was EU server, game only launched like a few weeks earlier , i think it dropped in the dinosaur area, or maybe i scooped it up from the ah, dont remember to clearly, but remember getting it as a worlddrop once for sure and then found out people payed mad gold for it :)
---
Good source. I don't see any changes to Ice Reflector in any patch notes, so I'm suspecting it was stealth-fixed sometime during BWL.
---
Right but after barrens horde have to go to Ashenvale, Stonetalon, Hillsbrad. Alliance have quests in all those zones, but also they can go to Duskwood, Redridge, Wetlands which have zero horde quests. Horde have no reason to go to those ally zones unless they're ganking, exploring or super lost.

So im not the only one with this dream..

Oh god this, the pain

Are you talking about [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker] ?

just arms until 60 then? no protection talents at all, but have a shield and one hander ready for dungeons?

Let's be real. Other RP realms are just better at keeping their ERP and Cyber PRIVATE rather than flaunting it.
---
&gt; A little refuge after a long journey before another one to the West. 
---
Horde I am assuming? I remember coming across this on Alliance and had a fantastic sense of foreboding. Great atmosphere that they wouldn't kill me on sight but I wouldn't look twice if I was dead in a ditch 2 minutes after walking through the archway.
---
But it should not be normal. If we all just accept this as normal then we lose.
---
Which?
---
I believe it was changed to not reflect onto the hunter in early BC/ BC pre patch. When Warriors got a baseline reflect.
---
It should reflect the trap onto the hunter in classic.
---
What sort of dps says no to more dps? Odd.
---
If you need money, farm dire maul or ZG, or roll an alt. Engineering/tailoring is the best way to deal the most damage as a mage.
---
And if you were top 3 with that sort of attitude, your competition wasn't very good.

Terrifying thought :shudder:

On pservers the barrens chat is still the same

Yea games never get delayed

When Jeremy got so addicted to WoW he completely forgot about C&amp;C lol.

im running 1.12.1 classic at 60 fps everything high  just not using aliasing on a i7 from 2012 with just the integrated hd4000 gfx , so no gfx card.
---
So u should be just fine, unless your gfx card drivers dont support dx11 or some weird stuff , but then just switch to your integrated gfx
---
any computer from after 2008 or so should be just fine as long as it still has recent drivers
---
I'm playing a hunter, and I want it.

Where in thr World did you get that ESO is WoWs biggest competitor? In terms of game design, FFXIV is the closest, and a lot of wow subs went there.
---
Here in germany the chance is 1: 140million  to win 77 Million Euro.
---
I currently play a WOTLK private server but will switch to Classic once it drops and probably stay regardless of changes/no changes.
---
We don't have any solid answers. However, I can only assume they'll do internal testing once the game is ready for it. They'll grab 40 people and kit them out with 60 gear; a mix of crafted, quested, and dungeon gear. They'll run into MC and see how it goes.
---
If, with the 1.12 changes to aggro and itemization, they roll over the raid without a moment's pause, I suspect they'll adjust the numbers. Because frankly, they'd be fools not to.
---
Why should he thought , why be upset over a whore?
---
It's based on experience. Lok'amir is a rare drop. My guild on Lightbringer server cleared Naxx, and did BWL every week after we killed Nef the first time and we only ever saw 1 Lok'amir.
---
While we were clearing AQ before Naxx came out we got at least 10 quest items that reward the staff. We were giving them to offspecs we had so many. We also never saw a C'Thun mace, another rare drop.  All but one of our paladins entered Naxx with Jindo's Hexxer.
---
So if you take one of two rare maces from paladins and give it to a druid who will certainly upgrade it in AQ, you are limiting your paladins come Naxx progression.

I agree. Can anyone add that has better knowledge and not just hearsay or specualtion?
---
We had 2 warriors with it and 1 rogue in our guild (we got very lucky), the rogue was always the top DPS in our guild and had highest DPS on our server.
---
You guys need to chill, we’re going to play soon alright
---
&gt; 1.13.
---
&gt; They'll use Patch 1.12 as base and fix some bugs.
---
Got source on this? Im curious to know what bugs you are talking about. To my knowledge 1.13.0 was just for BlizzCon demo.
---
I need to play on a private one
---
It’s good, but it looks amazeballs
---
One that is just WOTLK and back would be beautiful
---
Preach queen 🙌😩 couldn’t have said it better myself. Exactly why I started, then quit playing
---
Only one woman ever went down on Chuck Norris, she never came back up...
---
The proc is just insanely good at generating threat.
---
wat
---
You're forgetting that Horde gets Silverpine, and The Barrens actually covers a good portion of that leveling as well. 
---
Anyway, while it's not all horde favored at every single level of the way to 60, overall they come out on top.
---
Do my eyes deceive me? Is this an original post and not a meme?
---
I'm currently on Pservers but will make the swap when classic comes out. Most of it comes to that first point... my server could disappear at any time. Classic wont disappear randomly. I'll very gladly pay my sub for that stability.

BINGLE’S LOST TOOLS QUEST
---
MY LOST FAITH IN HUMANITY
---
Alternately, clearing a bunch of mobs for a chest only to find some a-hole looted it earlier and left a single grey trash item.
---
We won't really know for sure until the beta/release. It works that way on some private servers but that may just be errors.
---
not voting in this because there is no option for "never played a private server"
---
"no" implies you played at one time but stopped.
---
What people forget is that hundreds/thousands of people on the starting zone was not the Vanilla experience. WoW had a relatively slow adaption at the beginning, not to mention server stability issues and crappy internet on the consumer side.
---
I will happily take sharing in the starting zone. They are starting zones after all, the whole goal is to learn the base mechanics of the game. I already know how to play, so the sooner I can get out into the world, the better.
---
As far as loot trading goes, most organized raids will still use master loot. Even if it was for some reason on Free-for-all loot, idk how you think loot trading would prevent ninja looting. 
---
 And to those bashing PServer players, as obnoxious as that community is, they are the entire reason we are getting Classic.
---
pretty much.
---
my pet had nature resitance trained and due to the gear I was killing them much faster.  
---
Probably Joana was not even 60?
---
wow that is so full of bullshit
---
Guys, can you tell me about fury warrior in pvp (except that "arms is better"). I remember bits about playing it when I was a kid and I *think* it was super fun, but I don't remember anything except that I loved that ONLY CRIT cooldown. How viable is it solo in open world and in bgs without dedicated healer? Obviously I'm gonna level Eng and have potions with me, that goes without saying :)
---
Fwiw I'm also considering MM hunter, 30/0/21 Shaman and Rogue.
---
How so?
---
That's the primary philosophy behind nochanges.
---
Despite this, the vast majority of the nochanges crowd is OK or will still play despite the massive class revamps, many of which came many months/years after content patches
---
I mean yes. I never said they'd be checking if you have the app. That would likely be a privacy infringment. But they can search you and if you say you don't have a phone but you do... Maybe they won't let you in. I'm just brainstorming here.
---
If you can disable it, why? Other than it affecting those who don't know how to deny permissions it won't matter.
---
M8 to be clear I don't hold the position that uncooperative behavior OR cooperative behavior are hard-coded. I just took issue with your claim that its hardcoded. I've said before that cooperative behavior can be adaptive. Thats all those studies show btw, that cooperative behavior is sometimes adaptive. They don't show that rape or murder are unnatural behaviors for humans.
---
I don't think there will be anything worth going for personally in the slightest unless you want to see more phone shit like pokemon go WoW edition.
---
&gt; Got source on this? Im curious to know what bugs you are talking about. To my knowledge 1.13.0 was just for BlizzCon demo.
---
[The alpha/beta client is currently running on Patch version 1.13.2](https://i.redd.it/prf4d3gerys21.png) so it's pretty safe to assume that Classic will be 1.13.x and beyond.     
---
As for which specific bugs and fixes a 1.13. Patch version would entail: 
---
    
---
No one really knows until they give us some kind of patch notes. From interviews with the Classic team we know that they'll try to get game breaking stuff out of the game. 
---
I'd imagine that most of the fixes will relate to "under the hood" stuff, since Classic uses the retail client as basic foundation.
---
Oh shit same here. Have you seen the channel with the actual live stream classic zones? [This one!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfC5igEOK10)
---
It's super cool you can request zones and stuff.
---
don't even give me that when every other post here is talking about private servers which are also against the TOS
---
Yup... during all of Vanilla you could find those gloves on the AH for like 15-50g on my server. No one knew shit.
---
I've decided to play a Warlock! Feels great because I've spent like six months on that decision and now my body is READY
---
I played Vanilla WoW back in the day with a Pentium 3 1 ghz, with I believe 512mb of ram, and no dedicated video card.  
---
To say that I had some CTD issues would be an understatement. I could not run a music player, nor a voice chat client (Teamspeak/Ventrillo).
---
My Only concern is the 13” screen, i play on a 17” and i think its too small.
---
I swear I got MC'd once by a priest - only to have buffs put on me. 
---
Was that a thing? Or did I dream it?

For parents and students in the UK that are interesting in waiting for the holidays, they don't start until mid/end July. Just fyi not everyone is off at the same time across the globe.
---
I'll do them whenever i get them even if it's a "waste" of time.
---
no group content til 60 ? this is very sad to read
---
vanilla was hard and there's lots of reasons for that.
---
bad internet, bad computers, mostly non existent addons, shit itemisation, really shit talents, lack of knowledge sources. 
---
nowadays everything counted above is gone. you cant compare today's internet to the one you got 14 years ago, you cant compare today's shit computers to the ones available in vanilla, you will get plenty of addons, 1.12 itemisation, 1.12 talents, youtubers/streamers are practically hunting you down to tell you "how it's done".
---
basically, we will get a LFR version of what vanilla was.
---
Hmm, okay I see. Thank you.
---
What on earth are you making? 100k dollars a year?
---
It is calculated into what the customer is paying for your service, it's not taken out of the pay to the working man, no.
---
We still need a definitive answer from Blizzard.
---
I am very wary of their plans, since they haven't specified exactly what they plan to do.
---
At this point of development I suspect they know the following:
---
* How many realms to release
---
* What types of realms to release
---
* What regions and timezones the realms will be
---
* Under what circumstances they will engage sharding
---
* If some realm types (RP?) will have sharding completely disabled
---
I don't want a "surprise, we are using sharding" event like we had with the demo.
---
I'm also concerned that once they start using sharding they are going to keep using it to "fix" problems outside of the starter zones.
---
For example... what happens when everyone gets to 60 and the Capital cities have very large populations?  Is Blizzard going to reintroduce sharding to "fix" any perceived problems?
---
I would rather deal with inconveniences that come with large populations over the "cure" that comes with sharding.
---
Dude you're not in the minority. We get threads like this all the time that repeatedly push for things when arguments, valid ones, have been made explaining why people are against x change.
---
and that proves it :) thanks!
---
Seriously though, you should stop talking about anything gameplay related if you're awful at every game you play.
---
*"I'm gettin' back in line!"*
---
Yes. The threat generation was so good that it was still used in TBC at 70 until they patched it to generate less threat.
---
&gt;No idea who's right, I hate uncertainty !
---
I'm not sure either unfortunately. I think it's worth noting that in the website you linked, they also used the 8.6% miss number for 300 weapon skill - so that's what a player back in Vanilla thought the calculation was too (which is not to say he was correct). 
---
&gt;Why do you add the min damage to the max ? I thought it was the max that was important ?
---
I'm not sure why this would be. Shouldn't we just care about the averages? Like if there was a choice between two weapons, one which does 1-101, and another which does 99-100, the one with lower max damage is obviously better
---
&gt;If you have any reliable sources where I can educate myself how to properly calculate the final DPS of a hunter I'll take them. I really want to dev something but without reliable formulas it will be pointless
---
I don't unfortunately
---
Having the option of using the new models would only have a tiny impact on balance but having the ability to change the models of anything else is impossible (the new models from cataclysm does not match the old ones) at the moment and would require a whole team of artists to join the classic team to do a 1:1 recreation of all assets..
---
I think the one on the lips is Metzen's.
---
The more hardcore guilds will most likely choose a server and the rest will follow.
---
What is everyone's thoughts on mages for farming gold in Phase 1. Obviously DM is go-to, but it's not out until P2. I'm assuming Maraudon or BRD?
---
Definitely aspire to rank 10. In vanilla I ranked up to 11 SOLO. You do not have to group up, but you do have to be consistent with your time. Ranks 9-11 are rough but I managed by playing 6 hours each night.
---
If you can swing it join a guild or a premade once bgs are available. It'll cut those hours down a bit.
---
Not well. It's the same with movies and music and TV shows. Can't fight culture. One of the reasons the old school MMO worked so well is because there was limited connectivity. We didn't have cell phones and snapchat. We had chat rooms and pagers! The idea of a giant connected fantasy world was appealing. Now, kids live every day in a giant fantasy world ...

1. Server crashing was a thing in Vanilla. I really don’t want to bring that back.
---
nah.
---
I'm gonna pick what realm I want, you guys do you.
---
don't forget, not everyone is in the same time zone, some people want PvP, some want PvE, some want RP, etc.
---
we don't even have a list of servers yet, and probably won't for some time.
---
tl;dr I appreciate the sentiment, but no thank you.

That would cause an outrage within the community as they promised summer release several times.
---
Holy paladin
---
80k people on a realm with 3k concurrent players sounds pretty horrible.
---
&gt; I don't understand why we would need a dedicated server for better graphics.
---
Because they would have to recreate the old models 1:1 and that requires an entire art team. They cannot just use the cata models because those do not match.
---
**Let me save everyone some time, the entire point of the bloated ass 11 minute video was to tell you how to farm the Scorpids and Skitterers in Silithus.**
---
5 fucking minutes of backstory on AQ so you can inflate the video length over 10 minutes before even getting to the actual information the video existed to convey (grinding spots).
---
There's probably some that are skippable for speedleveling in purposes, but in general it's best to just do all your class quests. They're a unique element in Classic which retail WoW could certainly do with, provide lore and class fantasy to make alt-leveling more interesting, and many of them can give some pretty OP Gear for the level you get them, with that one warlock robe quest you get at 32ish coming to mind.
---
Geez. Negative nancys nevermind lol.
---
Sounds like a burn out Inc
---
Obligatory sorry for formatting, on mobile device.   I never played WoW, and as time went on and more and more expansions came out, I became less and less interested due mainly to learning a mew game that kept changing. I'm interested in classic wow to give the game a shot. Can anyone link me to a classic wow for dummies or something. I want to brush up and learn meta and what classes can do fully specced before I hop in and choose a toon and mess it up. I just don't know where to start. Does anyone have any resources for this?
---
Greed means releasing the game later and missing out in millions in sub fees?
---
I want Warcraft 4 before a World of Warcraft 2.
---
but both of those seem extremely unlikely to ever happen.
---
 (then again, most of us probably thought Classic would never happen, right? who knows?)
---
I'm going to whatever pvp server has the most people and opening a pvp guild with my irl friends....

Going to be so much world pvp

---
Just to share some insight from a developer point of view. 
---
1. If you’re on iOS, you have nothing to worry about with this app because of native privacy. If you give any of this away, you’ll be made aware beforehand, but from when I’ve used the app, it’s not a problem. 
---
2. If you’re on Android, you still probably have nothing to worry about. Most Android phones out there, the iOS stuff also applies to you. Some, though, the permissions are given by default without your knowing, but you agreed to it when you bought the phone. 
---
3. Access to each of these things could be because of the fact you can do a lot with your ticket. You can give it to a contact, for example. It pulls internet data, as all apps do. Considering the features of the app, none of the things OP listed should be surprising. 99% of the apps you all use do the same thing. Realistically, if you still have Facebook on your phone, you can’t possibly care about this app anyway. 
---
4. This could have been what I call “lazy-developer-syndrome.” They might not need all this information from you, but sometimes requesting it all so you have it is easier than putting in the time to make sure you only request what you need.
---
Stick to retail friendo.
---
I got no idea tbh but I think most (younger) gamers are more into short and fast paced combat games. I think a lot of younger people end up getting bored too quickly if they have to commit too much time into improving their character and stuff.
---
Wow.... to see that item for such a low price, that's nuts.
---
Really interesting that the weight more than doubles, I would't have thought that. The spreadsheet is awesome and exactly what I was looking for. Thanks a lot dude.
---
Great Video Frost, really enjoy your content
---
You need a damage gear set or you're shit out of luck.
---
I wouldn't put much faith in that guy.  Tipsout is a fucking idiot.
---
I think they could do the same for offensive stats as well. Imagine if they added a raid with bosses that was strong versus physical damage but weak versus fire damage. Then they also introduced weapons with effects that convert some percentage of all melee damage you deal to Fire damage. Such weapons would have clear advantages over regular ones for this raid but might not be so great for regular usage.
---
I've been dicking around or a private classic server. The art direction is so good that the game still looks great.
---
On the other hand, I checked out EQ 2 for the first time in like 12 years. The modern client looks like an inside out asshole, while it was considered more graphically advanced in 2004.
---
that's how I'm going to do it too. just dive right in. figure it out. if I really get stuck on something, THEN pull up the 'ol google. but not before. what fun is having wowhead or icyveins or whatever play the game for you?
---
An argument could be made that it'd be a big change of pace from most games and that could be very appealing (or very unappealing, who knows).
---
Was just lvling for fun recently and got those gloves at lvl 48 in Feralas, 800g! Sadly won't have the same luck at release.
---
They do, yes, I've been leveling a rogue on a pserv w/ engi and bombs make me capable of pulling multiple mobs successfully that likely would kill me otherwise
---
Terrible comparison.  Private servers exist because there’s no legal way to play classic or other previous states of the games as they were - none, zero.  I’m not arguing that pservers are lawful or moral,  I’m arguing that they’re inevitable if given no alernative.  Classic has been a market demand that Blizzard has failed to meet up to this point, and the loss is theirs.
---
Gold, on the othe hand, actually has the option of being earned by just playing the damn game.  Of course it’s held in different regards than pservers.
---
Yeah, who gives a fuck about what happens to other people?
---
Also happy cake day
---
F*u
---
Worgen is more fitting.
---
I’d look at MadSeasonShow’s class picking video which is like 50 minutes long but it’s worth it to get a good overview of all the classes and their capabilities.
---
Yeah I'd like this as well. Not that I mind the old look, I just like the nice visuals of the new look. The weather effects, sky boxes, ambient occlusion, shadows, etc.
---
Play a hunter. Send pet to attack while you auto shoot. Set pet on defensive and you can afk longer periods of time
---
That’s how I felt being a frost DK in mythic HFC. I parsed 99th percentile for my frost DKs, so my guild thought really highly of me despite barely ever topping the dps charts (I did a good job keeping up tho).
---
I don't think he's suggesting entirely new stats. He's suggesting they use existing stats in new ways.

---
Youtube Vurtne. You can thank me later.
---
Priests are great soloers in my experience. I've leveled 2 to 60 in classic and several on different private servers. You won't need 3 sets but a damage set and a healing set is not too much to ask.
---
Didn’t it take over 5 months to down Rag for the first time?
---
Consider the context where most people going to BlizzCon are gamers and will understand tech and their phones, it's not that bad.
---
Yes, there is zero correlation between hard work and success I'm America.
---
Thanks for letting us know man. We'll get right on fixing that for you.
---
Right, but thats with the power of hindsight. Its easy to look back and say “did this decision lead to a positive or negative outcome”.
---
Running a dungeon with 4 randoms and after struggling for a little bit with a boss when someone randomly decides to leave. The struggle to find someone to fill that spot when 4 of us are already in the dungeon is a nightmare and a lot of the times leads to a sad disbanding.
---
I just looked at Joana's video again (I'm glad I saved the videos a while ago, because apparently YouTube deleted them because they thought it was pserver footage). He went to Silithus at lvl 55, however he fought lvl 55 mobs, so technically not the same one than you.
---
But you're right, nature resist + faster killing speed should explain the difference, I'm probably too paranoid about pserver differences ;-)
---

I've played a ton of WPvP as an Elemental Shaman on undocumented servers. Elemental is by far the best spec for both BGs and WPvP, for duels it's up to debate. Enhancement has very good talents if you're into min-maxing high level dueling against melee specifically. Resto Shamans offer very little additional healing and Mana Tide Totem isn't exactly a game changer for PvP (it is in PvE).   
---
Your role in groups as an Elemental Shaman consists of preventing CC done to your group through totems, bursting down priority targets from a distance and purging targets from their beneficial buffs in order for your group to kill them faster. Interrupting enemy spell casts and healing your group are nice additions but the main strength is your burst damage.  
---
Elemental Shaman's have the highest on demand burst out of any class. Lighting bolt &gt; Chain Lightning &gt; Shock of your choice on a 6\~ second cooldown is insane. It's not impossible to kill an opponent before say an Enhancement Shaman would even find the time to get into Melee range. Sure other classes can deal more burst but it's more much conditional, situational or otherwise cooldown dependant. A 3 minute Mage can deal more burst through Pyroblast &gt; Presence of Mind &gt; Pyroblast &gt; Fireblast but that requires a longer setup and sits on a much longer cooldown. A Paladin can get a full reckoning stack, an Enhancement Shaman can get a sextuple Windfury crit from an Auto Attack + StormStrike and a full reckoning Paladin can also burst higher if the stars align... but none of them have it from ranged on a mere couple of seconds cooldown.  
---
As a side note, almost everybody believes that the best spec an Elemental Shamans could use is a 30/0/21 build where you take Natures Swiftness over Elemental Mastery. I am not one of those people, this is because in my years of playing Elemental Shaman I found that with situational awareness proactive high mobility is much more valuable than a reactive heal or additional burst once every 3 minutes. I'm talking of course about Improved Ghost Wolf, this talent is highly undervalued by players who don't play Elemental Shamans themselves. Your ability to get 2 seconds faster to your friends for buffs and heals or your opponent for interrupts, slows or damage at any time during combat more than makes up for what you could otherwise do once every 3 minutes.   
---
Another nice bonus is that you can increase your maximum mana by 5%, while this may not seem like much it's often the case that you can 1v2 but not 1v3 only because you run out of mana. Both Elemental Mastery (a talent that can make your most expensive spell free) and Ancestral Knowledge can make the difference between killing that third guy or dying simply because you run oom. Freeing up a potion slot for say additional healing or Limited Invulnerability is also way more powerful than having to chuck a mana potion.
---
Fuck man I just got out of a three year relationship and this post is making me realize I might be putting way to much want into this game to distract me from the emptiness inside.
---
I see you have never worked at the executive level. 
---
I have. Not at the level of blizzard...but if they keep making mistakes...how can you assume they are all around smart.
---
They may know how to do short term gains...but they always end up screwing themselves. And just look at their decision making process. 
---
Most of the people at the top kissed the right asses to make it, others knew the right person and networked their way up there. Its why they have no understanding of the value of work.
---
I had to literally sit down and explain to a board of executives, that the reason they were losing money every month is because they did not have an inventory management plan that included expired products and “waste”. It was all “we buy this many products...and sell this many and we have a huge gap of losses” now mind you they also werent charging for half the shit because the billing department had no plan to follow and it was done to the bare minimum. (I forgot to add this was a rather large medical care company in the DC area)

I used to read the Vanilla retail box and booklet while pooping. The booklet lasted for a few years before the moisture destroyed it (from the shower, not necessarily by my poops). The good ol' days when mom cleaned the toilets ... I should get her something nice for mother's day.

I think the distinction might revolve around if the hunter FD's after placing the trap.

My experience with Debufs is that they lose the 'owner' if they are applied while the owner is not in combat.
---
This statement shows a gross misunderstanding of biology.
---
Firstly fat isn’t a good “energy” storage for day to day hence your body stores glucose, fat is also a pretty poor catabolic energy storage.
---
A fat person would have a much higher BMR than a normal person e.g. a 300 lbs person would have a BMR of about 2800-3000 kcal while a 180lbs person would have a BMR of 1800-2000 kcal.
---
This means that the fat person by default would have to eat itself more just to survive.
---
A fat person would go to its energy stores faster, ketosis can only produce about 300-500 calories a day which means that a fat person would also primarily would go and break down muscle tissue for food.
---
However unless you are a body builder weighting at 300 lbs your muscle mass isn’t going to be sufficient to sustain you so you’ll start breaking down critical muscle tissue such as your heart.
---
So yes if you are fit you’ll outlive a fatso even when starving.
---
There literately isn’t a single case where being fat is advantageous.
---
He says it came from a private server that he saw through until the end - which means it can't be ND, because that server isn't through yet. It's probably something based on the Nostcore, meaning he would've gotten it directly from the nostcore database, like I did.

The feral talents are for tanking, but with some decent gear you should be fine. If I'm playing drood, it'll be like this fom pre-raid till BWL. Also good for some PVP; fc WSG and flag def AB.
---
He ded now.
---
Yeah but the caveat is that you have to aoe level to be really effective.  A good conc on a group of enemies, auto attack, and healing yourself can bring down a few enemies at a time.

Thats how it works on private servers, I've reflected the trap of hunters that are like 100 yards away from me.
---
theres also a private server called burning soulworker in case you dont like some of the pay to win aspects, but it shouldnt be that bad. Also the private server gives you set of gear every 10 levels so it feels like cheating.
---
This made me feel more nostalgia than anything. My heart is welling up a little bit.

Oh yeah.. I remember reading the manual included in the box when driving home from the mall. Although much of it was self-explanatory, I read every single piece of information.

IRL is the MMO for kids to explore after they get out from insta, snap, twitch, youtube and other whatever stuff they do 24/7.
---
Feigning death to drop combat then using goblin jumper cables on the healer to save the raid.
---
High damage and healing would not be balanced.  Expect to always kill slow compared to any class that can't heal.
---
Highest damage you can probably get is a Smite Priest with power infusion but I don't think you can raid like that (I don't play Priest).
---
I honestly suggest not picking a support class (all of the healers) if you don't plan to support anyone (play alone mostly).  But, to each their own.
---
Sarcasm is a hard thing to detect and portray over the internet :). That was supposed to be free karma but backfired on me... yikes.
---
What the f. That cheap? Rest assured, those gauntlets will be worth 100g+ in Classic.
---
Or just don't give these people money and then come up with an excuse to rationalize it?
---
Yea these LFR people are missing the point. The raids themselves aren’t necessarily difficult but the preparation and coordination needed for the raids are the hard parts.
---
I'm going to be reading quest text too. During my old days I was pressured by friends to get to the cap ASAP since I started later than all of them. It always felt like a rush. And even more so when xpacks came out. Going to be chill this go around and actually read the quests. Hopefully give me a better feel about the zones and why things are the way they are.
---
This is the one thing that makes my blood boil. You can literally take the bananas first and throw them away. Then again some people want to watch the world burn.
---
that 50% is largely developing countries. You're muddying the waters if you want to imply that you or I or OP have a good chance of getting an ulcer due to fasting.

Can't you just not give money to people who come up with this shit?
---
Resto druid in feral gear does just fine
---
It was the best! If I remember correctly it had a lot of information from the events in Warcraft 3 (and maybe 2?) with the old maps and locations. I never actually read the manual part lol, 13 year old me thought he had all the answers. Thinking back to those days, i *really* should have read the manual ... Who knew that ignoring the stats to ensure my first character looked badass mattered?
---
&gt; Shit like this and people are still hopeful about ~~classic~~ society
---
FTFY
---
Its a re-release, not a new game, this alone already means the game will have less players. Also, trust me on this one, no one that wants classic will admit it, but i'd rather have a small fanbase than moronic tourists.
---
It won't beat retail, and the player base will SIGNIFICANTLY drop  over the first 5-6 months. So again, what does your statement prove, exactly? Nothing...there are far more reason why classic isn't beating retail but that's a different story.
---
Retail failing doesn't mean classic was better. Retail is failing because it's neither a World, nor an RPG/social game. Its a single player game with mythics for those who are blessed with old time friends that still play. For every one else it's nothing but a single player game with occasional grouping. Im not going to write walls to discuss this further, but you are looking under heavy tunnel vision.
---
Do you require a strawman to have a discussion?
---
As someone who started playing WoW in 2007 when I was 10 a big part of it was at the time how unique it was. A whole social world before social media even existed and that was a big draw, despite being considered casual compared to MMOs of the time. The slow pace mostly didn't matter because just being online with other people was so unique and fun in itself, talking to guildies, barrens chat, goldshire ehem... but that's lost when, like others said, kids are on a plethora of social media it would need a contemporary unique draw like that once more that I can't foresee at the moment
---
Well, there are Skyrim-alike ruins in Drustvar so... :)
---
The average kid's attention span has decreased significantly since the dawn of MMOs. Classic is very slow paced, however, that doesn't necessarily mean it won't amass a population of newer younger players if it becomes successful.
---
Things like this are going to slowly add up, its just not something that the nochanges people want to risk whenever they get literally no benefit for the changes because they aren't going to be using them anyways.
---
Hey, it sucks they got rid of the models in retail, but I'm still in the crowd off having options. I think they should add it back to retail, just as much as I think we shouldn't be too concerned about peole crying about a non-issue. Blizz seems to put a lot of care into this restoration project, on this one I dont think some reddit circlejerk, or forum screamers is going to change a thing. No use in being riled up until it happens.
---
I would absolutely love to see this game updated with graphics such as Unreal Engine.
---
My druid needs this for bragging points
---
Edgemaster's don't have to do with stats so much as with the glancing blows mechanic. When attacking a mob whose defense skill is higher than your weapon skill, there's a chance that any given white-hit will "glance" which means you do some percentage of a normal white-hit. Weapon skill above your baseline ability helps to compensate for raid-mobs being 3 levels above you by making glances do a higher percentage of a normal hit than they otherwise would.
---
It did at one point.  Might have been in beta bit I remember it being patched out at some point.
---
People are going to mod the shit out of Classic until it is indistinguishable from Retail and then come to Reddit to complain about how similar they are.
---
if you get it asap phase 2, it will be very strong (rank 14 weapon mh and tf oh will be legit). However, once AQ40 and naxx roll around, it will be mediocre.
---
I will still definitely get one on my rogue because it's the best looking weapon in the game imo, but if you want to stay competitive, you wont use it in raids =/
---
I could be wrong but I seem to remember using warrior spell reflect to trap hunters in their own trap also.
---
I think it was nostalrius, but I'm not sure. There was a hunter named Huntardation in his own guild "The Melee Hunter". Dude was legit.
---
Get your own damn tools, Bingles. I'm too old for this shit.
---
I think people here are missing something. Kids always mostly played fast paced action-oriented games. Not many kids in my school played WoW, but I know waaaay more that would play Call of Duty, League of Legends, Mortal Kombat, etc. 
---
But there still are nerdy kids that love games like D&amp;D, Final Fantasy, and Elder Scrolls, where there is a significant time investment to see it through to it's end. Granted, theres not really a huge MMO to fill that role at the moment, but that doesn't mean people won't play it when it exists.
---
Now, will it be as popular with that demographic as it *was*? Probably not, but I think we will all be surprised with how many 10-15 year olds are in our raid.
---
After watching this I had to go watch all of the others and subscribe. Genuinely good content, comedic timing, slapstick, that old school looney toons kind of simplicity. I look forward to more of these!
---
&gt;group content while leveling is the most fun
---
For you.
---
Other people like other things.
---
 And here we thought it was attention to detail, hah! :P
---
They should but they won't.
---
https://www.nber.org/digest/jul06/w11895.html
---
Why do you say? I've watched a few of his videos and they seemed good.
---
It's not even as great as it was once perceived from 2006. Still a great novelty item though :O
---
You don't become a indestructible killing machine with skills no, but you can very easily clear content that was meant to be possible.
---
Could be Mara or Sunken Temple.
---
No, they will play BR games
---
I was a kid and only ever raised ZG and ONY which I actually thought were the first and easiest two raids. I am excited to try out many of the others for the first time and get to experience that.
---
Main reason was a vid I watched where he advocated  for and rolled on lavish ring from deadmines as a warrior against a mage and priest.  Among other things.
---
Depends on the profit and how much money they expect to make. There are people for everything, and then there is greed/goals.
---
It will be played, if it's fair and supported. It wont bring massive amounts of money but it will be played and it will bring profit. 
---
Thing is, these days most companies want to make the most with as little investment as possible.
---
Times changed indeed, but its only that which makes the biggest noise which is noticed, but there are still people for everything and there will always be. 
---
Id say yes, kids will play it but it wont be as famous, which isn't a bad thing. Trying to please everyone however dooms it. Something that happened with Retail.
---
I've given up on playing my main. So, I just gank people on my low level rogue and make people whisper me "KILL YOURSELF LITTLE SHIT" over and over. :) It's fun gameplay though, lots of good fights, and I'm going Alli in Classic, so I have to enjoy my hordiness while it's here.
---
But Silverpine and The Barrens are Horde-controlled by default. All of the 10-20 zones are uncontested, Alliance or Horde.
---
I've played a lot of Shaman and I can tell you that Resto Shamans are not going to win through burst or surprise attacks. Good Resto Shaman builds don't get access to a 2H talent for their RNG Windfury auto attack + StormStrike or Lightning Mastery for their improved Lightning Bolt + Chain Lightning 1 sec casting time, which makes a 2 second difference every time you cast the LB + CL combo.  
---
This is not to say Resto Shamans can't do well in duels, it's quite the opposite. They perform very well and are in my opinion an underrated dueling class because of 1 spell: Lightning Shield. Any class that can't burst down a mail+shield wearing Resto Shaman will slowly but surely die. What many Resto Shamans fail to do is have an actual 100% upkeep of Lightning Shield during duels, I cannot understate that it is your primary source of damage and you can't afford to slip and 'forget' to buff yourself with it, every couple of seconds you don't have it up directly results in your opponent having extra time to execute their gameplan.  
---
Some matchup info:
---
Rogues, Warriors, Hunters have a losing matchup vs Resto Shamans. Any burst they can do will be out-healed before you die and appropriate reactive measures + Lightning Shield upkeep will slowly kill them.  
---
Druids completely lack burst vs Resto Shamans and get demolished by Purge as they can't keep their own health up through interrupts and removal of hots. 
---
Mages can beat you if they get a good Counter Spell on you while you're in a bad position. If they fail to do this then the Resto Shaman will win.
---
Priests that can dispel Lightning Shield run the risk of going out of mana once the Resto Shaman mixes it up by putting Rank 1 Lightning Shield on themselves as a mixup. Priests that have the Improved Mana Burn talent will bypass the Searing Totem / Auto Attack / Grounding Totem / Earth Shock lockout you want to hold on them and consequentially beat Resto Shamans by draining their mana.  
---
Then there are Warlocks which you shouldn't duel because it's a near impossible matchup as Resto as long as they use their puppy.  
---
Shaman vs Shaman is a 50/50 because a Shaman can only win if another Shaman loses and I don't recommend fighting Paladins, neither of you will win it's a stalemate.
---
Losing only 2 out of 9 matchups going even with another 2 and winning 5 out of 9 matchups is quite good. Getting the Improved Lightning Shield talent is very easy because you're already forced to take Ancestral Knowledge and handicapping yourself by only 3 talents is barely noticeable if at all for PvE.
---
&gt; It's the same with movies and music and TV shows. Can't fight culture
---
Just go look at at IMDB top 100 for evidence of this. Tons of great thought provoking movies with deep stories being outranked by mindless CGI.
---
You can, but I can all but guarantee the app will refuse to work without accepting them.
---
How's the view up there from your high horse?
---
I’m also in a casual raid guild that I really enjoy and it’s the only reason I keep a subscription. I log in twice a week for a total of 6hrs a week just to raid with them. Sometimes I’ll log in to level alts, but that’s pretty slow. I asked them what their plans are and it looks like only one person knows for sure they’re playing classic. Oh well, they’ll be plenty of guilds to join in classic. 
---
I know for sure I’m going to play classic more, especially with BFA being current expac. I’ll still raid with my guild though.
---
LUL
---
And it's not even a good grinding spot.
---
Man youtubers nowadays.
---
No!! Eay to hoard more and more, not helping my disease! ;)
---
oh bro u got me, especially with that downvote
---
im just tired of autistic reddit users like you, ive had enough of this shit lately tbh. you legit dont worth any of my time at this point
---
Given that the entry cost is only $15, I wouldn’t expect so.
---
Full Tier 3 and Rank 14 on every class of course.
---
Included with what?
---
There is no physical copy to include a pass with.
---
Included with first month sub? Can I use it myself for 40 days instead?
---
Just buy 90m different tickets then... ez
---
There are some spots in BRD that are possible at phase 1 as a mage even if mobs have net ability(which they probably will have as it's added in 1.11). Mining is kinda a must and it's a very hard aoe grind, good aoe gear and skill is a must. 
---
Other than that, potentially there's a farming spot in LBRS, where if you clear the dungeon there's some ever respawning scorpionings with poor drop table(but because they spawn instantly and there's many of them it's okay). Though pserver loot table is probably wrong, possibly they don't drop shit, but heck they could also drop a lot.
---
For Warrior:
---
1 STR = 2 AP
---
1 AGI = 1 AP and 0.05% Crit (20 AGI = 1% Crit)
---
As the post above said Weapon skill is incredibly powerful due the glancing blows mechanic. That is why everyone plays Human or Orc when it come to Warrior and why Edgemasters are arguably the best gloves in the game for raid Bosses.
---
As you gear improves, crit and hit scale faster than pure AP would.  If you're crit capped hit will greatly surpass crit in value.
---
STR and AGI are better stats as opposed to crit and pure AP alliance side thanks to BoK and especially with a heart of hakkar buff, this greatly alters stat weights. While on horde AP can be slightly more valued since WF procs aren't normalized (this becomes very apparent with a slow 2h).
---
Probably more close to a 1000g
---
Lol sounds like me all of BC and Wrath with my rogue, even through the nerfs.
---
oh no you've had enough? :( damn it'd be a shame if you killed yourself. you and your post history have school shooter vibes - this along with your lack of skill in games is probably gonna blow at some point, i'd get some help
---
Woman youtubers nowdays are rare.
---
Resto sham ele off spec
---
Nah, this kid thinks they need classic wow as an incentive to sell blizzcon tickets. They have such a hard time filling out that convention center every year that they raised the price per ticket $30.  /s
---
I've done this.
---
It's not amazing to play "elemental" but with resto spec. You lose out on the crit damage, good amount of crit chance and ofc the fast cast on lightning bolt and chainlightning. You do get eye of the storm which is one of the better talents. It can certainly work as a poormans choice.
---
Alternatively you can just tell your raid to piss off and try go for 30-0-21 :D It's really not that bad for healing, and it's amazing for pvp.
---
As for the gearing part, most of your items will be raid gear, generally tier gear with spell power, and stuff like that. The best healing mace in BWL gives spellpower so :D A great shield and all that and you are good to go. 
---
As for healing, no it's not just chain healing all the time, it depends if the fight is aoe or not. If there's any aoe, then generally R1 chainheal spam is the way to go.
---
https://www.businessinsider.com/it-turns-out-the-smartest-people-do-run-the-us-2014-4
---
The higher up the food chain you go, the smarter people are, generally speaking. 
---
I don't buy your vision that everyone who ends up in these positions just ended up there by dumb luck. Most of them are smart people who worked their ass off.
---
An argument of authority doesn't really make your argument stronger, it just shows that you need something to lean on to be convincing. Anecdotal evidence from a few people you personally worked with doesn't indicate how the system works as a whole.
---
Competence is how physically weak and frail humans ended up at the top of the food chain. Competence levels among people is one of the biggest indicators of success and there is an absurd amount of science to back that up.
---
It felt weird when Anduin shouted "For the Alliance!" as if it was a copy-paste. I mean "Stand as one" was cool enough.
---
Agility doesn't give you AP as a warrior. Warriors, paladins, shamans and druids in bear form get 2 ap from strength rouges and druids in cat gains 1 ap from strength and one ap from agility. Hunters gain 2 mele ap from strength and 2 range ap from agility
---
No one has tried so really hard to say. Some vague researches on internet show that kids/teens prefer consoles/portable devices over PC, while young adults/adults lean more towards PC still. That being said, after playing mmos over a decade now I can say from experience there is always a younger population of games within an mmo.
---
If anything poor people get smartphones more often. They cant afford a tablet and a laptop, they need an all in one and they already need a phone in general so win win.
---
I want to do every dungeon and raid with my friends at least once while it's relevant. So doing wc, sfk DM, even stocks while I'm 18-25, and as we level doing a dungeon at each level range. I know it's not the fastest for leveling but that sounds so fun as a group. Hell well even do sunken temple when the time comes! And a full clear or brd sounds amazing. Then when we hit max level, the long process of gearing  to do each of the raids begins. Could be 2-3 years before we get to it all lol
---
My only goal in classic is to hit 60 on my gnome frost mage and turtle the hell out of AV games by 75% blizzard slow. Maybe hit rank 11?
---
Hitting 60 on a warrior seems cool, but I hate raiding so it seems pointless to max a warrior if I can't gear up.
---
Have as much fun with my friends as possible. Finally going to play a game together again.
---
+1
---
&gt; I hate single target leveling
---
You're going to have a rough time in Classic.
---
For early game, a few Dreamwave pieces can make it easier for everyone since not much gear comes with +dmg or +heals. [https://classic.wowhead.com/search?q=dreamweave](https://classic.wowhead.com/search?q=dreamweave) \+ [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18082/zumrahs-vexing-cane](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18082/zumrahs-vexing-cane)
---
For late game. you will need at least 2 sets of gear. I suggest getting the pvp set as your dmg gear. It's easy to get and comes with great stats especially if you're on a pvp server. I hate pvp but grinding AV isn't to bad at all plus the gear from quests/rep are very nice. Until it's released, just grab a few pieces when you can. The above should last you a good while.
---
Priest - Mindblast, dot and wand. Not worth the time to spam smite and drink.
---
Shaman - Flametongue, shocks and totem.
---
Druid - 0/30/21 build with some hybrid gear will let you tank, dps and heal. Caster staff won't gimp you either.
---
Paladin - SoR + BoW + quick judgings can speed it up. Something like 11/0/12 by lvl 32. Grind undead/demon when possible.
---
That's fine. I think the issue is that there are individuals who are so adamant about EVERYONE reliving Classic like it was in 2004, graphically, when it shouldn't matter to them. If Blizzard is forcing classic models, that's fine with me, and most likely anyone. However, if the option is on the table, I don't understand the vitriol having updating models gets at times.
---
If there's a toggle, no one should care.
---
I plan on crafting these even though I'm leveling feral 0/30/21 for hybrid gameplay. 3 Dreamweave + a staff. gg
---
I'm guessing the current free trial to lvl 20 is gonna work on classic as well,  maybe with some restrictions.
---
Sharding is a temporary fix for a temporary problem.
---
What makes these so special?
---
Yeah that's pretty fucked.
---
Huh? Even games like Everquest allow you to use old or new models. I am quite sure Blizzard has the capability of doing it quite easily. But again, as Grayland91 said, it wouldn't matter to a lot of us. We just want to play WoW Classic regardless of graphics. However, having that option would be a nice addition.
---
DoNt YoU gUyS hAvE pHoNeS?
---
oh don't get me wrong I'm not doing the "hate it bcz its not classic" thing, I love most of WoW's OST but I think the problem when you CHANGE music in places that you fundamentally change the feel of a zone. 
---
"Nightsong" is a great song, I agree, but do any of the Night Elf zones have the same peaceful magic about them now that you run through them and that plays instead of just the MagicForest tracks?
---
no
---
Nothing specific, though getting Corrupted Ashbringer is certainly on my list of things I want to do.
---
There are places in the US where you can get gigabit for less than $100/mo, and there are places where 1.5mbps costs $70/mo. The US is a very large place with spread out populations and lots of rural areas. If you [compare the size of Sweden to US](https://i.imgur.com/Vd4J6rQ.png)(not my map) then you should be able to see why it is easier to upgrade infrastructure for one than the other.
---
i love that you are using the AV rep arrows
---
I am not currently subscribed, but I re-subscribed when BfA came out after skipping both WoD and Legion, and played for several months, getting into a mythic guild.
---
The day Classic was announced, a switch flipped inside me. The people in my BfA guild, the raids, the loot, the gold, it lost all meaning. It was like walking around in a dream, knowing I am dreaming, and knowing that nothing mattered. I talked to a few people in the guild about Classic, and all I got was indifference. So 3 Weeks after the announcement, I simply logged off and haven't logged into the game since. My subscription ran out months ago. I don't care that I was booked for raids. I don't care that there was mail in my postboxes, I don't care that I just got a huge upgrade on my weapon.
---
I know that I will only log into my BfA account after classic releases, to convert all banked-up gold into tokens. Once that's done, Retail will never see me again.
---
Bottom line:  
---
If you are currently in a guild on retail, ask the people if they wanna stick to the game. If they won't, forget them. Don't waste time on a game you no longer wanna play, just because some people like the ridiculous carousel retail wow has become.
---
Worst feeling in wow? So you mean any of it?  The first day of Cata knowing everything had changed.  The old zones were so hollow by comparison even on expansion day.  I quit 2 months later never to resub.  Vanilla-cata was my journey.  I'll resub for classic though.
---
That would be a fun throwback to the old times, not sure how likely it will happen though.
---
&gt;even do sunken temple
---
You make it sound like ST wasn't an absolutely awesome place to be.
---
Yes it's a fukkin labyrinth, but it's a glorious 5man!
---
probably because people assume it will be close to release date
---
So many hunters and Mage’s smugly stealing the tools as you fight 3 mobs
---
Why is the trap so visible?  I thought that was something that showed up later in the game?
---
&gt; and turtle the hell out of AV games by 75% blizzard slow. 
---
I don't even know you, but I alread hate you soooooo much :D
---
#ENJOY ALL THE EXTRA INCOME AND FREE TIME YOU WANT, BUDDY.
---
It might be. But it's just weird as a survey question, as to something more broad, "will you quit before launch?"
---
IIRC he did not even play original wow, and has only played it on private servers, despite giving the impression he has.
---
BiS for warriors (I think) for almost entirety of vanilla (also I think Naxx gloves are better but am not sure). It gives those weapon skill. Why is it so good? Maybe because you don't miss so much in raiding (??). Idk. Read but forgot. Am in train right now, don't have time to google unfortunately.
---
It is
---
&gt; as long as the requirements don't go up,
---
Why would they? It's the legion-version of the engine using the lowpoly models and low res textures from vanilla.
---
They are best in slot for fury warriors the entire game. The +skill is absolutely huge for glancing and missing
---
&gt;so just test bfa on your pc. trial version is free.
---
As said repeatedly, that is not an accurate test.
---
Classic will use the same engine, but the lowpoly models and lowres textures from Vanilla, meaning less load on the GFX chip, and less VideoRAM used.
---
Something like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#of0E00fZZVAG0oft0o) would be a pretty safe single-target leveling build for 1-40. Once you've got Ice Barrier, feel free to go into Arcane, but if you're new to Pre-TBC and want a smooth experience, make sure you grab Ice Barrier first. Feel free to swap out some points in frost for Improved Cone of Cold, Piercing Ice, Permafrost, or Winter's Chill depending on your playstyle while leveling.
---
Zone leveling ranges can be found [here.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/g00/Zones_by_level_\(original\)?i10c.ua=1&amp;i10c.encReferrer=&amp;i10c.dv=13) Zones will depend on your race and faction, but you will probably end up doing bits and pieces of nearly every zone to get some questing variety. As alliance, I like Dun Morogh / Elwynn into Westfall &gt; Loch &gt; Redridge &gt; Duskwood &gt; Desolace, but you have a TON of options. Each leveling range has about 3-5 zones available, and you should just pick your favorite.
---
I play but like couple of hours weekly. I just do a M+, do some normal raids (new ones) and maybe do a couple of levels on my low lvl toons. Don't have time to do anything (real life) and the game is not so fun anymore unfortunately. Just waiting for classic. When for example spmething new comes I just do the content in couple of hours just as its intended. Nothing special.
---
...the castbar of the warlock you just detected is at 0.7sec left and the Spelltext reads "Soulfire".
---
I remember playing when there were no incentives at all for world pvp or for raiding major cities. Didn't stop people from doing it anyway.
---
I think I'm going to try to have some semblance of a real life/balance this time, surely can't make the same mistake twice?
---
You saved money and gained xp so not entirely wasted
---
Let’s do it baby! Fuck bitches play Warcraft
---
Hey, sometimes greens are the best choices. I just did this for my druid last night. Target a few solid guaranteed drops and ride those to 60. In my case they were leather, but can still be really good. Most of my targetted gear is between 30 and 40 so that keeps me motivated to level while it's quick and I won't need to stop between 40 and 60 to find upgrades that have minimal benefits.
---
Its not about hit chance, weapon skill also negates the effects of glancing blows to a certain extent, which will improve your white damage significantly.
---
Give a mount to get a mount amirite
---
Do all the raids at least once (maybe pass on AQ and Naxx, not sure how hardcore I'll go).
---
Definitely reach at least rank 10 on my warrior as soon as the honor system is implemented.
---
Level an Alliance alt to 60 on a pure RP realm. I never experienced the Alliance side of the game in Vanilla so it would be a nice refresher to do it, especially with a class I don't play,  maybe a warlock or rogue.
---
Those goals are good  for the first year and a half  of Classic I think.
---
Same dilemma, considered it as leveling
---
Atari 2600 box art
---
It’s the same sub for both games, wouldn’t make any sense to delay the game that’s going to bring in the most subs for a patch that’s only going to bring back a fraction of what classic would bring in.
---
I feel you, fellow oldy!
---
Lucky 
---
My girl won't stop playing league of legends :(
---
^ This.
---
Dont worry! Hit me up during release! Im looking for a mate to play with
---
Hell yeah brother
---
Ya I put it as leveling too.
---
Always only wanted ashkandi or untamed blade for my warrior. Its probably the only reason I'll be in the raiding scene
---
Starvation was something of a fad diet in the 80s (or maybe the 70s I can't remember), but fell out of favour because, guess what, it was kind of dangerous. That 382 days man also had to eat yeast as a source of protein to keep his body from cannibalizing his muscles: https://coach.nine.com.au/2016/04/06/17/01/the-mystery-behind-the-207kg-scotsman-who-fasted-for-over-a-year
---
Thnx for explaining further. I never played a class sonmuch that weapon skill was important (mage and only wands but that levels itself).
---
Not to mention he has **JUST** below BiS for the hunter for this farm. I get that these grind/gold videos are just suggestions but this video in particular is extra useless at the start of WoW Classic because the kill times are going to be way longer since no one will have equipment close to BiS.
---
Maybe look at all the people on the eso sub calling themselves wow refugees. Both of the games are competition for wow my guy.
---
Haven't played since Cata, but my previous main was a feral Druid, with my main alt being a rogue. I loved the in-your-face, mechanical aspect of being a pure melee character.
---
That being said, I want to roll an orc warrior this time around, but everyone keeps warning about warrior being the hardest class to level, and that's there's issues with gold farming and scaling in early levels. What's the element of truth to this?
---
For further clarification I plan on doing mining/blacksmithing hardcore, so I can make my own gear (thus saving gold), as well as selling pieces on the side for extra cash. Advice? Thoughts?
---
Buff/debuff only establishes combat and doesn’t really generate threat does it? I feel like if a tank just got a glancing blow on an enemy and stopped attacking, a mage could never get aggro from that mob by just spamming arcane intellect until that warrior and anyone else that did any damage/healing was dead/wipes their threat
---
Feels bad man, mine won't play anything yet. Hope classic is the one!
---
What pisses me off most about this exact situation is that there can only be SO many boxes spawned at once in a zone, and when you leave the box THERE with one crap item, the box doesn't despawn, doesn't populate elsewhere, and doesn't refill itself after a set amount of time.
---
It's ridiculous that Blizzard never instituted the box despawning once anything green and above was looted after a few minutes.
---
Oh yeah it's one of my favorite 5mans! But it takes sooo long! I guess it's nothing compared to brd
---
if you don't want to bring different gear sets or have to respec and you still want to be able to effectively heal and dps, you are wanting a different game than classic
---
What is a good race/classe combination for leveling and pve, also ok to find raid spots, sincero people seem to say Hunter is quite bad at this
---
Nope, buffs generate threat, sometimes a lot of it.
---
This can go to a rogue, but only if you already have a tank with it.
---
Yea the hell you won't play.
---
I know opposing the mob mentality is asking for downvotes, but there’s no reason for sarcasm, we can have an adult conversation. Like it or not, if you choose to use hardware and platforms developed by other people you are risking your privacy. That’s not to say that you are giving them permission to spy on you, but I think there’s a lot that the law really doesn’t cover when it comes to information gathering, and why the GDPR laws in Europe are a really good step in the right direction for our privacy. Arguably for the first time ever, billion dollar companies can have their profits gutted by a few lawsuits about how they used and protected their customer’s data. 
---
None of this is about making any jobs easier. It’s about companies maximizing on data gathering potential to make money, which isn’t inherently a bad thing in such a competitive market landscape. I won’t comment on the potential selling of this data to other companies because frankly I don’t know enough about it, but I don’t see any definitive proof that blizzard is just wholesale giving customer data to 3rd parties. 
---
Lastly, there are currently some very strong regulations even in the US surrounding the protection (not retention or use, which the EU has begun to cover) of customer data. PCI (credit card information) data protection is a BFD to a company’s IT staff, because very smart, well-paid people will certainly lose their jobs and reputation if that information is stolen or leaked, not to mention the loss of face to customers and regulatory fines levied.
---
Because Rogues have a trap detection passive ;)
---
No I only make around 50k USD a year but that translates into 470,000 ish kronor and the tax brackets there are(taken from wiki regarding Sweden's taxation):
---
0% from 0 kronor to 18,800 kronor
---
Circa 32% (ca. 11% county and 20% municipality tax which is the Swedish average): from 18,800 kronor to 468,700 kronor
---
32% + 20%: from 468,700 kronor to 675,700 kronor
---
32% + 25%: above 675,700 kronor
---
So I would be in the second bracket at 32%+20% on a small amount.  Also this is their income tax so that leads me to believe that it's taxed on their income.  Also, correct me if I'm wrong but the value added tax that is taken out of what a customer pays is different than their social security tax which is just another flat tax (31.42%) onto a worker that an employer pays (also taken from the wiki) so your employer pays that but that money comes from somewhere and it is probably factored into what a person is paid from their employer because of economics.
---
I'm not arguing against Sweden's system on a fundamental level because I don't live there and I don't know how happy I would be under that system but I get taxed 28% after state taxes, pay about 1100 in healthcare a year with my free screening and I have a decent amount of expendable income which some goes to charity, family and personal things(mostly personal).  So the system is working for someone like me.
---
It was pretty good on rogue up until like AQ40/Naxx, then there were better items around, but the proc generated SO MUCH threat that the only time you could ever use it is if whoever was tanking for you had one.
---
It generated so much threat it was BiS for threat gen even at 70. Blizz ended up nerfing it just so people would use TBC weapons on tanks.
---
Affliction locks aren't meant for hardcore pve with the debuff limit, seeing as you'd need to fill a large amount of those slots to get your full dps output. Generally for classic destruction is the most recommended. As for the Druid, my main pve spec was Resto for my Druid and I loved it. Pretty straightforward, and great with innervate. And in a 40 man raid it won't matter if you don't have a basic resurrect (though that does become an issue in 5 man dungeons)
---
Lmao I know right!? Stupid gfs always thinking they are as deserving of attention as a game. Bitch probably doesn’t even know about Mankrik or where to find his wife. Cheeto crusted self-handies are just as good anyway
---
Your best bet is probably an ele/resto shaman hybrid or a druid, you'll still need separate gear though.
---
He has Detect Traps on
---
There are no dps gloves that drop in Naxx. Warrior BIS gloves are the ones from Cthun. Edgemasters come in as a very close 2nd. Non-orc/human might even have them as BIS.
---
Not that you’d ever sell it, but I wonder what it would fetch.
---
just dont read reddit or forums or mmo-cesspoolion, join a nice guild and you will be fine.
---
I will be but when im not afk i want to auto attack something and not have to chase it or worry about something new attacking me until i come back to it.
---
&gt; Blizzard... seriously what's going on here? Of all the ticket apps you choose the worst one with the most tracking?  
---
$$$$$$
---
Unpopular because it's untrue perhaps?
---
yeah but I played both a hunter and warlock last time :/ seems like the best route tho.
---
When there's a voice in your head telling you to quit your job and break up with your gf so you can feel like 12 again spending all your days in a computer game without a worry in the world
---
Correct, that's why battle shout is actually a good method to generate threat on a more than a manageable amount of mobs.
---
I think you jumped too deep into the rabbithole.
---
As I sad I am no expert. But I read edgemasters are like best or second best.
---
I played Dark Age of Camelot before I played WoW. The community there has gone through the same transistion. After 15 years of playing the game people figure out what the top 1-3 DPSers are the best classes for each role and once that has been defined then the elitists come along and try to force people out of the game who do not conform to their idea of how the game should be played. Dark Age of Camelot has over 13+ classes on each of the 3 sides but only 4-5 of them are "allowed" to be played by the elitists. If you try to play a class or spec that they don't agree with, get ready to be benched for raids, groups or anything really.
---
No it fucking isn’t!
---
I guess it will be available for those who don't have retail wow activated.
---
I just want to play with old and new friends, i dont really care what content it is on.  
---
 Im going to play my way, and im going to have fun doing it.
---
/cry
---
There is no auto loot add on.
---
Wait till the game drops, this sub will be empty.
---
&gt; These apps are a common thing at any given big tech conference
---
And?
---
My true endgame is to acquire Atiesh.
---
Im new to WOW in general not played it at all.
---
&gt; Like it or not, if you choose to use hardware and platforms developed by other people
---
If you want to go to BlizzCon, you don't have a choice
---
Yeah came here to say this
---
Have fun and make friends
---
Modern wow perhaps, I wouldn't know. But this community here compared to others? Hardly at all
---
They said they wouldn't be at e3
---
Make sure you let yourself process your emotions, dude.   
---
That typically doesn't happen when we escape into games.
---
Go be real fucking sad at least once, because damnit, break-ups and being cheated on sucks.
---
&gt; They don't. It's their job to not understand.
---
Their job is to make money. Selling your data makes money and it's easy to do.
---
I don't see it in the slightest. Like, not even a hint of Tim Burton imo
---
Holy shit that girl is hard to listen to. Like all the energy in her soul has been sucked out, and what's left is a husk with a pretty face.
---
Everything has been done a dozen times in this sub broseph.
---
I'll play both
---
If you think this is toxic then don't even glance in the direction of Overwatch.
---
It never worked in actual vanilla. It's just a private server bug/'feature'.
---
After SC Ghost/Titan, they made it policy to not announce release date/ game creations until it was guaranteed. This led to the missing Diablo 4 announcement. They will not announce the release until it's 100% guaranteed to drop and just unlock for players to consume.
---
Anyway, why don't you offer to run the classic Guild?
---
Dunno why you're getting downvoted. That jaw could bust diamonds. 
---
Kriston Holt on the other hand is/was/is? is a goddess.
---
&gt;The dude who will be running a bizarre offtank rogue build as his first character when the game launches
---
Ohh I see why you think the community sucks LOL
---
Good luck with your weird spec, just don't expect any half-serious raiding guilds to take you seriously.
---
I think that, sadly, the great years of RTS games is over. WC 4 would be awesome though.
---
Honestly this one of the least toxic communities. It's pretty chill here.
---
Fresh guild on fresh server. Level together. Gear up together. First raid in molten core. Me and another tank are alternating MT role since we both want it and always show up.
---
First binding drops. We roll I win. A few weeks later the same binding drops and he gets it by default. 
---
A few weeks after that the 2nd binding drops. We roll he wins. Next week he transfers servers to join a different guild bringing a few other core players with him essentially destroying the guild.I rage quit the server. 
---
Ended up coming back later and joining a guild /group of players I'm still friends with today.
---
I'm still bitter about the binding. And I still have the first half in my bags.
---
Why would you do it like that? Name a successful product that was released without any hype build up to its release? Most sales are in the early stages of the product.
---
Was he hot?
---
Form my guild, grow it out to do RP, PvE and PvP. Looking forward to combining RP and playing the game.
---
They've already said there will be sharding in the starting zones in WoW Classic.
---
I stopped playing pservers the day Blizzard announced Legacy servers.
---
even in 2005 people loled at boomkins and retadins. thats not new.
---
&gt; Let me save everyone some time even though no one is required to watch this free content that can easily be skipped over if you're not interested in it.
---
Thanks man, really valuable input.
---
Nope because they know how much money this is going to make them. I’m sure they want to get it out as badly as we want it.
---
You might be on to something.
---
Yes of course it's a national effort and if your nation is so huge that it becomes impractical to micromanage then consequences like shit internet will emerge. Among with health care. Gun laws. Basically any national regulation is trash in USA.
---
I mean the comment above made it seem like he didnt want sex she tried to coerce him but then they didnt. If she really is he pressuring daily despite knowing he doesnt then he needs to leave the situation but if its just like "Hey lets have sex" "nah im tired" "Okay but if you do..." Then I think its probably an okay situation. As long as she respects the boundaries he places explicitly.
---
Cool. I must have missed that. I’ll delete the post
---
800mhz and 256mb ram :)
---
Been there bud.
---
Nothing of value was lost, trust me.
---
Played through all of vanilla as enhance mostly.
---
Windfury still hits like it should,  just get better gear. 
---
The truth is shocks are the best constant damage for enhance, but combined with windfury it has a deadly burst potential. 
---
Windfury isn't there to let you win with auto attack.... it's there to save you when you should have died
---
That's just kind of the whole internet, really.
---
Around lvl 40 all the shadow talents really add up. It's definitely faster than holy levelling, probably around 20% faster kill speed. Getting an easy 6% hit to all your spells is super powerful for a caster. The base 15% attack and 15% less damage is very good as well.  
---
Of course you *can* level as holy *fine*, but it is much slower. It would be like playing a hunter with a pet without claw/bite, or as a warlock going soul link and using a fel puppy for levelling. If you're aim is to quickly to level to 60 with an efficient build it's a bad idea.
---
Starrrveeeee till classic  
---
Doot dooot dooo  
---
Starrrrve TILlllllll Classssssickkkk  
---
Do do doooo  
---
Beep bop bam  
---
This man is dead fammmm  
---
Boopp beeepp bammmmm
---
Well, I came to this sub a week ago and noticed a certain handful of topics will downvote you but generally everyone is very nice and helpful. 
---
The general consensus is: most everyone knows what game flaws exist in 1.12.1 There's no need to really talk about how to fix them or suggest anything. Blizzard knows, and they know we know. That's why they're making a classic server... we're okay with it.
---
Oh yeah, that's a great option. Each race begins in their own zone, and Dun Morogh is the starting zone for Gnomes and Dwarves. Each starting zone leads to another zone for that race. For Gnomes and Dwarves, it's Dun Morogh into Loch Modan, and for Humans, it's Elwynn Forest to Westfall. The switch happens around level 10. I would say finish all (or most of) the quests in Dun Morogh and the  try out Loch Modan. If you're unhappy with the zone you're in, go ahead and try out the other race's zones. To get to Elwynn &amp; Westfall from Dun Morogh, walk to Ironforge, the Dwarf capitol city, and take the Deeprun Tram to Stormwind. Once you enter the city, talk to a guard, and he'll mark the tram entrance's location on your map.
---
Hunter, warlocks are extremely good for lvling. But raidspots will always be harder to get if you play a dps.
---
Poorly. Kids have been raised on games, PC console and cell phone, that encourage more rewards, smaller rewards, given more quickly in order to keep player attention.
---
I'll admit it can be difficult for an older MMO player who played in vanilla and then gradually had their effort to reward thought process altered by the progression of MMO's in the last 15 years, it can be difficult for them to then return to vanilla and find Value in that effort to reward scenario, but it's easier to relearn something then it is to learn something completely new that goes against what you already know.
---
I feel like it's the complete opposite. Retail WoW right now is a thousand times worse.
---
Yep. That does suck, but it's their event. They've chosen to clamp down on illegal entry and use apps to better understand their customers over making it easier to attend for the very small subset of the population that doesn't have a phone. Maybe the logic behind it is that if you are technologically modern enough to have a computer and play games, you likely also have a phone. After all, they're market segment isn't the off-grid type :)
---
Either way, it's their party, so they can invite who and how they want.
---
If they expected delays they wouldn't be constantly saying Summer, they'd be far more reluctant.
---
Down some world bosses and get some loot.
---
the questing is comfy af wtf bro
---
If by the same you mean edgy 14 year olds spamming the n-word then yeah it's still the same.
---
&gt; No one will ever take them to raids
---
Will you take the to raids?
---
What's stopping you and all the other people who want to play odd specs from forming your own guild?
---
Why should other have to accommodate your whims?
---
Drink lots of water and set up various break periods (crafting/waiting for groups/fp/etc) to do some pushups, planks, and grab a 12 inch step platform. Do a minute or two of stepping every break until you can bust out burpeees. That gives you core, cardio, upper body/back and lower body/legs with minimal effort and expense. This is my plan to get ready for this summer/fall.
---
The thing about barrens chat in 2019 is it will be so inauthentic. People will be trying to recreate it purposefully, and it will end up even spammier than it was. Also some level of cringe because of how forced it will be. Chuck Norris facts were THE meme back then, for an eternity compared to the memes that are lucky to last a month nowadays. But it’s a meme that has been dead and buried for a solid decade...it will remain dead outside of wow (I mean, slight resurgence probably irl rippling out of classic but not mainstream again) and that makes it forced in-game. I would also say trolls are much more numerous on today’s internet, and especially with the rise of political trolling it may very well be an utter shitshow if there isn’t good GM moderation. Just my two cents though, hopefully it can turn out to be innocently stupid and charming like yesteryear.
---
Yeah it was always annoying, there have always been valid points for legacy servers, but instead of having a conversation just LUL CTRL V
---
This is why referring to a fanbase or a fandom in general as toxic will inevitably poison your own experience. Because you are responsible for crafting your experience of a thing, it's up to you to block people or ignore people and crafts the view of the fandom you want to see.
---
I hardly think the brackets are that rigid, they aren't here in Norway atleast. I think wikipedia has simplified it greatly. I think you will have to make closer to 675,700 kroner to reach the level of 52% income tax.
---
The hour prices on workers like electrician for examples is insane, as I as a customer pays for the employer tax. Atleast it's this way in Norway, and I imagine it being pretty similar in Sweden.
---
Yeah, I just wanted to clearify that if you have to pay effectively 60% taxes of your income you would have to make alot of money.
---
Both of their actions may have led them to her being unhappy, but his actions did NOT lead her to cheating. That was her decision and hers alone. If she was unhappy, she should have communicated that, not gone behind his back.
---
If there were more then they would not be worth doing, or every warrior would be walking around with the same gear.
---
“Ow my gawd you guys talk trash when I tell you I want to raid as a fist fighting mage #toxic #retailisbetter #changes” it’s like there should be a way for you to not read reddit posts, and it’s almost as if you could press a single button and never have to look at comments to your shitposts. Hmmmmmmm?
---
Not on the minimap though, its just a yellow dot otherwise. I think that was the point trying to be made.
---
damn babe, how bad did I hurt you earlier that you're replying with this stupid nonsense. you clearly got some mental issues Stan, I highly recommend you to kys, I heard it solves every problem
---
also why you keep saying "u got no skillz lol xD" are you projecting, peter?
---
and let's not forget that you're the same retard who wrote this " If spamming shadow bolt is more complex than spamming frostbolt, yeah lock is more complicated" mr posting history sherlock andy
---
This is common when there's PVP in a game, it attracts jerks like flies...
---
PVE only games usually have much tamer communities (emphasis on usually, I guess someone is going to find a counter example).
---
PHYSICAL:
---
Strength:
---
Gives 1 melee AP for rogues, and 2 for warriors.
---
Agility: Gives crit chance(the amount depends on class. Warriors get a bit more than rogue, and hunter gets less than half of what rogue and warrior gets), 1 AP for rogues, and 2 RAP for hunters.
---
The exact amount of agility for 1 crit, is about 20 for warrior, 25for rogue and 55 for hunter. I'm not sure about the details but this is roughly it.
---
People generally value things in terms of AP. Generally for warriors 1agi = 1ap, 20ap = 1crit, for rogues 1agi = 2ap.
---
Hit is hard to value. 9% is the cap for yellow hits(abilities), and after that it's about the value of a crit. 
---
Weaponskill is very difficult to give rough value to. Weaponskill gives hit in the sense that the hit cap is lowered, which is the same thing really. But it also reduces how punishing glancing blows are, but that's only for melee. So hunters don't value weaponskill that highly, especially because they get hit very easily and their hitcap is 9%.
---
Glancing blows works that white attacks have a 40% chance to glance doing less damage and also not being possible to crit. So by getting more weaponskill you do more damage on glancing blows. Glancing blows also mean that there's a cap to your crit chance on white attacks. This cap depends on your hit and weaponskill but it's around 40% crit. This is actually fairly obtainable as a melee dps with worldbuffs,so it's something to look out for. The reason the cap exist is because of how attack RNG is rolled, but with white crit cap, all your non glancing blows will crit.
---
Casters are a fair bit simplier, at least when you don't consider resistance.
---
Int is very weak, you need 60 int to get a crit chance at 60, so most of the time int is just a stat to mean you have mana, so enough to last the fight but more than that kinda blows.
---
Spellpower scales a bit odd, the amount of extra damage you get depends on how long the casttime of your ability is before talents, and whether it's AoE or give debuffs. 
---
Spellpower is the best stat for sure. For crit, it's valued at 8-12 spellpower(this also means that you need about 6 int for 1 SP in terms of DPS without considering mana) depending on spec and gear level. Hit on spells is hard to get before ZG, the cap for casters is 16% hit and there's an extra 1% miss chance that you can never get rid off because fuck casters. Resistance can make some differences but in raids it should be zero due to warlock curses. Hope that explains.
---
Realistic goal: Benediction.
---
Unrealistic stretch goal if they keep level 60 as the level cap forever: Atiesh
---
Hunters fall off late end game in PvE in terms of damage. Warlocks are excellent throughout and they are the best PvP class. You're right about these two being the best leveling classes though.
---
Not sure if this is a meta shitpost or youre actually serious. Because offtank rogue implies youll be tanking in raids? and nobody, literally nobody will take a rogue as an "offtank", whatever that means. Im going with shitpost and I award you a 10/10
---
Nah, Vermintide community was much worse last year. It got so bad the PR person for Fatshark stopped posting.
---
What is this? A world of warcraft cooking book? Where can I find this?
---
You're not wrong man.
---
A player will say they want to make a Night Elf Priest and then get slammed with "good luck finding a guild lol," "you think it's fun to be an asshole and make your raid have to carry you and pull your dead weight?," "Dwarf Priest or you're a waste of space."  Then this thread is followed by min/maxers are under attack, look around you sheeple!!
---
I was a knowledgeable player before I showed up here so I had a sense of humor about the whole thing.  Putting myself in the shoes of a new player or post vanilla player coming here for legitimate advice is agreeably super toxic.
---
Most on here almost seem like they're trying to suck the fun out of everything.  Can't tell them though, because they are dripping with hypocrisy and will say "we just have fun differently than you" so you're the asshole for saying anything about it.  When in reality there's nothing fun about telling a guy who wants to know cool places to get meat for cooking while leveling that he's wasting his time and should power grind it at 60 in 4-6 hours.  Clearly that's not helpful and doesn't answer the question.
---
Just say it's haste if you are ally and str if you are horde because of windfury clipping auto attacks and you'll be golden LOL
---
You couldn't raid Onyxia with today's generation of wow players.
---
Frankly druid time to kill isn't impressive.
---
It's not even a matter of national regulation. California alone is about the size of Sweden but has 4 times the population. The vast majority of Sweden's population is in the southern half and the coast, while California only has a few areas as sparsely populated as Sweden's northern half. It is a lot more difficult to wire up the entire state of California than just the southern 1/3 of Sweden.
---
Yep, the competitor is gauntlets of annihilation.
---
Druid for sure.
---
That was to show that this isn't a sudden or odd thing for a technology conference. People seem to be getting angry at something that is pretty standard for an event that any sizable company puts on. 
---
It's understandable if you get mad every time that any company asks for your information, but it seems like people are getting up in arms about big bad Blizzard doing this when in reality every other company that they've interacted with likely has the same or more information. 
---
PSA: If you're worried about personal privacy, you probably shouldn't play WoW. Not only will they have your name, number, address, credit card information, etc. They will also have your IP address, your daily schedule (He plays 4 hours each week day from 6-10 PM), your work/phone location (if you ever log in to your account or blizzard site from work or on mobile), your password (hope you don't use it for any other sites with the same email!), and any URL that you are coming from or going to from a blizzard site.
---
I want to theorycraft ret so hard to the point where I can do more than passable dps. I think it can be done, but Im stealing all of the caster loot in 5 mans
---
To further that, more white damage means more rage. More rage means more yellow damage. More yellow strikes usually means more Crits which keeps flurry up longer which means more white damage...etc. this is why warriors scale so well with gear - it's somewhat circular.
---
Individual mob kill speed can certainly be greater with shadow. But overall leveling speed also incorporates stopping to drink. If you want to keep that to a minimum, you'll be wanding a lot so you can regen mana. With that, you won't see as big a difference with shadow.
---
This sub knows no humor, only salt.
---
Will of the Forsaken was the best racial in the game in terms of PvP hands down. 5 seconds immunity to charm, sleep, fear as well as breaking those on use on a 2 minute cooldown is what made undead rogues better than all other rogues.
---
Wish all classes had an epic quest like Hunter/Priest.
---
Thanks for the help.
---
Yep. SC2 was the last gasp of the RTS genre, and even that has its flaws (the story was a bit of a disaster).
---
Makes sense.
---
Watching a rogue stealth in and grab it as I’m fighting, after I waited five minutes for the spawn 
---
I wanted to create a horde and gank them just because of that moment.
---
Will of the Forsaken was the best racial in game for PvP back in Vanilla.
---
It's comparable to brd.
---
It's pretty crazy long and convoluted.  
---
I think BRD, ST, and LBRS were all great and extremely long.
---
It's hard to tell what kind of community will form on release. As a casual semi-rp / pvp player, I like my communities to be tight knit. But here we are, on a reddit forum, waiting for the next piece of meat to chew on while we wait. This pre-gaming process isn't much of a stable community. It's our short term fix to what will proceed.
---
On that note, I believe that CLASSIC will create the basis for a great community due to the nature of the game. Right now, you have a community based on speculation and possibly a bit of distrust. So yeah, it's not completely pleasant.  Also, pre-gaming attracts obsessives.
---
At the end, it's all about the game and I would argue that the community is going to be crazy tight.  We are getting a very specific product, a world that we already know and because of this, there's going to be a sense of loyalty. Like a small town that doesn't change much, it will require a community to 'be' the change. On top of this the economics, particularly gold mattering again, will create a meaningful market. That market will create specialty niches, and thus community.
---
I know it looks like crap right now, but I think you may be jumping the gun on how powerful a system can change that. Free form ideas don't lead to community. Reliance does.
---
Selfawarness nonexistent.
---
Participate in a 40 Paladin Naxx raid. Then I'll have beaten the game!
---
To me, the design decisions that made vanilla great are not necessarily intuitive, but nonetheless created an emerging gameplay that is wholly unique. I imagine many share this view and therefore worry about what the impact would be if we start pulling too many threads that made the whole.
---
As to the community, I have had the opposite experience. For one, compared to other games the Classic reddit is a hippie commune. The advise given may not be what many would have hoped for, but that may make it even more valuable? At least many will meet the came with more realistic expectations.
---
Nah you just don’t know what having a discussion is. Probably should look up the definition of salt for future reference.
---
Some grizzly bear hearts 😩🤤
---
&gt;  Like it or not, if you choose to use hardware and platforms developed by other people you are risking your privacy.
---
The fact that there are some risks that are less avoidable is no reason to simply give up entirely on the whole concept of privacy.
---
&gt; None of this is about making any jobs easier. It’s about companies maximizing on data gathering potential to make money
---
You're right, it is even _less_ defensible than making anyone's job easier, it is about maximizing corporations' profits at our expense.
---
&gt; I don’t see any definitive proof that blizzard is just wholesale giving customer data to 3rd parties.
---
Oh, they won't be _giving_ it to anyone, they'll be _selling_ it. There is a hundreds-of-billions-of-dollars industry based entirely on monetizing personal data. I have no idea why you would consider "absolute proof" to be the bar for believing that a company would do a thing that would make them money.
---
&gt; very smart, well-paid people will certainly lose their jobs and reputation if that information is stolen or leaked
---
Stolen or leaked, sure. But intentionally sold? Not in the slightest.
---
Username checks out.  But, your comment seems to suggest that you fundamentally don't understand the purpose of this sub.
---
It’s in their interest to release Vanilla as soon as it’s ready. People are getting bored, the hype train is slowing down. You wonder why blue posts come out in dribs and drabs? To keep people interested so they can buy time to make it. 
---
It is not greedy but stupid to fail to hit their “Summer” release, I just think it will be late Aug/Sept.
---
Sure i’ll Take that bet. Let’s make this happen.

Priest is great in a duo if your partner leaves you the killing blows. If it's a warrior that just *HAS* to execute everything, you'll basically become a heal/wand bot because you won't ever have mana left for dps. If you go shadow dps and stack spirit and he gives you all the killing blows you will kill things fast enough (at least 1 per 15secs) that you will always be in spirit tap and will be able to keep up high dps constantly, and VE should be enough to keep your warrior up for 4-5 minute stretches, but of course you can drop and throw a few heals if you do a big pull or whatever.   
---
The healbot style of just letting the warrior round up things and cleave them while down while priest heals/wands and throws a couple of SW:P is going to be slower but can be fun from the healer/dps class fantasy perspective. If you're doing this the warrior should always try to keep a good blue wep to use, make a plan for dungeons to hit while levelling to make that happen.  
---
      
---
Regarding spells to skip, on a priest around lvl 34 when things get a bit more expensive I stop all healing spells except Flash Heal. It can get you through every 15-45 dungeon healing if you need to. Usually around 50 when you have mount and a bit more gold i pickup the other healing spells to help out with the higher level dungeons where efficiency becomes more important. If you're levelling shadow the last rank of smite / holy fire i get is lvl 30. Usually just get 1 rank mind control/shackle. Cure disease is fine, don't need abolish for anything. Mana burn is really a pvp spell, and probably not often useful in &lt; 60 pvp anyway. 1 rank of resurrection is fine.
---
i didnt read it, did he want to play ret?
---
I played in Vanilla but only got my first lvl 60 (rogue) a few days before TBC launched. I got to raiding and other endgame content at lvl 70, so I'd like to experience Classic raid scene.
---
I'm not planning on pushing very hardcore, so perhaps not as far as Naxx. But who knows, maybe I'll reach it at some point if TBC legacy servers wont come in a long time (if at all).
---
Meanwhile I'll enjoy the leveling, running dungeons and in the end hope to get into a decent EU raiding guild that accepts ppl who identify as a summoning stone.
---
participate in naxx.
---
did up to nef in vanilla and done up to aq40 on pserver.
---
Death and Taxes had a Ret Paladin.  No one loled at Death and Taxes.
---
If I remember correctly it was Horde only at the start of Vanilla and was changed some time before Patch 1.12 - so that both Alliance and Horde could get the buffs. 
---
Seeing how Blizzard has so far chosen to base all decisions regarding the games balance on the Patch 1.12 version of the game, I'd wager that the answer to your question is *probably*: Yes.
---
Unfortunately, even that isn't sufficient.
---
Given that the top of the list of things this application scrapes and steals is contact information, anyone who does choose to go is also imposing this invasion of privacy on everyone they know.
---
Druids were great in PvP but when it came to PvE, they were considered jack of all trades and master of none. Warlocks were solid all around.
---
You're full of shit.
---
it literally could be explained in an image.
---
You are just whoring out for views here.
---
You don't go meditation in spriest pvp spec. You have no spirit so it gives terrible benefit. Getting a *free* 200 mana during a minute long fight is not worth spending 3 talent points.

i played on a wow vanilla server a while ago just to see if it was still fun after all that time. it was, It's not even accurate but it's still fun
---
I giggled
---
To get so lost in the game I forget who I am. I want to lose my job, my friends, and my family. I want to live in Azeroth because there is only Azeroth
---
That and in true vanilla Blizzard spirit Alliance is the favorite so Horde are definitely not allowed to have something that Alliance can't have.  :D
---
There will be plenty of guild recruitment spam, complaining, and more, I'm sure.
---
Tank rogue. Not kidding
---
No hate on Tipsout. But you should always doubt him saying technical stuff like this. He just isn’t that good at the game and/or that knowledgeable.
---
And having AOE loot would just be nice. 
---
Not gamebreaking, nor would it impact gameplay. 
---
Not at all looking forward to trying to target that one mob under the other 5.
---
I'm still holding out hope for age of empires 4. It better be good

Isn't thunderfury bis off-hand for sword rogues untill Naxx?

Giving up your rights? It's an app on your phone gathering information, most likely on what you as a customer are likely to spend money on, so they can manipulate you to buy even more things, if that is your "rights" I feel sorry for you.
---
LotRO had (and probably still has) a great community, possibly because of what you stated. The PvE element is so much stronger than PvP there (Monster Play or how it was called).
---
&gt; Hope you don't have; The Reddit app, Twitter, Instagram, Discord, Snapchat
---
Then I guess you can rest easy, because I don't.
---
Happy to help you out.
---
sadly this is the reality
---
Thank you for proving his point
---
Actually deep....
---
I am super excited about classic, but I do think they should have a plan in place to do progression beyond vanilla if classic doesn’t flop (and I optimistically think it will far exceed their expectations.) 
---
Vanilla progression is the right choice of course, but if it’s going to stagnate after naxx then there is only so much time before lots of people get bored. I think most casual players (most players) still won’t do more than MC/Ony/ZG maybe AQ20 and a few pulls of BWL, so their progression path is already coming to a halt early. 
---
Leveling is a WAAAAY more intensive process without heirlooms and speed running dungeons that have been shortened, so fewer people will put forth the effort to make alts other than maybe twinks.
---
Progressing at least to BC, probably wrath, possibly beyond has to be in the plans for real longevity on the project, but I think it will be more lucrative than they imagine if just done right. That or making a diverging story and make alternate expansions that keep more to the old design philosophy, that would be awesome but they never will. Easy enough to even make it cannon with time travel altering the events of the world.
---
Every game sub on reddit is full of toxicity. Welcome to the internet
---
You are comparing /r/classicwow to the retail GAME. you should compare /r/classicwow to /r/wow though. /r/wow is far from as toxic as this sub.
---
Retail wow or /r/wow?
---
As a PC FPS player my heart goes out to Oce players. Every new game I play I get discouraged when they take a game mode away from us, then I learn Oce has been forced to play 3pp quad queues only for months.

Blizzard
---
&gt; The fact that there are some risks that are less avoidable is no reason to simply give up entirely on the whole concept of privacy. 
---
Definitely true!
---
&gt; You're right, it is even *less* defensible than making anyone's job easier, it is about maximizing corporations' profits at our expense. 
---
I wouldn't agree. Corporations aren't here to protect you or be a "good guy", they are here to give you something you want in return for your money. It's a business. They do what they do to make money, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that as long as they are within their legal boundary. I feel grateful and partial to certain companies because of the product they produce, but they don't owe me anything outside of our transaction. I'd think most people who work in the corporate sales world would definitely agree it's about maximizing profits. I want to maximize my company's profits because if they go under, I stop getting the money I need to support myself and others. 
---
&gt;  they won't be *giving* it to anyone, they'll be *selling* it. 
---
I wasn't clear here, but I meant selling as well, yes.
---
&gt;  I have no idea why you would consider "absolute proof" to be the bar for believing that a company would do a thing that would make them money. 
---
I'm not sure "absolute proof" is easy to come by, and that's not what I expect. I haven't seen any evidence at all that Blizzard is selling our data. Internet people can claim that, but without evidence their claim is baseless. Blizzard's goal is to maximize profits. If they can sell our data legally, fine. More power to them. The problem would not be with them, but rather the laws governing them. Now, if Blizzard is selling data illegally, that would be grounds for very serious lawsuits and reputation damage, to the point that the company could go bankrupt. The people on the inside who make these decisions have families and careers that they care about. If you are in the c-suite of a company that goes under due to fraud, and you somehow aren't involved personally in the legal implications, then say goodbye to your 6-7 figure salary, because people aren't going to hire you after that.
---
Most people will probably quit retail simply because they don't have time for both versions of the game, since Classic will be very time consuming.
---
I recently got back into WoW, but find myself not enjoying it too much, even though the quests nowadays are so much better than they used to be.
---
Instead of collecting 30 of X or Killing 25 of Y, I actually feel like I'm an important part of the story.
---
Still, it does not feel very satisfying to level my mage and demon hunter and that's why I'm going to quit retail and play Classic instead.
---
The other respondent was clearly an asshole, but unfortunately the answer is that deleting the application afterward doesn't solve the problem.
---
By the time you install and run the application once, it can already harvest and upload a ton of information that is currently on your phone. At that point the alpaca is out of the barn, and uninstalling the application won't unpublish all that data.
---
The only thing uninstalling afterward would accomplish is not allowing them to track you walking around the con itself, or see any new data that you add after its installation. Which may be marginally better than nothing, but doesn't address the biggest parts of the problem.
---
Well the classic wow community is full of fakes, yes this is one of the most toxic communities. How can I prove this? Before classic wow was announced and even when before nostalrius got shut down, no damn youtuber, streamer, etc gave a f@ck about vanilla wow. Everyone claimed TBC and WOTLK to be the best xpacs of all time. Nostalrius gets shut down then classic wow get announced. Since 2017's announcement everyone is for some reason claiming "vanilla wow" to be the prime and favorite time in wow's history. They watch and d!ck ride these content creators opinions and call out everyone else who has a different opinion. I have literally since 2006 only met 2 people who said they prefer vanilla over every other xpac. Fast forward to 2019, supposedly vanilla is everyone's fav and if its not yours, your wrong. YES, I am excited for classic and running my own guild, but I would rather die than to lie and say vanilla was the best of all xpacs. Asmongold claimed he played vanilla, keep in mind he played the very last month of vanilla. Sodapoppin is excited for vanilla, it 100% is not his favorite xpac, its just another experience he is excited to play in. Esfand literally started playing private servers 1 1/2 years ago and had no clue what in the hell he was doing or talking about, now people act like he is the founder of vanilla. Staysafe is another fake vanilla follower who only played private servers and lies about him actually playing vanilla, people still follow him and act like his self entitled opinions are the truth. Tips out, jesus you dont want me to get into this guy, popped out of nowhere opening his big clueless mouth reading blizzard articles on youtube and has been proven that he had no clue what he was talking about in many cases. Overall this community is filled with fakes and fan boys who are just purely ignorant. I promise you probably 98% of the members of this reddit never played actual vanilla, I am just tired of all these liars tbh.
---
Monster Hunter World and Rimworld reddits are seriously full of some of the most awesome, kind, and understanding people.  You're not wrong about people not being able to control themselves when competition is involved.
---
Ok, every girl you ever date that is attractive is going to cheat on you eventually. It's human nature when you're having new penis thrown at you on a daily basis. Long term relationships are pointless unless you're attracted to generally unattractive women. So if you can't see yourself being with what most would consider a "hog", just stick to short term experiences. Trust me. It'll make your life a whole lot easier. ;)
---
I will tell about the kid I know instead of making generalizations.  He likes BR games, Destiny1/2, The Division 1/2,  and shooters in general. He also likes D&amp;D, collecting everything in a game, playing with his friends for hours online and chess. His friends are like him for the most part. He is looking forward to classic. Not so much for the story as I described it or the graphics, but for the fact he gets to explore something huge. He gets to find all these cool looking places and spend hours with his friends doing stupid stuff. He gets to pvp and collect all the armor sets through pve and pvp. He is also only 11.
---
There are plenty of kids like him out there. They are just like us when we were younger. It is just they haven't had the chance to experience the type of games like we had growing up. I think a game based upon Vanilla/Classic WoW philosophy would do fine with today's younger generations. We just have to show them its possible to have a game like that developed today.
---
I assume when talking about levelling speed people are using the right rotation for their level/spec.  
---
I've done a fair bit of testing over the last week trying out different classes at lvl 45.  
---
Shadow grinding is a similar speed over 10 minutes (ie. sustained grinding pace) as affliction lock and hunter.    
---
Holy grinding is a similar speed to warrior and rogue.
---
Also the fact that it's Trade Chat and a screencap of someone in Orgrimmar.
---
My first character was a Tauren hunter in vanilla...(bouncy Tauren kiting was awesome!) Just be good and people won’t care. But if you’re spec’d incorrectly for something then don’t do it, go do what you’re spec’d for. 
---
And for the people who you think are toxic, wait until the game drops and watch them sit in trade chat getting ignored. 
---
P.S. I paid for a race change to a troll for my hunter when that service came out.. 😎
---
Rogue tank, lmao.
---
Make one toon and stick to it.
---
Cannibalize won't do anything when your in the middle of a pvp fight. And if your against another Rogue or Warrior which is really common classes. You are going to have a difficult time. But doesn't mean Will of the Forsaken is not as good as Hardiness. It just depends what do you want in general.
---
Seen em go for 5, let's hope not for the warriors sake
---
True.
---
Too ez so we need changes.
---
Thank you. It's unfortunate we do not have a definite yes/no answer on the matter but we can assume for the time being that they will be available for both factions at launch.
---
Totally incapable of finding the hostility too, please help.  OP should be groveling to his reddit saviors for this game even blessing his insignificant life, to you he owes his thanks and first born child.
---
I mean you don’t enjoy those breakfasts?
---
The vast majority of us here just want to play WoW Classic. Of course it's irritating with people coming here wanting dual spec, changes in class balance and what not. It's the crazy mentality of today wanting to have the cake and it too.  
---
If they don't want to play the game, it's totally fine! Retail is out there and they can have it even on this very day. But WoW Classic is not to be messed with.
---
So the winner will be a 5-man mage multiboxer? 
---
Or it would end in two stealthed rogues doing a dance of death until one died from the blue zone.
---
Post full of 30 year old dads complaining about new generation LOL
---
Yes if there's good MMO's there will be interest. It is harder though for MMO's to strive not so much because of culture, but because of new game genres just being way better for current tech. I mean no wonder slow pace games with (comparably) good graphics worked well in earlier days with poor internet and PC's. Nowadays you can have amazing looking shooters with high FPS and flawless internet connection, it's not really that surprisingly that those kind of games are successful. Back in wow days you had CS1.6, game that I loved but looked like shit and people did have poor FPS and ms on it too.
---
you had one job
---
With my obsession of game of thrones, I hope that is exactly what you mean.
---
Ahhh God stfu
---
I never ever played wow, so I don’t see. Care to explain? Is he a Melvin ?
---
This is wrong and dumb
---
I read somewhere that TF only loses to Iblis and Hungering so it'd survive through AQ too.
---
To be honest this never really annoys me as a healer and I don’t understand why healers get mad at this. 
---
The only way I can imagine this negatively affects the healer is if they get blamed for the failure of dps.  But this is all a matter of perception.  In case of a wipe, I just tell them get good and most people are aware when they fail shit so they don’t say much (but I usually play at least with a friend or two If not more people I know, so my views are not that objective in a full pug).  Other times I just link the Death meter or if they died to a mechanic which does a lot of damage over long duration, I link damage taken by (avoidable) ability and that’s the end of it. 
---
If it’s not a wipe, then it’s a good challenge and I enjoy seeing insane amounts of hps on the charts due to team failing.  
---
The addon Elitism Helper is also a decent one which directly shows you avoidable damage (although doesnt pick up on every ability), you can have it show for yourself or announce it on party, I prefer to show it for myself, it’s a good assurance to see that it wasn’t your fault someone died when you see the rogue tanked 350k of avoidable damage.
---
Dude I remember hearing nothing but the wall of no for so many years .. this community is awesome now
---
Is that you, Macho Man Randy Savage?!
---
Right now the community is doing its part explaining that there is just some spec/combinations that doesn't work well, especially not in vanilla as everything wasn't that well balanced, and since wow is a team game, people will be less interested in inviting players playing really poor things especially for 40 man content. OP wants to play something that's absurdly bad and from seeing these posts instead of concluding that he maybe should play something that's not awful, he thinks the community is awful.

Gear up a rogue and just be a PITA to the  oppositefaction in world pvp. I didn't raid back then so im looking forward t doing that this time around as well
---
So if we reversed the roles and instead of cheating he started beating her you would say they both caused that? I get that creating a toxic relationship is a 2 way street that requires consent, I agree. But the individual actions are always the responsibility of the person. To be fair if he literally ignored her for that long I wouldn't even call it immoral cheating, but the proper thing would be to break up first. I think we are confusing motivating factors with responsibility, also he was probably not that serious.
---
YET
---
Yeehaw?
---
So I was in-game friends with this guy:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK6urhdGCMo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK6urhdGCMo) 
---
Mentioned because he was an inspiration. I would say that I performed very well as a paladin in battle grounds and in world PvP. It has been a very long very long time since I have even played WoW. I stopped around 2008. Came back for a fat minute and was bored out of my mind. (It got too big and too accessible.)
---
Hence my return to Classic... and my take on picking a class... First, yes stats &amp; abilities matter, but more than anything strategy. Pick a class that gets your blood flowing! My favorite are melee classes due to the in your face nature. I had a hunter which completely slayed at PvP, but it just wasn't as fun as the Paladin or Warrior do to the distance between targets. 
---
I HAVE been very much considering which class to play next and have had trouble deciding between Warrior, Paladin &amp; Rogue. Paladin is kind of attractive because it's the bastard class which gives you a sense of being unique. At least I think so. But man, warrior plus engineering... very very (explosive) tempting.  
---
So yeah, I am hung up on utility. I won't be raiding because I run a business and am busy af. But we'll see how it goes. Mainly, what class will give me that rush I crave in a short window.
---
All classes to 60 before TBC is announced.
---
Druids (in any form) gain 2 AP off Strength, Hunters get 1 melee AP off strength. As side note, Warriors and Rogues also get 2 ranged AP off Agi.
---
&gt;Single target DPSing as a warlock is not too complex in Classic. If your raid allows you to have a Corruption slot, you simply apply Corruption and keep it up *while Shadow Bolting.*

You've been blinded by a vocal minority here. The ones who yell the loudest are the most visible. But in reality it's pretty much opposite compared to many other gaming subreddits.
---
With the majority of players being tourists who will take a look and leave, I think this would be a terrible idea from a business standpoint.

Literally he only reason I'm leveling a warrior to be main tank.
---
&gt; I wouldn't agree. Corporations aren't here to protect you or be a "good guy", they are here to give you something you want in return for your money. It's a business. They do what they do to make money
---
I agree that corporations are amoral, and simply do whatever they are allowed to do that will make money.
---
But I think I disagree with you about the implications of that. The fact that we can't trust corporations to do good things means that we need to be vigilant and actively fight back against them when they try to do things that are harmful to us. And that's exactly what this conversation is trying to encourage and enable.
---
&gt; I haven't seen any evidence at all that Blizzard is selling our data.
---
The evidence is exactly your second paragraph here. Corporations will do whatever makes them money, and they would make money from this.
---
(Though one small clarification, Activision itself is playing only an indirect role in this. It appears to be the venue that is running the spyware and monetizing your data, Activision is just getting a cut. They're still complicit, of course, but they have outsourced the dirty work.)
---
&gt; Now, if Blizzard is selling data illegally, that would be grounds for very serious lawsuits and reputation damage
---
Nothing they're doing here is (as of yet) illegal. But that's not much of a defense of it, certainly not an indication that it's not bad. Legality is not the source of morality, it is a trailing effect of it.
---
if I was gonna do that, I'd start my own Classic guild, independent from my BFA guild. maybe I will. but when Classic is first released, I really don't want to be messing around with that guild stuff, I just wanna play the game!
---
We don’t have a definite yes no on so many different questions.
---
Nobody cares dude. Who told you the traditional world of warcraft dude was a sociable person?
---
We're here to grind for weeks and shit on kids.

---
Arrr matey
---
Oh well yeah, I mean there's no law that says you have to have everything all planned out before you start playing classic. Who knows, maybe you'll stumble across people while leveling and enjoy the company and join their Guild.
---
I know we are so excited that we keep daydreaming about and guessing at all the fun coming out way, but there is also the fun we can't predict
---
No-one's going to have that kind of money at launch unless you do business with the Chinese. As time goes on more characters are leveled and more gold is introduced to circulation so I bet the price will climb but won't be anything crazy at start.
---
What do you think?
---
Nah, those are the cobblestones in new dalaran.
---
Horde get warchiefs blessing, which is actually a really strong world buff.

There really is no debate here. There is a reason why 90% of rogues, warlocks, mages and priests were undead back then.

Yessss, hopefully both live up to the hype

We still do

This is further evidence on why picking the right race for your class does matter in vanilla. These gloves will sell for so much because of the weapon skill increase. You get free weapon skill increase by picking the right race.

Freak playing with a bunch of fat naked guys in their momma's basement, dancing as naked Nelf and Human females in Goldshire blah blah, sound familiar?
---
I enjoy reading about others RP stories and answering questions for interested players who want to try something new come Classic.  Any of the RP topics on this sub are a perfect example of what OP is talking about.  Every question is a cesspool of offensive and toxic comments completely unprovoked.  Every single time.
---
I'm sure everyone will fall into their cliques just fine like you said.  I can also see OP's view on how that behavior destroys someone's faith in humanity.
---
all your posts consist of you talking about either gameplay mechanics (which you know nothing of since you're so bad at every game you play, evident by how you had to lie about being glad). you say 'mage is braindead class XD!!!!' but you're no where near the top levels of this, or any, game so how would you know since you're not even remotely close to playing at a high skill level.
---
Or your posts consist of you fanboying xqc and shit talking people online.
---
I'm serious when i said you have school shooter tendencies - I guess this is because you're bad at your only hobby in life (video games) and have nothing else going for you in life; i'd be upset too :(. "ive had enough of this shit lately tbh" - suicidal andy. 
---
I want this post to stay here after you finally give in and shoot up a school (which you will do). i saw it coming
---
As i said, show me proof that you're good in a single game and maybe i'll think you have the right to speak about anything gameplay related :) Although at this point I know you're not good at anything because of how you lied about being x9 glad and when asked for char name you say "
---
Rogue offtank? Luckily you probably won’t even hit max level so you won’t have the opportunity to ruin people’s dungeons.
---
Laughing at the comment I read here yesterday saying how toxic the Classic WoW scene is because they would never share the real secrets of the game, like best farming spots or best items. He needs to see Frostradamus the MVP.
---
Clear and farm Naxx, try to get Atiesh before TBC hits so I can teleport my guild to Kara raids.
---
Didn’t get cheated on, but got dumped a month ago. Classic is definitely something I’m looking for beyond belief.
---
Yeah, they painted the leather black and speckled the red to look like blood, and even got my guild name on the back!

The hormone ghrelin, which is responsible for making you feel hungry, is reduced and the hormone cortisol is increased. This tandem response makes you not feel hungry, or at least a lot less hungry. I did a 5 day water fast and it was definitely easier after 3 days, but you get hungry in small waves every once in a while.
---
based on the spreadsheets i saw it was at like #15 overall. Looking at the numbers, it may not be that far off. Naxx 1h weapons simple have much higher dps

Yea, this is super common. Ghrelin spikes at 48 hours and goes down from there.

If you follow this mantra, great but, don't do it because of hysteria. This is pretty average stuff for apps.
---
It will actually be more active than ever before. There will be so many questions about different things it’s gonna be mental.
---
yes and???? xD
---
Oh, you got me there. Haha
---
Surely you don't believe that. If a troll evokes hostility by being rude that does not mean that the annoyed people are guilty of the troll's accusations.
---
Verigans Fist is so OP tho brother
---
Like OP, my main was Tauren (Shaman) and my *nemesis* in from STV and onwards was this pink haired gnome rogue. 
---
I love gnomes. That little shit ganked me so many times, laughed and pointed so many times. And every single time I was both furious, sad, and kinda glad it was her. 
---
Pink haired Gnome, you were the best and I hate you.
---
I'd be willing to bet they'll be both factions.
---
LIKEWISE
---
Needs a "Never Played" option if you are interested in capturing this whole community. However, if your only interested in what private server players are doing, data should be fine.
---
I was in high school in vanilla and my fondest memory in all of wow was a random pug group that started when I should have gone to bed, and we played until the morning wiping over and over until we finally killed the king and I sat on his throne. I was so tired at school but it was so worth it. We were vastly under leveled by the end, everything was red. But our determination payed off and we did it!
---
\#NoChanges
---
yeah exactly, what if I run into some cool people on whatever realm I roll on and end up joining up with them? who knows at this point?
---
I guess I was trying to say, I don't want to be the one running the "Classic branch" of the guild day to day in Classic when the real Guildmaster is busy playing BFA and would basically be an absentee Classic Guildmaster. if I'm doing the work to run a guild, it'd be MY guild. not his.
---
Sounds hot.
---
I think I understand your question properly, no I theres no hard list as to how you would judge X Agi being worth X Str for the AP vs the AP/Crit you would get, maybe a guide with some recommendations out there. Every class is different and you will weigh different stats differently for each, so theres nothing I could say here that fit in 1 post unless youre more specific. Additionally, theres certain trade offs, like crit getting worse the less hit you have due to crit cap.
---
Id recommend looking up the 1 class you plan on playing and researching its stats.
---
As for Weapon skill, its... quite complicated, you can look up the formulas, but effectively more weapon skill will increase your chance to hit, crit and reduce your likelihood of Glancing Blows (reduced damage). You also get a much larger penalty against enemies that are 3 levels (11+ skill) higher than you. So if you get that inital +5 skill (lowering the skill difference to 10) its actually quite a big bonus to hit and DPS. Hence Edgemasters end up being really good if youre say, a non-Human using a Sword or a non-Orc using Axes.
---
You can create that channel on your server
---
Sorry that you don't have a social life online I guess.
---
Yeah, I mean it doesn't sound like you are exactly best friends and would come to some kind of Guild partnership agreement where players would go between both guilds. If you're looking for something different from classic, something more substantial that you put all of your time into, then you should go and do that and make that experience.
---
With the unspoken implication that if you're not planning on coming back to battle for Azeroth that you may get removed from the guild for inactivity, which is common sense.
---
I hate T2 man
---
I wear it for pvp but rock my T1 in town 
---
I really hate the skirt but t2 helm is the only helm I turn off
---
OP said this sub is toxic and you made two replies calling him "full of shit" and a "troll".
---
You may not like what he wrote, but when you start your reply with "You are full of shit" then you are being a prick. This is not how you make a discussion.
---
Now just because you do not agree with what he wrote doesn't make him a troll either. You calling him a troll because he was stating his opinion which differs from yours is also you proving his point once again.
---
How'd you guys find footage of me at my computer during the BlizzCon 2017 opening ceremonies?

But you have to get the gear to transmog it.

Not that I like transmog but people with crappy gear can’t just transmog better gear

"The big corporation wants your dox to make the event fun and engaging!" 
---
No..They dox you because consumer telemetry and information is more valuable than gold. They want ALL of the money and all of the power and influence over people that they can muster. They want to exploit you, keep you addicted, manipulate your brain chemistry to keep you 'engaged' with products. The military industrial complex doesn't keep us in perpetual war because it wants a safer world. Food companies deliberately sell you toxic food engineered to be addictive, cause depression, obesity and low self-esteem and then sell you the solution by offering 'healthier' alternatives with a premium.

Ask the 22 trillion dollars in offshore tax-free bank accounts if corporations obey the law. (They MAKE the law). Why did articles 11 and 13 pass? Because the populace wanted it? No, because corporations wanted a link tax.

This is a small part of plutocratic consolidation and nobody gives a fuck. It sucks man.

stopped playing on vanilla private Servers at the same day, Classic was announced. Just to get a bit time off of the game, just to be more excited for release.
---
The problem is, i can't seem to get excited. I don't even know why, i want and will play classic, but i can't get excited for it. Maybe because i've cleared Naxx already and therefore won't get to see new content, i'm not sure. But i might be more excited after 3-5 days in, when people started to level, hit STV and world PvP slowly starts. I always played on PvE Servers, all that can get me excited right now is world PvP, as i've never done that before.
---
I'll play Classic for the gameplay, not for the outdated graphics, so I say yes. They prob are allready adding options for more vivid shadows and a more dense groundclutter.
---
Agreed. That's level 20 quest, not 12 tho.
---
5 steps of Denial is real.
---
I think the guild rule is: not online for 3 months = kick. that's pretty lenient, but like I said, its by no means a hardcore guild. and that's fine. once we get an actual release date for Classic, I'll talk to them and let em know I'm not gonna be playing BFA for a considerable amount of time, but don't want to just /gquit. if they kick me, they kick me. not too worried about it.
---
I know I’m just saying you should do it 
---
You need it 
---
You want it
---
Beat C'thun and clear Naxx. My old Vanilla guild never got a chance to beat him and we never even stepped foot into Naxx. Leadership wanted us to beat him 1st which doesnt seem like that good of an idea in hindsight. I'm looking forward to no lifing WoW again and I have nothing holding me back outside of my career
---
I'm ok with a september release though. Doesn't screw up whole summer.
---
BENEDICTION
---
i hope no beta will comming because beta phase can be  2-4 months instead of the real game we have then only a beta
---
Mage imo 
---
But as a Paladin healer, one mage is easy to trick and avoid their CC but one warlock can absolutely ruin my day. Fear is better than poly because damage doesn’t break fear, and curse of tongues is absolutely brutal. 
---
However nothing is worse than two coordinated mages in a BG. Sheeps are easy to avoid but two counterspells are impossible to avoid.
---
I wouldn't mind the new graphics, and models, as long as it was toggleable. Look at how the master chief collection handled halo CE. Toggled graphics based on preference.
---
Leveled my lock to 60 and raided, got my warrior to 52 right before BC. Would love to raid on both a lock and a warrior during classic
---

"THE EPIC QUEST NEVER ENDS!
---
Why are they so good? Explain to a noob.
---
To have a fun way getting distracted from everyday life (work)
---
While leveling your basically stuck carrying two different gear sets. There's really no way around it imo. It really isn't that much of a hassle.
---
Meh, I doubt it'll be that big of an issue. In any case, a GM will contact the person in question, quickly realize that the system has been abused and close the matter. It won't be the insanely huge, exploited issue that you guys think it will.
---
If you think this is toxic, you should go and read through the Anthem reddit, that’s been toxic since launch.
---
Actually jokes. Thank you!

you looking/asking for something like this ?  [https://classic-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Fishing](https://classic-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Fishing)
---
Well no offense, i didn‘t say the pic was a fraud and didn‘t mean to 😄
---
Pretty much sums up my experience. WoW didn't do anything especially new than anything else at the time, but it did it better in nearly every aspect. I think that if a new WoW were to come out, it would have to incorporate groundbreaking technology with incredibly well thought out game design. That is how you bring in new gamers and revitalize old ones. My hope is VR, but there is still a lot of advancement that needs to take place, particularly in controllers.
---
Yes gimme all the graphics with toggles
---
Why does this app need to control the vibration on my phone? Nice cherry picking.
---
Me too!
---
Start Deviate Fish early, farm the recipe to cook them in the Barrens and hold onto them.  Sell them when players start having access gold.  I don't think, as Alliance, there's anything comparable to that profit margin as a starting angler.
---
Best of luck!
---
Yep can confirm. Bought domos chest for ~70g to get the leaf. Fond memories :)
---
Have fun until I'm not.
---
You take handwritten notes for stuff in-game?
---
i ment the so true about no one knowing valeus of items :)
---
Then you get 5 comment responses telling you how they rogues tanked all the bosses in mc simultaneously, or that you are saying it’s impossible to play said class, and other hyperbolic responses
---
ez karma, just pander
---
I want to be a known druid on my server.
---
Nope, the most recent is just the battle royale and zombies
---
Have you tried it? It might for all I know, I just don't think there's any point complaining until we actually know.
---
wish i was so lucky, here i am committed to things like a chump
---
Rogue and Warrior both work if you're going for mechanical aspects as well as Hunter to a lesser extent. Warriors have the least leeway or wiggle room when it comes to leveling. It's not that it's particularly difficult to kill one mob that's your level; it's that you will have to spend 30 seconds killing a mob and 30 seconds eating after each mob kill. Depending on your level and resources, you can kill two mobs at once, but if that goes south, you'll have to run back from the spirit healer, which is often far away. Farming gold at low levels isn't the easiest, but it isn't much harder for a Warrior than any other class. Mining and Blacksmithing are fine, but professions generally don't make you a lot of money while you're leveling. Leveling will be slow, but if you're able to get a blue 2H weapon with like 3.6 speed and high top end weapon damage, that will be the single more impactful thing you can do to speed up your leveling experience. The kinds of abilities you'll have available to you, Heroic Strike, Battle Shout, Overpower, Rend, and eventually Mortal Strike, scale with weapon top end damage, so using overpower with a 3.6 speed 2H weapon will hit much harder than a 1.8 speed 1H weapon.
---
I will never understand why they release games in summer : it's hot, bright, there's a lot of things to do outside.
---
End of October, the night is falling very fast, temperatures get colder, this is the best season to stay home and play video games for the next 6 months !
---
play one month, get that nostalgia fix then cancel sub again, 12 euro a month for a 15y old game just doesnt feel right, especialy with the current activision vibes, and wait for next expansion
---
my goal is to have fun. and maybe to show some alliance players how strong the horde is in pvp 😉
---
There is No beta for us, they Are testning the servers them self
---
Nahh its still her, I actually know her IRL.
---
Skills impacted combat monumentally, mainly because it governed your miss chance. 
---
Although you’d be maxed out in a certain weapon skill, missing was still possible. These gloves decrease that chance by a lot, since 7+ extra weapon skill is equal to about 1 level up.
---
Game publishers don't think that way. They mainly think in $$$$$$$$$$'s. And my previous post got downvoted for giving my opinion favouring a late summer release... Sad...
---
This will be me  at release 100%
---
I’m a hand writing kinda person, yeah. I’ll keep my notes on who not to group with, what I was doing before I logged so I don’t forget when I return, random ideas for stuff while gaming, etc. I was also thinking of having one made for a dungeon guide or something like that too.
---
Agreed! While not quite the same, Warriors and Paladins can do Quel'Serrar and Shamans get their Skyfury Helm. Both of those quests are pretty involved and fun too!
---
Been subbed since Vanilla and played every xpac since
---
My guild runs heroic raids, but never the quality of raider or time commitment for mythic. I told them I’m gonna be devoting 110% of my time to classic, and as a college student, even that’s not gonna be very much.
---
As much as I like them and I’ve been with them since MOP, people are more expendable today with sharping and cross realm grouping. My holy pally can be just the same as any other holy pally they find in the group finder. 
---
They’re going to miss me as a person, but our characters aren’t so essential anymore. Professions are borderline useless, cross realm grouping eliminates the necessity of having capable raiders in every role, except maybe tank, because you’re not limited by just the options on your server, you’ve got the whole game to pluck people from.
---
They’ll miss Larenthar the holy paladin, but they’ll do just as fine with another holy pally, and when I come back I’ll just be Larenthar the holy paladin again.
---
I wonder why you’re getting downvoted :)
---
Where'd that skybox come from? BfA has far better skyboxes with much better clouds than that: [https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/713193.jpg](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/713193.jpg)
---
Hahahahaha, 2600 server population being too low? Yeah, maybe it's too low if you are a private server hopping fresh finding need to be surrounded by 10000 anonymous characters at all times trying to find the fun bottom feeder.
---
Have fun, make friends, find my niche and own it and be a positive fixture on the server.
---
Sounds pretty cool. Don't think I could do it myself though - my stomach would turn from my horrible handwriting.
---
My main long term goal would be to have a full set of tier 1 armor for my Priest. Maybe full tier 2 if things go really well.
---
I know those are not BiS but I enjoy the looks of them. Mostly will be doing dungeon runs through as I enjoy doing those even after they offer nothing for me to collect.
---
a very rare specimen , please donate your body to science+, we have to study your genes.... 
---
+  after you die from natural causes obviously)
---
Do you have a single fact to back that up?
---
Tbh im glad they do. Apps like these can be great to counter fraud. Sadly, like many other things these days they want to know everything about you and then some.
---
Funny how you pull out the not so bad things and use them to say it's fine. Just ignoring all the "complete co trol over your phone so we can create a profile of your event experience to sell" stuff.
---
So how good are those for a human warrior?
---
Of everyone that I've asked on private servers if they're going to play classic, all of them said they were.
---
I haven't heard a single person say they were going to stick to private because it's free.  I'm not saying there aren't any, but I've yet to find one.
---
Why? Not like he's spouting facts either. It's just a guessing game.
---
I just think the idea that for every ONE  private server player there are TEN refusing to play until a legit classic server comes is far-fetched
---
ok lol
---
Damn almost 50% plays pservers
---
Rogue tank ahahahahah
---
I'm trying out different builds I never tried on vanilla just so I know what I wanna do when classic drops. It's having the same effect on me, it's just increasing my hype and not getting old whatsoever.
---
People knew, just not many. I was using them to raid in mc early 2015as dw fury with capped hit %
---
are gold amounts on mobs on private servers accurate?  or respawn rates?  not to mention combat numbers..
---
Seems like something as heavily mathematical as ‘what’s the best to farm’ needs to be tested on the actual game before making this sort of content
---
I see this and think....   who cares.....
---
You made some of these up which completely kills the meme for me.
---
Pinch of salt.
---
You have to get better at ignoring the toxic nobodies.  I have been here since the start and before that in many private server communities.  There are TONS of great people here and in game, and you will meet people who will appreciate any  wacky playstyle  you might fancy  (as long as your a sociable and not a complete idiot in game, but I don't think that's the problem here)   Really, I don't even notice toxic comments, maybe I avoid them or I am trained over the years to skip them, I don't know.  But it never bothers me and I have 0 tolerance for that stuff. I must admit I am not the most active reader here but I always find something interesting  any time I do visit this subreddit. 
---
Good luck and all the best in classic.
---
At least Hella had a fucking release date.
---
Someone else made it, but I agree, BfA has improved alot in regards to skybox quality. I pick this one because the change wasn't that drastic and it kept the same color scheme.
---
Get a healer to 60 and geared comfortably. That way I can log in and do what I WANT to do, right now I log in to retail and do what I SHOULD do such as Dailies, rep farm, artifact farm, mythic for a weekly chest, expeditions etc.  
---
Sure its content but you HAVE to do it or you fall behind, in Classic you can go back to logging in and not being told AZEROTH NEED YE HELP LAD! Every two seconds. Retail currently has content but its just surface content with no depth. Classic is the sea, retail is the pool.
---
I havent raided vanilla before, but from my retail experience I would say it’s hard to get much progress with 1 day a week. Many times, we used 1 raid day to just clear up to where we were last week. 
---
I have heard that, after getting some good gear from later raids, earlier raids can be cleared relatively fast (1hr?).
---
Thanks. :3 I'm not looking for progression raiding, or anything. Just looking to have fun. By virtue of being a complete game, there's no necessity to continually push forward like in retail or even Vanilla when it was current. Maybe I'll create a human fury warrior at some point to see the hardcore raiding scene, but right now I'm most interested in building weird things again. Might lead some crack pugs for people like me if life allows, aha.
---
Usually one night is dedicated two to three hours.   Depending on guild but most of the time the first night is just to clear what you know you can beat already. The second night is for progression. One night a week isn’t really much time to progress.
---
That zone was so good, Stiches and Mor Ladim.
---
Sell it for resources then or wait until people farm gold
---
I made this :)
---
I read that being a streamer is a way to go, that's why I'm quitting my job when classic release and I'll be full-time streamer!!! justin.tv here I come!!
---
the fuck is justin.tv ^^
---
To have one character and stick with it. Playing everything im interested to 30 on private servers. I think i finally found my class. And to be less introverted awkward antisocial then 14 year old me. Other then these, MC, BWL, Ony, ZG, AQ20 clear at some point. PvP wise maybe rank 10 or whatever needed to the first basic set of gear but im not super focused on ranks. I plan on doing outdoor pvp for fun.
---
Didnt read the whole thing. Most people suck. The longer we go without release the more people look stuff up and become radicalized elitist fucks. Hell give me about an hour to watch a few videos and I too will have "cleared naxx and got rank 14 in vanilla." I said it before but it's probably harming the launch numbers by waiting so long. The more time we wait the more dbags will scare away newcomers and the more people are likely to find another game to become invested in.
---
Quality of this subreddit decreased compared to 2017-2018, but it's still better than many others.

---
Then why is she repeating her viral tweet in February 2, 2019?
---
I actually do intend to hold my own raids, and I certainly don't expect anyone to take me over a human fury warrior for DPS. The point is more that telling people if they don't play one of three specific things they aren't able to do anything is destructive. Will a fury warrior deal more damage than a hunter? Sure. Do you need 30+ fury warriors to complete the raid? Not in the slightest. There are 40 spots, there's room for nonmeta builds.
---
Amen
---
Long term goal is to complete every quest in the game with the exception of raid quests.  Not sure how much raiding I'll do yet.  I'm going to be a tank druid so my raiding options are limited.  
---
I'll also be maxing out both professions (probably skinning/leatherworking) and all secondary professions. And attempting to collect all leatherworking patterns and cooking recipes.

my advice: never let some random strangers on the internet ruin your fun, or tell you what to think.
---
Not much. A well geared guild could clear multiple raids in 3 to 4 hours, but that's after the effort put in to get gear and learn the mechanics to put it in farm status in the first place.
---
Your two best choices. 1) be a casual in a high end raid guild who might be willing to use you as filler slots or tag along spots during farm nights. 2) dont commit to a guild schedule and instead look for pug groups to eventually form. That way you can flex, play when time permits. Just make friends with pug raid leads, to have contacts and know when they usually run.
---
I started vanilla late and successfully plugged most of MC, ZG, and AQ 20. Plugging later content is unlikely, though maybe 3 to 4 years down the road it might start happening as more people get familiar with those raids and have alts that have worked up into that content.
---
Only revealed the very moment she was released lol

PvP in FFXIV is almost non-existend (and it's a pity really), and the community was nice and chill (at least untill WoW refugees started their great exodus from horrors of BfA).

I ignore that, because that's already the norm. Every app is saving analytics about you.

If you need a wake up call for that in 2019, you're already way to late.

That's not how discussions work. I'm not claiming anything. The burden of proof isn't on me. 
---
Real world example: Person A claims that vaccines cause autism. Person B asks what proof person A has that vaccines cause autism. Person A responds by saying, well I don't know the proof *but neither do you* so my claim is valid.

No, that's not how this works.

Translation: "Will people just stop bringing logic into these conversations?!"
---
Here's the thing. Private servers have been collecting data and refining their database for years. It's a much more valuable source of information than some random person's 14-year-old memory. So valuable that Blizzard invited Nostalrius staff to their headquarters to discuss the implementation of WoW Classic. I don't remember Blizzard inviting any random people off Reddit to glean their thoughts and implement their memories into the game?
---
And the thing we're discussing is pretty simple stuff: server release zone congestion. I'm bringing a few facts to the table:
---
* Nostalrius had 2-3 times more people at release than WoW classic servers will have, most likely. I'm basing this on quotes from developers stating that they want to emulate vanilla server populations.
---
* The time that I had to basically sit around doing nothing on the launch of the server, waiting for enough people to move on before I could start killing boars, scorpids, etc. This amount of time was about 2 hours, and Nostalrius didn't launch with dynamic spawns or sharding.
---
* I'm not claiming that servers are perfect, but I'm using common sense to determine that basic information like spawn times and mob density in the Valley of Trials will at least be closely accurate to a Classic WoW server, because really it just can't be that different.
---
So if you want to attack my facts, tell me which of these things are incorrect. Specifically, tell me what was so different about the Nostalrius launch, that will make the Classic WoW launch ~62.2 times worse than the Nostalrius launch (1 week before players can make substantial progress). Because that claim is just wild and baseless.
---
I'm just going to ignore the rest of the childish screeching in your previous message. And probably the childish screeching that will follow in your response. If you ever want people to take you seriously, you may want to learn how to have an adult conversation.
---
Theoretically everything.  And I’d say easily through BWL... depends on efficient the guild is.  It would be quite difficult to continue making progress when AQ launched tho I’d say. 
---
For what it’s worth, I fully intend to find a one day a week raid and stick with it.  I LOVE raiding in WoW, but I’m not willing to sacrifice more than one night a week’s worth of family time to dedicate to it.
---
I expect 200k player for release
---
Misinformation bad no bad dog bad dog spanked rolled up newspaper SWAT no treat go outside
---
I've been running sims and even on horde side, +1% haste is actually better than +8 str. Not by a lot though, the difference is always &lt; 1% DPS
---
Well yeah, lol, youre literally asking the demographic they are making the game for
---
My biggest point is there is not a giant army hiding in the shadows waiting for a retail classic server, there is a fine chunk, but mind blowing? Nah
---
The biggest private servers have nothing to do with classic, barely even wow anymore..just filled to the brim with custom garbage and free loot
---
Things will not be that hard up till BWL if the raid knows what to do. AQ40 and Nax will be another cookie.

It's very hard to find actual data. Most people have their memories colored by their time on private servers, and real vanilla had a ton of patches where what worked how changed fairly frequently.  
---
So just doubt everyone, can't know for sure if it's accurate or not :p
---
So it is a misinformation? Where you got that info?
---
Did someone say...
---
It isn't.
---
Have a good day.
---
Depends on all the factors you would think depends on. Player commitment, player preparation, player skill, class distribution, random luck for gear drops
---
to have fun. why else would I pay $15 a month to play a video game? so much salt on this sub and we don't even have a release date yet. don't forget guys, its all about having fun. if you're not having fun, you're wasting your time. this applies to all aspects of life, not just World of Warcraft.

I think this album will be associated with Classic for lots of people. 15 years from now a song from here will spark our Classic memories. It's a given for PvP videos and perhaps new memes.
---
I think Judas Priest's latest album will be featured a lot too, certainly on Paladin clips.
---
Haha I don't care just caught my eye that something I made got posted :D
---
Beyond feeling the experience and challenges of Classic again, I want to finally do and complete a proper classic raid. I never went on raid because I didn't know how to approach Raid Guilds back then due to my lack of knowledge with English and tendency to solo. 
---
Also, I want to earn an Epic mount with the original pricing. While I managed to get a flying and epic mount in Wrath, it never felt like a true achievement.
---
Well you made me groan so I guess you did a good meme or something.
---
Because people thought undead looked badass (they were right), and because people weren't nearly as knowledgeable/experienced/min-max-oriented as the hardcore crowd on private servers are now. It doesn't matter that undead was/is more popular than orc for rogues/warlocks, when today's best vanilla PvPers (who are way better than the ones who actually played vanilla) consider Hardiness to be the best racial.
---
Being stuck on classic? You can do everything eventually
---
Can you gauge the legitimacy behind rumors? May be based on where the rumors were posted? Blue posts, search bar, encouraging responsible, proactive posting.
---
But what matters is where you got the info, haha.
---
I would still say, for someone creating content and trying to strive on 'teaching' people about Classic, the bar is expected to be higher.
---
😂alright if you say so
---
not talking shit guy. just merely stating /u/Hycran doesn't know fuck all about relationships. it's as simple as that. don't be so offended or do. lol

By your logic, anything less than total agreement would be considered "toxic"

haha Neat! if you see it again shoot me the link I'd be curious to see
---
stop being soft, seriously, grow up
---
Another shit meme wow thanks for posting this
---
You can complete raids with 20 people if they know what they're doing.
---
At that point it's not about being able to finish the raid, it's about not being stuck in MC for 2+ hours because some people just want to play what's fun for them

Going to aoe grind murlocs in dustwallow only to be poly ganked a mage three levels lower than me to which proceeds to corpse camp me. I managed to rez behind a tree while he was distracted, got my mana back and rushed him only for a level 60 buddy of his to materalize out of thin air to Fuck my day.
---
As a resto shaman I just fish, herb and vendor excess junk from instance runs. Very early on when you still have enhancement stuff from leveling you can farm a bit of fire elemental for elemental fire for raid fire protection pots.
---
It'd probably prefer them to retune since MC on 1.12 is a complete joke. I doubt they'll retune as keeping original values is the safer and cleaner option for them, there is hope as they haven't explicitly said anything on the subject though, maybe they're intentionally not talking about it.

I started as a horde player but one day decided to try out the alliance side for kicks.  I leveled a hunter up a bit and was questing around hillsbrad when a group was trying to run SFK.  I had run it on the horde side and agreed to join this group of four players. I had been playing solo mostly and had little contact with the alliance players so far.
---
We progressed through the dungeon and defeated the second to last boss when the Feline Mantle dropped.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=3748
---
It was a good upgrade for a few people and I rolled need on it as well as it was much better than whatever twill shoulders I had on at the time.  I won which made the trip worthwhile.  
---
But then the shitstorm, the group went insane, they yelled and berated me over and over because I had rolled on an item that was "only for casters".
---
In my defense it was an item with agility on it, my main stat, also hunters used mana in vanilla so the increased int was going to allow for better dps rotarionnwhile leveling.  If it was ONLY a caster item why did it have agility?
---
In their defense it was a cloth item.
---
You could chalk it up to "huntard" who thinks all gear is hunter gear but I blame blizzard for terrible item stat allocation. If it had not had agility on it I wouldn't have rolled need.  I believe blizzard did eventually adjust stats on items which removed stats like this but at the time there it was.
---
But here is what makes it this whole ordeal my worst memory playing WoW. We continued to the last boss, the whole group continued to spew the most toxic speech at me I had ever experienced in WoW. I tried to explain myself and do my job to help the group beat the dungeon. We started the fight with Archmage Arugal and about halfway through the fight I was kicked from the group. I then had seconds before I was to be teleported out of the dungeon and to whever my hearth stone was set, which was not near south shore.
---
The group was so pretty that they used me to clear trash and fight the last boss but keep me from getting the last kill as if I was a ninja or something.  I had not been rolling need on everything, I am always a team player in dungeons and try to help the group succeed. Because of bad itemization I made a choice and that was terrible enough for them to be incredibly toxic to me and then do the most petty thing I have ever witnessed by kicking me halfway through the last boss.
---
It taught me what I had always heard about but never completely believed, that alliance players were the most immature, ass hole, jerks. I figured that reputation had only been due to the rivalry between alliance and horde players, but no, they really are the most immature jerks I have had the misfortune of playing with.
---
Needless to say I went back to playing horde after this.
---
I was in two different guilds in classic that fell apart because of husband / wife nepotism.
---
Were those with patch 1.12 itemization? On progression realms TF should be main-hand weapon and therefore not that good on rogues. Classic will however have 1.12 itemization so it'll be one-handed from the start. 15th seems little wierd considering I'm not sure if there even were 15 off-hand viable epic swords in the game.
---
&gt;By your logic, anything less than total agreement would be considered "toxic"
---
Not at all. As I wrote
---
&gt;There is a difference between "annoyed replies" and calling someone "full of shit".
---
You can disagree, of course, but you we can have a civil discussion without opening your first reply by calling someone "full of shit". Like the way I discuss this topic.

&gt;The topic was posted JUST to stir up negative responses.

If I was using your logic I could say

&gt;By your logic, anything less than total ~~agreement would be considered "toxic"~~ praise for this community would be considered a post to stir up negative responses.

Not to sound like the guy defending them. But some dude shot up a game competition because he lost. Blizzard is probably doing this for safety more than wanting your nudes and privacy. Don’t like it? Don’t go
---
"heard rumors". Care to elaborate?
---
Fantastic goals.
---
Same, with full T3
---
Pending you mean a human using a sword, then not quite as good as with any other class using a sword. There is sliding scale of sorts when it comes to level difference between you and the mob you are attacking (which is where the 15 points in weapon skill comes into play). You need a weapon skill of 315 to be completely capped against a 63 boss, but the difference between going from 300 to 305 is greater than going from 310 to 315.
---
It sounds like your parents were... uh...
---
Cross realm BG’s existed in Vanilla.

I am in a 3 night raid guild that eventually works into, but doesn't complete mythic. As soon as classic was announced, I asked who was interested. No more than maybe 10% are interested at all and I may be the only one planning a full swap. So my plan is join a new guild for classic. Leave myself in the retail guild until I get booted out for inactivity most likely.
---
I told the guild leader I would be full switching to classic. At the beginning of this raid tier, I reminded him again and told him to feel free to recruit me out to a sub spot. ATM I still have a full spot. We are running very thin for mythic.
---
My guild is going alliance for classic sadly(it's a big no for me) and I won't be joining them. Tough i think we will still continue raid progressing on retail. I will just do my weekly mount runs, do a  +10, cap my islands and come to raids(raiding and mount farming are the only things I enjoy in retail). Outside of that all my playtime will be spent on classic unless there's a content update in retail. Hopefully I can find another nice casual guild on classic with different raiding hours that also doesn't ruin my day to day life.
---
I love Warcraft as a whole and enjoy different aspects of both games. I don't wanna quit either.
---
All the ɡold in the ɡame, like the filthy ɡoblin I am.

o_o
---
Its was on cooldown....(lie) :)
---
The only gloves you might replace them with (for raiding) is from C'thun. Weapon skill is very valuable. 1k would be pretty high, but 500-800 is probably what many will go for.
---
Yeah I am guessing an August/Sept release if 8.2 comes out end of June to try to compete with FF14 expac(blizz always seems to launch patches around this). With the raid coming out Mid-July since Blizz said they wanted it out earlier after 8.2.
---
I was the Healer officer for a solid raiding guild. Despite being the youngest officer in the guild (19) I ran a VERY tight ship and when our raid fucked up, very rarely was it the fault of our healers. 
---
Anyway, one day, we were trying to kill one of the Green Dragonflight... I don't recall which one...
---
If you remember world raid bosses in Vanilla, it was often extremely stressful getting a kill, especially on PvP servers. My guild was the first to the dragon and there was word that the top Alliance guild was rallying the troops, so we were short on time.
---
We were really struggling as we were lacking healers and had a few raw guild trial members along for the ride. We had already wiped three times, and our healing rotation kept dropping the ball. Some of the other guild officers were starting to chirp me in officer chat. This was relatively new for me, and I didn't take it well.
---
One of our most senior priests was a gravelly old dude named Gnostic. He was a sub-par healer at best, but he was easily the oldest person in the guild and was also sort of our defacto mascot. He was beloved by pretty much everyone.
---
But on that particular day it was obvious that Gnostic was the reason our main tank kept dying. He was fucking up his rotation, and his healing numbers were garbage.
---
Feeling the heat from my guild officers, outside competition coming to steal our kill, and my own personal pride, I decided to call out Gnostic. But not in private. I did it over the raid group Vent, publicly, for everyone to hear. I wasn't profane or nasty, but I just simply said that Gnostic needed to get his act together, as he was the reason we were failing.
---
Gnostic. Went. Fucking. Nuts.
---
He cursed me up and down, told me to shut the fuck up, and just generally dressed me down in front of the entire guild. I was absolutely gobsmacked. (Insert surprised Pikachu here). Nobody had EVER heard Gnostic speak that way.
---
The whole raid Vent went deathly silent. All I could muster was a meek "OK." It was like daddy slapped mommy at the kitchen table.
---
After the overwhelming awkwardness dissipated, we soldiered on, wiped twice more, then gave up after Alliance started to show up an harass us.
---
I learned a valuable lesson that day that I carry with me to my current career in management: never, ever, ever, ever publicly dress someone down. Always take that shit private.
---
That was my worst feeling in WoW, by far.
---
That is incredibly doable, I've cheated on someone for over a year and they didn't contribute in any way shape or form. All it takes is being careful about your lies and meticulous about covering your tracks. The only reason she ever found out was because I told her myself after coming to terms with how much of a fucking lowlife I was.
---
If I do play a warrior, to get a god damned decent raiding DPS chest piece. I think I was stuck with Heroism. Never got AQ40 one, and they wouldn't give me the Nax trash leather one when it would drop
---
So something is right or wrong by how common it is? Let's just ignore everything that goes against our privacy because everything is already going against our privacy. Brilliant.
---
Agreed.  The graphics are the last thing I’m concerned about.  Would rather they be as updated as possible.  It’s the GAMEPLAY that matters and makes it special.
---
Did you get to play the demo? It was amazing. I've never been so happy to be in the barrens in my life.
---
I didn’t.
---
It's not # of nights per week it's # of hours per week  
---
a 1 night guild can very well be ahead of a 4 night guild  
---
   
---
Without knowing how many hours/wk you want to raid, you can't really accurately answer this question
---
I’m not disappointed in the Least

But if the Oasis isn’t a real thing by 2030 I’ll be pissed

I think he died, guys. This is what happens when you don't stock up at a food vendor.

how are you going split your time between both? personally I can only get into one thing (game, or version of a game) at a time. teach me your secrets...
---
I´ve seen it mentioned multiple times on Youtube comments and in Classic stream chats.
---
Again, rumors. I wasn´t able to find anything confirming or denying it on this reddit, so I thought I will ask the question myself. I was curious.
---
blizzard has already announced that there are changes...
---
Buy me a tick, if I win I'll pay you back...LOL
---
He is correct, though.
---
Alexensual made a video on it? all the information is on there and his pinned comment for an update
---
Aww man. It was great. Barrens chat in full swing.

the only two measurements you could describe as titanic for trump are his waistline and his stupidity

I'll admit I was wrong.

I very much doubt I will be wrong

&gt; Youtube comments and Classic stream chats.   
---
&gt;All I asked is where you verified your claim that it is a misinformation.  
---
&gt;I know I am giving out just rumors, but in that case, so are you. :D  
---
&gt;No need to be so defensive. I´ve seen this rumor mentioned a lot of times, so I thought I will ask here.
---
WoW community has always been toxic.  It’s easily the worst of all MMO’s I’ve ever played.  And it’s really not even close.
---
I bought 10 Playfields for 20 euro. I didnt even check until now, because i didnt win anyway xD

Idk what game you played,  but there aren't 20 man's in vanilla. 
---
That was Wrath
---
pre raid bis.  he is using beastmaster shoulders and the sword from DM.  calm down.
---
50 threat for applying a buff/debuff.
---
I was discussing this point you made. 
---
&gt;Especially considering how many people play private servers simply because they're free.
---
I do think there is a huge amount of people waiting for classic.  I can't get most of my friends to play cause they're all waiting for classic; I'd imagine its the same for many others.
---
I play on a pretty large server currently, and have played on others, but none have custom content or free loot. In fact, the largest 12 current pservers are Blizzlike and have none of that.
---
Where are you getting this information?
---
The way I'm doing it is specifically not the way you are doing it. I am in a guild with friends in battle for Azeroth. One of my friends runs the guild there and I participate. We are going to make a sister Guild in classic and I am going to run that one. However our friendship ensures that we can communicate and don't feel any weird power struggle one person's Guild is getting less attention than the others that causes a Rift, there is none of that. Because the classic Guild will also attract new players, and a new players will also join the battle for Azeroth group, and we have already talked it out and decided that if the two guilds start to grow a part that that is just fine.
---
But I'll have fun on both. Thing about classic is, I'm not trying to recreate or replace my battle for Azeroth experience with classic. This new classic will be its own experience.
---
Decreasing the amount of hit% you need is nice but not the real reason why these gloves are so good. If the hit % was the main reason to equip these gloves then you could simply equip some gloves with hit% and better stats on top of it.  
---
The main reason why these gloves are so good and BiS for the entire game is because they combat glancing blows. The better geared you are the more important it is to negate glancing blows and is also the reason why Humans with additional weapon skill in both Swords and Maces are unarguably the best Warrior race for PvE.
---
They are using the vanilla maps so I doubt they will go out of their way to remove it
---
You say defensive, I say encouraging critical thinking, haha.
---
They have to do a beta, and then they have to fix the colossal amount of bugs and mistakes we will find in the beta. It’s gonna be a late September release if we’re lucky.
---
You don’t mind playing a broken game just so you can play it a few months sooner?
---
I personally wouldn't believe someone who lost to a level 17 hunter as a level 25 druid.
---
How dare you even suggest a change in graphics.
---
We need bengay!
---
Have fun with the game, raid casually (MC, Ony, BWL, ZG, AQ20), do loads of PvP, get rich to help out friends, play three toons to 60 (Hunter, Mage, Druid), max out cooking and fishing, do some twinking in fun brackets, stuff like that.
---
1 night basically means 4 hours. It doesn't always have to be like that, but it is most of the time. And with most of the time i mean 80% of the time.
---
Only on the internet can someone use subjective rumors as evidence, then expect other people to provide objective evidence to counter their rumors.

That simultaneously made me lol. Really seals the deal.

OH! So this is where it is from. So the rumors are based on that. And the video is basically "tinfoil hat", nothing sure for certain. Thank You!
---
if you wanna roll Horde, roll Horde man. dont let others dictate your realm, faction, race, class, or spec. just do you. I'm rolling Alliance but I'll still throw ya a LOK'TAR!!!
---
no 1 night means 1 night  
---
I know many guilds that run 1 night 2 hours &amp; many that run 1 night 9 hours.    
---
It's always been hours/wk not nights/wk in terms of time spent raiding, which is the only metric you can use to gauge how far you might progress.  
---
I was just saying without knowing how many hours he's spending in that 1 night raiding, nobody can accurately answer. And basing your time spent on raiding in terms of days/wk instead of hours/wk is just stupid.
---
My biggest struggle is either to level a mage or a rogue.

Shit's rough

Wait, is Cyberpunk not coming in 2020?

Why not just use them on a computer?
---
The dice careens off of the spent drink bottles on the table and dashed wildly for the edge. Centrifugal force kicks in halts the madness as the die lands perfectly...you have rolled a 1.

Try not to listen to dumb people.
---
I don't know what guilds you know.. but they are everything but casuals then. We are talking about vanilla here after all. In BfA, i would've understand that a bit more, because raids are way harder and actually require progress, but even then, i raided mythic sucessfully troughout Legion until Antorus, with raiding 1 day and we raided 4 hours. 4 hours and we got cutting edge(KJ was insanely close though).
---
So again, i don't know what guilds you are talking about, but if we talk about a casual 1 day raiding guild, we are talking about 4 hours(maybe 5 because it's really only 1 day).
---
it's up to everyone to decide for themselves. sometimes in this sub, we forget that not everyone is as HYPE for Classic as we are. crazy right? how could they not be? but seriously, many are happy with staying in BFA. oh well. less competition to kill mobs for quests at launch, right? ;)
---
get a rogue and priest to full t3 and bis weapons. thinking that will take me 1.5 to 2 years at which point the TBC servers will be starting up where I will want to finish BT with a belf mage.

So you're just going to assume the fat person's body will maintain the same BMR?  Even as they lose weight to approach that of an ideal weight individual?

are you having a stroke?

that's cool.
---
for me, I feel like I could give 100% to one, or give 50% to each and then what's the point anyway. I have a weird work schedule, so my free time is pretty limited. I'd rather just focus on one.
---
Hahaha i laughed
---
I am a guy just like you. I want Classic to succeed and I really want it without WoW tokens. I was just curious. I´ve heard rumors, I asked here, that is all.
---
Yes so you raided 4 hours a week. You would classify your guild as a 4h/wk guild. And you would rank your guilds amongst other 4h/wk guilds.   
---
So if a guild raided 2 days a week and 2 hours a night, you could safely compare the two in terms of progression because you have the same time spent raiding. (Granted your guild would've had a slight edge due to traveling &amp; prep) but my point remains.  
---
My entire point which you for some reason can't seem to grasp is it doesn't matter how many days a week your raid, it matters on the hours you spend in the raid. And saying 1 day/week = 4 hours/week is just making shit up because every single guild is different.   
---
Yes there are TYPICAL raid lengths which are USUALLY 3-4 hours a night, but without knowing roughly the amount of time OP plans on raiding you can't tell him how much he will or won't clear. I don't know why this had to turn into a huge thing, I was literally just stating that the # of days you raid doesn't matter where as the # of hours does...
---
I'm pretty excited for Vampire The Masquerade Bloodlines 2. It is a little over 15 Years now.

I never thought I see the day, where this game gets a Sequel and Classic WoW.

Hi, /u/Cornsinmypoo
---
Same here.
---
Think I saw the same thing a few days earlier on this reddit :( .
---
Especially with improved shocks
---
Mage on pve server for portals (not much game time) or rogue on pvp server for fun. Choices, choices.
---
Yeah man Vanilla graphics look like shit by today's standards
---
No need to grab pitchforks until we see something official from Blizzard, but if ingame gold is buyable with WoW tokens then I'm out.
---
This runs contrary to what I've found playing on private servers. I'm curious as to why you think this way.
---
Those are long used. i am talking going from 45ish binds up to 60+ and staying in reach of WASD.
---
No you don't understand me. I understand you, but i've never seen anything like that, 2 hours per day for 2 days a week? I've never seen this and i'm not only talking about my guild here, every Guild i got to know raided 4 hours per day. how many days they did, was up to them but if they were to raid 4 hours longer it always meant 1 day longer. The closest i could recall a guild doing stuff like that was 2x 3 hours, but 2, hours in vanilla, that's not even Worth it if u seriously want to atleast progress a bit in vanilla.
---
They are casuals, going to a raid twice for 2 hours per week, would mean traveling, buffing, worldbuffs, all that stuff, that consumes time. They would actually sacrifice more than raiding 1 day 4 hours and i'm certainly sure that the OP is looking for a 4 hours raiding guild and not 1 day but 9 hours or 2 days but 2 hours, that would neither be worth it nor would it make sense for him.
---
Im pretty certain being stupid but also being smarter than the majority is still possible.

Most of the people at the top are not smart. They generally just are willing to take the risks to lower cost and produce profits.

Thats all the tops of companies care about.

If it's my raid group, there's only room for people that I want to raid with.

Just like I cannot tell you what/how to play, you cannot tell me who to bring to my raids

why would we tell you, then it wouldn't be the best ;^)

That was my first assumption too, but the app does not appear to have the capacity to receive tickets by scanning a barcode/QR code - everything except the ticket being displayed at the gate occurs over the network.

Closing out unfinished business.

Was in the best Horde raid guild on our server from BWL through AQ. With 5 bosses left in Naxx we hit a wall, after struggling for close to a month our GM quit and we could never recover.   
---
Wanted to get that Cryptstalker 6 piece bonus so hard(I dared not dream of 8 pc at the time) and was stuck at 5 piece for the rest of my life.  
---
So for me it's finishing Naxx and getting my full Cryptstalker.

---
I am in a guild, but I haven't raided or instanced with any of them except my ex-wife in a long time (early Legion, I think), so it doesn't really matter. 
---
I have not heard any of them mention anything about classic, mostly because there is almost never any guild chat anymore. It's a zombie, but they still do raid regularly. No social aspect outside of that anymore.
---
MOM
---
MORE HOT POCKETS
---
Enhance shamans eat mages alive lmao
---
That's entirely contingent on you being a motivated player on a raidteam. If you lose your raid spot, its not like you can just pug AQ40 and Naxx. A lot of guilds are gonna die in AQ40 and Naxx and the players in those guilds will likely never see Kel Thuzad.
---
I mean, you're very likely correct but it's still useful to look at how the system runs retail, and then just interpret that performance as a lower bound for how the system will handle classic.
---
I doubt it will make such a big difference that a PC which can barely manage retail will provide an enjoyable experience for classic, so it's still worth checking, imo.
---
I never said that it was right or wrong. I'm just here to clarify what the permissions are used for because people love to spin up conspiracy theories. 
---
Yes it can open the camera app (while unlocked), no it can't listen in on you while you take a shower. 
---
I'm sure the people that make a fuss about this have the [reddit app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&amp;hl=en) installed, which asks for mostly the same stuff.
---
If you don't know, you don't need to pay to reactivate your account to buy the first token, which is nice

I guess I could mention who made it. (Delete if this isn’t allowed - it’s not my business)

Lende Leather on FB and I can provide an email if you want as well.

Amen to this

$15/month is what you pay Blizzard to play. Make it 20 mins excersize/day paid to yourself in addition to that.
---
Most guilds didnt raid for more then 1/2 nights a week. U should be completely fine.

It's based on Cyberpunk 2020, so it'd be a big missed opportunity if it wasn't.
---
We'll know for sure at E3 this year.
---
Good lord. Just checked my guild's chat history, and in the last 40 hours it's a total of two people talking through 8 lines of chat.
---
gg noob team
---
This is why people should be worried less than they are. They may not have given us a clear definition of shard usage yet, but they did make it clear they dont want to impact the overall vanilla experience... like sharded world bosses. 
---
As a software dev, I think the idea of using it in early zones on day 1 to allow higher server pops to offset the sightseeing players who wont be there days or weeks later makes sense. The other options are logon queues or more servers that will certainly have to be merged together once the pops stabilize. Both those are far more negative to the experience.
---
Assuming that before the end if my first play session that I'll be past sharding, I have no concerns. If they use it again later for events or whatever, they'll just be shooting themselves in the foot. Sure they could do it... but even if they removed it now they could add it in later. People want guarantees now like somehow that means for ever and ever it'll always be that way. :)
---
I sure hope so.
---
wait... what?
---
Sounds like a scraped/unfinished feature then. The Google Store entry lists it as "take pictures and videos", so as far as I know it could only use the camera while unlocked. 
---
I don't see a reason to use the camera to collect data when they already have so many other vectors to collect data.
---
Alexensual is just freaking out over nothing as always. Not new. They haven't said they're going to add tokens to Classic, and we have no reason to believe they will.
---
Lines of code in the CDN that we're not meant to 'offically' have access to mean nothing.
---
Apex style. I like it.
---
Yes... it took a tune down before it could happen as well
---
&gt; At first I was kind of scared that going on a Private Server would "disenchant" my rose-colored glasses prematurely, but gladly the opposite happened. Classic is 100% for me.
---
Had the same thing. I went in reluctantly, fearing I'd get burned out, but instead I just got more hyped than before.
---
I attempt to catch it and end up spill the boiling hot stew all over me, giving me first degree burns all over my body. What a tasty way to die
---
It makes me sad that as a priest I could *technically* wield it, but will never be able to.
---
You’re a pussy
---
Shooters and MMOs aren't even the same demographic and there's not really even MMOs making use of changes in technology, so that's not a very fair comparison. It's nothing to do with "new game genres just being way better for current tech."
---
MMOs haven't really innovated or changed significantly in well over a decade, and all follow basically the same formula of EQ1 with nothing new and other alternative formulas being forgotten, like UO's, even when there would be a niche interested in them that is not interested in yet another WoW clone.
---
In addition the demographics of gamers are way different today and there's few people willing to put the time and effort into an MMO when they could have action and a large world in bite sized, more instantly gratifying quick matches of say, a Battle Royale.

Don't do it, you will hurt yourself.

HI, I'M WONDERING IF THERE IS AN ATLAS FOR WOW THAT I COULD USE FROM A WEB BROWSER INSTEAD OF HAVING TO INSTALL THE GAME? IN PARTICULAR I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO EASILY VIEW WHAT BOSSES ARE IN A DUNGEON, AND WHAT ITEMS THEY DROP. ATLAS ADDON WAS PERFECT FOR THIS. IT ALSO WAS GREAT FOR SHOWING WHAT ITEMS YOU GET FROM REPUTATIONS, AND FROM PROFESSION SPECIALISATIONS.
---
 I HAVEN'T FOUND SUCH A DATABASE THAT SHOWS THEM AS LISTS (I WOULD HAVE TO KNOW ALREADY AND INDIVIDUALLY SEARCH FOR THE ITEMS).
---
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP IN ADVANCE!

I'd like to meet up with some cool people and make it through MC and BWL for sure.  If I like the group of people I will stay for AQ and Naxx, but through BWL really appeals to me.
---
Would like to see how far I can get in PvP.  Would love to get to rank 13 again, or even 14 this time around but I doubt I will be able to put that much into it.  Be level 60 by Phase 2 so I can go hog wild with the world pvp.
---
Every top private server for the past few years have had pretty much 0 custom content, wtf are you talking about.
---
Have you even played a private server in the past 10 years?

Im going to use retail wow to pay for wow tokens to play classic for free. I'm a pretty good retail goldmaker, but that's all I really do on wow bfa.
---
&gt; The exact value of hit should be about the same as a crit.
---
Spell hit is better than spell crit until hit cap.  Spells have two rolls in series: the first roll is for hit chance, and the second roll is for crit chance.  If you can't hit the boss, you can't crit.  Even with 100% crit chance, if you have no added spell hit through gear or talents only 83% of your spells will crit because the other 17% are missing.
---
If you want the full WoW experience you should ALWAYS play on PvP server.
---
WELL HELLO THERE, THAT IS A FINE IDEA SIR. I HOPE SOMEONE KNOWNS SOME SITE OF THAT SORT
---
DID SOMEONE SAY!!!
---
I would disagree. The extra mana is definitely worth it.
---
Hahaha this is brilliant!!! 😂😂😂😂👍
---
just curious, what class are you playing?
---
But there's a chance that it gets very unbalanced towards one faction, I want to avoid that as much as I can really
---
I got 4 words for ya
---
Black Qiraji Battle Tank
---
ye the point is to have fun and you gotta maximize your fun
---
To answer your bonus question: Rank 1 Chain Heal is your most efficient spell, by far, especially once you get a decent amount of bonus healing. If you're trying to do as much healing as you can using the least amount of mana, then it's the only spell you will ever cast. That means raid assignments usually look like this:
---
Druids - Tank healers
---
Shaman - Raid healers
---
Priests - Tank and raid healers
---
Resto Shaman have access to Healing Way, which makes them passable tank healers. You will put out less overall healing with Healing Wave than a Shaman who is using Chain Heal. And you don't have the safety cushions that Druids and Priests have (HoTs + shield). But if you ever need to step in and heal the tanks, then Healing Wave is what you cast.
---
Second account camped at the AH 24/7 wins.
---
No one cares.
---
There's still a demand for RTS and their great years don't have to be over, but most into the genre have given up and moved on because no one is interested in appealing to us, and when multiplayer gaming today revolves around microtransactions and infinitely exploitable broadly appealing IPs, the most technically demanding and hardest to play genre that only suffers from microtransactions and exploitation is forgotten. Too expensive to make and maintain for not enough profit, even when they were extremely popular back in the day.
---
DotA clones have largely replaced RTS, because they're easier to play and understand and you only have to control and micro one unit. The attitude in WC3 ladder was DotA was what all the people not good enough to play ladder played, ironically that's why it's far more successful.
---
There's still a lot of people into RTS, though. Just no RTS for us to play. The only game that's at all active is SC2, which is made to be an eSport first and fun game second (the focus on eSports being no doubt a huge reason why a lot of people no longer play RTS — they no longer have casual appeal, no focus on team games and team games have arranged team vs random team matches, no ranked FFA, and the games are made for &lt;1% of their players), and most (former) WC3 players will not even touch it with it lacking a lot of the appeal even Brood War had.
---
Yeah there's usually at least one thing off about these videos but this one seems spot on, which is bad because a lot of people will use it
---
Stopped a long while back.  Starving myself of vanilla.
---
wAiT, wHaT?
---
This looks different than in the first video
---
Yeah dude yikes. Overwatch is intensely toxic. I always mute everyone in chat and voice. Thats what you have to do...
---
Sc,ig,and twitter are arguably far better on mobile(sc is mobile only) I can understand only keeping discord on pc since it can cause alot of notifs
---
Try Wowhead
---
I don't need the links, it's memorised in my head
---
No one knew they were BiS in vanilla. Theorycrafting hadn't started yet.
---
Pretty sure if that's your ambition you can live your entire life with 1 million only playing wow
---
AQ20 &amp; ZG
---
A good frost mage will make things look easy.
---
Pointing out that a raid doesn't need a specific composition to be successful is not the same as telling you to bring a different raid composition, but you do you.
---
Yeah but I’m playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure...
---
gotta admit Horde NPC's have the better greetings but maybe that's just because when I hear LOK'TAR I immediately think of Chris Metzen saying it from Warcraft 3 as Thrall

What? Playing that South Park video instead of a horrible movie? Sure, it's a good episode, but nothing to get that excited about.
---
Just no.
---
Every bot needs to be banned from reddit
---
Do you know of a server called project 1999?
---
Been around for years. Makes WoW classic look like a mobile game in difficulty.
---
If a casual can do it there they cam do it 20 times over in wow.
---
Be wary if you have a rogue as a guild leader.
---
I know a handful of families with kids 16 and under, and none of them have gaming PCs for the kids. My daughter will rarely play on my ex-wife's
---
Seems like a big problem for any game similar to WOW.
---
Maybe, and I'm gonna go on a limb here, he should play whatever he wants to play.
---
You mean literally a 2nd account entirely?
---
Well, getting handed legendary items left and right *does* tend to dampen the experience somewhat. But back then? Orange was something unobtainable for mere mortals.
---
Seconded. Shaman don't outlast anyone. They burst. But Resto doesn't have any burst damage.
---
That said, Shaman of any spec have a ridiculous toolkit in PvP and are very strong 1v1. You still beat everything that you would beat as Elemental except for Paladins. The matchup with Mages would be harder as well, simply because you have to cast more spells to beat them and you're dead if you ever eat a Counterspell.
---
Thank you 👍
---
Show the damn results...
---
not even gonna read any of this shit, gg retard keep wasting your energy
---
o wait youre worthless so its not like you need do anything else anyways smiley face ecks dee sparkling heart
---
My long term goal is to get full BIS shockadin gear on my paladin and drop  [meteors](https://classicdb.ch/?item=21891) on people.
---
wait why did you even personal message me LMAO why all those reddit retards are like that rofl. its so fucking sad and funny at the same time
---
You are the only one being sensitive here just because nobody believes your shit without asking questions
---
you're forgetting about all the kids who only care that it's free. *tons* of them will continue playing on pservers considering there's no sub or initial cost, along with the hardcore nochange crowd who will stay as well. they will probably be enough to populate a few pservers but it won't be as spread out as it is now.
---
ill just go ahead and block you i dont need any of this autism thank you very much
---
Thunderfury on my Mage
---
The meme is that the name is very long so people would find any reason to use the name frequently in chat to fill up the chat
---
It's kind of hard to say. The knowledge is "contaminated" with a decade's worth of private server information, and we don't really know how much of it applies to Classic. Farming is all about loot tables and drop rates, and it's believed that private servers mostly made these up. Until we can try it, there's no way of knowing if the Dire Maul farming spots are worthwhile, for instance.
---
For what it's worth, I have no recollection of anyone solo-farming Dire Maul, Maraudon or BRD back in retail vanilla. Odds are that some of these just weren't known, but it could just as well be that these farming spots weren't possible or worthwhile. Sometimes it's down to a single mob's pathing.
---
Back then, people farmed Tyr's Hand in EPL, satyrs in Felwood and Azshara, and elementals for crafting mats and vendor trash. I mained a rogue and there was no talk of pickpocketing for profit. I remember doing it for fun now and then, and there wasn't really any money in it. It's hugely profitable on some pservers, though, leading me to believe that there could be all kinds of other inconsistencies.
---
Nah nah, i want my million and play like the pleb i am.
---
It can help the hunger, he just needs to supplement minerals
---
Really? Im not even being malicious or pretentious here. But really? Other than not getting what her character's supposed to be (evil undead-but-not-undead or misunderstood leader of a faction that wasn't really meant to be part of the Horde?), her voice actress was either swapped or the autotune-settings were changed, for her voice in the last couple of expansions has this bizarro nasal tone that just... doesn't work.
---
Thanks for this post down here. I couldn't hear you up above. Upvoted for senior citizen accommodation.
---
It did and it was absolutely fantastic.
---
I thought the same thing.  I would literally buy a fucking $40 phone from BestBuy with none of my information or contacts or credit card number on it if I was going to Blizzcon and then throw that thing in the trash the day I fly out of Anaheim
---
Viable in amazing gear.  Not optimal in anyway.  It CAN work.  It just relies on having even more gear than would be required to be as effective as arms.
---
the biggest private servers are the blizzlike ones trying to emulate exactly how wow expacs/vanilla progressed back then.
---
The battle at the Wrath Gate was great and it didn't even have this level of CGI (iirc, it was rendered with in-game models, but with better animation). And it made more sense.
---
Anal [Purge]
---
Yeah I can't say I disagree.
---
I can tell you that twinstarz is probably going to be the best for this. Classicdb.ch has a pretty good database but it's allocation of items to bosses is crap. Same with listing bosses in the dungeon, also crap.  
---
Wowhead has done a pretty good job at listing bosses in the dungeon, but you can tell they're still working on it because some instances are incomplete.  
---
[Twinstarz](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/), ignoring how crap their servers are, have the most complete database I've ever seen. Based on the amount of time I've spent with the raw data that ClassicDB uses, I can tell that Twinstarz has attempted to go through their data line by line.  
---
Real shame their servers are junk.
---
Cool. All I could think, when I saw that trailer, was how bitter that pill must have been for Blizzard to swallow.
---
Hello!
---
I'm playing classic with a bunch of friends who are probably best described as 'semi-casual'. They're mechanically skilled, played wow for 10+ years and do a lot of research and theory crafting but won't actually push into the end game very far.
---
I'm trying to find a class that will be a good mix of engaging solo play and fill the needs of our team (healer shortage).
---
I'm primarily going to be leveling in a pair with a warrior. I'm thinking about Paladin but I've been warned they're really not what you'd expect in vanilla. End up wearing cloth and being a 1 button heal bot which doesn't sound super fun. I'm also interested in Druid, but i've been warned that they're, again, one button heal bots in group play at 60.
---
The group will be on Alliance and already has a rogue, mage and warrior. The lads will be focusing on arena pvp and dungeon instances without a real eye for raids at this stage. 
---
What are some important considerations in deciding team compositions?
---
remember suicide and school shootings aren't the only way out! even if your life is as worthless as it is now there are always other ways!
---
What about people who dont have phones?
---
I belive the #1 vanilla farm spot was Tyr's Hand due to its wast amount of cloth drops. There were/will be other sites depending on the exact material you are intending to farm. The other most profitable things to farm being among others essences (some more expensive than others) and speciality nasty farms like Larval acid. Essences are single rare drops, NOT combinable fragments. They were farmable at about 1 per hour with a decent character spending all the time camping a set of mobs effectively. Longer if there are more people farming the same mobs....
---
If I do go classic, I will roll a different class spectype and DEFINITELY a different set of profs.
---
Maybe we will get some actual good remakes of other games if WoW Classic and WC3 reforged go well.
---
I am praying for a remake of Dungeon Keeper 1 and 2... oh and also original C&amp;C yep!
---
The community is toxic, but not for the reasons you mentioned.
---
Debris pools. You get all sorts of goodies, and if you start early, once people start dinging 60 and working on profs, you can sell all the Mageweave and Runecloth bolts you get for a pretty good amount. Also any extra journeyman/Traveller's packs. And any greens/blues worth using.
---
All the alchemy fish sell pretty well, especially stonescale eel. And the end-game buff food fishes are worth quite a bit.
---
Deviate Delight is a bit of a long term thing, since it most comes once people are established.
---
So we should give up all of our privacy and personal info because terrorists exist? That sounds like a terrible idea. Bad people exist and always will exist. It sucks. But I don't want some random company taking and selling my personal info because some guy killed some people.
---
If the info was ONLY taken for security reasons, I could *maybe* be on board. This company *sells* the personal info it gathers on you, though. How is selling my personal info to strangers protecting me?
---
I find it disturbing how some people in this thread say that they have just logged out, or are planning to do so, and just wait for their characters to be booted from their current guilds for inactivity.
---
Switching to Classic, leaving for another guild, quitting due to IRL schedules or whatever is always fine, but the very least you can do is to inform the people who are leading your respective guilds. Just disappearing without notice is such a dick move. 
---
Remember the characters you see in-game are controlled by actual human beings who put a lot of time and effort into managing a guild for YOU to raid and/or have fun in.
---
Honestly, people are giving the attention span of kids way less credit than they deserve. PUBG was THE game just a few years ago. That game is not fast paced by any stretch of the imagination, certainly not by shooter games standards.
---
I think when a game with the right formula comes along, it'll be successful, but nothing like WoW. WoW was like the Beatles. It was a cultural phenomenon. You can't recreate that new cultural wave in the same genre again. It's like when you've heard the Beatles, another legendary band like the Rolling Stones doesn't sound revolutionary anymore. Same WoW. You can create a better game, but you can't create that same cultural impact.
---
Your main issues as a shadow priest is keeping your mana up throughout the whole fight.  If you run out of mana and the boss is at 20% health, then you wand the rest of the time.  If you can keep you mana up, then shadow priests can do good dps.  Not great necessarily, but solid and you provide increased damage to the warlocks.
---
Expect to bring a lot of mana consumables to raids.  You'll need to use major mana potions on cooldown as well as mana regen food and other stuff that is out there.
---
It means that they are taking more control of your phone and info than needed. Why would they want to do that? Is there a reason why I shouldn't be asking why they need things?
---
Oh you knew that for sure? Thought this was another random commenter.
---
Even so, I stand by my comment as a generality.
---
He said during vanilla, not on private servers 10 years later.
---
They aren't the target audience I guess. Blizzard is becoming a mobile developer.
---
Low settings but probably.
---
Interesting. Why did you choose level 45? Spells rank up at different times and I thought I remembered that the grinding speeds even out a bit over most of the leveling process if you account for the jumps in damage that the spells make.
---
Blizzard is making a lot of questionable decisions.
---
I fully expect them to add boosts or tokens in to classic at some point
---
So you find out which Mage got the ignite going and PI them? Or is it too late at that point, do you have to PI the mage while he's casting the ignite for it to count?  And hope that is the right mage? 
---
Just curious really.
---
that's what's the real big shot hardcore auction housers do. play/gather merchandise on one account, auctionhouse wheel and deal at the same time on another.
---
Qixel, i ask of you to consider a single hardcore community of *any* game, tv show, music artist, *anything* that is not completely awful?
---
Hardcore fans are always the worst of the worst, they were perfectly made fun of in the Simpsons with the Comic Book Guy as being socially awkward dweebs. This is always the case with anything.
---
Stay away from hardcore communities in general, in regards to everything. There are Star Wars fans now bitching about the color of a belt, these people are painfully autistic and incapable of human interaction.
---
I don't think they'll reveal the next expansion until 2020. Reason for that being, Blizz said in a Q &amp; A that after the Azshara raid we would know who the final boss of the expansion is. Since that is going to drop in the next month or so, we'll have yet another content drought until Blizzcon 2019 where they announce 8.3 and the N'zoth raid (as that should be the final boss, I can't see it being anyone else).
---
in this case it would probably be available to both from the start. Since the content exists in the beginning, it just changed, so it would be in it's 1.12 form.
---
Though she might still be in Orgrimmar until phase 4, making it basically impossible for alliance to get the jujus, even if she's friendly and offers quests.
---
If the app doesn't function without the permissions, you could try to spoof the data being fed with tools for (rooted) Android. Of course, this is only an option for power users.
---
Holy shit I had idea they were doing a sequel to that game.
---
Lucky you, my first ever boe epic trade ended being trade window scammed...
---
What's so special about rank 11?
---
From memory (haven't played any vanilla private servers), ST wasn't so bad once you understood the layout. I did regular runs of ST. Ulda and BRD on the other hand ... never understood them.
---
Care to share his vids somehow?
---
I could tell, but then the devilsaur mafia would have to kill you
---
Fuck that sounds fun and has thrown a spanner in my plan to play priest.
---
Live to win!
---
those gorillas are as good as DEAD
---
I still want sc ghost...
---
My favorite ST memory was diving into it for the warlock questline that eventually rewarded that badass scythe. The tank left 75% in before I could get the quest item, but I void tanked the rest of the way and the other party members stuck with me til the end. Heroes through and through
---
Kids dont play vanilla wow...
---
Seriously, i dont even put this much effort into my job, and i have peoples lives on the line.
---
I want to experience Classic in a more permanent setting.  On pservers there is the hype train - a huge initial population and then a steady decline.  So Number 1 - I want to experience Classic on a server with a stable population or a population that actually grows over time.
---
Number 2 - I want Blizzard to see the success of progression servers and continue with the trend.  I want them to keep the Classic servers permanently (as they have stated).  I want them to release TBC servers after a good long time in Naxx (and then maybe WotLK).  I want them to release Classic-style servers than contain new content more in the keeping with Vanilla (like OSRS is doing).  Basically we need to all ensure that Classic is a huge success so they have a financial reason to provide us with quality content.
---
Unless youre alliance.  Then everything is wrong.
---
Same.
---
The n-word was made to be spammed, there's too many people in that game who deserve the title. I'm talking about noob, of course.
---
Cool story man, not even joking.
---
They’ll eat muscle at the same rate the different is that a fit person has much more muscle to consume.
---
Fasting diet are extremely risky for overweight people because they are much more likely to damage their hearts.
---
Fat people will die first in every situation :)
---
Elemental Shaman damage is actually good against non-boss mobs, but bad against anything that's a raid boss. You are probably more useful as Elemental than Resto as long as you're not raiding.
---
If you raid... yeah, you need to heal.
---
I'm looking forward to trying it for the first time but I do believe people will look more like clowns regarding armor. No one will match.
---
Selling poopsocks - bulk rate available.  PM me for more information.
---
auction house is gonna be all over the place at release. after some time, it will settle down a bit.
---
fun fact: worthless gear (in terms of stats) will sell for much,much more on the auction house on a RP server. there will be no transmog, so RPers need to have the actual item to wear it as part of their RP costume. check the AH before you vendor that "worthless" green, common, or grey armor!
---
Is there anyone working on something akin to Oasis? I mean we have VRChat as a nice base all it needs is realistic graphics.
---
100% world completion  
---
rank 14  
---
and  
---
Thunderfury.  
---
Everything else is bonus
---
no murloc eye???
---
You should be fine, honestly.
---
Get her addicted to farming like my wife.
---
so far we have  over a thousand responses. I was hoping to get to a server cap about 2000 
---
if  I get there next Tuesday I may be showing all the results.  So far it is pretty balanced
---
I am almost there with ya.
---
16 July confirmed
---
As a gesture of some odd thing or another some god of some thing from somewhere has deemed your pathetic roll a travesty and with one simple nudge of angelic stuff and things the die seems to have become a natural 20!
---
Thats valid. Maybe if there are a lot of suggestions I will make a MkIII after we look at the results :D
---
just one more reason for me to stay home
---
Better toxic then braindead
---
Server pop is a massive contributor to inflated value like that. The more players there are the more raw gold is created, and the more people competing to purchase the same items.  Things won't have as much gold value as they do on private servers.
---
I was also going to just post the results here and on the classic forums. Exactly as I did on the previous one.
---
I have seen all of them being said unironically. However its clearly a not-even-very-vocal minority, so the post IS kinda dumb.
---
eh, it was average. 
---
Its worth watching as a fan. But you can tell it was kinda rushed. you needed maybe a trilogy to tell the story properly
---
That's just awesome!
---
rank 10 unlock the full blue pvp set and rank 11 unlocks the black pvp mounts.
---
Rank10 is doable, but 11 might be too much of a grind without constant premades so i dont get my hopes up. That raptor mount is bae tho &lt;3
---
Hi, /u/poinifie
---
If you are using steppenwolf's simulation sheet from fight club the members there who are involved in its development are who convinced me to use strength I don't think that sheet accurately models windfury clipping but I maybe wrong let me know if you know something different.
---
I guess the small post on character caps counted as Blizzard internal blue post quota.
---
When I leveled 9n private servers I would actively search out sets that matched for about 10 levels. Cool off hand items like lanterns and spooky orbs, wizard hats, all that. Who cares what you have on for the first 40 levels, look good feel good!
---
I like what you did here.
---
The good thing about BWL is that it's a short raid. If you know the bosses you can finish the place in a single night comfortably.
---
personally, if I'm leaving a guild in a game, or will be away for some time, I try to be courteous and let the people in the guild know what the deal is. 
---
that said, good Guildmasters should understand and even anticipate that people are going to leave the guild/quit playing the game. often without notice. getting mad about it is pointless. unless you have a guild with family or IRL friends, its just some dude/dudette on the internet. even if you thought you knew them, you didn't really know them. maybe if they left without notice, they didn't feel comfortable sharing with the guild the reasons why.
---
Assuming someone updates Theorycraft for the new API or makes an new addon like it, you can have it automatically convert values for you, if you dislike having to memorize which class gets what stat conversions.
---
#WELL HELLO THERE, THAT IS A FINE IDEA SIR. I HOPE SOMEONE KNOWNS SOME SITE OF THAT SORT
---
Is anyone else scared Classic won’t have enough gold sinks? After everyone starts getting their epic mounts and gear, a large majority of players are going to start hoarding large amounts of gold with nothing to really spend it on. I’m scared it’s going to completely fuck up the economy. Does anyone have any experience with this in pservers?
---
Didn’t know this, thank you!
---
If you want an engaging healing experience, Priest.
---
If you want an easy healing experience and to be very tanky in PvP, Paladin.
---
If you want the healer with the best solo experience, easiest leveling and potential to tank dungeons as well, Druid.
---
Arenas aren’t in classic lol unless you mean bgs or gurubashi/dm ffa wpvp for some reason
---
I mean, many of these changes were great and would never have broken with what Classic was. Dual talent being the prime example, as it improved the game for healers and tanks but otherwise didn't really do anything.
---
Hey!
---
I'm glad you're interested in playing! We're in a pretty similar boat. Way back when, I cleared AQ40, but at this point, I'm looking for something much more casual. Leveling as a group is great. In a group that large, you might not even *need* a healer outside of the harder group quests. It would definitely be the easier if you played a healer though.
---
As for PvP, Arena didn't exist in Pre-TBC, so your options are WSG, AV, AB, and world PvP. PvP synergy is pretty preferential. Warriors struggle with CC, so having a Paladin healer for Blessing of Freedom is great. Pick whatever class you have the most fun with, and it'll work in a semi-casual group PvP setting. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTrVgogA6kU) goes over some strengths, weaknesses, and general roles of each class in a premade BG environment.
---
Paladin buffs are some of the best in the game. Blessing of Protection and Blessing of Freedom both synergize well with Mage and Warrior respectively. Paladins are pretty bulky, so that helps.
---
Druids are very mobile. Very hard to kill. Very good at healing and CCing on the move. They don't deal very much damage, but they just have a lot of utility.
---
Priests are pretty frail, but have lots of different ways of healing. Between Heal / Greater Heal / Flash Heal casts, Renew, Power Word: Shield, etc., you have a ton of options. You also have a lot of non-healing benefits to provide to your group. Dwarf Priests get Fear Ward (30 second CD, 10 minute duration, so you can buff your whole group at the same time). You can dispel your teammates' debuffs and dispel your opponent's buffs to help your team. Priests, Hunters, and Warlocks are also able to use mana burn to target enemy healers. This is a huge benefit that no other healing class has. With [this build](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsAioobhtsc), you have access to Power Infusion's +20% spell damage buff, which does wonders when combined with the Mage in your group, especially if your Mage has trinkets or cooldowns to pop.

The biggest private server is basically a 1:1 recreation of vanilla
---
It's really not.  First right is basement.  Clear it for the drop down.  Take the 2nd path to the right.  Go up the stairs and folllw it arouns the ring clearing statue areas.  Return to staircase accessed from 2nd right from entrance (when facing into the dungeon ) and clear that ring.  Do serpent statues / quest garbage if need be.  
---
Return to entrance and take third from right and go upstairs to the guardian ring.  Go around circle and clear guardian ring.  Go back to entrance and take far left.  Clear entire bottom ring of trash, including the trash in eranikus wing saving jammal'an for last.  Do hakkar, do jammal an.  Do drakes.  Do eranikus.  Y'all cowards don't even smoke crack.
---
I think a vast majority of players will be new and never played classic before
---
Sadly it's only got worse over time. In the early days it was 70/30 good games to bad games. Now it's the other way around at best.
---
pretty good actually
---
Are they still the best class on the alliance side?
---
I just love having a friendly dual on a zeppelin, as it's pulling out of either org/UC. MC the victim and run them off the zep. 
---
You get a lot of lols from the people around you, but you make an enemy for life from the guy who has to wait another 5 mins and do a corpse run. Tehe.
---
Hmm good heads up. I love doing 5 man's, maybe it is better to just do them as much as possible and accept whatever items happens to drop.
---
Yup. I made about 25 million in the first few months of BFA. It's fun. And with a second account, minimal time taken away from my main.
---
Yeah the PvP part is essentially a separate game. Allowed the idiots to go and kill each other in the Moors while the rest of us were mostly civil.
---
If you don't have 11 minutes to find out what grinding spot he is talking about you can skip to 4 minutes and then stop watching after 12 seconds.
---
OR read this comprehensive TL;DR that I have prepared for you:
---
1. Go to Silithus
---
2. Kill Sand Skitterer and Stonelash Scorpids.
---
I know the feeling. I will probably do warrior and hate/love every minute of it :D
---
K, ill give you gold if they release during Summer. If they don't and have beta access included with Blizzcon this year you give me Reddit gold.
---
It’s insanely toxic on pservers. Hope it’s different in classic where people’s reputation is on the line
---
&gt;Shaman vs Shaman is a 50/50 because a Shaman can only win if another Shaman loses
---
Yep thats how things work
---
Had a giggle at this
---
Also, as a wise man said once "times change"
---
Not sure if it'll be in classic but Opie is the single greatest add-on for hotkeys that don't require millisecond accuracy.
---
According to the book, Azeroth is in the Oasis in Ready Player One! Always knew that’s where I’d spend all my time
---
ST is, but maras in the 40s. Plus, there aren’t any worms in SM, RFD, Uldaman, or ZF.
---
No real reason. Around lvl 20-30 a lot can change depending on spell rank/weapon/talent unlock. 45 seems like a good point at which you have the meat of your spec and the gear and spell upgrades slow down enough that a test is a good average spec abilities.   
---
It’s showed some interesting things people don’t talk about much - like being able to stop mobs running away is really important do keeping a good kill rate. So is being able to handle 2 mobs at once. Rogue/warrior aren’t super slow as long as you have a stack of bandages and food. The other specs are generally pretty close- the range is only about 30% between slowest and fastest (excluding mage aoe that is absurd given the perfect situation).
---
Frost has a video on this, some very handy tips in it for how to make gold with Fishing. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhSapeZHaVA&amp;t=49s
---
I don't dislike having to memorize, in fact I would prefer it. I just don't get it in the first place!
---
Don’t say Classic and Tool are coming out near the same time. That means Classic is never coming out. All jokes aside, I hope to be blasting Tool along with Devin and Periphery this summer, from 1-60.
---
They're still good but you definitely gotta get used to using other forms of CC from Engineering.
---
I'm looking at rogue and mage here primarily. I know Edgemaster's arent an item for either of them, just an item I didnt really understand.
---
Because those players who want TBC expansion started there and that's just what they know.
---
For the record TBC was the reason I quit playing so to each their own.
---
&gt;Judas Priest 
---
&gt;Paladin

Thanks for this, super informative!

---
[teslasuit.io](https://teslasuit.io) has the suit covered idk about the actual Oasis
---
Realistic goal: full blue pvp set w/Unstoppable force on my ret paladin. 
---
Long-term dream: Full AQ set and Hand of Rag.
---
Where did I ever say that a raid needs a specific composition?!?
---
I've even told you that you can clear raids with 20 people in a different comment.
---
If I want to bring 30+ fury warriors to my raid and I can find enough brave people to do it with, you can bet your ass I'm going to do it.
---
If you want to be a rogue tank or w/e and you can find enough people willing to put up with that, then more power to you!
---
But if you try to come to my 30+ fury warrior raid and get declined for not being a mighty warrior, please don't come to the forums and whine about how everyone is toxic and not accepting of your class/spec choice.
---
Again, no one can tell you what to play, if you want to be a rogue tank, then do it, ignore the haters and prove everyone wrong!
---
But ***you are not entitled to a spot in any group***. I don't care if you're a rogue tank or the best player ever, if I do not want you in my raid, you are not getting invited, regardless of our ability to finish the raid.
---
Were those the epic mounts? Didn't they still cost full price? Grinding the money AND the honour... God damn.
---
responsible adults don't break the law, and don't waste time typing an entire novel to justify their law breaking, and then accuse any reply to the contrary of childish screeching when they just childishly screeched for 10+ paragraphs ;)
---
All I want is the ZG tiger mount.
---
Personally I think that going into classic without a group is a more interesting adventure.
---
i'm mostly a nochanges person but i will admit that second image looks wonderful
---
I agree with most of your bad points.  
---
I would also add the inclusion of daily quests to your BAD list.
---
I really like a lot of TBC content, and I actually like the LFG tool (not the auto grouping tool, just the bulletin board thing).
---
I think the raids in TBC were amazing. 
---
I would like personally if they implemented an "alternate" TBC leaving all the things I think are bad out and trying to make it more like vanilla but with the TBC content.
---
The viability of almost all (if not all) specs of all classes. It was overall a more balanced game. Though the flying mount and summoning stones together was a bridge too far.
---
I see what you've done and you had me for the first half.   
---
Thanks for this.
---
respec costs are an incredible gold sink
---
So are you rolling Larenthar the Holy Pally in Classic?
---
Oasis, as in the VR world where anyone can create anything and be anything?
---
Not by a long-shot. That world is essentially a literal universe simulation. 
---
The VR tech though? Sure.   
---
I don't know about the movie, but the book describes how the equipment varies from googles and gloves to full body suits and treadmills.
---
Because it's also a rad game. Character progression in vanilla is excellent, character progression in TBC takes it even further (especially during the first half of the expansion).
---
The raids are fun and challenging. Arena at that point was legitimately a great addition to PvP. Heroic dungeons were challenging and rewarding 5 man content. Karazhan.
---
no.
---
I'm surprised it was even in color.
---
That's what I mean. Sorry if that wasn't clear. I've just personally ran in to a lot more cancerous garbage on that sub than this.
---
Some people also get 'instinctual' urges to rape, murder or steal from others which from an animalistic point of view is fine, but not if you're going to be a functional member of society. Some people commit these crimes anyway because they don't believe it makes them bad. 
---
I'm not saying that polyamory is bad or equivalent to a crime, but it is someone's sexual beliefs and not everyone has or wants to follow through with those urges. I guess asexuals are demented based on your logic. People have different sexualities and I don't understand why you are forcing yours onto others. Personally, the thought of having more than one sexual partner makes me want to vomit.
---
&gt; Just like I cannot tell you what/how to play, you cannot tell me who to bring to my raids
---
I don't think we're disagreeing. I don't understand why you think that if I play an off meta build, that means I demand a spot in a raid. There are groups that take off meta builds, there are groups that want to set a clear time record, there are groups that wanna bring all priests. None of them are wrong, and none of them need to invite anyone they don't want to. If anyone insists that they deserve a spot for whatever reason, they are both wrong and an asshole.
---
My problem has and continues to be the general atmosphere of 'There is only one correct playstyle', because that drives potential players away. If you didn't want those players in your group, cool, doesn't affect you. But I wouldn't have minded those players in my group, and telling them that *no one* will take them deprives me of potential groupmates. 
---
You and I will likely never be in a group together. That's cool, we got different brands of fun. I just want people to stop abusing people for having a different playstyle.
---
Because the bad points you listed hardly have any weight in comparison to the good points...
---
Linear dungeons was a god send compared to some of the ones in Vanilla especially because those dungeons had to be farmed to get heroic keys.
---
Flying being bad but it was a milestone and awesome to have and then to be forced to use that to reach new dungeons was magnificent.
---
Smaller world due to flying? Not technically as important as having good raids and content to do...
---
I would pay to see this.  
---
Cocaine and hookers all around!
---
Why do you think they put pillars in? Arena would be hilariously stupid if there was no way to kite/los. It would just be a tunnel fest.
---
It seems more like VRChat considering they use portals to get around. Its not an open world game IIRC
---
Hahaha
---
1 night a week will depend on how much time you devote to raiding.  
---
You will definitely be able to do either MC, or ZG.
---
AQ20 and BWL probably.
---
The main issue with raiding once per week is gear progression.  With 2 nights a week you can do say, MC and ZG or MC and BWL meaning more people gear up faster.
---
With one night a week it just limits how soon you can get into say BWL or something because getting gear will take so much longer.
---
The quality is so bad it looks like a different game
---
That would be so rad. Could you imagine the stoke/mayhem if a new event started after guilds had been working through Naxx? If this community loses their minds over ever blue post regarding classic info, I bet a new content release within classic would cause complete pandemonium...
---
torn between warlock with atiesh and shaman with hand of rag.
---
Wow this is giving me alot haha.
---
I think the issue is that you are on the wrong subreddit for this type o discussion. This thread is about OP experiencing pain from a now ex partner and coping with it through WoW.
---
Yup.  They've got the hooks/metrics in place now.  If large sums of gold are moving between accounts, flag it, ban them.  Ban the seller, and the buyer.  But.. they probably wont.  The more we complain about gold inflation, the closer they get to reintroducing WoW tokens to Classic.
---
I often get asked how far a Casual player should expect to get in Classic's gameplay. In this video, I break down just how far a casual player who plays only 5-10 hours a week can reach in Classic WoW. 
---
Spoiler Alert: Pretty damn far all things considered.
---
Yes of course
---
Gloves from cthun is better than edgemaster
---
I always play the Euro Jackpot when the price pool is maxed out like it is now.
---
I see your point and I think you're right that the builds really don't start to diverge until the 40s so that makes the most sense as a starting place to compare them. The ability to handle multiple mobs easier is really the place where shadow steps away from holy. As smite-spec, I can kill a long line of individual mobs nearly as fast as shadow, but as soon as a second mob shows up the differences become really apparent. Holy priest almost certainly won't die to multiple mobs, but they'll take much longer to kill than shadow. 
---
For me, I just like the holy aesthetic. I'm rolling a warlock as my alt for the shadow side.
---
Looks ugly
---
yeah we just can hope. But i guess our life was not destined to win this shit.
---
"11 auctions @ 29g "
---
2005 these were pieces of shit.
---
Most warlocks will roll horde because of the fear of WotF. Hence there will be less fearing classes for a horde rogue to worry about.
---
No swords for priests in vanilla.
---
We'll stay in the forest. Killing boars.
---
The price pool just maxed out when no one won last Friday so I didn't play. Next Friday I'll totally be a millionaire...
---
Classic had better gold sinks than any later wow iteration.
---
Repair costs were real in classic.  Respec costs were incredibly high (50g when maxed).
---
DO NOT INSTALL THIS, They will keep your CREDIT CARD NUMBER AND OTHER invaluable information from you! they will sell your information or even giveaway!
---
&gt; telling them that no one will take them
---
I agree that people can be a bit extreme with their explanations.
---
But there is a reason for that. If you do try to go for something as meme as a rogue tank, you will have a VERY hard time finding groups, even among rets, boomkins and other meme specs.  
---
It has nothing to do with people being toxic, it's about the fact that people had 15 years to figure out what works and what doesn't.
---
It's not so much to discourage people from playing certain specs, but to warn them that they will have an uphill battle, especially if they don't want to be stuck in a guild that wipes for 2+ hours in MC. And let's be honest, most do not want to be that type of a guild.
---
.... MAAAAAHHHHH!
---
If that many come, I'll be so happy.
---
Can we combine the two? I would like to play classic via VR.
---
Yeah I'll be Alch so farming a ton if stuff for Mana Pots is anticipated and planned, as well as Fisuing+Cooking for the best mp5 food I can get between each raid
---
Need to watch that episode again.
---
Yeah it really isn't, but it's better than a healer.
---
Solid video man!
---
Kind of makes me think there might only be 1 expac past bfa.
---
Lordy... someone's woken on the wrong side of the bed.
---
What I'm really excited for is the first Deadmines run with me and my friends a day or so after classic launches. Long dungeons have always been my favourite in WoW which is where classic shines for me.
---
Here comes barren chat
---
Try Gnomer
---
Been watching more of your videos as of recent.
---
Super excited to relive vanilla again, but am an adult with a kid now lol. So this will be interesting to see how far i can get....lol however my knowledge is far better than when it was 2004....so hoping that helps me keep an edge over the competition... (people who played vanilla originally know private servers do not play like retail vanilla) lol
---
Weirdly i don’t remember my first epic item.
---
https://youtu.be/vH67duada9E
---
That song is the only thing i know about dungeon keeper
---
dno if its a port or just ea using the name for a phone game tho
---
It was in the book actually, you had to have a space ship for travel and even pay for fuel. There were portals but the entire game was once instance with no loading zones iirc
---
If I’m doing Dun Morogh I’m going Dwarf, nothing like a Dwarf Hunter taming his first bear MMMM
