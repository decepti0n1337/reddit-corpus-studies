Can confirm. Detheroc was my server, and it was "VC"
---
---
---
And nature vulnerable mobs.
---
Wow even just seeing the guild names from my old server was a trip!
---
I chose faction personally.  I disliked playing on the horde and really don't want to do it.  Sadly, my friends all want to do it, so we are just going to be competing with each other in a sense.  
---

---
Bottom line is this.  There is no guarantee your friends will even stick with the game.  If they quit and you already hit max lvl... then what?  Stuck playing on the faction you didn't want to play, and still end up alone.
---
The issue is if you increase your defense rating (anticipation) you'll be crit less and less.
---
But it’s not like that even in the beta. It’s never been like this in retail. You have no source material other than an opinion in a hive mind of people who feel the same. 
---
If we wanna make outlandish claims. 
---
Half the player base probably won’t even get passed level 30 so.
---
Honestly nothing seems too interesting right now. Mainly just doing the usual Reddit/YouTube/Twitch/Discord and waiting :D
---
Rogues and Mages were not the most populated classes in Vanilla.
---
Rogues and Mages are not the most populated classes on Pservers.
---
Rogues and Mages are not the most populated classes on the Beta.
---
You "knowing 100%" is bullshit.
---
you have the option to get summoned by a warlock
---
And what is said friends quit the game in a few months and never come back?  He is then stuck on a faction he didn't want to play, and is now alone.
---
No, definitely.  No I didn't play a Warrior.  I played a GOD-MODE ENHANCE SHAMAN.  But like I said, what does your class matter in regards to making money from professions, scrubbyboi?  Herb/Alch, Mining/Jewelcrafting, Enchanting ALL made tons of gold.  Hell even with Leatherworking I was pulling in tons of gold, hell of a lot more than doing a full 25 stack of dailys (which the cap didn't increase to until the end of BC).  Even at 25 daily's that was what, 300 gold a day?  I wipe my ass with 300 gold a day in BC.  Because I'm amazing and I know how to make gold.
---
LOL
---
Server Transfer will be available at some point, but they said it won't be at launch, so probably in phase 2-3 would be my best guess.
---
It's fine to think that, but it's your opinion. But to me, TBC was a masterpiece, and better than Vanilla in almost every regard. 
---
Every single time I saw a change suggested on this subreddit, I'd see the same constant reply; "Muh slippery slope", "Just go play retail", "no changes means no changes", and "Classic is supposed to be a faithful adaptation to what Vanilla was, a museum of sorts". I actually supported those people saying that shit too
---
Sorry man, but changing what you don't like in TBC is gonna be a big fat no from me. Just stick to classic if you don't like it.
---
Oh ffs you're not entitled to every goddam experience just because its unique people
---
I don't agree with the selfish approach, but I do agree (as it happened to me) that it sucks if your friends end up leaving the game post 60, leaving you on a faction you never wanted to play on to begin with.
---
Why, because I want changes in classic?
---
maybe mods should ban for copy pasta
---
lol i bet you thought that line was so slick xD cringe
---
Sounds about right.  The biggest assholes that WoW has to offer would hold the rest of the server population for ransom.  If players can get away with murder, then they will.
---
A hardcore PvE server definitely might draw a decent following, but damn every death of a guildie would almost be like a death in the family.  Boom, they're gone.  Gotta grind all the way to 60 again, and if you die while leveling then you start AGAIN from level 1.
---
That's one hell of a harsh way to play, but some players are masochists.
---
"new"
---
Nobody called Deadmines VC back in Vanilla, it was always called DM.
---
Dire Maul was called either DM East, DM West, DM North or DM tribute. So there was no confusion between VC and DM.
---
Guess i know what i'm maining in classic :D
---
Someone should call Child Protective Services on this guy. If he's this irate about a video game, chances are good his kids deserve a better parent.
---
Kek is what an Alliance player sees when a Horde player types lol.
---
Bur is the equivalent the other way around.
---
You better start believing in circles, you're in one.
---
Yes, but we also don't know if it will be as possible with the correct values on classic either.
---
He said ding 20 and get soc already??
---
Female. Males have stupid size proportions.
---
Sorry mate but I think it's time you let the game go, move on and be the best dad that you possibly can be.
---
Yo are you serious go play a game with your 5 kids. How the fuck do you have time to even casual an mmo with that much responsibility?
---
 BTW, you're acting like a solipsistic prick.
---
&gt; Daily dungeon quests force you to spend your time in a certain way in your play window.
---
That's one way to look at it. Daily dungeon quests, from a design point of view, allowed the developers to give you a reason to do old content again. It's a way of recycling content to keep players engaged in the game. This is exactly why the developers put "Heroic Dungeons" into the game starting with TBC. 
---
&gt;  There is less creativity in how you spend your time because doing anything else is less optimal.
---
But you could say that with anything, even in Classic. 
---
&gt; It deteriorated my relationship with the game, I felt I needed to log in to complete the daily on my main character and I started to perceive running dungeons as a chore.
---
But you still didn't have to do it. It's why they introduced multiple ways to get "capped" on badges for the week. 
---
And if you think that was a chore, just wait for Classic.
---
SOUL
---
Keep your chin up and your blades sharp, rogues.  Muscle memory is developed at different speeds for different people.  He’ll fall asleep thinking about every tool in his arsenal and wake up one day a killing machine.
---
/signed
---
Yeah it had the best class balance and raids.
---
Maybe eventually. But only after I've leveled my human and my night elf. I wanna experience it without added assistance. (If I make Horde characters, same basic gist.) After all that, if I feel like I need the extra help, I'll consider it.
---
It's just shorthand. People want to express emotions via text, but it's an informal setting and no one needs a novel. Thus, emotes.
---
You have the version you're talking about already. You've had that super casual for years.  A decade. Simple answer is don't play. Complex answer is enjoy the ride and play what you can when you can. Not everything was designed to suite everyone. That's how we ended up with the hot garbage as BFA.

Name a more iconic duo, I'll wait
---
What we know so far:
---
* You can proc extra attacks by main-hand swing or yellow attack
---
* Extra attacks procced by off-hand trigger a main-hand swing
---
* Extra attacks can't proc extra attacks
---
* Extra attacks reset your swing timer
---
* You can proc multiple extra attacks at the same time when cleaving
---
I'd almost worry that nerves would get the best of people. Those harder raid encounters would get the adrenaline pumping. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
On a side note - can mages cast portal while in combat?
---
unabashedly based
---
You honestly have good points but you ruin your credibility and respect by your uncontrolled language / anger and false claims that the Classic WoW community is responsible for you not having more time with your kids. You're making the choice to play the game. if dungeon finder isn't present in Classic and that simply makes the game so much harder and more time consuming - don't play.

I really like yours the most, it makes sense for what I was trying to accomplish. In the end I am considering dropping Parry all together and going for something like this:
---
https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-talents/paladin-talents/?tal=50500120000000053250330001551050000000000000
---
Having a better LoH to save yourself makes more sense to me than straight out 3-4% Parry. The healer will just have to deal with a few more heals. From testing I know that DS is better than impSoR for almost everything, so having thought about situations where Spiritual Focus might come in handy it's the better choice on tier 2. And ebay made a good point that 10% intellect isn't that good until you're in raid gear, so for a leveling Protadin build it's probably useless. Thanks so much for the great input, I love this build and I'm going to enjoy playing it so I can make friends and lead groups without a nagging warrior :)
---
It only drops down IF you don’t respec for an entire month. 50 gold max, dropping by 5 for every month you don’t respec.
---
https://dump.video/i/mpSpsl.mp4

Thanks for this. Helpful to read especially the quest rewards.
---
Herb and Alch are best bets still.  
---
For enchant &amp; tailoring, create an alt and use as a banker for a bit.  IIRC, you can level both of these professions to a decent level before needing to do quests to advance further.

Fuck the kids man, I want to play this game so bad. They'll be fine, plenty of kids survived without their dad.

There are more sacrifices hes making than a rent payment. It's probably exhausting not being on his own.
---
R14. 
---
I will dumb down this explanation dramatically (omitting brackets, stacking blahblah), but your ranking progress depends on your position in the top honor contributor list. This means that the amount of honor players are ready to grind dictates the amount you have to grind in order to progress. 
---
Imagine a dad gamer only realm where players PvP casually and the top contributor made 100k honor. If you earn 101k honor weekly you will steadily progress towards r14 and get it in 11 weeks as #1 honor contributor. 
---
Now think of a nerd realm where the top honor contributors grind 1000k honor per week. And you will have to grind 1000k+ honor weekly as well, if you want to progress at the same pace as on dad realm to be the #1 contributor, aka most likely you are totally fucked. And if you earn 101k honor like you did on the Dad gamer server then your progress will absolutely stop at approximately rank 7 forever.
---
Yeah super high variation,  just like on private servers where 95% of lvl 60 hunters have Lupos.
---
Viable as in, "by defending, you could reliably succeed at defending and stopping the enemy push/zerg".
---
AV was changed because defending was *too* viable.  It was difficult to push passed the NPC defense and 15 or so defending players even if you had double their numbers.  It was of course double, but make the sides even (30vs30, or 40vs40) and it was incredibly difficult for even coordinating attacking teams to push or zerg past, largely due to the strength of the NPC's.
---
This is why games lasted so long, and why it was changed and the NPC's changed to be weaker and fewer.  It was taking too long to aquire the rewards.
---
The people who want things to go back to pre-nerf think so because the weaker NPC's have resulted in the zerg-meta that has kind of ruined modern AV.  Zerging pre-nerf wasn't exactly impossibly, but the defenders had a massive advantage due to strong NPC'S tearing through non-tanks classes caught by CC and other abilities.
---
BOE items are fair game for all since anyone can benefit from it.
---
Aaaaaaaaand the post is fake boys
---
you complain about everyone going for BT but with the earlier patch everyone goes for lupos so not much difference imo
---
Love this. Have plenty of similar silly plans
---
Nope, I already know their stance on development, I have no fear that stupid little posts like yours are going to get anything accomplished. I think you are a moron for copy pasting the same thing several times in silly attempt to get people to react to you. You say you have kids and a wife and that you don't have time to run to a dungeon every time but you have the time to sit on the internet trolling for reactions? I feel sorry for you and if you do have a family, I feel sorry for them even more
---
The more tanks and priests the better, especially in the beginning. Makes running instances and getting groups easier. There’ll be enough DPS classes around :)
---
I always recommend pet classes (warlock, hunter) to new players.  They tend to be more forgiving while leveling.  
---
If you’re considering a mage, you can also consider a warlock.  Different utility, also ranged caster.
---
I mean the big one is playing 16+ hours a day in order to reach lvl 60 asap to start progressing attunement/farming
---
Whatever happened in your life to turn you into a Jackass, I am sorry. Hopefully your family and friends don’t abandon you. Try to enjoy your life.
---
you guys have weird obsessions about twitch
---
100%, the guy has posted this at least twice already. He is simply trolling for reactions and people to talk to. I honestly feel sorry for him
---
Man you dodge a lot don't you?
---
Thanks homie!
---
400 hk/day isn't going to get u r14...
---
I mean 100g is the high end , but it’s perfectly possible for any class to get 50 gold an hour farming DM east lashers.
---
Well yeah, blizzard aint doing us a favor, this is business. They definitely know they screwed up along the expansions. 
---
The data gathering will be very important. I just dont know if they can save Retail WoW. The idea of Classic is amazing, you get to "reboot" your game from ground zero and, if its a success, you can "redo" the bad game mechanics that evolved through out the years and ended up like BFA. Some of these mechanics were only implemented because players really wanted them, but doesnt mean they were the right call. 
---
Imagine gathering all that data and realizing that the best game mechanics and structure were the ones in Vanilla. Realizing that they should remove LFR, class changes, ilvl, reforging, etc.. Realizing that the next expansion after BFA should be way more "simple" mechanically, back to the old roots. 
---
How can they adapt to that new information? I would be very interested to see what they would come up with to overcome this new challenge and mentality.
---
Rushing to 60 and clearing MC in the first reset.
---
After that, speedruns + topping meters, world bosses and world PvP.
---
Honestly just nerfing epic flying to 90% would probably fix the issues it introduces. You can't exactly strip it out because TBC is designed around it.
---
You don't know anything about me, yet you sit there behind a computer telling me how sorry you are. Nobody gives a fuck. I can do whatever I want, let the children be damned.
---
I'm talking about bfa. I thought it's obvious since this is what you were talking about
---
Please make this as phone wallpaper (:
---
You can still have a little fun with the current state of the game I think, I haven't done it but have been tempted to.
---
I think a strawpoll of top 3 is in order. Earthshatter over Ten Storms? For shame
---
No, I'm going to go into it blind. I may or may not remember where everything is so it may take longer than usual to find things, but the experience will be better. 
---
Dungeons will be interesting though because I'm sure I won't remember most of those. Luckily I'll be the tank and my wife will be the healer, so the dps will have to grin and bear it or, better yet, help and be friendly.
---
50g a respect dayum it only ever got to 10g back in the day for me but i was never hardcore endgame either, thats rough but i like it for some reason
---
in the mines
---
Done it twice.  Get ready to compete with other mages who thought they'd have the spot at odd hours too lol.
---
PW: Shield is inefficient mana usage and should only be used for emergencies anyways.
---
Just use heals with a cast time, wand and try to snipe last hits for Spirit Tap with Mind Blast. Only use Renew during pulls and not before pulls.
---
As a balance druid your two most valuable professions will be:
---
1. Begging - for raid spots and spare loot
---
2. Dancing - because that's all you'll be doing 20 seconds after a pull
---
Ok
---
/u/fulbaked lmfao
---
Can we stop promoting this moron with his dumbass reactions and experiences?  This isn't /r/asmongoldfans
---
I mean its more variation than just broken tooth! Lupos was top tier for pve sure, but PVP you had snarler with his resistances and broken tooth for the knockback
---
Thats not even counting the world pvp value of the ZG bats/AV wolves, who ran faster than a epic mount
---
Don't feed the troll
---
Wow beta fall damage is def too low
---
Well he is to undergeared to tank in zerker stance without a shield.. Stupid idea... Just stupid...
---
Tier gear can be used by most classes for PvP.
---
For PvE, its warrior tanks, rogues, hunters, priests mostly.
---
T3 can be used in PvE by everyone.
---
you: "Let the children be damned"
---
still you: "I dont have the time to run to the dungeon every time because I have kids and a wife"
---
gen x have so little identity they may as well be boomers
---
It's just instances per hour, when you try and zone in and you've been in too many you just end up behind the instance plane but still in the world. I recall it being 6 per hour in vanilla.
---
Well, the honor system is relative so it's not like it's a linear grind that is just "necessary" for people to do for people playing a certain class. It's literally time gated and limited to a few people every week. Even R12 will require spending basically a full time job PvPing with extremely efficient premades to realistically reach before the next phase, unless Classic is somehow attracting a larger PvP bracket than the biggest private servers.
---
Anyone who casually throws a couple of R12/13/14 pieces into their "BiS list" is either an incredibly talented, well-connected player who can lead premades and play an extra 8+ hours in a day when the weekly standings call for it or they'll get a very rude surprise once they try to grind for it.
---
An anecdote from back in 2005: a very hardcore PvPer on my server was going to get R14 the next honor update. They managed the brackets on Alliance and had everything set up for him to reach standing 1. Their premade took New Years Eve off and didn't play. That mistake cost him an extra week of grinding, because of course people broke the brackets and pushed to take his spot.
---
Pretty much this. Even if you add all the "variety" there still are going to be like 2 or 3 pets worth taming.
---
Pserver lupos is a bad example, as retards decided to give him 10 min respawn instead of a few hours.
---
Does he have beta? I really like his videos.
---
Delivery quests. Take x item to y person in z town.
---
At 20, a frost mage can start AoE grinding somewhat efficiently.
---
Strongly agree with this one. Every instance of pet normalisation just served to make Hunters less interesting.
---
Personally, I think my favourite version is actually the original Beta Hunter, where pets retained their original size as well. Which allowed for some fun extremes with stuff like the Sewer Beast (mediocre pet, but the biggest in the game!) or the Warg pups from LBRS.
---
Unfortunately, Blizzard seems to largely be against a "mixed patch", and are only making exceptions for changes made in preparation for TBC. So I wouldn't get my hopes up.
---
There is no 2H class that works for both PvP and PvE without respeccing.
---
The closest you can get is 2H fury warrior, but you won't be as strong in PvP without Mortal Strike.
---
I'm currently running on near max settings on a 5-year old i3 w/ 8gb ram. I think my graphics card is better than yours though. I'd be surprised if you cannot easily run at least medium settings.
---
Thats rude lol :d
---
It’s easy. The hardest bit is getting the drop from Kazzak or farming the elites in Winterspring. 
---
Can’t wait to get a Benediction again! I had a Lok’Dhelar on my hunter, I found that far more difficult to obtain
---
Does anyone know of a list of streamers that will be on the same server so I can avoid them?  
---
TBH I feel that if anything is going to "ruin" classic wow it will be streamers, so I just want to avoid them at all costs.
---
Asmongold fails at throwing food away from 2 years ago inside his room. I can't take this guy seriously after seeing pictures of the pigsty he lives in
---
I generally look at leveling guides to get a general idea where to level at what level, but if I actually use them the whole experience becomes boring
---
You're looking at approximately 12 hours per day grind for 3-4 months, depending on the competition and PvP scene of your server.
---
Reported
---
Oh wow, what a lonely soul
---
You can level as dps and still tank/heal vanilla dungeons fine.
---
In classic your spec doesn’t limit your abilities, being prot spec will enhance your tank experience but you will still have the tools need to tank/heal in any spec.
---
The most important thing when tanking/healing while leveling is your gear, while leveling you should build a dps set and a tank set.
---
Oh wow i never knew there was a variation where pets kept their size! i remember taming the sewer beast as a horde hunter, it was an amazing challenge, though watchin him shrink to tiny size was saddening :(
---
Don't forget about people who are not streamers who are going to do their best to get it, but fall short solely because a streamer was essentially given scarab lord by their fans.
---
sounds like a "fun" server that would get boring after about 10 minutes.
---
Plus it looks cool. I wana wear them all just to wear them haha.
---
Druid tier 2 or 3 on a Tauren 💜💜 pretty please
---
this is posted here about once every 2 weeks since classic announcement
---
What about during Phase 2? Will there be Rank 14's during Phase 2 when there's no BGs?
---
Warriors use T2.5 gear for DPS, tanking and PvP. That's the only Warrior tier set usable for all though.
---
Feels like it already did.
---
even if he loopholes his way around, someone will buy them and upload them somewhere and you can just download them for free..only downside is you have to wait longer for someone to upload the updates to them.
---
Is that you John Wayne? Is this me?
---
Alright so: hidden tech I found in the beta.
---
If you press W at certain cycles of your animation you will repeat it infinitely. Try it with /dance and tap w forward at a steady beat, you will keep repeating the cycle of /dance. This also works if you jump off a tall object and spam W after touching the ground, you will keep looping the animation as demonstrated here:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7P0LiXn0D0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7P0LiXn0D0) 
---
With night elf it's possible to jump, tap W as your feet touch the ground and keep flipping over and over. You can thank me later
---
Rogues and Mages were 100% over populated on Vanilla. Stay retail kid
---
I used it to tank twin emperors, so enough.
---
If they tried anything different they definitely need to go with alternate advancement.
---
Okay fine level 10 characters per account. During phase 2 I reckon it will
---
Didn't I see this exact post by somebody else like ten minutes ago?
---
I'm glad you think so, but my roommate and I have put in a couple hundred hours each. Don't know where you get off commenting dumb shit like this but I'm glad you made your opinion known.
---
While I agree, it's 1600 HK/day.
---
4 toons per account x 40 accounts = 160 toons. Killed 10x per day = 1600 HKs.
---
Can't you say the same about vanilla? Clear raid each week and you're done
---
This but unironically.
---
He requested one to be made by blizzard
---
Only if I can link my wow account to my call of duty account
---
You can heal as a Shadow Priest in dungeons no problem.
---
For raids the only close thing to healing as a Shadow Priest is Shadow Weaving. You will stack 5 stacks of Shadow Weaving and then continue to heal while keeping the stacks up. It's not DPSing though, its just debuffing.
---
I love you for fulfilling your class fantasy
---
**TIL U DIE**
---
But how much would Kings improve the group's capability? I figure melee can do just fine with BoM and the heal gets BoW. I think it's hard to determine the value of Kings in dungeon crawling.
---
More variation is still always good though! Lupos aside (who would be FAR less popular if you have to wait hours to find him and then level him as well), you had broken tooth/snarler for pvp, not even counting the variety of speedy pets for world pvp fun, like the AV wolf/ZG bats 
---
Obviously there will always be one "Best in slot" pet of sorts for each activity, but some variation is always better than literally only broken tooths
---
Ban dad gamers
---
11 wtf
---
if you got a cellphone or a tablet could just use that as a second monitor :D what I use to do before I got my second monitor.
---
&gt;even fury warriors get this
---
Sure, but only after all the tanks
---
Was a Warrior in Vanilla (Alliance) and played mostly arms for PVP and Raiding. Can confirm it holds it's own on the meters.
---
No one cared about the MS debuff back when we got up to 16 debuff slots and shouldn't now. This is a narrative that has stemmed from private servers.
---
Have fun my dude.
---
Hunters and Mages are your best bet to be able to efficiently farm gold and raid on the same character.
---
Hunters can farm Maraudon and DM:North, Mages can farm DM: East and ZG crocs.
---
I really am sick of seeing the (only works in ) I want my stuff to work everywhere that’s why it’s the WORLD
---
Your entitled to think it's dumb. The mob has to form from something.
---
Troll post? Go play BFA
---
Druids are viable, but Warriors are better overall.
---
Don't plan to, no.
---
Watch streamers until game day
---
Don't you need tailoring to wear bloodweave though at max lvl?
---
This comment makes no sense.
---
😂
---
runescape launched a "pvp everywhere get your opponents stuff" server called deadman mode and it had tons of flaws at the beginning that were slowly fixed as the playerbase pointed them out. It's not perfect and neither would a WoW server like this, but god damn would it be fun for those who like this kind of thing
---
It didn't until it hit. If you switched a target and were out of energy you'd be standing there until the energy ticked. 
---
Startattack command wasnt there either. You needed to make a command to check if auto attack was enabled and then activate if not, and had to reference a bar slot auto attack was placed in. I'm coming around to the macro change. Things will be easier.
---
Yep and it doesn't matter if you equip or sell, just need on BOEs cause everyone needs gold.
---
No pls we aren’t all like this 😅
---
&gt;  I just dont know if they can save Retail WoW.
---
My issue with retail is that the story is rather bland, and people are experiencing game fatigue. Overall the mechanics and content available are solid. So I'm not sure it "needs saving". 
---
&gt; Some of these mechanics were only implemented because players really wanted them, but doesn't mean they were the right call.
---
You'd have to be more specific, but the developers looked at the data, the player behavior, etc, and then made the right call based on what needed to be done. 
---
For example, it doesn't really add much gameplay to your experience to force players to "fly" out to a dungeon one by one. That increases the time spent before you can get to the "fun part". It doesn't add anything to your experience. It's actually a barrier to entry since some players would simply not bother doing a particular 5 man if they didn't have time. 
---
That's why they added summoning stone summoning in TBC. That's why they eventually added just straight teleporting your player to the dungeon. Forcing the player to run there didn't make sense. 
---
&gt; Realizing that they should remove LFR, class changes, ilvl, reforging
---
LFR was added so that players that do not have time to do raids, or get into a guild that are organized enough, a chance to experience the content. The concept of LFR actually doesn't even hinder people that don't want to engage with it, it only helps your fellow player enjoy the game at their own pace. 
---
Class changes I'm not really sure of what you're asking for.
---
iLvl was added because it gave you an accurate idea of what your character "can do". How do you measure your character's strength compared to content you haven't done yet? ilvl assists with that. It was also introduced because players started to use addons that basically did this for them. You'll find that a lot of features in WoW were taken from addons that almost everyone was using anyway. Which is actually a super smart business move. 
---
Reforging is probably the only thing in your list here that has questionability to it. I see why it was added - it allowed for the chance of players to feel good about getting a "strong item" at random. Like getting a Legendary skin out of an Overwatch loot box. But it becomes polarizing when you get a "super strong" item from doing something relatively easy or someone gets that super strong item on dumb luck.
---
&gt; How can they adapt to that new information?
---
I think it will confirm a lot of the design choices they made in the past as "good choices" overall. It will add some perspective and allow them to see if maybe they went a little "too far" on certain things.
---
Yes, and every single one of the accounts posting it are less than a month old.
---
They're never going to pick and choose individual pieces of patches to make changes to 1.12 classes. And honestly it's a terrible idea to go down that rabbit hole.
---
Too bad activision sucks streamers cocks even though the majority of people want fucking nothing to do with them.
---
I would agree that extra-PvE server would be ideal for Hardcore-mode.
---
Reason being ganking and other helpful gestures (streamer benefits! or any other friend benefit).  
---
I would also like to restrict trading and other features that can help players.   
---
For example:  
---
Disable Auction House (its HC server, theres not going to be a market anyway and also that market would be helpful if abused)  
---
Disable Trading (so people cant help eachother at all with money and gear)
---
Disable all PvP-features, honor, bgs, world pvp and gurubashi.(noone  is gonna end up doing them)
---
Make every character unable to wear any gear that is green or higher quality. (the ironman rules, maybe too harsh  for classic)
---
  
---
Keep groups enabled so people can still group up and do group-hardcore. Also dungeons and raids should still exist... although i doubt anyone is gonna  be able  to do ANY raids. But dungeons can be done, it would infact be one ultimate challenge to complete group-hardcore and complete all dungeons.
---
Everything else should still be ingame... greens and higher items would just be vendored for money (mount and skills).  
---
This is my idea and i would definitely give it a try at some point once normal classic gets a bit boring. But thats going to take years for sure... the gameplay itself takes a while if you want to level up every class atleast once.
---
I'm wondering if the OP has any experience with a balance druid in vanilla? 
---
I mean if you think you can make it work from previous vanilla experience, all the power to you and good luck.
---
But if you are determined to make it work because you loved balance from another version of the game I'd suggest you play a mage.
---
I am more than happy to let you play the game you want to play. Unfortunately this isn't that game. Take care, dont let the door hit you on the way out :)
---
It's been suggested before. It's really just a messy way of adding in new servers with character transfers.   
---
TBC isn't just content. It added tons of new UI changes, gameplay changes, mechanic changes. Switching between vanilla and tbc in the one game on the one character would be very weird.  
---
You'd zone in from Azeroth from Outlands and the way all your stats worked would change, all your spell coefficients would change, your base rotation would chance, the amount of debuffs allowed on the enemy would change. It would be really silly.  
---
Keep them separate. Yes populations would drop, no shit. That's what happens when people complete games - they stop playing them.
---
The available data all calls your lies out. Stay stupid grandpa.
---
&gt; JUST LET ME PLAY THE FUCKING GAME I WANT TO why does every single thing have to be so fucking difficult. Thanks to your stupid threads and arguments I will have way less time for my kids, just remember that. YOU are responsible for this shit not me. 
---
No - you are. 
---
Retail is right there, man. It's not going anywhere. Everything you have said you needed is in Retail. 
---
Do you not like retail? Yeah... we get that. Nobody talks with each other is the big thing for me. But why don't they talk with each other? Because they can be auto-grouped together and teleported directly to the dungeon. No need to coordinate where they are meeting or where they are going.
---
So - to reiterate - you can play the game how you want to: don't blame us if it's no longer the kind of game you want to play.
---
Generally "everyone rolls" is the expectation. I don't see it as any different than a mage being expected to hand out water to the rest of the group.
---
my first character is at 13 days /played and he's level 28, if that makes you feel any better
---
Female Orc emotes are horrendous imho. Can't stand that voice, especially the attack sounds.
---
Arcane priest with starshards 🤠
---
Will there be "Balance patches" of sorts, or just keep it as is?
---
I don't mean "EVERYTHING IS EQUAL" but small things like mana cost reduction or a percent bump on some spells. (Asking for some OOMkin friends)
---
Agreed wowhead is absolute shit on the user end. Filled with popups and ads and slow as fuck load times.
---
yeah most people only want to get rank 14 or open aq gates or clear naxx lmao.
---
Been lvling a balance druid on a private server ATM :) it's a different challenge but it isn't as awful as people make out. Experienced vanilla as a feral back in the day and just want a different druid experience. :)
---
Only think I can't decide on is the professions now :S
---
This guy knows his stuff
---
Yeah, because in this microtransaction riddled 2019 gaming landscape, people are gonna feel sooooo bad for buying gold. Okay.
---
So...far away.
---
Many people have done ironman dungeons on retail. They havent managed to completely finish their run ofcourse but its a thing people do try.
---
Atleast i saw sodapoppin do ironman with his friends and they did dungeons, if someone died they dropped out because they failed the ironman. (this was like a year ago)
---
Still see those R1 players dominating the pserver dudes in pvp. 
---
I understand they have the knowledge but don’t underestimate some of the new players who continued with retail as well.
---
Also plan to be a tank and group leader if you expect to be able to reserve anything.
---
He's posted it about 4 times this morning so far. Gets downvoted to oblivion then he reposts it lol.
---
I guess you techincally could, but there are thousands of things to do before you get there, and while your getting there. First and foremost, gold. Gold to me in the recent expansions has become trivial. Garrison missions alone provided me with plenty of gold so i wouldnt have to sweat about "do i have enough gold for foods and flasks for raid this weekend?". i had enough for months without doing anything. classic on the contrary will have me farming gold for mounts, for professions, for training, respecs ETC. Not only that but leveling alone 1-60 will be months, especially as someone who will pretty busy with work during the launch time.
---
What is the ideal number of druids on the horde vs the alliance?
---
Hmm.. Thats a new approach. I havent thought about the sound perspective. I wonder if I would really be annoyed by something like that, maybe Im more focused on the visual
---

&gt; I've died a total of twelve times, three of those too the Murlocs in the northern part of Tirisfal Glades alone I forgot what it was like to have the world actually be dangerous.
---
Warlock is one of the best leveling classes in the game. They also have the easiest time leveling compared to other classes just starting out. 
---
1-6 or so on beta consisted of me completely dotting up a target and then just running from it (if I was going somewhere) and letting the dots / pet kill it. The game changes when you get fear. You can completely dot up a target, fear it, and then start dotting another target while the dots and pet kill off the first. Then fear the second mob and finish it off with a wand. 
---
As long as you are careful and pulling one mob or so at a time (fear juggling two mobs becomes harder to do after 10), you'll be fine. Even if you do pull too much, you're still likely fine and at least more likely to get away than most other classes. 
---
It's why I highly recommend people get a leveling partner for when the game launches. You'll be able to handle unexpected pulls easier, as well as complete quests faster.

Your mouth: *drool*

Some people dont want to play on pservers for several reasons. Just because some of us do doesn't mean the people who dont want to have to.
---
Stay wrong, again the available data is skewed do to the particular sample of players and the meta of the server.
---
Enjoy being so dense that you can't understand how to actual read statistics and not being able to admit that you're wrong

Stay retail kid

We wait for the daaaay
---
This is accurate.
---
I bet most people who argue against DM never actually played in Vanilla. :P
---
We asked for 1.12 so I think 1.12 is what we should get, not cherry picked parts from all the patches.
---
RemindMe! September 4
---
Blizzard has given no indication that they will rebalance any classes. You can tell your friends not to worry, they will get their true nostalgic oomkin experience.
---
Those were my exact first shoulders!
---
&gt; I've seen people vary between different dungeons in Scarlet Monastery to "avoid to get locked out" which confused me here.
---
Then why were they doing this instead of going out -&gt; resetting and going back into the same one again?
---
Yeah but some specs were just strait up broken in a raid environment. As in absolutley sub optimal in almost any given scenario or situation. 
---
Class balance in TBC was peak wow. On almost every measurable metric TBC was better. Coming from someone who has leveled 3 toons to 60 on private servers and will level many on retail classic
---
Yeah but it's Alliance tho.
---
Ya, its the 12-24 bracket imo that's the rly hard slog. If you can manage that you're in the clear
---
Yeah, nobody called it BRS it was always LBRS or UBRS.  
---
LBRS being the pleb-dungeon only 5 man and UBRS being the big deal 10 man. (pleb because less people required)

I should have said from a PvP perspective. I only pvp.
---
If phase 2 is at least 12 weeks long then there will be R14's. You just need to beat all other on your faction on your server in weekly honor gain, for 12 weeks straight.
---
[book mark this ](https://www.avoidstreamers.com/) I think it’s just what you need.
---
Yea ud is probably better because if you have to sit a fear as a rogue you've already lost
---
Very self aware, there...
---
A hunter can start as early as lvl 16 AoE grinding, just use a pet like the owl that has both screech and claw.
---
The screech ability is an AoE debuff/dmg ability that is great!
---
https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/abilities.php#screech
---
I did similar, but didn't even go back for it.  They didn't raise lockpicking to 300.  I didn't try to roll for the ore they got.  Fair is fair, no one gets it.

He is asking if after reaching the 50g MAX and waiting for the decay if it will drop down to either 5g or 10g at the lowest. 
---
Hopefully someone else can answer as I'm unsure
---
If you followed the link, it quite literally contains what you're asking for. I know having a room temperature IQ is challenging but there's no need to lash out.
---
Going to have to say that TBC was not peak wow for class balance.
---
That honor belongs to Mists.
---
PvP gear for paladins is actually really good if u can get it early. Considering ret has only 3 gear sets actually designed for them, rank 13 gear is not only BiS for pvp but also pve and just about anything tbh, until you can get into AQ40. If your sole purpose is to reckbomb people, t2.5 has more crit and doesn’t require an insane grind.
---
same
---
stelthraper69
---
No, if they do tbc or wrath I don't want a remaster. I want it as faithful as possible like classic is going to be.
---
Engineering is far from necessary. There will be plenty of us “real gamers” that opt to not take engineering.
---
I think badge gear was good back then  too... it gave you a little more incentive to do dungeons, even dungeons you didnt necessary need but you joined the group just so you could get some badges. (this made it easier for people to join for groups, in classic everyone usually wanted to do a specific dungeon for its loot so getting a group for one dungeon might be harder than for another)
---
Trying to recall what these were generally going for. I know I made quite a big of gold selling healing pots in Vanilla. Got me my mounts. Thinking maybe a stack was going for 5-10g? Pre-AQ.
---
- balance druid
---
- pre-RAID BiS
---
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
---
Most of them play so poorly i am yelling at my screen :(. 
---
Half of the streamers didn't activate the option to see their number of hp/mp.
---
It's not as efficient leveling, problem is end game you can't be mana efficient enough to participate in end game PVE content. 
---
Anyway, best thing for you would be alchemy to make all the mana pots you're going to need.
---
There are a few - I never played priest though so I couldn't tell you. :(
---
Twitch bad &gt;:(
---
Lupos was great and all, but really only for PvP and his Furious Howl buff.
---
The owl with Screech and Claw was the better pet to run when leveling and out AoE grinding.
---
What’s the source for this? There’s literally no way to tell based on the beta right now since it’s capped at 40. Anyone saying otherwise is either a blizzard employee or full of crap. What the private servers do/have done cannot be used to indicate the direction the official servers will go
---
Drives me insane too, how they have the percentages instead of numbers. Nails on a chalkboard
---
let me put it this way, lupos did 900 crit damage, while brokentooth barely does 100 per hit. And that 900 bypasses any armor.
---
&gt; Viable as in, "by defending, you could reliably succeed at defending and stopping the enemy push/zerg".
---
Why do you want to do that, exactly?
---
They didn't, dunno what OP is talking about
---
Trust me you don't want it. I tried to get Lupos for like 2 weeks on private servers with auto click, macros and shit because people would tryhard 100% to get it, some would even sell accounts with it. Guilds would take a Hunter with Lupos over someone who doesnt have it, it's cancer.
---
Could you stop speaking as if you speak from experience? Attach some sort of disclaimer to your uncertainty please, you're misleading people for no reason.
---
There was one you could MC in BRS for a Fire Resist buff that was used in raids. And a Goblin in BWL you could MC to learn how to smelt Elementium.
---
When people are doing the run into MC - throw them off the bridge into the lava. Instant death with a graveyard run of approx 3-4 mins. Good times
---
Theme park mmo.
---
For PvP, the ZG bats had 1sec atk spd and also blocked peoples views very good and had the ability Screech was pretty great.
---
I've never been a huge grinder.  Prob high value mobs and herbs, but will probably see how much I can be self sufficient as an AH goblin
---
No one went deep prot back in the day, most people went arms or fury mixed with enough points for last stand.
---
Any love for Mages? :(
---
and wanting items rogues and warriors would have prio for. seeing a shaman winning stuff someone  would need for his fury warrior too,  can really cause bad vibes in guilds.
---
I want to test the reputation gains, in the beta I could check if I need to go to teldrasil in lvl 1 and start leveling or if I can revisit it at higher level and gain the same amount of reputation. I know how it works on private servers, but every streamer I ask don't know and none of them wants to check it out because its boring.
---
Scarshield Spellbinder in BRS gives +83 Fire Resist for an hour.
---
Twilight Emmisary in BRD gives +25 SPDH for 30 minutes
---
Scarlet Medic in WPL gives +82 Arcane Resist for an hour

Crimson Initiate in Strat &amp; Scholo reduce all Shadow Damage taken by 87.

You use MC on Instructor Razuvius in Naxx.

---
But these aren't even the max level healing potions.
---
Theres a big difference between ground mount and flying mount.
---
Ground mount can be stopped by everything... daze, root, stun and certain spells like fear.
---
But flying mount is basically immune to slowing effects since if you get slowed... just fly up and your enemy cant follow you no matter what they do. (same goes for ingame mobs)  
---
Only if you are on the ground with them do they work the same way but even then its more worth it to wait the CC out and fly up instead of dismounting and fighting back.  
---
Ground mounts have no such "sanctuary"... if you get slowed by someone, a warrior for example, you will not be able to get away unless they make a mistake. (you have to fight back or let them kill you)  
---
And now that flying mounts were buffed further after TBC you cant even get polymorphed while flying, only at ground level will you be dismounted but when midair you are just immune.
---
Flying mounts are also SIGNIFICANTLY faster than any ground mount  so that makes them even easier vessels to be used for escape and the lack of midair combat mechanics in the game theres nothing you can do to people flying around. (only mages  can  slowfall and cast a few instants, other classes require you to be within their range)
---
WTB Priest t2 vector with Benediction!
---
yep
---
I see people mention Broken Tooth and Lupos... but real hunters, the good ones at least knew about the ZG bats and the owl.
---
ZG bats had 1sec atk speed and blocked peoples view really good and both Claw and Screech, both the owl and ZG bat were great pets to use.
---
Screech also stacked with the same debuff that warriors and druids used... so it was pretty powerful ;)
---
Obviously, you are too slow to see whining in a post.
---
Why wouldn’t I go right to the source?  Damn, you are all really this slow?

First of all, if you plan on doing pve, you gon heal.
---
Second, if you plan to pvp, you will oom after the first 3 spells. They take forever to cast, you have no defensive spells, you ded.

Just play on a pserver

Here’s an idea

No.

Supposedly double

spell dmg and healing?

Spell Damage &amp; Healing
---
You went above and beyond, thanks.
---
Those numbers are kinda meaningless. You're comparing crits to non-crits, and they have different attack speeds. Yeah, the 900 bypasses armour, but it doesn't bypass Shadow Resistance. So for low armour, high resistance enemies, the relative power changes.
---
There were still balance issues, sure, but I've always maintained that Blizzard should have just nerfed Lupos's DPS a bit rather than making it just another wolf.

It was the first thing that popped up on google when I searched elementalist mage.
---
Lmao not every guild did that.
---
I’m planning to multi box warrior (tank), paladin (dedicated healer), mage, hunter, priest(shadow/disc). After max level I will move all the characters to one account for raiding.
---
ZG won't be at launch, thats why people talk about BT/Lupos, ZG is pretty much BT just a little bit better. Lupos is better than both.
---
Nah. You can make a solid argument for something even if that thing is fundamentally incorrect, just like you can make a poor argument and actually be in the right.
---
It’s 1/5 iirc
---
Make a video of killing retail Hogger and then splice it with another video of killing Classic Hogger.
---
Yeah, you'll have to level the alt at some point, but much can be done while being used as a bank alt.
---
Sorry servers wont die. Maybe your on the wrong sub?
---
Those devilsaur won't respawns as fast and leather won't sell as much. Pservers use dynamic respawns, the economy will be completely different.

I don't have a ton of time to play so I figure I will be well behind the try hards that are running the same route
---
holy fuck this thread do not skip mind soothe LMAO its literally the most underrated spell of all time.  its essentially stealth in humanoid zones
---
And farming for raids does not? Shit man atleast I did not do dailies daily. I did them whenever I felt like it and did my own thing when i didn't feel like it.
---
Nice post. 1.12 though.
---
Idk who this dude is but hes like legit bad
---
For raids? 2 and 2.
---
I enjoyed daily quests for things like mounts. Rep grinds for gear, not so much. They can work, but it depends on how they implement the rewards.
---
Fuck Druids are like cancer cells then.
---
Both of these will only make the leather more valuable
---
Private servers have dynamic respawns and during the past two big private server launches it backfired tremendously.
---
Dude is straight up a moron. I watched a stream for like 5 minutes and couldn't stand him. 
---
Maybe if I was 12 I'd be able to watch him.
---
30% of characters in vanilla are warriors but it's important to understand that around 5% of them are bank alts, 10% will never make it to 60, and 10% of them will be bad players that won't be able to tank well. Leaving about 5% maybe even less of the warriors on any given server useful what so ever.
---
I rly don't understand the downvotes here. The dailies weren't forced. Shit i barely did them and played the game fine anyways.
---
This was my transmog for a long time on my lock
---
It’s always auto flagged you. It’s alliance territory
---
I love the warlock sets. I’ve been looking for a T-shirt with the warlock class symbol but I can’t find anything online.  Does anyone know where I might be able to get one?
---
I saw this comic when it ran. Didn't play back then though.
---
what I meant to say is that players asked for some changes that werent so good to the game. And sometimes developers came up with Quality of Life changes that actually impacted the game negatively in other aspects that they didnt even imagine.
---
LFR for example. Players asked for it, but at the same time this change killed part of the social interaction that Vanilla had, and that made WoW unique. And then players complained about it too. But thats ok, you cant please them all.
---
Those were just examples tbh... like some Class Changes through out expansions that dumbed down some classes/specs... iLVL made your gear goals more "souless", you are just turning it to numbers. Players stopped looking for that X Weapon that made them excited and just started thinking about the iLVL that they had to achieve.
---
But like I said, these are just simple examples... Some of them requested from the community, some are just developers ideas... Some are good for some ppl, some are just bad.. Its ok, of course blizzard was aiming and hoping for the best, based on the data that they gathered.
---
I really hope Classic thrives and that it can help Retail to be a better game, because I love mmorpgs and I really dont want this game genre to die. Very few gaming companies investing on RPGs. Mobile crap flying all over the place (diablo immortal e.g). And I get it, its way more profitable for companies to develop something likle that. But I just cant stand loging in Twitch and seeing 200k Fortnite Viewers and 15k WoW Viewers, its just sad. Thankfully Classic is improving that. Sry for the rambling, but anyway.. Im cheering for WoW and I cant wait to play Classic even though Im not a long time WoW player like most of the community.
---
For the same reason I play defense in other games like TF2.  Putting up a defense is fun, and it gives the rest of my team more time to succeed on offense.
---
Are people surprised that Slowmonbald failed? At best he is bellow average. The only reason he is successful sometimes is because he is being carried by others.
---
Agree, imagine watching someone play WoW of all things.
---
In phase 2 there are no battle grounds yet. Someone each week will still be #1 standing on each faction and will rank up the max amount. If phase 2 is long enough, and you're rank 1 every week, you'll be rank 14.
---
Biggest two are probably the goblins in BWL who teach Smelt Elementium to miners and MC tanking for Raz in Naxx.
---
Nice to see a video from Stormrage Horde. Was this before or after the entire faction abandoned the server?
---
Gold have to come from somewhere. Mage aoe farming on pservers inject tons of money into the economy.
---
It’s too hot for the police and the firemen.
---
it was a joke but be real, as a warrior man you gotta go engi
---
Yeah instead of doing dailies out in the world for a bit of gold, you'll be hiding in Scarlet Monastery repeatedly grinding trivial mobs for gold. How thrilling.
---
You won't hit exalted.
---
There really aren’t any, the new API stops anything get close to botting. Did vanilla have cast at cursor macros? Those are good for aoe retical stuff.
---
I'll be playing human warlock in classic and this right there is the goal ;)
---
most guilds only have 2 tanks and then get fury warriors do rest, say you want to be one of those who do the rest and you get showered in tier
---
But if by doing that you are actually costing every single player on your team rewards per hour, that is griefing your own team so you can have your "fun".
---
What Slappy said is right, except you can only enter five instances per hour, not 6. It's just that all the Scarlet Monastery dungeons are technically the same instance in the game, so players can do all the SM dungeons and haven't technically entered more than one instance until they reset scarlet monastery and re-enter.
---
I always found Rogues to be incredibly easy to level, especially in comparison to Warrior.
---
It very much is !
---
I would say dwarf / gnomeish rep is the toughest to get as they share a starting area.
---
But if you focus on quests from another faction, you shouldn't have too much trouble being exalted by 40.
---
Look at Mr(s) Moneybags here with 99 gold!
---
Do we know much about the Classic Graphics button?
---
I built my current PC in the MoP era, and according to system requirements lab I meet the minimum specs for BFA (not the recommended specs though) so I’d assume it will run Classic as I’ve read it’s based off this or the Legion client?
---
Does the classic button enable the game to run on potato PCs? Or is it still intensive and just a visual only effect for nostalgia?
---
How can you be 100% sure. On PvP servers, yes. On PvE servers there are a lot of people who seem to have differing opinions
---
No, while possible on private servers - it is not possible on the BETA. Reputation per quest is considerably lower on the BETA.

No

Warriors, rogues, mages gonna be everywhere.

carrying the flag as a shaman...alright good luck getting r12/r13 with that mindset
---
The benefit here is there is a definite end.  No matter how far behind, you'll eventually get there because there hits a point where there is no where to go.  It is doubtful everyone will just ditch all servers after they clear the content. There will always be different groups of people clearing different things.  Old players, new players.  It's not like retail where taking a 2 month hiatus means you come back to an entirely different game.
---
This is wrong. Even doing your own faction the whole way, you will not reach Exalted by 60, let alone 40.
---
You can do skinning/gathering (herb or mining) and send boe items to a bank alt with level 1 enchanting to DE (regardless of level). 
---
You won’t be able to DE the quest rewards you don’t need or gear you replace but it should still give you a lot of mats to AH
---
Cherry picked parts from all the patches is actually exactly what we're getting. 
---
1.12 balance/itemization/talents
---
1.2 Raids/Items available (at launch)
---
No BGs/Honor System
---
Progressive releases. 
---
Pre-1.12 Mount mechanics. 
---
I'm not in any way speaking out against this; I'm definitely a fan of the approach Blizzard has been taking. It is, however, definitely a hodgepodge of mechanics taken from various points in vanilla in order to capture the spirit of vanilla.
---
Cant wait for that level 20ish undead rogue grinding to high warlord in redridge inn..
---
The strawmans are real.
---
That's what it turned into after LFD.  Before, everyone greeded and if someone needed it, they hit need.   
---
If it was an epic BoE, generally everyone needed.
---
&gt; I don't think this is a huge deal, but I'd probably have preferred it if everyone was 'assigned' to a layer for the first couple of weeks, and the only way to change layer (temporarily) was to join a group with someone from another layer.
---
That is basically what they are planning, though? They said time and time again that they don't want to introduce ways where people can change layers at will. And that they expect the vast majority of players to never change layers.
---
It might be that you would basically never group with players from a different layer. The chatrooms don't have to span layers. If you never meet or chat with players from a different layer, then there is not much means of forming a party with them.
---
The only reason they are allowing layer hops to begin with is to join up with your guild or in the super unlikely scenario of you happening to have friends on different layers.
---
Pve servers or “normal” servers still flagged you for PvP in opposing faction zones. You could be attacked freely by the opposing factions. 
---
The only difference between normal servers and PvP servers is absence of contested zones. 
---
Faction specific zones still act the same way for both server types.
---
Not everyone that will end up playing Classic will play on launch. You'll always be able to find a guild in all stages of progression.
---
If your framework is "how can we cause the most hindrance to asmongold" (as he is implying moonwalk to have) then stealing their name does not fit that goal.
---
Thank you!
---
I just don't want to gank some random player who is half HP and it turns out to be a streamer and RIP me playing the game because I got a dedicated gank squad on me 24/7
---
But they said they don't expect many players to ever change layers. After the dust settles after the first few days, chances are that your friends on layer 1 will stay on layer 1.
---
Path of the titans : - )
---
&gt; As a hunter I don't have to worry about someone not wanting me to take their gear.
---
LOL....Oh wait you are serious, let me laugh even harder!
---
if you going to grind to r13 as a ret might as well go for 14 for the wep tho
---
I like it, just not on orcs, the helmet looks fucked on orcs, and I would be playing an orc.... quite the
---
Go druid and go tank.  We need more.  Make friends with rogues too.  Rogues are the best friends.
---
When I heard WotLK Naxx was bringing it back, I was happy. Then I saw it. I was no longer happy. 
---
The weird ass colors make it. I called it the “jesterpwn” set cause it was badass but also reminded me of a jester suit
---
boomers memes good zoomer memes bad
---
I hope so! That’s the classic AV I know, more to do than just zerg.
---
Hunters and druids will be the two least popular classes.
---
Warlocks have more investment time on average for max level content which is something to also keep in mind for new players. 
---
Soul stone farming before raids/pvp can get annoying.
---
I mained warrior in vanilla. 
---
Warrior is a bit of a kick in the dick in a fresh server to play. You are a free kill for every class in the open world and leveling is slow. 
---
At 60 you are still weak af but you don’t feel it as badly since you’ll be more in group play and you shine more in groups.
---
After the first tier of raid gear you start coming into your own and it’s all downhill from there. 
---
Druid always seemed like a shit class to me. Jack of all trades / master of none. 
---
That being said - truly good Druid players are some of the most entertaining, awe inspiring players to watch and group with imo.
---
VC on the Oceanic servers I played on too. Anyone that said DM was always followed by someone snarkily saying something about a level 17 doing Diremaul.

---
"we’re all in our 30’s+" I doubt that the majority of this sub is over 20.  
---
I would enjoy a guild with people who are a little bit more mature.
---
I'd definitely buy 1000g for 20$.
---
Private servers have increased rep rewards from quests. You won’t see that kind of rep in classic I don’t imagine.
---
Absolutely fucking not!
---
Considering hardcore guilds will be farming naxx week 2 if not week 1 who cares about dps bonuses. Even semi hardcore guilds will likely clear the raid before they complete their first set of splinters.
---
troll is super strong. the orbs can procc blackout, whoch makes them immensly strong for pvp
---
I (personally) wouldn't recommend aoe grinding to a new player. Unless grinding is specifically their favorite thing to do in an RPG, I would suggest they do quests, explore, and get themselves immersed in the world. 
---
Sure, long time players may be concerned with the most efficient way to reach 60, but for a new player the entire time is fresh.
---
No, 100 IS the crit. At least on plate warriors. You might get a lucky 250 on a clothy with brokentooth, but usually it hits 70-90. Mainly because the damage stays the same regardless of attack speed. So faster attack = lower damage. 
---
Also shadow resistance doesnt really resist. Most of the time, Lupos would still hit even if the targets had insane shadow resistance from pally or lock.
---
Thrash.
---
Most classes can farm DM lashers for 50g an hour
---
That's actually pretty darn good.
---
I love how you got downvoted here... just shows how delusional some people are.  Somehow the majority of gamer culture must also revert to 15 years ago because we're getting a reboot of a 15 year old game, I guess.
---
I think having the knowledge we have now will just put players on a more equal footing to face content rather than trivialize it.
---
Private server players will have an advantage with a few tricks, they know exactly what consumes and items to bring to fights, different strats, how to prepare for patches, economy fluctuations (some items are worth more during diff times of the game, and prices can vary wildly depending on what is needed for current content), secret farming locations and just general forsite into all aspects of the game.
---
It won’t impact your game tho they are such a low minority, on private servers there is usually one guild per country so it’s likely your server won’t even have one tbh, but if your server has a guild that clears stuff within hours it’s prob from prive server.
---
You generally can't farm BoEs tho.
---
Theres going to be some serious kill trading for R14
---
Oh that makes way more sense! Does the same apply to Dire Maul too, as they're all connected?
---
I actually tested this during the Stress Test; it is still working as it did in Vanilla.  PW:S does still affect rage generation of Warriors - I didn’t test it on a Druid.
---
Yes, but at this point it’s probably not needed
---
Don't forget aclg for dagger rogues further incentives breaking devilsaur.
---
Makes sense. Thanks for the clarification.
---
I think the easiest way of dealing with flying is significantly lower the flight ceiling. Far enough off the ground that random mobs can’t hit you, but low enough that players with ranged abilities can hit you, potentially dismounting you.
---
Can even add in an item that dismounts a player with a 6s channel or something as a PvP reward that anyone can earn so warriors/rogues/classes without reliable ranged skills can still hit a flying player and begin a fair fight.
---
If there are any downsides to this idea please share, I fail to see any at time of writing.
---
And screenshots
---
Classic and retail gameplay is very similar for every class. Your just less versatile at PVE but for PVP all specs are viable. My advice, level every character to 20 in the retail demo. You will know what to play.
---
I mean, that's classic.  That's what people want, even if it's stupid.
---
Yep!
---
The mailboxes were still a thing though, the way my guild did it was that we just had a treasurer officer who had a guild bank alt, and everything was just mailed back and forth.
---
God it's gonna be so awful. This is why I want to stay away from streamer servers.
---
There is. All you have to do is type /join world and the chat channel is created. Anyone else who types /join world will be in world chat.
---
I agree thats how it SHOULD work but according to other people AND the wiki page, the only faction zone in PvE server are the major cities. Every other zone is Neutral. Doesnt make much sense to me but there are way too many people saying its so and the wiki itself as well.
---
With a priest as a duo - I'd go warrior.  You will have little downtime quest grinding.  With a pocket healer, you can effectively kill mobs non stop.  You'll be able to run dungeons anytime you want.
---
If you are playing a lot solo though, warrior sucks until 30 ish.
---
Strengtg = Spirit &gt; Agility &gt; Stamina &gt; Intellect. Mana per 5 is huge for leveling really speeds it up.
---
Yes.
---
Also, where do you prefer to be stabbed when you won't provide me with a beta key??
---
The gay is strong
---
On top of the buffs other people are talking about, some mobs had damage abilities like cleave or damage spells that you could use to attack other mobs.
---
I remember in Scarlet Monestary and other dungeons, my regular dungeon group would CC a mob in a pull, then when the rest were dead I would MC it and use it to attack the next group of mobs while my group stood by.  The mobs would gangbang the MC'd one, then right before they killed it I would break the MC (so we could get xp for killing it).  It would basically kill one mob for free while also getting free damage in on some others.  
---
It wasn't exactly the fasted way to do a dungeon but it was mana efficient which was sometimes a good thing depending on our level and group compesition.  Plus I got to see all the different spells and abilities various mobs had at their disposal, which was cool.
---
I like Mining/Engineering as a warrior because you can craft goggles early and the bombs help A TON in fights/leveling/saving your ass.  
---
Also be sure to do cooking and first aid as both are very helpful with leveling and questing.
---
you can't just have some game mechanics be pre 1.12 and some 1.12, it's stupid sorry.
---
Complete agree, it became a bit ridiculous in Wrath, dungeons were easy, so everyone got “welfare epics” due to badges.  As far as TBC was concerned, I feel like the difficulty of dungeons warranted the use of badges.  
---
I would be super happy with a legacy TBC server.  I for one think that’s when the game hit it’s all time peak.
---
And are there any others like this? Others I see that could qualify would be Razorfen Kraul/Downs, Maraudon and BRS
---
I think you mean millenials. Google what a baby boomer is
---
&gt; I certainly wouldnt Bloodrage AFTER the pull, its a waste of a global
---
Bloodrage doesn't trigger the GCD.
---
people didnt mention it here, but spriests arent that good in organized pvp either. premades (at least hardcore premades) dont take spriests with em, because they cant carry their weight utilitywise. in wpvp scenarios they are beasts tho.
---
It's just such a 'weird flex' like "here's proof I played during vanilla." Well okay, nobody asked. Literally millions of people played vanilla. Why is that something anyone would think they need to prove?
---
I was on the toilet.
---
LBRS and UBRS are the same instance. Maraudon is all one instance. I think RFD and RFK are separate.
---
Anytime a mob “appears” taunt them as they approach and put one sunder on and that should be enough to hold them and you can go back to focusing the main mobs.
---
No, but I am absolutely going to alt tab to wowhead a lot.
---
So, when people in twitch type those phrases into chat, "kappa" "pogger" etc, it's not the text itself that appears, but twitch instead converts it into a little emoticon?
---
For example, like when I type a colon followed by a bracket on my phone, it turns it into a smiling face?
---
You mean the millenials.
---
Yes!! I loved this game.
---
Yes if the Orc is dwing axes. I've said that twice now.
---
Troll is better unless you're always using axes, and even then Troll is better with TF or IF.
---
If you're using DW Fury/Prot to tank that means you're having issues holding threat which means you care about threat gen.
---
Nothing I've stated is unknown, it's well known for a decade and a half now. If your theory crafting friends or discord group doesn't know that then that's on them. Common knowledge for a long time.
---
This.
---
I'm surprised how smooth the footage was. I tried that back in 2006 and it was a slideshow.
---
Is there any place to find a leveling partner for classic? I only know of classic.live, but the forums there don't seem very lively =\
---
I used to run with some premades on my server in Vanilla as a shaman. Those premades produced no fewer than 8 rank 14 players, I carried the flag fairly often as a shaman. 
---
Sometimes your Druid isn’t on, or needs a break, the best way isn’t the only way.
---
No way. I'm not dealing with Lupos again... Plus it looks so stupid when 95% of Hunters have the same pet, 0 variation.
---
Players taking fall damage is Player vs Enviroment
---
I don’t get how it’s a humble brag he’s just saying it sucks he can’t enjoy the game while streaming it.
---
Ah I misread OPs post. Oh well, still relevant
---
I don't watch his streams, but I've heard he trolls his viewers alot. Is this a joke video? I genuinely can't imagine anyone who's played a Warrior on WoW as long as he has -- including his time on the beta -- and doesn't understand the basics of tanking. 
---
Complaining that he couldn't hold threat against a mob 7+ levels above him while in Zerker stance is just too much for me to believe. No one can be that stupid.
---
All you have to do is type /join world and the chat channel is created. Anyone else who types /join world will be in world chat.
---
All you have to do is type /join world and the chat channel is created. Anyone else who types /join world will be in world chat
---
Well, that confirms the Tauren hitbox thing people were arguing about a few weeks back. That's definitely a larger swing distance than others.
---
#PAT
---
For what it's worth, I think most people in the camp you're arguing with aren't exactly asking for BC with flying/dailies removed. They're closer to saying it would be cool to have the Outlands added to Classic in the future.
---
Hoping for selectively added things from future expansions =/= hoping for recreated expansions with features removed.
---
If you're willing to put the time and effort into being good on a Druid then you will be rewarded.
---
Same goes for Warrior, watching a good player play either of these classes is a treat to experience.
---
At this point we’re just in agreement, troll is better with TF, no doubt. My only thing is its much, much easier to get 2 axes than tf. If youre struggling and troll, you really only can get tf later on and will be losing out on potential threat that an orc could have. Trolls more of a gamble is all
---
Seems like you can use the old graphics on Classic, but will include optimizations from current WoW, so theoretically if you put the graphics on low it should run even more easily than if it was actually vanilla.
---
Friendly to Exalted: 39k rep.  
---
[Darnassus rep quests](https://classic.wowhead.com/faction=69/darnassus#quests:0-6+1+2)  
---
Assuming those numbers are accurate, you can't break 24k rep from just darnassus rep quests pre level 60 as a non night elf.
---
All grenades are stuns but not all stuns are grenades
---
I think people do it more to be a part of something than a quick thank you.
---
One class has 10-14 slots in a raid, the other 2-3.
---
Related. Is rep in starter/lower level zones reduced at high levels on the beta?
---
Hot take, but blizzard should sell a flip MTX where their Nelf character always flips when jumping.
---
$40.
---
In every game, there are those race to the max level and there are those that enjoy the journey.  
---
Most streamers will be racing.  It's an epeen flex to be first.  
---
WoW Classic has enough content on the way to 60, explore and enjoy it.   The raiding scene will be there and need players regardless of when you get there.
---
The best thing about Classic is that even when Naxx opens up there will still be an abundance of MC, Ony and BWL runs going weekly.
---
You can start at any point in Classics lifespan and you will be able to experience something.
---
AHHHHHHH FUCKING STREAMERS REEEEEEEEEE AHHHHHFUCKOFF I HATEYOU STREAMERS REEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I'm on google trying to find post about grinding gold in 2004-2006. I clearly remember 10g/hours beeing a good amount. What's the price of a black lotus on pservers right now?
---
Because the majority of people want to get in and "test" the game to see which class they want to play the most before launch. And I'm willing to bet these are the same people who either wouldn't submit a single bug report...or submit a bug saying Mankrik's wife is too hard to find.
---
*Laughs in private servers.*
---
I think you would not want more than 3 resto druids. Like the other guy said 2 RESTO druids is good.  
---
However I think 1 or 2 ferals can have a spot. They're much better than fury warriors OS tanking. Can also do comparable DPS to rogues/warrs if they've veeeery tryhard.
---
I'd bet my left nut that the minority in this sub is under 20. Most people on this sub will be 25+ easy, no question.
---
&gt;- Dragonbreath Chili (100% scaling)
---
- Shadow Oil (42.85% scaling)
---
How do you know this?..
---
Hunter tier 2 on a tauren come on you know it’s so legit
---
LUL is like laughing or lol but like less enthusiastic right? When I read LUL I read it as a depressed person saying lol with no happiness in their voice. Also, boomers are in their 70s and 80s. Do you mean millenials? Mid 20s to mid 30s?
---
A lot of people posted how they were 9 years old when they first played WoW. Just assume everybody is still 9 Years old instead of adults with college education and degrees and shit.
---
Mine was quite bad i made a UD mage first ever character an was running around fireballing things an somehow dragged the fireball spell off my action bars, had no idea what i did an just thought i must of run out of fireballs lol gg
---
It would make sense to me to send it to a bank alt.  Then you can keep an eye on the AH and decide when to sell.
---
I don't care what other people do frankly.
---
Double.
---
The only thing that’s different about classic and vanilla HWL is someone will be making money while grinding it. It was always about being in the top premade that no lifed the game. Now that premade is just going to be people also making money doing it.
---
That’s awesome. Gonna hold on to any decent spell power gear for the meme.
---
Its been a few months but I wanna say 300ish
---
It just goes to show their lack of education and historical education. They don't realize what a real boomer is or why they are even called baby boomers.
---
It won't.  It'll be used a bit in the first week as a joke but since you won't get any icons people won't wanna use it.  It'll stay on Twitch where it belongs.
---
100g on vanilla people were complaining.
---
To be fair, pserver players aren't necessarily representative of the general population.
---
I would rather just have classic continue in a classic mindset, not saying anything bad about TBC, it's just, it really isn't the same game
---
Release and phase 2
---
I'll read a guide over to get some ideas and the jist of the good areas and questlines to look out for but when it comes to actually playing, no I won't be alt-tabbing to a guide or using an add-on.
---
It would actually be awesome have a spreadsheet of every 10 levels, t1, t2, t3
---
T3 is better than warlord year?
---
in 12 months in sure of it
---
But the term boomer already means something extremely specific. They are called boomers because it was a BOOM in childbirth as a result of all the vets coming home and fucking like rabbits. Where is the BOOM on describing millenials as boomers? It makes no actual sense.
---
I've played wow for over a decade on both sides of the sword and plan on  going alliance. To me, their cities are just better  to spend more time in while messing with bank alts and such. That's a large part of the game for me.
---
Having played both sides extensively, you will find a decent community with whatever side you choose.
---
You know that daily quests have been around since classic, the best example is silithus
---
Where did you come from, where did you go?  Where did you come from cotton-eye joe
---
Lock gear is largely tied to raid gear. Theres some adjustments that im not sure of, but this gear list should be helpful
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aKD1SXeQWfoZKHO7zZUnQk3iixzfYF_BqkzQ-V_Pj6U/htmlview
---
Try playing a warrior, 48 days played for lvl 60 for you :P
---
So many people know this content that in time there will be pugs for most all major raids but no one appreciate anyone that comes in under geared.
---
Now I wish I could see what it said.
---
The #nochanges crowd should be demanding 1.0, not 1.12, because apparently balancing and patching is bad.... Let's intentionally have bugs and unbalanced classes because _thats_ what made classic great kappa
---
Play on a fucking PvE Server you pussy Streamers, if you can't handle it!
---
If you’re not trying to be a speed demon leveling you should have enough gold to get your first mount soon after forty, no need to vendor the leather. Follow a guide to see how much of each you need though, and vendor/ah the rest for sure
---
It's SLIGHTLY worse. I mean, you still get escape artist and the +engineering with gnome. Pretty decent for pvp. 
---
30% less threat from salv is just too big imo, but I do put more emphasis on pve so to each their own.
---
Once or twice, at all. I was in high school with strict bed times and the computer was in the basement and I was on the 2nd floor once i was in college with BC/WOTLK i raided a lot. In wotlk i was up to 5-6 nights a week 4 hours a night.
---
Geez. He's so bad!? How is this guy popular?
---
As a Tank that was painful to watch Taunt off cooldown while his healers getting pelted with Shadowbolts and he's just standing there watching it happen.
---
No. Everyone needed the BoE rares as well. LFD didn’t change anything I don’t know where you got that assumption from.
---
I see it from both ways. But ultimately I think it's up to the person with the ability to open the chest. With out a person capable of opening the locked chest it might as well not be even there. Furthermore it's a bonus for the people that take the time/gold to have the ability to open locked chests.
---
Thrash blade
---
I would say so. Atiesh is def better than even R14 wep. R13 gear is gunna be a mega grind as well.
---
Thanks!
---
Does this have anything to do with PvP?
---
Thanks
---
You will lose a good amount of time if you level professions along the way. Hunter?
---
And QD brought back wPVP in a big way on my server
---
Ill just be skinning along the way, playing rogue
---
I remember reading this when it was printed and just knowing Bill Amend had to play.  It was too perfect to be done solely for the sake of an audience.  He even got the math right on the weapon's dps in the tooltip.
---
Thier where other ways to earn money, why did they feel mandatory to you?
---
Its pve BiS but lock does best with raid gear. Pvp gear for all classes really doesnt compare to raid gear. Remember theres no pvp stat yet
---
I plan on duo leveling with my fiance. I'm rolling warlock, she's rolling priest. Will gear sharing suck, and what professions should we each choose?
---
Also as soon as you get access to a salt shaker start refining deep rock salt. It’s a two or three day cooldown, and even if you can’t use it, it’s good to start stockpiling!
---
T3 isn’t till like phase 3 though right?  Almost 2-3 years down the road
---
So would you rather AV be two separated PvE races where neither faction can interact with each other, but the quicker faction wins?  Because any cross-faction fighting would reduce potential "rewards per hour".
---
Defending in AV does not reduce "rewards per hour" if your attacking force succeeds, as a win is 3x the reward of a loss.  Now, if the attacking forces on both sides fail, then yes the "rewards per hour" are reduced for everybody on both sides.  But I generally play games to not only have fun, but to win.  Letting the enemy side get to my side's final boss will potentially lose the battle, so preventing or slowing the enemy from getting there is sometimes necessary to win.
---
Release will likely be whatever your pre-raid bis is, as theres no honor rewards yet
---
In Vanilla I did Tailoring/Enchanting on my Warrior.
---
Made Bags and Wands for the AH with all the cloth I'd farm off easy to kill humanoid casters.
---
Then I would create greens and Disenchant them for dust for enchants or the AH.
---
I'll probably do something different this time around
---
Yes but stamina is really good and many of these BIS pieces have veery little of it.  Not to mention some near useless stats like crit and too much hit.  (I believe you only need 2 % hit in PvP)
---
Will do!
---
I quit sometime in BC and dailies was a big part of why I'd soured towards the game (technically I limped into WotLK but didn't level much before quitting).
---
Timegating = not respecting your players' time. You can't plan, schedule, and execute on your own terms.
---
Give me back the design philosophy that allowed me to grind rep 30 minutes one day, skip a day or two to get real life stuff done, grind 8 hours on a rainy Saturday, and never once feel like my arm was tied behind my back or that I was now eternally behind someone who logged in for half an hour every day.
---
TIME should be the currency for progress, NOT # of days logged in.  If someone wants to no-life a rep to exalted in one day, that's their perrogative. It would be insane to argue otherwise with any other game.
---
https://pastebin.com/v0f83deX
---
Check this out, may be some good info
---
Oh gotchya that’s what I need to know
---
Well good thing Classic will fix all of those "bugs" for ya so you can still get your ass clapped by a high warlord warrior!
---
If you're planning on leveling LW at any point then you'll obviously want to save it. Either level up leatherworking alongside it to 60, or send it to a bank ult. When it comes to leveling, you can either vendor it for quick cash or send it to a bank ult to sell once the market stabilizes.
---
The point is its his choice to farm what he wants for what rewards he wants, the game doesn't just direct him toward a set of dailies that are too lucrative to pass up.
---
oh ok, so then dungeons will always be better than questing and grinding
---
Yup, there wont even be honorable kills until phase 2
---
Yeah thats what ill do
---
When they say things like "This is an old one from 2014" or  "this one is from way back in 2011" i feel like these are aimed at my 9yr old, cause to her that actually is "way back". When I was in my teens I always said I would keep up with the times...unfortunately the times sound really dumb and I will pass.
---
If by all those bugs you mean one specific one. Sure.
---
Yes it will suck and cause many relationship issues. But honestly, if you two are set on those, go for it; otherwise, you could roll an easier combination to share on.
---
Where did you hear that and what is the logic behind it because that doesn't make much sense.
---
Joana
---
Well on the two servers I played on, that is what we did.  Once LFD and people ninja'd stupid shit, everyone started rolling need on BoEs that they only intended to DE or AH.
---

Why not implement BGs without cross realm first and if queues are really taking days like some people are arguing then implement small groups of 2-3 realms?
---
The only real argument I can see people are making is that queues may take hours. So why not take this approach first for the underpopulated realms and go from there?
---
I am strongly against x-realm bgs and this is most likely going to be a deal breaker for me as it will be for a few other people. This seems like a pretty fair compromise to me.
---
I'm not making anything up. I believe you that it was mostly 2v2's. All that means though is that the server is unpopular. Most likely because as I said. A game designed like that is always dominated by the mob the instant it becomes popular. I've played enough full loot games to see that.
---
Sounds like a preference you don't have. Not really that crazy, some people like to do something a little different.
---
Very true. There's a much bet5er chance you can get axes than getting a TF.
---
If you don't have the axes though then Trolls are still slighty better by a c-hair.
---
It's definitely a gamble though, I will agree the safe pick would be Orc just because once you have an Axe you won't need Edgemasters Handguards unless you get a really nice Dagger/Sword/Mace to replace it.
---
Phase 3???? Phase 3 brings bgs, phase 3 will be here. Y feb/March of next year at the very latest.
---
Warlord gear is great and comparable to T2 
---
T3 is the good good.
---
Why? With wq you don't have to backtrack
---
Crit is fine, and In conflag spec it’s actually really good. It’s not bad in sm ruin either, it’s really only bad if you’re SL or don’t have any points in destro. I actually just made a list for it today for p1, there’s not many options though it’s mostly just t1 and t2 stuff with azuresong mageblade and fire runed grimoire. Trinkets and off hands are gonna be swapped out a lot though if you’re serious.
---
...So you would rather everyone run broken tooth? the currently planned version has LESS options and less variation available
---
You could've won the 1 mil lottery; instead you spent your luck on flips.
---
If he really wanted to be different, he'd roll druid,shaman. They'll be the least played - so that will add 75% more fun!
---
Man reading this SR I don't feel as bad being a man child.
---
Actually really interesting, I don't personally have access to the beta is there anyway you could cite a source or provide some proof for this?
---
I think  Sodapoppin  and Asmongold have a shitty attitude. But, in the same time, it's fun to watch them getting pissed off or rage.
---
Esfand and Bajheera are chill.
---
In Vanilla, we raided 4-5 times a week for 3-4 hours. The inefficiency is astounding in retrospect; with all that time invested we barely scraped AQ40.
---
For Classic, I’ll be resurrecting a former mythic guild. We will raid once per week (with an optional weekend time), and even though we’re not going to be tryharding Classic raids, we will definitely reach Naxx and, with a little elbow grease, I expect us to clear it.
---
I'd argue Druid is the hardest class to master at 60 in Classic/Vanilla.
---
Very VERY hard class to do well with but if you see a master Druid in PvP (even PvE) it's like watching an artist.
---
&gt;No one can be that stupid.
---
The video proves you are wrong. ;)
---
Wait what I through phase 1 brought BGs.  Help me out with the timeline here...
---
i'm still choosing betwen mage, lock, priest or shaman. but i have like 90% change of going shaman
---
This Pat video is always a great. Gear is king in classic pvp. I remember one shotting pugs with with fireballs and POM pyros all the time when I had Nax gear. It wasn't balanced at all. It was hilariously awesome.
---
ive probably seen vc cause way more confusion then just using DM ever has.
---
True. Gl with troll, you seem to know your stuff so im sure tf will find its way to you
---
Noob.
---
I’m pretty sure most serious pvpers are going to be SL.
---
What is it with people thinking the vanilla/classic experience can even remotely be the same in any other way than just getting a somewhat close replica of the old game? Setting yourself up for disappointment with that attitude.
---
how the fuck do you fall for this? these guys are joking.
---
I like Warrior because it's a challenge and a grind to hit 60. Once you do you feel so accomplished and then you get to have fun in raids and the sense of accomplishment just keeps coming steadily depending on how much time and effort you put into being a good Warrior.
---
did you contract the same disease as tipsout?
---
from reading your other posts, you clearly are not knowledgeable of vanilla, so why pretend to be?
---
it's gross that you care so much about appearing knowledgeable while not giving a shit about misleading people.
---
What's your source on that?
---
You sag your Not good and dont want to Play heal but like Play Caster in a Group? Got. the Perfect class for you: Warlcok! Why? #1Easy leveling(vanilla leveling can be hard) #2 free 60% mount(big Thing in vanilla) #3 Tons of grp buffs (healthstone,Spülsteine,curse) and #4 you can Port ppl to you means if you dont afraid of walking everyone Wants you in grp so atleast 2 can keep questing meanwhile..  warlock got more benefits but should be enough.. ah and why Not mage? You Said your Not good .. Mages have to sheep resheep and Crowd Control everywhere (Dungeons, bg, leveling...) As warlock you got fear and you DONT fear in Dungeons and so you got. mitging to do except do dps as caster in grp 
---
That’s it sry for bad English x)
---
Your first mistake was calling it VC
---
What makes you say that? SL is pretty much only useful for dueling and some wpvp, it has a small niche in premades but in most scenarios it’s outclassed by other specs. The spec is a bit of a meme at this point tbh, although it is really good at what it’s good for.
---
I have no idea what you mean, I’m just generally trying my best to give what I can about this game that I’m trying to learn about, I feel some perspective is better then none and a lot of threads on this subreddit go unnoticed sometimes. I am not trying to appear knowledgeable at all, so I apologize if I look like a dick, or stupid, I’ve heard this before so I apologize.
---
I've played a dwarf/orc hunter since before burning crusade and I'm mixing it up this time around. Here's what I think is "best":
---
Roll a Nelf
---
Access to an owl from the starting area, then teach it screech from a westfall carrion bird = sleeper pet
---
Shadowmeld gives you the upper hand in both pvp and solo dungeon runs at 60
---
Base agi though not powerful, is a nice bonus and always useful
---
+bow skill is actually useful considering the weapons available in classic end game are not guns
---
Nature resists are useful
---
Jump flips are sweet
---
I'm not necessarily a cat person, but nelf mount animation  &gt; dwarf mount animation
---
Doing the vast majority of all quests in classic will only put you at revered with all but one rep on alliance side, and high honored with one of them IIRC.
---
Getting another races mounts is a post-60 thing with cloth hand ins.
---
So, the way it works right now on the beta: I launch the battle.net app and click on world of warcraft. There's a dropdown menu that lets me swap between my different accounts and versions of the game (bfa, ptr and classic). It prompts a download for the version you try to launch if you don't have it installed.
---
I would think the survivability would be a necessity in high level group PvP
---
You wouldn't be able to kill anyone because they'd all be rogues.
---
And not just 1 rogue nono, a group of rogues stealthed together to minimize any odds of getting jumped and killed, you'd let 1 rogue kill mobs while the others lie in wait to jump anyone that gets baited.
---
Sounds like fun!
---
40 man pugs?
---
I mean that rabbit hole has already been dove into, since raids will be released while already having class buffs/nerfs that weren't present when the raids were originally released.
---
Was friends with a druid back during vanilla who was great bear tank and because of him, druid was the 2nd class I played and dwarf priest was the 3rd. 
---
I actually look forward to being a bear tank once I'm happy where my hunter is at.
---
Haha. But that's why I assume it's a troll video for attention. He does something dumb so someone clips it and posts it here and we're all quick to watch the video and laugh at him -- but now he's got more views which means more money, right? The old "no such thing as bad publicity" thing. 
---
So he's either a genius... or a total moron who has been carried for over a decade.
---
I think it won't be too bad. You'll probably be doing a lot of quests, so just be sure to get most of your items from those rather than relying on dungeons.  
---
Also between the two of you should get tailoring and enchanting, and make lesser/greater magic wands for yourselves.
---
There were a few different WoW based Foxtrots back in the day. I remember cutting them all out of the Sunday paper back in high school. Best thing about Sunday’s was grabbing the paper to see if could get my WoW fix while at work waiting to go home and play... bet they’re all at my parents somewhere, I’ll have to go find them soon and get me some r/classicwow karma lol
---
I think the main problem is I'm doing this as a Mage, and Darnassus doesn't carry a Mage trainer. If I run over at Level 12, I ideally want to back twice: At 20 for Teleport IF/SW, and at some point to actually get useful skills.
---
Oh man, I remember when this first came out. It was so good.
---
I hope so! 
---
I had the left binding on my Warrior for months in Vanilla but just never saw the right drop. I hated that I saw Rogues and Pallys with it at TBC Launch. I eventually got it on my Paladin farming it years later but to this day the right Binding hasn't dropped for my old main Warrior.
---
GL in Classic man!
---
I mean you could probably level most cooking levels with it but honestly I like slamming through the first 50 or so levels by cooking bread since you can buy the mats from a vendor for super cheap, and you should be picking up a lot of meat from beasts you kill while leveling which should really help your cooking too. Most foods vendor for more than the mats do so it helps you squeeze out a little more money from drops. Fishing is more supplemental but there are a few money makers that make leveling it up worth it. Deviate fish, oily blackmouth, firefin snapper, the seasonal squid/salmon, and stonescale eels.
---
I made the educated guess that the majority of peeps jazzed about classic were college-aged at some point when this content was relevant
---
I believe there’s honor decay on repeat kills, no?
---
You will have no problems to find enough warris for every finger of both hands sir
---
My own personal reference is when I played back in ‘05. As for definitive video comparison proof? Suggest you watch a BETA streamer and ask them to show you so you can compare yourself.
---
Here is a long winded discussion of it with varying points. 
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/reputation-gains-seem-to-be-off/177300/17
---
Zodar and Vokire both provided good links &amp; details to provide sufficient evidence on this topic.
---
Be sure that when validating rep/quest you review data from classic and not TBC or WoTLK as changes did come into effect pre-Cata.
---
Zug Zug
---
Also you don't feel like you missing something when you are not logging in for one day. With dailys you always had the feeling you need to log in today and that sure sucked especially when you had to do like 20 or sonof them in WotlK...
---
Somehow, as a PvE player, the idea that I shouldn't get flying so that gankers can more easily find people to gank? That makes me want to scream and throw things.
---
I suggest no-fly realms.
---
It's not even about anything like the leetspeek stuff. It's simply emotes. You used to have a small selection such as the lols, wtfs, omgs etc, stuff we all know as basic internet emotes. With twitch it was just taken further, more different types of emotions gained their own symbols. That process was guided and turboboosted by a stream chat being the perfect breeding ground for such things, due to it often being so fast, spamming symbols that convey some type of sentiment is the only way to get your "voice" across, as text simply isn't an option anymore. With the success level of twitch, these new popular emotes making their way into internet pop culture is probably as inevitable as stuff like "lol" emerging into popular use from the depths of some IRC dwellings.
---
What about as an Alliance Mage though? Once I leave to Darkshore at Level 12, I won't be getting skill ups for a long time without consistent trips back.  It seems like they would be necessary for a Mage especially.
---
There isn't a guide out there that says *IF YOU ARE MAGE, GO BACK TO SKILL UP AT LEVEL 16 and 24* and such.
---
I just want to play a Dwarf dual wielding Enhance Shammy in Classic.  But I know itll never happen...
---
No but I always have a browser open on my second monitor.
---
I mained a gnome mage and had a human rogue alt in vanilla. Excellent fun.
---
Cant answer all of your questions but I know for a fact that the answer to your 3rd question is Yes, I’ve seen it on streams alot.
---
a geared feral wolfshead dps will be on the top of the board tho.
---
Eh not as much as you’d think, the issue with sl in premades is mostly that your dots are just going to get dispelled and you have absolutely no burst. If you go nf/sl which is the usual sl build you just end up kind of useless outside of fear and putting tongues on healers, which is kind of your main job anyway but you’re just much less useful than the other specs that can do what you do but also have much better damage potential. Like it does have its place like anchoring in AB but it’s not some universal god spec that it’s made out to be.
---
I'm confused, how did we get from angry drunk beta rejects to star wars?
---
I havent seen mages abusing clearcasting so I assume per cast
---
Yes good
---
Hey you seem to know what you are talking about and I like the cut of your jib. Recommend any good wpvp leveling specs?
---
Oof, the humor has certainly aged.
---
Thank you!  It's definitely good to know. I know mages have slowfall but the blink interaction is much more convenient and doesn't require any mats.
---
No, burst damage is a necessity as a warlock. You’ll have healers to help your survivability so it’s far less critical. You need to be able to burst down an enemy flag carrier.
---
How do you approach Darkshore as Mage? Because even Joana's guide, it doesn't have you go back to IF/SW until like, level 26..  But it does send you to Wetlands at 24. That would mean your last skill ups as Mage is Level 12 all the way until 24 if you go back to IF first That doesn't seem right.
---
If you left at Level 12 to Darkshore and don't skill up until you are in Wetlands at 24, you miss out on.
---
Arcane Explosion, AI rank 2, fire blast rank 2, frostbolt ranks 3 and 4, blink, evocation, rank 3 water, blizzard, rank 3 frost armor..
---
I feel like that's a lot of valuable skills to miss out on for a 12 level gap when you won't be doing dungeons either due to speedrunning.
---
Great point, but I feel like it’s the same with frost mages vs fire but is sure you will see far more frost mages than fire.  I could be wrong!
---
The link you gave me is about getting less rep the higher level you. I'll have to find a video of a streamers leveling and compare it to private servers. But I'm sure if it was very different from private servers we would have heard something as of now it should be possible to become exalted by level 44 or so by leveling through the night elf zones there are a couple videos on it by staysafe confirming the reputation values from private servers and vanilla.

&gt;Dragonbreath Chili no longer recieves a bonus from your +dmg/healing as of patch 2.2.0
---
This means that before patch 2.2.0, it did receive a bonus from that gear
---
Enchace and ret can actually heal/DPS while you level, and it's fun. At cap...in pvp hybrids are real.
---
I have played on 32" Monitors (Single and Triple), 34" Ultra Wide, and currently 27" monitors.
---
The game looks great in Ultrawide. Definetly worth it to play with a 49" Super Ultra. 
---
The cons are going to be scaling issues. You can use MoveAnything to center everything in the middle of the screen (I've done this and the downside is sometimes vendor/inspect/social tabs will overlap). The biggest issue is that Vanilla scaled horizontally meaning your chat bubbles and scrolling combat text are going to be massive compared to a single screen. 
---
For me that wasn't worth it as I enjoy the default Blizzard UI. But if you YouTube "Playing WoW with ultrawide/triple monitors" you'll get results of how it is going to look. The nice thing is with BFA's client, you can scale the default scrolling combat text to be correct.
---
Three best options for self sufficiency, depending on what you like:
---
Hunter: pet tanking, good mobility with aspect of the cheetah, also welcome in dungeon runs and raids. 
---
Warlock: Pet tanking, decent AoE mob farming, pretty fast leveling and good raid utility. 
---
Druid: basically travel form as a bonus, good all around self sustain and healing while leveling. Enjoyed in battlegrounds as a flag capper, or raids as a healer. 
---
All of them will farm mats about the same, Druid might have a slight travel speed edge, but warlocks also get a free mount at 40. I think(?) warlocks AoE farm mobs quicker, but that’s about it. If you just want to do herb and ore runs, any class works fine.
---
There isn't a profession that won't hinder leveling. Even skinning will add several hours to your /played time to 60.
---
But if you don't care THAT much, then you take skinning and herbalism. Once you're no longer able to get the herbs in the zone you're leveling, you drop it for enchanting and DE quest rewards that aren't worth vendoring.
---
Not everyone wants Priests in fact more people probably want Mages. Only 1 heal spot in a group but 3 DPS spots and Mage is probably the most desired DPS in groups.
---
Also won't offset you being bad at all it will amplify the fact that you're bad.
---
I low key really want to main a gnome mage. And a night elf druid. Human warriors look fun too. Ah shit, Its so tough to just choose one!
---
I kinda wish I could tweak what the drunk guy in the pic says , feels like it's lacking just a tiny bit of extra spice! something like this : 
---
"Fuck! where's my beta key?! also fuck streamers, hic! " .
---
Apologies for the weird comment, i just kinda imagined it would fit the image more :p
---
So you’ll get 7 in a row once every 15,625 attempts (if my math checks out).
---
Yeah there were mc,  zg and bwl pugs pre bc.
---
yeah the kind you can disarm on a rogue if you're careful
---
I wrote out an answer but then realized its too valuable information
---
Git gud
---
Agreed, but sometimes very risky. I remember the great lift in thousand needles, died alot of times there because i blinked too soon/late
---
So you’re saying don’t do any profs till 60 so it doesn’t slow down your leveling and you can make more gold at 60.  I understand this logic but it seems to me all the mobs you would have killed to 60 and all you have to do is right click then with skinning would bet you a LOT of gold.  Probably more than it would cost you to farm at 60.
---
People on here are all boomers change my mind.
---
Well, that's what pve servers were for. I was actually the one running from a fight 100% of the time back when I played. And another person pointed out why my 3rd point isn't that different from regular ground mounts anyways. Wanted to cover the core issues that people have.
---
I do remember feeling like a sneaky slippery badass when escaping pvp by rezing in a weird spot, mounting up quick, and running away along a route I pre-scouted as a ghost.
---
I don't remember ever feeling cool doing the same thing but simply flying up.
---
At least mages and locks could farm their brains out after raids for gold and shit, unlike us healers. Trust me, as two of the best farm classes in the game, backspace issues don't compare to that of a healer's or a tank's.
---
But a mage didn't had to conjure drinks for healers if he didn't want to. Though would've been very unfortunate if say midway an encounter he'd suddenly drop off the damage chart due to a bad case of nohealingitus.
---
Which class appeals to you more? Play that one.
---
Because gearing is so slow, you won't be that far behind the hardcore raiders that started 2 months before you. 10 bosses dropping ~2.5 items each is 25 epics a week between a guild of 45-50 raiders. In 2 months someone might have 4 MC epics. So if you're a good player and work on dungeons for pre-raid gear you'll still be able to get picked up by a good guild by BWL. You might just miss all the MC firsts.
---
Did not know that you can get in the queue for BGs from the city so everytime i wanted to do a WG or AB or AV i walked all the way to their actual location in the world.
---
If I had to guess blizzard will eventually do fresh servers as the player base starts dropping, and once that happens everyone will just abandon ship and move to the newest realms, it’s a bit of a meme in the pserver community at this point.
---
You should bomb nearly everything else take stuff put it to the ah and them for extreme cheap at ah cause as you said a lot of ppl kill em for quests. I mean we talk about copper..
---
I have read that this is post-2.3, which means all dungeons had undergone considerable change (and nerfs, if I recall correctly).  Many mobs had level changed as well.
---
If damage is matching the post-2.3 data, that is a real concern.
---
&gt; So would you rather AV be two separated PvE races where neither faction can interact with each other, but the quicker faction wins?
---
I am not talking about what I would rather, I am talking about what will happen. What I would *like* is neither here nor there.
---
&gt; Defending in AV does not reduce "rewards per hour" if your attacking force succeeds, as a win is 3x the reward of a loss.
---
And buying lotto tickets is not a bad investment if the ticket wins.
---
If your argument relies on the assumption that you always win a contested AV, that is not a very good argument. All you know for certain if you drag a game out is that it will take longer, not that you will win. If you make games take three times as long that means everyone (on both factions) gets 1/3rd the rewards in the long run no matter who wins each individual game.
---
Like I keep saying, player behaviour simply will not change unless and until the rewards are changed so that you reliably maximise your rewards *per hour* (**not** per game) by fighting the other team. Since that won't happen in either 1.5 AV or 1.12 AV, it won't happen.
---
If you strictly want to gather stuff, Druid is your best bet. You can pick up herbs and ore in travel form so you save a lot of time not having to mount between herbs. You can also use stealth to get deep into mines to get the ore.
---
But as far as gold/hr goes, Mage is the way to go. You can make a ton of money by AoE farming mobs. The go-to for solo is DME, but there's other things you can farm too. Especially at later content stages, you'll be able to solo AoE farm some of the dungeons, like Strat Live for Righteous Orbs.
---
Its already every Monday
---
I’m honestly sad it’s over.
---
My server pugged everything but AQ40 and Naxx when classic was out.
---
Downsides: Nightmare to balance and will eventually lead to an overly bloated game that requires a steep learning curve like EvE Online.
---
They're also testing to make sure that when they translated all the old data into the new engine nothing funky happened, which is why they're limiting the level cap on the beta, forcing more people to do the same content to catch weird outliers.
---
1. No, 3/3 Imp. Blizzard will remain on the target after CoC.
---
2. Clearcasting chance is based on spell cast. Arcane Missiles gets one chance to proc. Arcane Explosion gets one chance to proc (assuming it hits at least one enemy).
---
3. Yes, Blink resets falling distance, but with spell batching artificially implemented, it's much harder to do on the beta than it is on retail.
---
Nightmare to balance isn’t my problem to worry about.
---
I’m sure all the under 20’s are playing (insert battle royale game here). Or whatever the kids are playing these days.
---
Talking about from a website though. Comparing two items I don't have.
---
That's a bizarre response to criticism of your ideas.
---
There's a few things going on in this video. First of all, he's in full R14 gear, with buffs, pots, and a flask. Second, parts of it were recorded during a week where warriors had an extra talent point- allowing for him to have a 31/21 build with both Mortal Stike and Deathwish. Lastly, it's an edited big crits video to start with. Some enemies have armor, some don't. Sometimes he hits the topend of his damage range, sometimes he doesn't. In several of these clips he has recklessness popped- that's a 30 minute cooldown! 
---
Watch Laintime instead for a more realistic depiction of what warriors can do without all of this stuff.
---
this guy answered your questions and addressed the concerns you raised and then you call him a jack ass right before hoping his family doesn't abandon him? Seems like you're the jackass here. Grow a pair.
---
I mained human warrior in TBC. It was a blast! With just halfway decent gear and a good weapon, I was top 3 of every BG as arms spec.
---
That’s an honest response, tbh I wasn’t even aware you were criticizing it
---
And gloves give a huge buff to mana shield where it absorbs more than IB.
---
Im so happy that I will be playing in EU servers
---
i'm not reexplaining it.
---
Wow thank you!! I plan on (obviously) doing a lot of aoe farming to level/make gold so that makes my talent decision easier. 
---
As for clearcasting, I was 90% sure that was the case but people have been telling me that it was per enemy hit on the private servers or something. Not even sure if that's true. Just needed to confirm.
---
Time to start mapping my leveling path!
---
The thing is in classic if you are good you can pretty much play any viable spec you want and find a guild / raid spot.  Sure it is easier if you play a healer but once you find a guild you will run 99% of things with them so it doesn't matter much what you are.
---
You will have much more fun playing what you like instead of playing a Dwarf Priest and hating it just because it is slightly easier to get in groups.
---
Does srgrafo know about this?
---
Playing official Vanilla, I started in Cata(playing a a pserver made me know what I missed) and damn Vanillas much more fun
---
Yeah, you don't want more than 2 points in Imp Blizzard. That way CoC reapplies it.
---
i rolled alliance warlock in vanilla on a pvp server... never again. i honestly believe alliance lock is the gimpest race/class combo in the game on a pvp server
---
 orc + not facing undead every matchup is the best racial in the game
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bawsup/the_complete_classic_plan_pve_pvp_phases/
---
Most guilds raid two nights a week with some 20 mans on off nights.
---
what a weirdo change, what were they thinking?
---
Geedis?
---
Can always play on a server to get familiar, playing to level 20 gives you a lot of experience with the class to make a better decision. Gives you something to do while you wait for release.
---
&gt;but it seems to me all the mobs you would have killed to 60 and all you have to do is right click them with skinning would net you a LOT of gold.
---
Where does that gold come from?
---
Vancouver WA here!
---
the majority of the pop will not be poop socking speed levelers

Why would someone drop their account because of streamers? Just play on another realm. 
---
All blizzard has to do is announce the server names and types, and all of the big streamers would flock to one server. Having a system to ban people who stream is excessive.
---
I lasted for like 24 hours,   and it was fucking glorious
---
sauce,  Vanilla Warrior who spammed BGs that day.
---
Refresh my memory, but wasn't there a point when you really didn't *need* to do any more dailies? Didn't need to as in: there wasn't anything more to gain. Like say for example by the time someone was clearing Tempest Keep with the character he played since the launch of TBC?
---
This is unrelated but you might find it useful. I've heard many people say that WF is currently resetting the swing timer on the beta. I havent seen any evidence to prove it but I believe the people that told me. Hopefully its a bug and not intended. I am not really sure either way.
---
Skinning is really the only profession that barely slows down leveling.
---
With herbalism / mining you will be going out of your way to herb/mine things in order to make sure you are high enough to be able to gather in the next zones.   Though I believe either is going to be worth it in the long run even if it slows down leveling a bit. 
---
I would say it depends what you want to do after you hit 60.  IF you are switching to alchemy then go herbalism or blacksmithing get mining.
---
I don't know man. People like to clap after a plane lands.
---
he used WOTF  to break your fear and start the Diminishing returns timer,has the 5 seconds of immunity and now hes in melee range. unless you have deathcoil which is also a 2 minute cooldown and then they have a pvp trinket, further diminishing returns and locks have no way to remove slows unless gnome. they will get back in your face and your never getting fear cast off again, even if you did it would last 2 seconds at most.
---
Tier1 is great for pvp, lots of stam and int with some spellpower. That should be your go to in phase 1.
---
This. The only downside of Rogues is going to be that a lot of people will play them. So finding a group will be slightly harder than normal, but all you need is a decent guild and you're set.
---
I know they made it so WF can't proc of itself, not sure about procing off non-ability procs like Hand of Justice.
---
The Blade's Edge dailies are the only ones that I didn't mind for one simple reason, and that being the chance at getting Crystalforged Darkrunes to do that demon event with. Also probably the only instance of essentially "siege weapon"-type of gameplay that didn't get boring within 5 minutes.
---
Dailies are still bad for the overall game though.
---
Pewdiepie just kill it.
---
No changes crew wanted full progressive itemization buddy. Meaning stats changed through all patches as time goes on. So no, 1.12 #nochanges doesn’t ring a bell.
---
AH at 60 mailed to bank alt
---
I doubt higher than 8. Maybe 9 if you world PVP like 16 hours a day or something.
---
PvPers on your realm will be running premade ABs or WSG groups constantly all day (depends what pvp weekend it is).  You will never be able to compete with it just doing world pvp.
---
Minimum level for rank 14 is 58 I believe.
---
You can't get higher than rank 3 until the 30s.
---
Gotcha, welp I guess I'm missing the part where people will have tons of gold to spend at the auction house within the first month.
---
Being a streamer or not makes almost zero difference as to whether you can get rank 14 or not. Can you handle doing the same BG 12+ hours per day, 6 days per week, for 4 months? If so you can get r14 if not you can't. Not sure how streaming helps in this regard other than the fact you don't have to do leave the house to work.
---
Yeah. 10% less per kill on the same target so after 10 you get 0. That resets daily though.
---
Theres gunna be so many bad rogues and flakey people if you show willingness to learn and show up you’ll have no issue
---
What is a warrior without honor tho
---
It depends if you want to heal or DPS.  If you want to DPS go mage if healing go Priest.
---
Either is good in groups / endgame.
---
Being in beta isn’t that important to get butt hurt over not getting in. I know AAA compabies have brainwashed you people into thinking beta is an entitlement, but seriously learn to deal with not getting into a phase that doesn’t really matter that you don’t get in.
---
Man this is the reason, this is what I feel about every single game, for example The Division 2 has plenty of stuff to do but after office I feel I should do dailies then by the time I finish, it's bedtime.
---
After sometime I lost interest in other things and quit the game fully.
---
This is the reason i don't like that mod that day MMOs, forcing people and leveraging that fear of missing out factor.
---
Your friends are a bunch of pussies.
---
Yes he has Beta. He’s been streaming leveling a warlock.
---
early in wow it did require the killing blow for a shard but they changed it in one of the patches to only need to be draining when the mob dies
---
Read the whole thread.
---
Pretty much this. I wouldn't say leadership so much but more so a guildie who has helped out the guild the entire way. The guy that is always out farming potion/flask mats. The guy that you think "oh yeah, he deserves to have Ateish first."
---
Giving it solely to leadership because they're butt buddies with the GM will almost always lead to a guild collapse. Keep in mind that by Naxx, most of your tanks and healers are decked out in their pvp BiS and are getting burnt out on raiding...shit starts getting real tenuous.
---
Wow retail is free till level 20. The game is still very similar but oversimplified. It will give you a good idea. Wow is probably the biggest and most polished RPG ever.
---
Exactly. Everyone thinks it's random.  It's completely controllable though not easy to time.
---
Homogenization, likely largely for arena balance.
---
Leveled as a prot paladin because i thought that  was a cool character concept, after leveling a rogue alt i realized how hard going it really was haha
---
Oh man. Foxtrot exists. I totally forgot about it. I used to have a book of em
---
If you have a microphone and know how to press Tranq shot you will have a raid spot.
---
Thanks a lot for all your input.
---
The fact that they want to make it as accurate as possible so i would assumt itbworks
---
I've been keen in mage the past few weeks. Always a great class to play. I was 90% sure of it 
---
But I realized im not playing this game to be the best, I want to enjoy it and have fun. 
---
I'll be going back to druid. Even though they aren't at all great at anything, I always have had a great time playing one.
---
I was actually thinking something more along the lines of TBC servers. While I think the best way of doing this would be to let people transfer their characters from Classic to Classic TBC, some people might want completely fresh servers. Either debate between the two, or keep the servers as they are and create an additional set of servers that are not transferable to.
---
Summit doesn't look like he's having a good time playing WOW.
---
I remember guides like this. 
---
"Hey guys, here's my 100g an hour guide. I ran SM and got staff of Jordan. Easy gold here"
---
Nowadays dailies basically punish you for missing out, as the resources they give are related to your end game progression. That's especially bad, but back in TBC/WotLK the most effective means of farming gold was just to do dailies. If you didn't do your dailies, you basically missed out on efficient gold farming, and playing while you had depleted your dailies basically meant you weren't farming efficiently anymore.
---
So even without the direct repercussions that missing out on modern dailies have, it still feels pretty shitty to have to work around your dailies in order to maximise your income vs time spent. Vanilla doesn't have this aspect at all, as spending 14 hours in 1 day or 2 hours every day is entirely equivalent. There's no rush or obligation to do anything and you can spend as much time as you want on anything, as at no point are you truly "wasting time" by not doing some particular thing first.

Looking to Level Semi Fast 4-8 weeks on average..
---
Every classic PvP montage had that song and if I don't hear it when classic releases I'll lose my mind
---
Very insightful comment.
---
You can def be a mage or rogue in any guild as long as you're better than the guildless/raidless ones.  Hunter you just need to not be a huntard and you will rise above the rest.  Bonus points if your good at pulling and kiting and then you're essential to your guild.
---
I don't think streamers do it for the flex, I think they do it because it drives viewers up. Whoever gets to something first can put in their stream title "First ever run of XXX Classic" and get a few dozen/hundred viewers, which is ad/donation fodder. Money has always dictated how streamers/youtubers decided what they'd play and how they'd play it.
---
Burning tin
---
You absolutley can get it the second you ding 40 as long as you dont buy useless or not worthwhile spells when leveling.  Dont buy like mad off the AH. Grind during the 30-40 stretch on specific mobs that drop vendor grays. Always have my mount money with ease
---
Maybe if you got a rez you didn’t have to start over, but if you release it resets you to a lvl 1 forsaken. Lol
---
I would try the Discord links in the sidebar. If you know what class you’d like to pair with then I’d try the class Discord. Otherwise you could always try the weekly LFG sticky thread.
---
Literally none of them will say this
---
That was another thought - I remember seeing that when it came to damage a rogue's most powerful move during their "U FUKT" combo did the same damage whether you were using a grey level 1 dagger or a level 60 epic.
---
Mind controlling an enemy faction player into the lava outside MC. This is the only acceptable use of MC
---
Even worse, it's more likely they will try to get you banned for "stream sniping".
---
Umm, you clearly cheated by manipulating RNG with those right strafes in the middle ^/s
---
You say that but players engage in things that give no rewards all the time, like raiding cities or those old Tarren Mill vs. Southshore battles.
---
Ideally, AV would give rewards for time spent or number of honor kills (say 3 marks for every 100 kills) along with a bonus to the winning side so "losing quickly" would not be the quickest way to get rewards, but that's a change that shouldn't be in Classic Wow.
---
I am right behind you. I think I'll have a hunter for farming and a rogue for raiding
---
Yeah but will that ramp exploit that made it possible for anybody to kite still be in 1.12, or had it already been patched?
---
That’s because you need a lot of warriors. Where as most guilds will take 2-3 hunters.
---
Assuming 15k rep is needed, that's still roughly 300 stacks of Runecloth for Exalted. Assume a stack of 20 Runecloth is worth at least 1g (vendor price of bandages) and you're looking at 300-1000g worth of farming before even buying the mount. Definitely not an early endeavor, but probably doable for die-hards in Phase 1.
---
For visible face sets you could just show the actual armor arranged with black space between head and shoulders.
---
On an entirely unrelated note, I would love to see some Vestments of Faith
---
Repeating of course...
---
Daily quests and flying are the only things wrong with bc.
---
It took people years to see dailies as a bad thing
---
Only annoyance I foresee is if you mail gear to get enchanted...You are looking at 1 hour to get to your enchanter and 1 hour to get back to your warrior...it might be more worth getting some people you are cool with that are also enchanters and supplying them with whatever is necessary for the enchant when you need it on your warrior, and doing the same for whatever their alts are. A sort of cooperation pact.
---
are those boron shoulders graphite-tipped?
---
MC will be down within the first seven days. There are teams of people that have been preparing for this and i wouldnt doubt it gets done. At the very latest two weeks and at that point it will be multiple guilds imo
---
To me farming for raids doesn’t. I dig farming though. Dailies made it worse cause they are tied to rep and unlock things.
---
Mindlessly slaying mobs is what I do and have done in MMO’s since I started playing them (thanks UO). Feeling compelled to do dailies for rep unlocks makes it feel more like a chore.
---
I get the other side though. You don’t ever have to do stuff in game.
---
My first Ony kill was a pug and was pretty early in the game.  It was a dumpster fire, but we killed her.
---
Given many of us will recall the fights, I expect some pug groups doing quite well.
---
Blizz pls nerf Environment.
---
That's great for you, but I'm still not convinced that the PvE players who enjoy flying should have to lose it or have it nerfed because of a loud minority of PvPers.
---
In TBC Warlocks were the absolute kings. They were so good in pve and PVP. But Hunter was definitely close.
---
There wont be scaling respawns in classic
---
&gt; You say that but players engage in things that give no rewards all the time, like raiding cities or those old Tarren Mill vs. Southshore battles.
---
"Players" are not a homogenous blob. Some people raid cities or get involved in big world PvP brawls, because they like doing that, and lots of people think that is totally pointless and do not. The people who are in AV, by and large, seem to be people who have their eyes on the prize of AV rep rewards and honour rewards.
---
So arguing "some people enjoy pointless world PvP, so the people who are in AV will enjoy pointless AV PvP more than pursuing AV rewards" missed the fact that these are two different groups of people doing different things with different goals.
---
If it’s 1/5 wouldn’t it be once every 78,125 for 7 in a row? Someone correct one of us
---
All the gear guides I see for casters always talk spell power spell power, stay safe in particular, but from what I remember while playing a mage recently is once I prioritize all that wonderful spell power, I’m OOM. What balance between spell power and int should I be looking for here? Not necessarily looking for a BiS list just a general rule of thumb
---
I was leveling a mage mostly following Joannas guide on a p server recently. The only problem with Darkshore, as you said, is training skills. But if you’re leveling Frost the only skill you absolutely need to level is frostbolt at 16. Taking the boat to menethil and flying to IF the n breathing back isn’t a HUGE time sink.
---
It was VC way before it was DM to a lot of people, no 'needed to be' about it. I'm fine with either, or both, but the people getting into these fights constantly are fucking retarded. Of course different people call it different things.
---
If it wasn't added until 1.11 and Classic stats in 1.12....
---
Don't use wowhead to check when things are added. Wowhead as a website wasn't made before patch 1.11 which means it lists every single pre 1.11 item as 1.11
---
Wolfshead is in the game from launch.
---
Don't trust the patch information on wowhead. Wolfshead was in the game at launch. You can see comments imported from thottbot dated from as early as patch 1.3.0 on the item.
---
8 was the combo breaker!
---
I think it always depended on the specific item. If it was an extremely rare items that sells for a lot on the AH usually everyone needed unless it was discussed prior
---
i mean he just needs 1 wind-furry proc also to one shot any class with that gear.

---
Tl;dr - 15 year old me panic ninja looted Azuregos very early on in vanilla and got blacklisted. And it was an item i couldnt even equip.
---
In vanilla I was invited to a raid 2 days after dinging 60 on my mage to kill Azuregos for the first time he was up on my server. I took the summon and spent most of my time killing the horde that was trying to wipe us.
---
My PC was such a potato that i had sub 10 fps, and my only experience in the game up to that point was leveling.
---
After what seemed like a couple hours, we got him down. I saw that he was lootable by me and was excited that i possibly got something off of this epic dragon! 
---
I opened the loot for him and saw a bunch of items dissapearing really fast and being looted by people, and i saw my first PURPLE item! In a greedy panic i thought i had to seize the opportunity to get fat lootz, so i looted the first purple i could click without looking at what it was.
---
Turns out it was a 2 handed sword called Typhoon, and i was a MAGE. I ported back to Iron Forge and saw every chat channel filled with my name spamming what I had done, as well as a wall of whispers saying deserved but aweful things.
---
I logged off and came back a few hours later to the same thing, in fact it lasted a couple days, i was officially blacklisted and couldnt find a lvl 60 dungeon group at all, everyone knew me. I had to reroll because name changes and server tansfers didnt exist.
---
To this day i tell this story as an advocat for why a sense of community is missing from retail, and how having a reputation on a server makes for a better game.
---
[deleted]
---
If anything, this improves the classic wow immersion.
---
You are the correct one.
---
I don't see the problem here. Isn't this the same in vanilla where people with the collectors edition got the pets?
---
Am I not seeing something? Please don't tell me you're upset because 0,0001% of people gets pets they bought with original Classic Collection Edition 15 years go.
---
no one wants to watch a warrior get kited or chain rooted. its all about the highlights not the average or below average plays.
---
Math doesn’t check out. Should be 1/78125 or 5^7
---
The had these IN vanilla, didn't they? So what's the point...
---
Pets from the **World of Warcraft: Collectors Edition** *(circa 2004)* will be available in World of Warcraft Classic, a re-release of said game.
---
How in Uther's light is this a slippery slope? It's *actually* more authentic, no?
---
Idk why so many people on here go on about the “slippery slope”. It’s literally a logical fallacy lol.
---
Name two dungeons in classic that share the same abbreviation, retard.
---
Yeah because that subreddit doesn't exist lol
---
In Vanilla - Raided Wednesday - Sunday
---
Wednesday - BWL
---
Thursday - AQ40
---
Friday -  Guild leaders choice, generally AQ20, but some alt runs in 
---
MC, Ony, and ZG.  
---
Saturday &amp; Sunday - Naxx Death party
---
They’re referring to the ORIGINAL collector’s edition from 2004. The poster in the screenshot made a mistake in referring to the panda cub pet as a Pandaren.
---
I don't know too much about the guides, but I would probably end up doing something like this:
---
* 10-16 in Darkshore
---
* Hearth back to SW for training
---
* 16-20 in Westfall (including a DM run)
---
* Darkshore for 20-24
---
At that point, I believe that you should be able to learn how to teleport to SW/IF. At that point, set your hearth at strategic points out in the world and teleport to SW whenever you need to.
---
We all know how that played out now.
---
The earliest patch on wowhead is 1.11 on all items. It was in fact available at launch.
---
It will always have a steady flow of people dinging , so I don't think pace is a problem. Even if you are behind, so are 1000's of others. Sweaty gooch stuck to the seat isn't the norm play rate, it's  opposite.
---
Someone needs to meme up the miners as dwarves stopping the twilight cultists from bringing about the apocalypse.
---
Samee, undead to pvp and troll to pve, I really enjoy pvp but pve is really important
---
Double stamp, no erasey, no.
---
Shhhh
---
I think I want to main ne druid too.   I'm just scared I'll want to flex some hps/dps on my friends and I'll not be able to with the class from what I hear.
---
People who have trouble deciding something so simple are absolutely insufferable to be around on this forum.
---
I'm planning on running a priest(NE), and then a mage. Doing the opposite is also something I've been debating as well, but I think this is the format I'll be sticking with. Whatever I'm starting with I plan on taking Herbalism and Skinning until ~lvl20 for the extra skinning money, and then dropping it for alch and use the previously gathered mats to level alch up. My alt would be tailoring/ench so that I can feed it whatever green items I might have come across, as well as some pots and money to keep things going faster the second time around. Because they both use cloth gear they can share, but also herb/alch has always seemed so useful to me (despite my inclination to never remember to use potions...).
---
yikes
---
I'd imagine raiding with that guy (head honcho of the reactor) in charge would be like raiding Onyxia with the moar dots guy in charge.
---
Thats 1 in 48,828,125 chances
---
For real. My record is 5 and I’ve mained night elf since TBC
---
This was a pretty common scam in vanilla, where you'd layer in a pretty expensive listing for people who are blindly clicking.
---
I was going to make. TROLL mage but this works too
---
They said the two games will have no overlap, then they overlap them. I think that's his point
---
I can't wait to tell them to google it
---
They have to make at least one.
---
Naah...go with "AZFive" as your character name.  Dare people to "push your buttons"; they will regret it!
---
The Panda Cub was one of the pets in the original CE. That is what the post about the Pandaren is about.
---
There only questing add-on I'd want to use is one that lists uncompleted quests to make it easier to know where to look if I ever want to go back and complete all the quests after I hit level cap.
---
"Deciding between X and Y". Mate you are mentally masturbating. Its cringey. Pick something and go, it's not that big of a deal as you're making it. Don't like it? Re-roll. No cost.
---
This what my guild did until bfa. It works great imo
---
While I'd be happy if I never saw another pandaren in my life, those things were in vanilla. I think people should be able to use their murky, too.
---
Remember why? Lol oh early tbc shenanigans like the diamond flask scaling.
---
!remindme 2 months
---
Reading it again I guess I can see it that way. The dudes other reply to me makes me think he didn’t mean it in a pleasant way though, lol
---
I'm gonna learn the twitch talk and then annoy the shit out of all my friends (we're in our late 20s, early 30s).
---
If enough of us use it (incorrectly most of the time) the kids won't think it's cool anymore and will find something new.
---
They said no such thing about no overlap between original Vanilla and Classic.  They said no overlap between Retail and Classic.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=8345
---
that's the real one
---
The druid set bonus is pretty much BiS for them due to the movement speed bonus iirc
---
That's why I don't trouble people with "What should I play? Lock or Mage?" posts. It's already been answered a thousand times.
---
Ouch.... I was so hyped for classic again but honestly all of this is a let down.
---
Its hard to say no to Rogue. I've been leveling healer classes to about 30, and stealth even as a Druid is so fun. Amazing pvp tool to both find fights that are favorable and avoid them all together. So many saved corpse runs.
---
What an awful keyboard... I love it!
---
I bought this keyboard I think during BC. Still using it today. Single most reliable piece of gaming hardware I own
---
He doesn't stream often and when he does it's not a very lengthy amount of time. But Mark Kern ([grummz\_em8er](https://www.twitch.tv/grummz_em8er/videos)) the Team Lead for World of Warcraft Vanilla streams Thursdays and gives a lot of stories about how WoW came about. He's posted his previous streams that are worth checking out as well. He also talks about the game he's currently developing. Well worth a watch!
---
I feel the same way about people who call it a logical fallacy. Where and when did that concept gain traction? The slippery slope is a prevalent property in so many facets of life, whether you see it in sunk cost behavior or gaming companies falling into balancing their games around new, large user bases in the same manner or peoples' live patterns turning them into their parents though they promised they'd never become that or the legal system regressing into a competitive/collusive malarky or businesses picking a system and then going through the same sequence of logistical challenges that create challenges that create challenges. 
---
Now OP here is false-flag level stupid but that is not proof that the concept is unsound. That is just an idiot or a bad actor reinforcing an fallacy about something being fallacious.
---
I sure hope that TBC wasn't he pinnacle of balance, because it was far from balanced. Locks could easily top DPS with Shadow Bolt spam, mages weren't required except for 1 or 2 encounters, and druids owned arena with Cyclone. WotLK was even worse than TBC.
---
Some might say they couldnt handle it.
---
They are also essentially no lifing it as well. It's hard to play full time and not make progress.
---
If I'm going to main a warrior and focus on tanking, which should I go for an alt character to level? I really only want to focus on two characters with one main and one alt following behind.
---
So Warrior and a Mage?
---
Or Warrior and a Paladin for heals?
---
Does anybody think dwarf priest be oversaturated? I have been considering playing one for the longest time but i've noticed a lot of them on a private server.
---
You are basing your conclusion on your bad experience and then put a wide brush assuming everyone have the same problem as you.. Then you trying to 'troll' the subreddit by claiming you 'keep seeing' people reminiscing about old vanilla WOW. I dont think you are honest  , i think you are trying to troll people here , trying to rage people to response to your dishonest post
---
It seems out of all the classes, the two that always seem to be able to be the best with their tier gear are Rogues and Warriors (granted I know its best for Prot but still). I know most classes can use one or two pieces but it always seems to be best for them.
---
If you say so. I personally don't care one way or the other.
---
Classic will not have progressive itemization BUT it will most likely have patched items.
---
Skinning is trash, u will be vendoring the scraps, and the leather won't make u any more than linen cloth would the first 20 levels. Enchanting is great, doesn't require you to stop questing, frees bag space when u get soulbound greens. Enchanting will do VERY well on launch because every caster and their mom will want enchanting wand at 13. People will skip training skills for 6 levels to get that OP wand at 13. Herbalism is the next best because it's closer to mobs and easier to find.
---
he said the first one is the fastest leveling but worst gold maker, and skinning your kills totally increases your leveling time, standing still for 3-ish seconds after every killed beast is not the definition of speed

yes i agree with your assesment , so many people think just because they are in reddit or forums the whole player population also exists in those outlet.. in reality the vocal voice in reddit and forums are far far insignificant than real players in any MMO.
---
not everyone live 24/7 on the internet and those who access internet not everyone bother to check the forum or subreddit for information.

If you care about pvp, then yeah you're doing yourself a disservice to not take Engineering.
---
If you dont mind losing the fights that would've been winnable with a grenade, then go whatever profession you want.
---
Druids are great tanks, great healers, great duelists, great sustain, great at solo farming high level content, and more.
---
If you care about having fun gadgets, take Engineering.  Otherwise don't.
---
NP, have fun!
---
What was different about tbc Hunter?
---
Hmm I see, thanks!
---
No, but if you want the mounts you may as well level in NE zones. You'll get more rep that way, going back to do the quests for rep later isnt really worth it.
---
Pretty much this, also engineering helps with raiding but not needed (can make it much smoother though).
---
If you plan on taking PvP seriously, then yeah. Engineer will be superior, especially for Hunters as you have a few disengage and incapacitate bombs which can help you get back out of melee range.
---
If you are more PvE then LW will be good early game for your pre-raid best in slots then a few other items later down the track.
---
1.12 patch is instant mail I think
---
Or sodapoppin wanting black lists of people who 'snipe' him, to try to prevent them from getting gear so they cannot snipe him.
---
Dude, if you are playing a PvP mmo and stream, you are going to get sniped. It's part of streaming, if streaming is your job then getting sniped is part of your job. 
---
Let's look at Hearthstone, sniping in that game gives you a tactical advantage and can let a grossly weaker player beat a much tougher opponent.
---
Let's look at WoW, getting 'sniped' in wow is basically just your current location, if you are AFK, and if you are in a group. If they group up on you, you would be dead either way if they found you even without stream sniping. 
---
Many times the streamers have been "sniped" only to have the sniper get dunked on because they suck. You see in WoW when a sniper finds you, he still has to out skill you, where as in Hearthstone they can just usually win because they know what cards you have and what your next move is.
---
This is why stream sniping is bannable in Hearthstone, but won't be in WoW, not to mention it is much MUCH harder to prove in WoW. (Unless you are a stealthed rogue/druid in an obscure location, vanished and they went exactly where you went, or you are AFK in an obscure location where 90% of players have no business being there because there is nothing there (like a random mountain top you have to parkour to get to, or some ocean area with no mobs)
---
Entertaining read. Thanks
---
Dwarf hunter.
---
It's not as bad in1.12 as the soulshards dont disappear at logout, so you can actually stockpile them well in advance just by going about your business
---
&gt; We asked for 1.12
---
No we didn't.  1.12 is the only version of Vanilla they found.
---
idk wtf I am going to do without my minimap ping's telling me when someone is coming my way should I choose to not play hunter.
---
Daily dungeons are bad for the reasons you mention, when I do log in it’s like great que for dungeon and then go about also doing timer based world events right now. The game tells you exactly how to play it. But on the other hand, in BC at level cap this was my log in experience. 
---
Log in, run in circles in whatever city, afk, run in more circles okay cool it’s raid time, do raid, run in circles in city again. Log off. Repeat. 
---
The addition of dailies gives some sort of direction when you’re at level cap and have no reason to play beyond raiding. However they’ve basically turned dailies into something you need to do, with the artifact system and azerite systems. Not to mention the tedious rep grinds for basically everything allied races especially. So when I log in the last couple expansions it’s not longer this feeling of great here’s a reason to play, because I could be leveling Alts and doing dungeons and gearing those but they’d have to repeat the same long daily grind for Azerite that my main has been doing to be able to use multiples of their gear slots and produce halfway decent results in a dungeon or raid. So I log in now, panic about azerite and dailies, knowing I want those allied races that are supposedly a selling point of the last 2 expansions, and I want that azerite (this goes away I guess if you max it out but I took a long break between Legion and BFA and catching up on that right now is a huge chore) and I can’t even begin to think about doing something like leveling an alt because I’d have to double the amount of time I put into grinding dailies.
---
They’ve removed any fun from leveling and doing the end game, because gear grinding is too easy, and we’d know the end game is shallow so they hate us with dailies. I have so many characters at 90-110 but will never touch any but my main now because it’s too much of a commitment. When I finally grinded out the nightborne in legion I was so burnt out on all the rep quests and whatnot I didn’t even wanna make a new toon. 
---
Basically I loved the idea of dailies in BC, most gave a mount or something cosmetic as the end result, or just provided an easy source of some extra gold. But I never felt I had to do these things, they were just options for how to spend my time in this world I loved being in.  I honestly didn’t feel pressured to do dailies until legion, but before the mandatory daily grind there was the forced legendary grinds that started in MoP and eventually evolved into the artifact power system.
---
I only counted 6 in the combo.
---
I was going to go leather working/engineering on my main and have an alt that does mining/skinning.
---
Have another alt parked at the bank/auctionhouse that does tailoring/enchanting.
---
Wow is very much cpu dependent. You’ll be fine for classic, but be wary of ppl that say a 20 year old system will run the game (it won’t)
---
One aspect I'm going to miss from retail is class balancing. Some classing spec being completely useless/really bad.  
---
I want to play Resto Druid. But they lack the versatility of their Retail. And realistically, no one would want a Resto Druid over Priest or Shaman.
---
To me it's the difference in a chore I have to do.  And work I have to do toward something I really want/enjoy.
---
The dailies didn't feel like I was rewarded with the same experience as raid progress as a reward for doing them.  It was just something I had to do.
---
I remember from the Penny Arcade comic, "Sinistine, Bow Of The Black Maiden". The effect on it was "this bow shoots witches instead of arrows".
---
And a mage looted it or something similar.
---
Why did you have 3 blink spells on your bar?
---
They were 10 day trials and I used to see how far I could level in those 10 days. I remember I got to level 15 or so once on a tauren hunter. Was pretty stoked.
---
You get X amount of progress on your rank based on your placement in your faction of total honor earned for that week. 
---
It will be very hard to get into, or compete with the top pvp groups. You can solo grind, however your honor/hour is much slower.
---
I had to grind an additional week then i should have needed because on my last week to r14, it was alterac valley bonus honor week. My pvp group still did wsg and ab during this week. But there was a rank 9 solo mage that literally didnt log off that week and was in AV the entire time because our faction had instant ques for it.
---
He took my rank one and forced me to play 18 hours a day for another week, i had some friends help me through this week because i was so exhausted at this point.
---
As dope as getting r14 was, it just wont be doable by 99% of people. And to be honest, just not that worth it.. just get an ashkandi and settle for rank 12.
---
Man those AVs were quite a production. Hours and hours long.
---
To say Blizzard loses money because they're banning bots that pay subs isn't correct.  They sue the companies that sell gold and that create bots for large amounts of money and have even won the rights to a gold selling website before.  It's also a win/win because Blizzard sues anyone they feel is harassing their customers which also could cost them money.
---
I don't like multiboxing and agree it's not healthy for the immersion and RPG aspects of the game, though the impact on the economy is questionably low.  But we're not going to start limiting accounts to one per household.
---
I was somewhere around the level 45 mark on my first hunter when I learned that the best gear wasn't simply whatever had the highest armor. It could have int or spell power and I still thought it was better since it had a higher armor value.
---
Oh man they were ten? Lol I guess I was a little mixed up! I levelef to bear form and danced away in Goldshire.
---
haHAA :ok_hand:
---
The real problem is saying VC instead of DM.
---
And no, it is not hard to shift click to see what level the person is
---
I can not wait to kite the add in ubrs back to the dog again.
---
during vanilla i watched a friend go down this route, and you nailed it. he was going hardcore for a couple of months, then when it was "his turn" he vanished from gchat and ventrillo, and he was always in a BG.

Will buying a lvl 40 mount be worth it when having a Druid's Cheetah form?
---
Not if you enjoy world pvp, world bosses, professions actually being impactful, bging, and helping your friends/guild out for their alts.  I wasn't really an alt person myself but helping someone gear their alt through Scholo/Strat/UBRS was fun.
---
You’re forgetting the xoomers
---
 My earliest memory is actually goofing around on the very first private server that was made from the leaked alpha client way before release. Login would put you in Arathi around the Dalaran shield. Couldn’t really do anything, but it was fun just looking around and chatting with people.
---
I can't wrap my brains around why they won't just make a Blue post about this.  There won't be anything but an overwhelming positive reaction from the community followed by a sigh of relief.
---
The closer to launch we get, the more out of touch with their customers they're starting to feel on this issue.

The best part is when it zooms in on him clicking his action bar

---
Regular Expressions are a very powerful method of searching for one string inside another string.  
---
I have created a simple demo here - https://www.debuggex.com/r/tp07LIJaqF6gYFeO
---
For simplicity, I have ignored the speed component of the previous example.
---
You can that the regex "fishing \+[2-4][0-9]" only matches the lines where the number is from 20 - 49.
---
From all Polls I studied Warrior, Mage, Rogue and Hunter are the top played classes.
---
Warlock seems a decent choice.
---
That's because their racial priest spell is the best of all races.
---
Thanks very much!
---
Lol not gonna happen at all on pve servers. Theoretically if you got 5 guilds on each side to organise TM zergs every night you could, but realistically it will never happen.
---
The Druid might surprise you.

It could also be only 5^6 because you would only start counting if you did a flip.
---
If you've got enough gold for lvl 40 spells and then some, go for it. I usually get my mount around lvl 45 when I'm playing druid. Travel form is much better when you're questing anyways.
---
I'd rather they just update the game with patches beyond 1.3, curate content then have players vote on what gets in. increasing level caps is what got us to such a crappy leveling experience in retail.
---
Phase 1 probably won’t be as bad as far as the skulls ganking and itll be too early for twinks.
---
Funny, I am actually in the same dilemma with the same classes.  
---
I played a rogue in vanilla and loved it. I was also very young and didn’t get to raid much with him. 
---
On the other hand I have played lock since cata and really love the lore behind them. (Also free mount is nice)
---
Once AV rewards were no longer current content, the defense style matches made a comeback for a while.  It was not too rare to see one of the bosses get summoned if you played AV enough, even into Wrath and  Cata (even if the resource limit meant they rarely had enough time to do anything). I saw *both* bosses get summoned at the same time in late Cata, maybe early MoP.
---
But my original point was, pre-nerf zerging was much more difficult.  So difficult that it was hard for *either* side to advance to the point where Blizzard nerfed the NPC's to make it easier for the offense to push.  If classic went back to original AV, zerging on a "win quick or lose quick" mentality would rarely work because 100% of the players won't agree with that, and even a minority of players could stop the enemy zerg with the help of the NPC's.
---
Work work
---
That part though was limited in who could even do that.
---
I wouldn't mind it if you couldn't afk mount in the air.
---
The arguments about seeing the world I can actually be ok without doing so at the point you can fly since you saw most of it before you could fly.  But the safety of flight was sad to me.
---
I guess I gotta start watching him then
---
For PvE at 60, hit, crit, and spell damage are your preferred stats. But while leveling, spell damage is hard to come by. The benefit of having spell damage is being able to kill a mob in 5 Frostbolts instead of 6 (just as an example).  But because large amounts of spell damage can be hard to come by while leveling, I can understand why you might want other stats to prioritize mana and reduce downtime instead. Pick stats according to the kind of playstyle you want to use.
---
Or perhaps they've run the numbers and realized there's just no evidence to support RP-PVP Classic will have a large enough population to sustain itself.
---
You can go to Stormwind to learn them. Not too far of a run.
---
A lot of people are going to be taking engineering. A lot of people are not going to hit 300 engineering.
---
Hah that's awesome.   I rerolled DK once wolk came.  I'm so stuck.
---
Running into a dwarf hunter wearing cloth, a robe and some kind of fishing hat looking thing and all of his gear was white or grey items and he was just farming up a storm on tigers in STV and me my friend just stood there laughing and tried to get him to talk to us but he never did.... could have been a gold farmer for all I know, but it sure was a funny sight.
---
or, since you're talking premades, your druid is capping the first flag and you are waiting for it to respawn while the alliance stay in spirit form at the GY
---
Yep, there's a private server that implemented this, players looting players.  It became a cheese fest and pointless to play very quickly.
---
Mage is by far going to be the easier of the two.
---
Probably one of the fastest and easiest levelers. You can teleport, make your own food/water, and will always be wanted by people to do little things like conjure water for them which you can sell for $$$.
---
Highest DPS in game and always have a few mages in raids/dungeons.
---
Priest will be more difficult to level and less forgiving over-all. But in the end game you'll be far more desirable and people will always befriend you and want you around for heals.
---
Mage is easier but not quite as loved as the Priest. Priest is more well loved by raids and dungeons but solo will be harder going.
---
Every hour they don’t confirm RP-PvP we kill a hostage
---
If you're a mage, you're relying on spirit regen, mana gems, potions, beer, food, buffs, and evocation. If you're a lock, you're tapping. If you're a boomkin or ele shaman, you're not in a raid :)
---
8/05/05 was when I first started playing the game, leveling a Paladin in Northshire Abbey wanting to be a Warrior who could heal themselves. I remember most of that first day playing, including trying to figure out how the hell to use the fishing pole, not realizing the Fishing icon was an on-use ability and not like the Two-Handed proficiency icons.
---
Can you link a source for that statement please? That's not what I've seen so far.
---
Mines been Undead Priest -&gt; Orc Shaman -&gt; Tauren Druid 
---
So far
---
I would argue that since every class and spec brings something unique they all have a certain role, yes even oomkin.  
---
Sure retri paladin is terrible raid dps, but it's really good in pvp etc.  
---
In BFA since everything is homogenized, it all just comes down to which ranged spec can do the most DPS or which melee spec can do the most DPS and all the others are pretty much irrelevant since damage is the only metric.
---
Is there a list of all addons that can be installed?
---
on most servers sure, but the groups that constantly do this on pservers will definitely be looking for the highest pop/streamer servers and camping redridge asap, it's kinda their thing. they've already said as much
---
http://www.wowclassicbis.com
---
You're absolutely wrong about Hunters. The gloves are their BiS forever, and the other tier parts are very very solid.
---
If I roll Horde that’s exactly what I’m thinking for my top three as well.
---
Alch/herb to help fight mana issues plus being less optimal dps.
---
Or eng/mine to help boost your dps even more. (Requires buying potions though)
---
To be honest, raiding as oomkin is going to be difficult but having a few of the less optimal in a raid doesn't hurt too much (more than a few does though).
---
Also the most optimal dps oomkin spec outside of raids doesn't take moonkin form (insect swarm &gt; moonkin form)
---
Probably, because I don’t want to level for a year.
---
Is it possible to twink at 49 and stay there until you get to rank 10, so that when you hit level 60 you can buy the PvP set right away?
---
no master list I know of, but sites like [legacy-wow](https://legacy-wow.com/classic-addons/) are useful.
---
Most people HATE feeling like they're missing out on something. Daily rewards makes you feel bad for not doing them. Some people just want to grind for like 8 hours one day and get a fuck ton done then not touch it for awhile. Time gated content feels horrible.  
---
When you take away that choice you drive away a lot of people.
---
I'm going tauren druid this time instead of NE.  I'm really gonna miss wisp form though.  Many a time getting the drop on someone after being ganked because they misjudged the time back from a GY
---
More meme spec guides pls
---
I don’t think there will be many priests to begin with come classic. Private servers have more min maxers which could explain what you noticed.
---
a big issue will be possible faction imbalance. i think historically pve servers have been very alliance-heavy, which is even less incentive for an under-populated horde to flag up
---
There are class couples as I call them and these are one of them rogue warlock ,     sham/druid   etc. I am going lock, was rogue in 2004
---
Same man.  Who knows, maybe I’ll just try something new and roll a mage or hunter.
---
You can, but I've been banned for that. The message said 'Manipulating the economy.' all I did was buy things that were underpriced and resell them.
---
It's a toss up. I played a ton of druid in Vanilla, Cheetah form was very useful for gathering herbs. If you're going to be doing a lot of herbalism, stopping and starting constantly, then no I'd say it's not a huge difference. I would still get my mount as early as possible, there are times when you just need to get somewhere a little faster (being chased, chasing someone etc.).
---
To start it won’t be bad and any ganking will just be groups of similarly leveled players going for each other. 
---
As time goes on we likely will see it get worse but I think a lot of people will wanna go about their business just like they do during a new expansion.
---
Person other than grunt.  Like us AF guys.
---
Then why would they say they will open them after launch. It makes no sense.
---
My only request is make it a bit more mobile friendly. I browse your site a lot from my phone and iPad. 
---
Making the tooltip pop up with 1 click and then hyperlink on two would be amaz No, or some such functionality. 
---
Something so that I’m  not loading like 19 different pages when I want to look up level 60 1handers while I’m taking a dump at work. 
---
anyhow dank site
---
short answer? yes
---
I was 12 years old back in 2006 when I made my first character. I made an orc warrior and started running around the starting area. I saw a lowered area in the rock where I jumped out of after much effort and landed by a river that lead to what I would later find out to be The Barrens.  
---
I swam across the river and saw a bunch of ?? level mobs with a skull that scared the shit out of me. I avoided them and headed to the first town I saw.  It was full of goblins and nobody had any quests for me. A boat pulled up, so I hopped on it.  I still distinctly remember seeing a huge Tauren warrior on the boat with a square shield on his back thinking 'Is this guy gonna kill me? Wait, the cow guys are on our side. He probably thinks I'm a noob. I'm probably not supposed to be here.' 
---
I arrived in another goblin city, and still nobody had any quests for me. I thought  to myself 'Yeah, I'm not supposed to be here' so I logged off and proceeded to make 10 other toons before settling on a human warrior.
---
Rank is calculated relative to other people on your faction - on your server. 
---
So PvP flag up - and find like minded people of the opposing faction. If you flag in a high level zone, like the Plaguelands, Winterspring, Ungoro -- you'll find folks who want to flag. 
---
I had loads of PvE server experience in classic. PvE means you can PvP *when you choose to*. It doesn't mean no PvP. Sure, you can't gank that priest who just wants to farm herbs -- but for every one of *those* there is a warrior, bored, looking for trouble.
---
I'm planning to have an army of L35 alts with Tailoring/Alchemy to just use their Mooncloth / Arcanite cooldowns. I don't think those will ever stop printing money.
---
PC, at 2560x1440 in Google Chrome.
---
They have said no such thing.
---
Thirding Laughing Skull.  Sup boys.
---
My first memory of WoW was watching my older brother level a Tauren warrior in Mulgore, I thought the game looked sooo boring at first. Every time I looked at what he was doing, he was just running from point A to point B. Lol
---
Once I started my first memory was just constantly making new characters in the Orc zone and lvling to 10, and repeat. Ionly had Trial accounts for a while, every time it ended I’d make a new trial account
---
Ain't impacting shit for me. Stream, don't stream.  Just tell asmon too clean his pigsty of a room up.  Pics of his pad looking like hoarders and shit lol
---
Well, in OSRS you had most of the people who were going to play already playing upon release.  
---
Unfortunately, Blizzard is unlikely to push out advertisements what so ever for this, as they still want their main game to sell expansions.  Having an influx of newer players or random returning players joining in enough of a number post launch months is wishful thinking in my mind.
---
While I appreciate the Bear in Mind pun, that chart doesn’t have balance included, just bear, cat, and healer.
---
Also ClassicDB says it requires a minimum of 285 enchanting, which is why I’m hesitant. I know I can drop it after making it, but I also know I want alchemy at end game so if I have to get almost to max with a profession I’d rather it be alchemy than waste points on enchanting. If it’s only 165, I’d def take it though but idk.
---
Both are fun. Depends on your end game expectations and play style. 
---
Locks in raids essentially just end up spamming shadowbolt over and over so if that sounds boring, you might want to go rogue but they’re pretty one button macro in raids themselves. 
---
For PvP they’re both really solid and it’s playstle preference. 
---
Tough decision. I’m personally going alliance lock since they’re pretty rare.
---
Warrior and a mage to farm gold for all those warrior repairs
---
What do you want your alt to accomplish? What roles/tasks sound interesting to you?  
---
A frost mage is a great farming character, especially in Vanilla. If you like healing, by all means go Paladin! As a citizen of the Horde I am required by law to say " 101 101".
---
Getting rank 14 is based upon how active your servers faction  is IN PVP. you only need to beat the next highest person in CP to be rank 1 and get the 13000RP, do that for like 12 weeks and you're HW/GM. So yeah if phase 2 lasts long enough and there is enough active pvpers than you can get rank 14. but as soon as BGS come out there is no way you;re getting it through wpvp.    
---
so you could do it in 8 hours per day if there not too much in the way of competition and your realm is active enough to have a rank 14.
---
Every time Retail becomes dry of new content, more people will play Classic. They might not ever choose it over Retail and they might go back to Retail after another major patch or expansion, but these "casual" players will eventually hit 60 and want to raid.
---
I love reading these stories. Wow was a large, daunting game back then, so many people only got a fragmented experience.
---
15 years later and there’s still so much to explore and experience.
---
See you in the bgs Lok’Tar Ogar!
---
Beat me to it 😂
---
Yea, most people who have been following this crap closely are well into their late 20's to mid 30's.  
---
I would be surprised if we see any early 20's or teens in classic.  I just don't think it is going to be pushed by blizzard at all apart from for returning players.  And like it or not, new players are going to have a tough time choosing modern WoW vs a classic version; to them the choice isn't so black and white.
---
Yup
---
I’ve always hated BGs. Open world PvP is way more interesting and immergent. I stepped foot in one once and never again. Preferred the Tarren Mill/Southshore wars which BGs killed off.
---
It was rare to run into kids/teens in vanilla/TBC.  I started vanilla when I was 14 and I was always the odd person out due to my age.
---
Tanking dungeons for a tip - the easiest way to both gear up and earn gold at the same time
---
Rest in Peace Wade Boggs

You forgot all the time Alt+Tab on Thottbot
---
A guildmate went onto most of the major twitch channels and asked them to comment on our plans in [The Blacklist thread](https://redd.it/by3nd0). Almost all of them said the idea alone would be enough for them not to choose our realm.
---
Warstomp -&gt; regrowth -&gt; rejuvenation -&gt; bear form
---
Saved me countless times in vanilla.
---
Hunters are actually pretty awkward in pure world pvp, because very often they don't have enough space to kite you freely, without fear of running into mobs and basically ruining everything for them. And to kill a geared warrior they have to kite for a very long time.
---
It is in no way, shape, or form a necessity.  
---
Yes, you can have an advantage in 1v1 combat with engineering, but in frequent BGs you are just cycling kills/dying often enough to where it really isn't going to matter a whole lot, especially if you like AV and prefer it.
---
Rogues have more to do in pve, they’re a dime a dozen, but the good ones certainly stand out.
---
Locks offer more convenience and are better in group pvp, but are boring in raids.
---
1.12 is to Vanilla as Frozen Yogurt is to Ice Cream.
---
Yeah.  One wipe on Ragnaros and the whole guild has to spend weeks and weeks leveling and gearing up again (without ever dying) before they can give it another shot.  Can you imagine that?  Yikes!
---
Nope, can't cast portals in combat.  According to the Vanilla wikis you can enter a portal in combat though.
---
Damn the edge case gotcha me there, I guess videogame progress is relevant incase you die and give your world of warcraft account to your child so that they can play on your character.
---
for a hunter its a must. you can make ammo and guns as a engineer.
---
you basically fight other rankers that's it. Remember rank gained depends only on how much you get compared to others, so if the standing 1 is 50k or 1mil doesn't matter. What does matter though is the bracket size, the amount of players that get 15hk for the week, since ranking is based on % and I'd reckon a pve server will have way way fewer hit the 15hk
---
Yeah i have seen multiple polls on here and the polls support this.
---
Night Elf Hunter sounds like a fancy way of saying Stealth Archer. It all comes back around.
---
Healers would be everybody's extra best special friends.  Can you imagine the general or world chat spam from dead players begging for a res?  They'd need a special channel for that...especially if a res timer started ticking after death.
---
Yeah, every tv show I’ve tried to watch since has been ruined now. HBO sure knows how to make a docudrama. This might even be better than band of brothers
---
Honestly I think it depends on the streamer you are watching, at some point you are going to find yourself a streamer that you genuinely like listening to and interacting with, along with a chill community to have to gag and laugh with. 
---
You just don't get the same sense of community in bigger streams, like asmongold's; where everyone is trying their hardest to get the big old streamer attention either by spamming @ him in the chat or going as far to stream snipe them ingame
---
They're only up for like 30 seconds though, right?
---
No sorry I looked for the initial news that I read via Discord but could not find it after now 10 minutes.
---
Most the stuff I read about this topic is conjecture, though.
---
They said they'd consider adding them later if there was enough interest. It's nonsensical though, because if they were to add them later the population would be crippled because people wouldn't want to start all over. 
---
That's why we need at least one RP-PVP server at launch. I love RP and I love world PVP. I shouldn't have to choose between the two. RP-PVP servers existed well before patch 1.12. They were part of Vanilla WoW and should be included in Classic.
---
Rogues always have trouble getting groups. There's tons of them and you share gear with a lot of class.
---
I turned 14 a couple weeks after the game released, got it for my birthday.
---
Made a night elf Druid, closest thing to wow I had played at that point was Diablo I &amp; II, so the movement was weird and I was spamming weapon attack like a D2 clickfest.
---
Made a friend in the cave, made it to 20, dicked around in cat form for a bit.
---
Then I rerolled Orc Shaman and never looked back
---
Lok’Tar Ogar!
---
I think people on this reddit underestimate the amount of people that wont be raiding in Classic. A lot of the Vanilla veterans don't have time to raid anymore and will be happy to only do Dungeons and LVL.
---
Do you have a source on this?
---
They're open for 1 minute.
---
Shadow Oil has been confirmed to scale on Beta @ 56%
---
there is no fishing pools
---
I remember on my first or second day in 2005, after my friends logged out I decided to keep exploring. I was only level 10ish, but I had no idea what I was doing and ended up in Ratchet, and for some reason decided to take the boat and ended up in Booty Bay. 
---
Got ganked immediately a few times by the Alliance and logged out thinking how I was gonna need to restart the game because I was lost and couldn't stop getting ganked. But I logged in the next day, took the boat back and learned about Hearthstones, etc.
---
Huh. Yeah you’re right. Good call
---
Thanks for all the work! I've been using your website a lot recently.
---
Since you asked, here's a couple of things I'd want the most:
---
- More options to search by where the items come from: quests, world drops, dungeon drops, pvp rewards, etc. Even better if we could exclude specific dungeons/raids to be able to search according to the phases of classic.
---
- More accurate droprates. They seem really broken right now.
---
I'm planning on playing resto shaman/warlock.
---
Have a wonderful day
---
The [Race &amp; Class comparison tool](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=1046) is good for this kind of thing too.
---
Yup, dailies turned it from a game into a job.
---
&gt;THIS GUIDE ONLY USES ITEMS THAT ARE CONFIRMED TO SCALE ON 1.12 CONTENT
---
- Storm Gauntlets, and once you have the money, Edgemaster’s Handguards
---
- Blazefury Medallion (You are not getting this one though)
---
Any sauce on these scaling? Neither are available to test on Beta.
---
This is all true. One thing to consider is that in a fresh server without a big auction house economy, the more you can get from a vendor for your kills, the better. Leatherworking can be a lackluster profession in a developed server, but for this purpose it just nets you more gold per kill.
---
I'm looking forward to staring at stuck login screens, login queues and frequent disconnects on that day.  Ahhhhhh the Vanilla opening day experience.  Good times, memories and memes will be born on that day.
---
But then we wouldn't have already had RP announced, which is an even smaller community.
---
Even in pvp they're limited, most people will at least try to pug raids though.
---
It's unlikely that lashers will drop nearly as many grays as did on private servers. 
---
So far in Classic beta, grey drop rates from mobs are considerably lower than private servers across the board.
---
I agree with you totally.
---
pvp rewards won't be in phase1.  honor gains used to be a joke for low levels, but not sure about vanilla.
---
Black Lotus was selling for 50-60g on the pserver I played on about 1.5-2 years ago.
---
God that's... still a really tight window to gauge whether you can actually do it and bail or not.
---
Maybe I was misinformed but I remember something from a while back that said that instant mail was a private server thing and that actual vanilla had (and thus, classic will have) 1 hour mail even to your own characters.
---
M+ is dominated by utility, though.
---
Was not aware of that,thanks
---
Druids are the least played race in classic. Extremely desirable resto and feral. Any healers will never have problems getting a group for any content. There's a lot of hybrid builds for druids. Min-maxers use optimal specs and best in slots gear and engineering profession exclusively and they will clear the content in a week.
---
Looks better?
---
WTF are you talking about? There are far more PVE RP players than PVP RP.
---
There isn't much better options as elemental when it comes to boots, and you don't need premade to hit rank 12 lmfao. You can also nature's swiftness into ghost wolf if someone drops the flag if needed in a clutch moment. Please post the boots that sooooo much better than the shaman rank 12 pvp ones.
---
His best time on Blizz servers was 4 days, 20 hours.  
---
I reckon he'll easily beat it, but not necessarily in his first attempt due to competition.
---
why does it make sense for an elf to change into animals? why does it make sense for shamans to turn into ghost wolves?
---
Herb / Tailoring.  You'll need to craft robes and have someone make you mana potions.
---
You can but you get a lot more honor at level 60 so it's not efficient.
---
7 golf claps!
---
They are great in world PvP not so much in battlegrounds. They will be the least played class for sure but I still think there will be a lot of people who don't raid at all or just occasionally pug MC or onyxia
---
How is the experience on a RP-PVP server? How is the community? Is there competitive guilds?
---
What
---
they don't work. rp'ers end up moving to rp-pve reams cause people keep pvping their gatherings and most people who end up on rp-pvp servers don't rp. i mean retail actually does this better because you can turn off warmode and not get pvp'ed during your rp sessions.
---
Feral isn't really that good in PVP, their talents kinda suck. Balance/resto is generally better even for flag carrying in BGs.
---
My point being that in the scenario of exiting combat via CC and bailing, ground and flying mounts are incomparable since they can't catch you either way
---
Flying mounts are certainly safer against just random people attacking you, though, but that wasn't really the discussion I was engaging in
---
You expecting repair gold, consumables, crafted gear to just drop from the sky?

Not gonna happen. Even in a guild full of friends you'll have a hard time getting them to let you play this spec, let alone take up debuff slots on SS &amp; Immolation trap.

Druids playstyle isn't bursty in vanilla. You're not going to be like a rogue. Its more of an unkillable kite machine type thing.
---
Thanksgiving 2004. I'm 12 years old.
---
I'm at my brother's dad's house. My cousin is there, he just got WoW. He introduced me to Diablo, Warcraft, Starcraft and the following Blizzard games. He also showed me some EQ stuff back then.
---
I'm watching him corpse run in Mulgore on his level 9 Tauren Warrior. After resurrecting he crosses the bridge near Bloodhoof village. It was then that I knew I needed to play this game.
---
I'll never get that image of him crossing the bridge out of my head.
---
No taunt has always been the big problem with paladin and shaman. Considering hunters can solo a lot of content it should be somewhat possible. Do you use different pets?
---
Well in a few months you meet new ppl in the game, hopefully, everything has a downside.
---
I would always start off with ppl i know over my faction choice. 🙃
---
Doesn't mean it's 100% scaling.
---
That's what i thought as well.
---
I leveled a boomkin back in vanilla closed beta... I'll say this now... DO NOT do this.
---
You are much much more efficient leveling feral/resto.
---
Do 5 mans with resto or boomkin, but for sure respec for raids as resto.
---
I loved playing my boomkin in bg's. Just don't go all the way to the bird and play a support/damage dealer/cc role that can run away.
---
They still exist.
---
Garrisons eroded the last piece of the community aspect of wow away. People sat in their garrisons and never came out, leaving the world more lifeless than it was before. 
---
I’d be very uneasy trusting blizzard not to botch “player housing” again.
---
Wrong game for this idea :(
---
If it’s a lvl 25 blue, then I completely agree. But what if we’re talking like Staff of Jordan for example. I’m guessing a caster would “need” it but since it’s of such huge value, people wouldn’t be willing to hand it over so freely.
---
Playing druids in PVP you need to use all your abilities. Spells, heals, cat, bear, travel. You won't just stay in feral forms and mimic a rogue.
---
It’s possible to be a good feral in Vanilla.
---
I had a similar thought process nice choice
---
yes rogue, we get  it u r a loot whore  stop spamming
---
Which channels and what's your friend's twitch name? Pmessage me if you're afraid of hateful people. The "my friend said he did x" is worthless.
---
I didn't say it wasn't. I said Balance/Resto are more effective in PVP.
---
BG cross-realm (patch 1.12) will be a bit of a bummer
---
FYI the current recommendation within the classic mage discord is to use 3/3 imp blizzard .. see their #faq for details
---
I can see Resto spamming Heal Touch which is pretty efficient, but what does Feral bring to the group (I'm assuming Cat form)?
---
Bypassing this issue, Seems like a shit show. While I don’t have problems with streamers, I do dislike toxic people. Some streamers are toxic, not all. Both your blacklist and SOME streamers can duck a sick. A good time to be European.
---
Streamers should ignore this topic altogether.
---
It's just the fact that streamers who honestly have no business playing classic are "beta testing" it. What I mean by that is they either have never played WoW at all, or hell havnt played it in actual vanilla. The reason for this is free publicity and marking by blizzard which makes sense... but I still think its fucked up, and anyone who had an active sub during real vanilla wow time on their account should have been put into the beta instead of any streamer or "content creator" with any sort of audience. It really does show you what's more important to blizzard.
---
Really well done guide, thanks for this!
---
I’m kinda thinking of making a mage at the start, it’s good for farming and is pretty fun.
---
Only way they could possibly solve that would be to make housing a limited stock and present in the overworld... which I don't feel would go over well. Just do what everyone else does, claim the house West of Dalaran as your own and call it a day.
---
One goal a designer might have is to get a player to replay max level content.  They could go for daily chore model (feels endless), or a gambling model (feels hopeless), or what I like: a leveling model.  You have ten or fifty or a hundred little bars, related to everything you do at max level, and as the bar goes up, you're more effective at various specific things, and perhaps building up better luck for specific drops.

This is my source, where have you gotten your information from?
---
In beta there is no instant mail.
---
&gt; The slow 2/3 Improved Blizzard deals is weaker than the Cone of Cold slow
---
They're the same slow...
---
It's just a difficult spec to master and most people will try to be a melee exclusively. Good feral druids are beast are you see immediately who's good and bad.
---
Feral druid in PVP plays more like a balance / resto druid, a lot of shifting, kiting, healing. The cat form has a Claw (reg attack), simple bleed, Finisher to do burst and finisher to do bleed. 
---
Bear for is even more bare...... Maul Swipe (3 target limit, terrible damage, bash, charge) 
---
So you have to rely on roots, heals, travel kiting and so forth.
---
Anyone here representing from Emerald Dream?
---
At first I was using wolf to buff my melee damage. tried owl to screech and lower the damage dealt but it didnt save me often. I switched to a boar because i could have it charge a mob that is going for the healer. the charge causes a short root, and a charge + intimidate is at least a long enough stun to give the healer time to fade or me time to get in and wingclip, or just shoot it with distracting.
---
Hahaha, perfect.
---
I sure am ready ;) Will be nice when I have to compete against horde players too.
---
I realized something this time around. I mained a warrior/tank in vanilla. I wasn't have as much fun as I should've been, grinding and repairing and respeccing, always being poor.
---
So I'm rolling a huntard this time around and ain't gonna give a fuck.
---
Ya I will find something 2 do even if its fishing and cooking
---
I have 2 questions.
---
What is spillover exactly?
---
How is the progress in this guide?
---
This used to be my old chat cover. Reworked my ui and chat cover in the past days so now it's tier 3 instead ;)
---
he does have his ownn sub tho tbh
---
That's not true. Ion said in an interview they are open to adding then after launch.
---
upvoted for have the right info.
---
It doesn’t have to be a scrub. Someone can be a half second slower on anything and lose. There is always someone better.
---
Seems awfull. I hope it's just the big population on the pservers that generated those problems. With 1/4 the players maybe you won't see as many people in the starting zones.
---
Wondering about best professions to take on a Paladin. I plan on doing a mix of PvE and PvP, a Ret/Holy hybrid to help heal/utility while providing some damage. I was thinking I’d go BS/Mining and then later swap to Engineering but not 100% sure yet. Also going to work on a Mage which I figured Tailoring/Enchanting would be go to or perhaps I’d do like double gathering on Mage and do like BS/Alch on Paladin but idk how valuable and viable that is. Open to suggestions.
---
Yeah... that’s the resto spec i run. Its not to be balance though.
---
Do you have to get the dreadsteed for warlock or can you skip the quest? If it isn't part of a quest chain or something then I'd rather just spend the gold on a regular lvl 60 mount.
---
My source is the actual data from current WoW players: https://realmpop.com/
---
No BG means highly geared player will go around in leveling areas looking for lvl 55+ players on PVP servers. 
---
On PVE servers well there will be no opportunity for PVP at all..... not fair for PVE players.
---
I was gonna say. Based on the chart seems like mage is the way to go. I'm planning on mage main &amp; 39 mage twink.
---
Then link the interview, until then, I don't believe you.
---
The major difference between vanilla and current bfa is that feral‘ snow rely on those huge bursts and regrowths from ferocious bite.
---
Yeah that’s poor phrasing I guess.. it’s the same point though as in  less and/or same % allows CoC to apply over the blizz slow.
---
RP-PvP servers don't exist in retail?  It just says "Normal" and "RP" for server types.
---
atm you don’t really need to switch much just for maybe heals and that’s about it.
---
You're being downvoted but you're completely correct. The quest wasn't labled as a dungeon back then. But, anyway.. ^DM ^^is ^^the ^^^superior ^^^acronym
---
Oh I can't see it haha have to be invited lol
---
MoP was peak class design. It had some pretty bad balance issues though. Warlocks were gods walking amongst mere mortals, prot paladins could solo tank a raid tier, un-capped divine star in 25 mans, etc. A lot of it was busted, but it was extremely fun and fluid to play nonetheless.
---
They do, that site just doesn't differentiate between the two. You have to look up the realm type yourself. 9 of the top 10 RP realms are PVE.
---
I'm pretty young so my earliest Wow memory was my first guild lead buying me flying. I was very thankful for that. She's still been one of my favorite guild leads.
---
Can a warlock's voidwalker taunt a hunter's pet?
---
I believe you made this meme spec just to roll on more items
---
I’m not sure if ESO is good, but after the E3 trailer, im interested in hearing other’s opinions.
---
But that's what you want...
---
If you have 3/3 Blizzard and CoC, it doesn't matter if the mob has 0.01 seconds of Blizzard left, CoC won't get applied.
---
So if I run SM cath and then armory, then reset, that’s 1 instance? So you can do 10 total runs before you’re locked out? Or does running cath mean I can’t run armory until I reset cath?
---
My buddy had sort of the same problem, so when he was being a dick... I'd pop on his account when he was asleep and set his hearthstone to ironforge, then put his toon back in the wilderness where he had logged off...   xD

If the population more or less equally distributed both factions usually "claim" a leveling areas. It is different on every server but STV is always a bloodbath

Hi, /u/tunatornadotv
---
Best professions for a rogue? Looking for profs that will aid me in both pve/pvp, and to help me make a decent amount of gold.
---
Host you're own PServer? It's not that difficult or expensive at all.
---
My guild does it for testing our leveling routes and week one rag kill plans. The hosting is basically nothing.
---
And since you don't care about other people connecting, you could just host it on your own machine, which means the cost is $0.
---
That was I replied though.. their recommendation is that is not what you want.. 
---
&gt; Either one of those will do, though it is highly recommended that you get used to the 3/3 Imp Blizzard (more slows, more damage), please learn how to time your CoC correctly so the debuff overlap isn't a problem to you.
---
And further context to the “more slows, more damage”
---
&gt; 3/3 hits them with all 8 ticks.  2/3 is 5 or 6 ticks, and they get to you way before frost nova cools down, which is why you need CoC, and need CoC to overwrite Blizzard slow
---
Black Lotus spawns were also amped up on private servers, so the price will be different

I genuinely forgot that was a thing in early classic. Now I'll have night terrors of my internet going down for too long and have zero shards.

---
Battlegrounds are fun.  Competitive premade vs premade can be really fun.   I wouldn’t want to play the game without world pvp or without bgs I think both are important.    Also if bgs didn’t ever exist there would be a ton of camping hot spots for people grinding rank 14.  It stops being world pvp and starts being camping flight paths for 12-16 hours a day.     Hopefully that is just an extreme and we won’t see that in phase 2.  But many people are sure it’s going to happen and it won’t be anything like the “world pvp” you remember in vanilla
---
I really hope so. The memes on this sub and the community on Twitch scares me. WoW are top streaming on Twitch, this is a great way of pushing the game but you will agree Twitch don't attract lots of older gamers.
---
Bear tank actually. A bear with Manual Crowd Pummeler can generate absurd amounts of threat. I think cat form is generally considered underwhelming, but what you're doing when not tanking (cat or healing/decursing) probably depends on your spec and raid.
---
I saw plenty of people calling it VC on my server back in the day.
---
I guess I deserve downvotes as well.
---
Fun story... One time I was feeling kinda sick, popped into an av... Sitting up in chair with blanket on. Mom walks in, gives me medicine... Comes back 3 min later *oops, that was accidentally restoril* oh well I say... I'll just enjoy this quick alterac valley, then go down for a nice sleepyby... Instantly falls asleep in my chair... Wakes up several hours later, hands still on keyboard/mouse, running into wall... Resumes AV for 3 hours until completion.

Engineer ammo is actually the best ammo in the game. Aside from I think ammo that drops in lbrs but no one bothers farming that shit
---
Upvote for the Sanderson reference :)

But.. It's still a meme that was put into the game that originated from Korean starcraft players typing "kekeke" instead of "hahaha".

My point is that that type of lingo is already established and we are just arbitrarily gatekeeping at this point.

Sha was a high elf before Artgas raised her as a banshee. Bit that was in WCIII so she’s always been a banshee during WoW.

Rogue excel in small group PVP and get a bit not fun in a larger scale.... you just get targeted and nuked hard. No clack of skill. 
---
Warlocks are not the greatest in a small group PVP just because they really lack mobility and as alliance keep in mind undead have fear brake/immune plus the trinket. In large PVP oh boy ..... you can just unload and snipe away.
---
In Vanilla I dont remember a single build for PVE that would be great for PVE, They are optimized around different thing. I mean yes you can have a hybrid build but keep in mind the Damage meter will feel it and you PVP will be different. 
---
As Alliance, Dwarf rogues are insane..... ability to remove poisons (blind) and bleeds just wins you Warrior and other rogue encounters. You go prep and with double blind, double vanish, double imp sprint you can even challenge mages.
---
well it depends on your level and engineering skill. there are times you can buy better.
---
Well At the talents I still have to think what I will do the most.. Pvp or Pve and then choose them.
---
And the problem might be that my friend is rolling an rogue too...
---
Good info. Thanks!
---
I personally feel Feral is a PvE spec in Vanilla.  Tanking or Dps, it's much better for grinding and dungeons than you'll ever be for PvP.  I was running with 1600 AP and still felt my burst damage was lacking, couldn't keep up with 900 AP rogues.  But, if it's what you enjoy definitely do it, just have reasonable expectations.
---
Deep Resto and Balance hybrids are quite good for PvP.
---
If he wants to get into content creation then he'd be better off with something that's not oversaturated already - levelling guides are everywhere, especially for popular races like UD, although most of it is written (which is usually better for levelling). 
---
With that said I'll give it a watch later when I finish work.

I'm kinda in the same boat. I came into vanilla late. While I eventually ended up raiding fairly hard core, that didn't really happen until BC/WotLK. In vanilla I did like MC and AQ20 but that's about it. I haven't played on any private servers so it's been a hot minute since I played. I'm not even going to try and compete with those private server guys who have been playing for 5/10+ years. I got the same mentality as them, just not the experience. Hopefully I'll end up in a fairly successful raiding guild that's more like second teir that doesn't speed level just to be world firsts, but still has that competitive spirit. I'm sure there's enough players similar to us that we'll end up joining together and having some awesome raiding fun.
---
it's what Alf came back as
---
You cannot however, get your class quests from Stormwind. So if you leave the NE starting zone without a pet, you will have to go back to the NE starting zone to get one.
---
Player housing exists in vanilla.  There's an inactive portal and mock houses in place, just unusable.  You should look at the dev plans that were made for vanilla housing, it's quite interesting.  If the devs weren't so pressed for time at release it would have made it into the game most likely.
---
I do agree that twitch is going to bring in a lot of younger people (for how long, who knows), but don't underestimate how many adults are actually watching streamers either.  A lot of these people aren't kids behind the screen.
---
I could definitely see that being true. Since Blizzard said "the only way to win is kill the boss", that must mean reinforcements aren't a way. So turtling a game is not a strategy to win, and likely both sides will avoid each other, except like you said some small defender teams trying to recap a tower.
---
Off-tanking when needed while still having reasonable dps. Off-healing while still having reasonable dps. A nice buff. Druids are doing so much in a group but won't ever top the meter. It's one of the most difficult class to master because it's the most hybrid class in vanilla. With all specs you need to use all your abilities.
---
Idk, the sons of hodir dailies were really cool imo. Fighting a protodrake in mid air was dope. I also dug how the rep grinds actually gave you stuff for taking the time to go through with them. I think it's hard to find the right balance for content like dailies, like on one hand they will eventually feel like a chore if you do them enough even if they're cool quests but on the other hand it's a pretty satisfying feeling to be finished and get the items you want.
---
World PvP is always present in vanilla regardless of BGs. Raiding will force players to frequent certain hotspots such as Blackrock Mountain, Silithus and EPL and this inevitably leads to some bloodshed. Also don't forget Kazzak, Azuregos and the 4 Emerald Dragons, this is where the most epic of outdoor pvp battles happen. It may not be possible high ranks just by outdoor pvp but it certainly is a whole lot of fun...
---
You could be right.
---
But you could as well flip the same argument into "if you aren't playing 24/7 then you are missing out on something". There's always something to do and if you aren't playing you are missing out on it. People need to get grip on their lives. No-one forces you to do dailies every day. I didn't.
---
No. The "taunts" that pets get (both hunter and lock pets) only generate a fixed amount of threat. They don't force the target to hit them like warriors/druids do.

Right but his question wasnt about what is theoretically possible, it was about what is realistically possible so im not sure if this is the "right info" for this question
---
I don’t feel like /dance-ing since several expansions.
---
Yeah true. But this was really really bad ;p I feel its okay to have a laugh about it. Its clear he did not play allot of Vanilla and is carried by privalidge. I will still come watch from time to time. I think he is a Nice guy
---
You absolutely do
---
Until you are one of the only druid in the gold and they want you for every WSG que and hard cap 3 druids in the raid. (Mt healing, melee healing, ranged healing) so you outgear the swarms of other classes pretty quick.
---
That calculator is nothing like what we are asking for, you can't input any weights and it can't compare items
---
Go to PH for that kinda stuff, pervert!
---
Ah okay I see
---
Are you surprised? These people are stupid enough to pay others so they can watch them play video games
---
I agree, in the end it should come back to playing what you like. We've waited how long for classic? Definitely play what you like.
---
You can skip the Dreadsteed quest, but it's cheaper than buying a normal epic mount.
---
Oh god, these crossovers are getting better and better. Amazing how everyone knew about the Ragnaros viewing portal at Golemagg!
---
the easy alliance life
---
It’s very difficult, you need to be top .3% of the servers active pvp player base for about 8 weeks in a row to get it.
---
OSRS also has lots of daily things you should be doing like farming/herb runs and birdhouse runs every hour 24 hours a day and so on.
---
Questing in the Barrens with folks who soon be my guildies.
---
No wait, before that, dealing with multi-minute loot lag in Mulgore and endless disconnects in that super rough first week.
---
Care to elaborate?
---
I always knew oceanic servers were full of trash humans, now I have proof
---
I think the stats on the healer sets are excellent for PvP because you don't downrank spells in PvP. You cast max rank heals. You don't need any bonus healing to top someone off when you're using max rank heals. Just intellect, which every set has.
---
OP: The worst set bonus is Shaman by far. 2% shock crit is completely forgettable and doesn't impact your gameplay at all. The individual set pieces are really good for PvP though, so you would still wear them regardless.
---
I’m torn between a Dwarf Priest or Paladin right now. Can’t decide.
---
Important to note, your group will only get a small fraction of the experience from the MC’ed mob.
---
I don’t think I’ve seen anybody claim that, ever.
---
Night elf priests mind controlling people off of cliffs = Night elf hunters &gt; all
---

---
Priest is much easier to level.  Mage is easier endgame but higher skillcap
---
1v1 warlock wins 95% of the time. 
---
Anyone that tells u otherwise doesn't know how to play a lock. Also, if he had deathcoil then you beat rogues pretty much every time.
---
I main warlock. Very rarely do I lose 1v1 in world PvP. Just be smart and use fear to your advantage. Sacrifice voidwalker for  a massive shield. Honestly it's an amazing PvP class even with shit gear.
---
MC was used on the adds for Instructor Razuvious in Naxx. From what I recall, it was almost 100% necessary.
---
Strongly disagree. That set has a shitload of armor. It's probably the most important stat for a Druid in PvP, no matter what spec they are. Can't heal when you're dead.
---
By the way, I beat 2 level 60 rogues 2 days ago in a 2v1 as a level 56 lock. So....
---
&gt; On streams(classic beta) people were getting full exp even with doing little to minimal damage
---
Last stress test, I tried in Dun Morogh, with the guards at the top of the quarry, kiting lvl 8 mobs up to them when level 5. Got roughly half XP.
---
or could be a dwarf instead....
---
Like 90% of hunters failed this simple task. I wonder if it's even needed now that players are generally better and 1.12 talents make players more powerful.
---
Maybe not as valuable in pve. Not sure. Escape artist is nice.
---
Also a few days ago there was a hit cap post with info from Blizzard talking about how weapon skill affects damage numbers. It sounded like private servers underestimated how much weapon skill affected it, so that the human bonus would mean more gain than expected in boss fights.
---
Are the spells sorted from left to right from most mana efficient to least mana efficient or just placed randomly?
---
And that player would have to go back to Dun Morogh (or however it’s spelled) to learn Tame Beast.
---
Oh ding.. one of those magical things in Vanilla. Even at lower levels with just said ding with friends. Doesn't happen now days when it takes 15 minutes to get one level.
---
Is there a way to get this song? I always wanted it and tried looking but no luck.
---
Look up a guy on YouTube named Shedothedruid. Shedo has good videos on feral dps. I definitely recommend watching him.
---
Ultimately, you'll have to put in more work than other classes to compare to them, but if you have fun doing it and it makes you happy, do it!
---
Engineering is basically a must if you plan to minmax at all. Not a lot of money to be made there though. My plan is to take mining and skinning until lvl 40, selling or vending the leather, and banking the ore, stone etc. (Selling/ vending whatever I don't need to cap engineering.) After I get my mount, drop skinning for engineering.
---
The quality of memes on this sub has really gone down the shitter
---
You need higher level to disenchant higher level gear and enchanting can be learned only after level 5
---
I see a lot of people saying rogues use full tier gear. Yeah good luck getting enough hit% ...
---
This information is so wrong.
---
You need to be level 10 to pick up Enchanting.
---
There is no skill requirement on disenchanting any gear. That was added in TBC.
---
I actually prefer a patch before Battlegrounds. It's not a big deal. I concede to the patch at its current state and it doesn't ruin World PvP at all.
---
He has his own charisma that attracts people. If you think, skill is what streamer needs to be successful, you are really mistaken.
---
Locks are beast at PvP and PvE
---
And one thing I always noticed and saw happening back during vanilla was that lower level locks would still kick your ass and even if you killed them, you usually ended up dying to their dots.
---
They’re not reward based like your thinking, the value is the intrinsic difficulty
---
Might as well go back to sleep!
---
Yes but you and both realize that doesn't illicit the bad feeling for those people. You could obviously say if you aren't playing every second that's a second that you could be acquiring thunder fury if you just had 50 characters and raided on all of them. And yeah not everyone is the same so some people actually enjoy dailies because they only have to play for 30 minutes to an hour and they don't feel like they missed out.   
---
I'm not saying one way is better than the other, but what I am saying is time gated content drives away a lot of people because it makes them feel shitty / like they have to do something and then it becomes a job and not enjoyable. A lot of people would rather just not play that game then feel that bad feeling.  
---
Just like having huge grinds that require lots of time will drive away a large audience. The difference is MMO's started for people who want to no life games or only play one game. Then they tried even harder to appeal to a wider more casual audience went way too far in that direction and their populations plummeted.
---
I mean, thats a lot more than 3kdps they should get it right 😌
---
I’m actually gonna roll a Druid too, the play style is great and I’ve always liked how good they are at disengaging and kiting
---
Lol
---
Same, except I started even younger than you. I'm pretty sure the entire rest of my guild was at least 20yo back then. But they liked me because I followed directions well, basically had 100% raid attendance, and all the while still being an above average player (I think that says more about the average player back then, then it does about my individual skill...).
---
Yeah, if I weren’t deeply attached to tanking dungeons in vanilla I’d likely be playing a warlock. They are pretty sweet and everyone loves you.
---
You need a special level 40 helm and "powershift" with mana buffs. Very wierd, we could almost say it's a bug or some kind or exploits. If you do it you can be "viable" as a dps in raids.
---
Feral druids tank when needed and dps when not. You use both forms in raids.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Powershifting
---
That was my initial thought. There's so much YouTube content out there, and with a franchise as huge as WoW, I can see how it would be easy to go unnoticed. But hey, why not? I appreciate the comment, thanks.
---
Check out willitclassic.com, the site has a long list of vanilla addons, and tracks the ones that devs or users have updated or are updating.
---
Asmongold is an imbecile, I will make it my life's mission to relentlessly camp him.
---
The spells are sorted alphabetically, but the point of the site is not to help you pick which spell to use. But which rank of each spell to use as your filler heals.
---
Hey OP, nothing against you or this guide, but I just wanted to say a couple things.
---
&gt; (easily beats owl, spriest, retri or DPS shaman) 
---
Please don't tear down other people to make your preferred spec look good. We are all memespec brothers and sisters in arms. I can tell you right now that a Spelladin ret pally will blow 360 dps straight out of the water in Pre-bis and continues to scale into the late game. You'll notice in the spelladin guide though, this is the only thing that is said regarding the dps of others:
---
&gt;In Tips Outs' parse ranking video, 4 weeks into MC, the average dps is this:  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;477.1 warriors, 429 rogue, 361.3 hunters, 359.6 mage, 264.7 locks  
---
&gt;I don't know if this is boss only dps, or boss+trash or entire raid. Because of lack of information I can't really conclude anything, but none the less its interesting to wonder where we could be
---
&gt; THIS GUIDE ONLY USES ITEMS THAT ARE CONFIRMED TO SCALE ON 1.12 CONTENT 
---
Not sure if this only refers to Dragonbreath Chili/Shadow Oil, or all the gear in the build, but Alcor's Sunrazor, Darkmooncard: Maelstrom, Storm Gauntlets, and Blazefury Medallion are all entirely unconfirmed regarding scaling.
---
&gt;\- [Dragonbreath Chili](https://classicdb.ch/?item=12217) (100% scaling)  
---
&gt;\- [Shadow Oil](https://classicdb.ch/?item=3824) (42.85% scaling)
---
Shadow Oil is scaling at 56% (80% minus low level penalty) on the beta. I don't think anyone has tested chili yet. Our beta guy is testing it now and I'll edit this with the results.  
---
That's all, good luck with the memes.
---
Mama Mia nothing beats fresh pasta.
---
Isn't end game ammo craft only? I know for BC and WOTLK it was...until they removed it.
---
As I recall, you can mail greens to a bank alt for disenchanting. (But I'm not 100% when this changed. TBC probably.)
---
They are realy good in pvp but i dont know how well the lock dots and the 16 debuf limit goes on pve raid bosses.
---
You realize the people that are going to be doing that have likely been playing this shit for years at this point. Your understanding of this shit is so far from reality
---

---
Portals, free and instant food, great farming, great damage, great pvp. First two alone is putting it above anything else for me.
---
Running around with a friend of mine and emoting at a couple Alliance rogues who were trying to sneak around the Crossroads during the original closed beta.
---
I ve never been into pvp videos at all, but. This. One. This are the best 4 minutes with not only trash metal but a good song (even for ppl who dislike metal) and it is absolutely insane what this tauren achieves. 
---
Loved it in 2005 and still love to watch it. Thanks for posting!
---
Pallies and locks and it isn’t even a contest
---
There is absolutely no recourse for ganking, corpse camping, graveyard camping, NPC killing, etc to be found on a PVP server by complaining to Blizzard. They’re unlikely to even respond and if they do, they’ll just tell you to ask for help from your fellow faction players. It says so right in the EULA.
---
Badge gear was the same gear catchup mechanism that was ALWAYS present in the game.
---
Yes in Vanilla too.  
---
Best pre-raid helm you could get for mage when WoW hit the shelves:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14332/eternal-crown](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14332/eternal-crown) of Frozen Wrath, no stats, 40something frost spell damage

Best pre-raiding helm you could get patch 1.4  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18727/crimson-felt-hat](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18727/crimson-felt-hat)  8int 8sta 8spi 30Spell damage

---
They didn't offer the gear for badges, but they kept adding more powerful gear in 5men dungeon for the entire vanilla duration, to help people out with decking for raids.
---
As DPS, you'll do **literally** 1/3rd of what other classes do. You'll need to work twice as hard to do a fraction of other players' damage.
---
You're a decent tank though.
---
Well, if we ever do move to TBC, I kinda want to do a blood elf pally. My main is definitely going to be an undead lock. Assuming we stick purely to vanilla I have no plans for alts beyond a bank alt.
---
it's not that serious dork
---
What are the best mage classes for both factions in your opinion?
---
Looks like its gnomes for alliance but those fuckers are ugly.
---
&gt;heroics were hard and not everyone was able to do trash, let alone bosses and full runs
---
trash in tbc heroics (much like in pandaria/warlords challenge mode) were way way harder than bosses
---
It's not just the leveling? WTF you smoking??
---
You know long it can take to get the gear endgame? the time commitment alone will be enough to mindfuck all but the most diehard players.
---
In vanilla WoW you earned your gear, it was not handed to you on a silver platter...
---
Our retirement homes will be pretty much huge LAN parties and WoW Classic guilds, I’m actually quite excited for this
---
This is amazing
---
I'm looking forward to calmly level fishing and jumping up and down in iron forge.
---
&gt;it became a bit ridiculous in Wrath, dungeons were easy,
---
yeah, I remember being a little wary of going in the first heroics because I remembered how punishing TBC ones were, and we ended up roflstomping wrath heroics
---
If you're min/maxing properly, it's more like 80-90% on most fights, and equal to other melees on specific fights.
---
Is that a *Close Combat: Invasion Normandie* -quote?
---
I went to college in Florida and lived in NJ.  I was in an AV that was too long and I had to leave for the airport.  I got to school, ate a late lunch, walked to my dorm, and when I queued up, it was the same AV.  I couldnt believe it, I hope its the very same again
---
i dont think that will be a factor anymore, in todays gaming community.. their mind set is to rush to endgame to start the real grind...  its not like the old days were people sits on level brackets for long weeks ( unless ur a busy irl man )  to do other things in game like go to towwn, chat with people, play mini games, etc ( like maplestory back then )
---
&gt;Tbc was alot better than classic.
---
I agree, I would have loved Classic with a TBC style itemization where almost every class/spec was viable.
---
i will only play dps only classes so I will never have to tank or heal :-)
---
If you win the roll on a chest, it's contents are yours. Most people that I've played with would pass the item on if someone legitimately needed it, myself included. 
---
In the case of something like the Staff of Jordan, however,  that can literally fund your epic mount and more, I would keep it, and every level headed person in the group wouldn't fault you.
---
You need to be lvl 5 to learn Enchanting. You can disenchant any item of any level. There are no level/skill requirements.
---
I think it added an additional dynamic to a pretty stale genre. RTS:es has been pretty much the same since the C&amp;C days.
---
I think we're going around in circles at this point. My experience of WoW players is that there is huge cultural momentum and people are slow to change their behaviour even when the incentives change. If zerging is rewarded more than fighting, and the current cultural momentum is towards zerging not fighting, I don't see that changing just because it takes a bit more coordination to down some trash mobs.
---
But if you think differently I don't see any strong reason to try to convince you otherwise.
---
Oh well! Duo rogue world pvp is so much fun!
---
Most people don't have the time to level more than 1 character so they are choosing their one and only class/race. Let them have this.
---
Its already said there will be few servers meaning all will likely be high pop. There will be mass kill trading, guilds farming each other to get 1 person R14. You wont make it to R14 camping STV

Creating 1 Mooncloth is on a 4 Day cooldown, so there will be a limited amount of Mooncloth available on the server.
---
Throughout the expansion it's used for 16 slot Mooncloth Bags, 18 slot Bottomless Bags, and 24 slot Herbalism bags. Bagspace in general is scarce, and better bags are scarcer. with 18 slot Ony bags rolled on by 40 people and 18 slot ZG bags rolled on by 20 in Phase 4.
---
In Phase 1/2, it's used for BiS crafted gear like Truefaith Vestments.
---
In Phase 4, it's used for BiS crafted gear like the Bloodvine set.
---
In Phase 6, it's used for T3 Mage/Warlock/Priest armor turn-ins, 2-4 Mooncloth per item.
---
Arcanite Bars are similar, with the transmute on a 2 Day cooldown. These are used for a lot of things:
---
* Phase 1:
---
  * Sulfuron Hammer (Sulfuras)
---
  * Annihilator (armor pen axe)
---
  * Nightfall (spell dmg boost axe)
---
  * Force Reactive Disk (AoE farming engineering shield)
---
  * Lionheart Helm (BiS Warrior helm)
---
  * Stronghold Gauntlets (crafted disarm immune gloves)
---
  * Arcanite Reaper (BiS Phase 1 Warrior 2H)
---
  * Arcanite Rod (needed by Enchanters)
---
* Phase 2:
---
  * Warlock epic mount quest
---
  * Paladin epic mount quest
---
* Phase 3
---
  * Elementium (Thunderfury)
---
* Phase 5
---
  * Titanic Leggings (BiS Warrior legs)
---
  * AQ40 scepter questline
---
* Phase 6
---
  * Frost-Resist Gear (for Sapphiron)
---
  * T3 Rogue / Hunter / Warrior / Paladin armor turn-ins (1-4 per item)

DM hc was incredible I loved it
---
The earliest WoW related thing I can remember is watching two early beta videos. One was a mage doing quests by Northshire Abbey and I was amazed at the awesome spell animations. The other was a big brawl somewhere in Elwynn Forest that was just incomprehensible.
---
As for playing the game myself, the earliest actual thing I can remember is doing raptor quests in STV as a priest during beta while the Mind Flay sound bug was happening. Basically the sound would remain permanently in the world wherever you cast Mind Flay, constantly playing.
---
Sulfuras, looks like a black hole of mats. Is it contested or since basically you're in nax by time you assembled the mats for it do most just deem it not worth it. I get that it's cool to have a legendary but warriors want and get better stuff, druids gain nothing from it. do paladins and shaman just roll for the eye for giggles. I'm confused how apart from the orange name is it worth that much gold in materials.
---
Incorrect.   
---
First things first. As gear scales up, running as Soul Link becomes less attractive. Using DOTs also becomes less attractive. Because in BIS gear, the game becomes more about globaling people. With the right spec, shadowbolts are capable of killing people in 1-2 globals.   
---
In other words, why apply corruption when you can 1-shot the target? (That's before you take into consideration the fact your DOTs are often being removed in during organized play.) As damage scales up, even Fear becomes a spell you use less often.   
---
In my opinion, with BIS gear, SM/Ruin is the best PVP spec. I've used it to get a 100-0 KDR in Alterac Valley while playing solo. And for an SM/Ruin build, nothing is more important than crit. Because when you crit, players die. My largest Warsong Gulch (shadowbolt) crits were in the neighborhood of 8,000 damage. (Flasked, trinkets up, etc.) It was actually two 8K bolts in a row, each 1-shotting a fully buffed Grand Marshal warrior.   
---
When you can do that, the only reason to throw corruption is because you're hoping it gives you another shadowbolt.
---
Confirming there is no skill requirement for disenchanting.
---
&gt;  Just stick to classic if you don't like it.
---
Are you assuming they are going to maintain Retail WoW, Classic WoW *and* TBC? That seems very unlikely.
---
Deployed to Iraq 2004  feb to sept.  Went on leave and came back from leave to find a corpsman buddy of mine playing in November. He let me roll a toon and play for an hour or 2. I went and bought the game immediately after and that was all she wrote.  I got out in Feb 05 and spent the next 6 months just playing, it was a great way to defuse from deployments.
---
Rp-pvp servers in retail have always been the deadest realms in the game. There was a brief uptick when an Orc Warhammer crossover guild got a blue post on Ravenholdt, but other than that they are largely abandoned. Compare this to Moon Guard or WRA, two of the larger servers in the game. Reddit is a terrible sample for these surveys as most people on reddit play much different than the average. Rp-pvp servers constantly get merged because no one plays on them
---
Don't be so down on yourself, InnervateBoi
---
Dead. They aren’t competitive and they are amongst the lowest pop, constantly needing mergers. I’m not saying this to be a dick, I def rp’d for a number of years and love RP but I understand why blizzard doesnt want to pay for an empty server
---
argarbargarbgarb
---
I wish any level 5 couldn't disenchant. It kinda defeats the whole purpose of being a enchanter. I don't think blizzard meant for this. I levelled enchanting on my first vanilla character. What a complete waste of gold it was. Enchanters did it for free if you provide mats
---
Its a fact
---
I agree with that. There's more determining factors for winning BGs. A good group, good gear, beeing a skilled players will impact your performance a lot more.
---
The best way to get better at PVP is leveling alts. The more you know about an opponent the more you can outplay them.
---
Yeah, this will make raiding much smoother.
---
Rep grinds were fairly important in Vanilla.
---
Plus, getting enough gold for your raid consumables and epic mount was not trivial.

cat form isn't underwhelming by itself, problem is a raid can seldom afford the cat spec the dot slots it would need to perform

I occasionally post this in PoE Global and it turns into Stormwind Vanilla general chat in seconds

In the rounding process i take a lot of damage. They hit hard and i dont see how to round them without taking damage.

---
I think most guilds are going to be more like that,  not too many people playing during the day and more active at night.
---
If that’s true then they must of fixed.  Which I’m happy about
---
Its good Info, but a little too focused on +healing for my taste. To forgo crown of the penitent in favor of a pure stat helm just sounds wrong. On the other hand, i totally forgot about afrasa, that was worth the read alone.
---
What ? I’m talking about the lasher packs not the boss.
---
Yes, the text will convert into the emote instead.
---
These are all wrong anyway. I hope eventually you make your way to the right faction.
---
I was dps warrior in vanilla \o/
---
Nah, DM is the correct one. Explaining why people are wrong and call it VC doesn't make it less wrong ;)
---
yeah but you use daggers in pvp and once aq40/naxx drops you swap to seal fate daggers
---
Same here. No debate in my mind. Nothing is more fun than the utility of being a hunter.
---
I remember stumbling into sunken temple at level 51 as a warrior and said this is to hard ( I was 11 at the time), so I called my best mate who got me into wow and he was level 54 at the time, he came in also a noob but a paladin and we duoed it until I was 54 only killing trash mobs, took a few nights though
---
Train at 12 before doing Darkshore. You only need to go back to IF to train once at level 14. You won’t need to train again until level 20 because the spells up until that point are optional to learn.
---
What are you talking about. What do you mean "atm"? Retail?
---
Ever heard of power shifting?
---
Yeah sure there are farm runs which have been in the game since the dawn of time, and other daily things that are insanely helpful such as ur battlestaves, birdhouse runs for free hunter exp, but its not like the game revolves around them. thats my issue with current mmo's. You did ur mythic+ and ur emissary?? Glad you had fun playing for an hour, see you at raid time!! ff14 has the same sad issue . Completed ur roulettes, see you at raid time! of course im overexagerating a little bit, but there are no hundred hour grinds in current MMO's which makes there feel like less rewarding feelings.
---
I mean, you can do it. Its not the best, requires weird ass shit like farming Gnomeregan forever, tons of consumables, perfect rotations, and even then you're still not as gonna be performing as well as everyone else.
---
Furthermore, imo, Kitty DPS only really works on Alliance. Shaman's have Windfury Totems that do not do anything for Kitty DPS, putting you even further behind. At least on Alliance you get blessings.
---
Druid is kind of the odd child of Classic. You just suck at everything; anything you want to do, you're doing at least 20% less than what another class could do but I enjoy the class aesthetic and feel too much to not play one.
---
Low effort shit post.
---
Words evolve, boomer has transcended only speaking about the actual Baby boomer generation and in different contexts implies ideas or concepts, like being out of touch with modern culture. Which is ironically what you appear to be right now, ya boomer &lt;3
---
I had a lot of fun with my holy pally alt in vanilla. Granted I only leveled it to mid 30s, but it felt really impactful in dungeons.
---
And the Alliance takes the gold in women's gymnastics
---
Why speak accurately when you can just lie? 
---
I bet he also thinks no raid will succeed unless it is has 40 warriors.
---
The literal definition of “the slippery slope” is the logical fallacy that a minor action leads to a chain of events culminating in a significant event. That’s the reason the term was created, to describe the fallacy. 
---
Many logical fallacies are extremely persuasive, but that doesn’t make them a valid argument. I’m sure there are countless other reasons to argue against blizzard changing minor things with classic but the slippery slope is an invalid argument.
---
Yeah, that's what I'm saying though, if you want a character to "do a little of everything" on, rogue really isn't the best choice.  Lock, hunter, 2h fury, druid to a lesser extent (HotW), and mage have strong specs that are good no matter the content you are playing.  This is mostly due to either their damage being strong regardless, the core power or their utility not being tied to talent point, or both.
---
Consider that mage and hunter both have sap analogues but both are expressly better untalented than untalented sap.  Rogue isn't really *bad* and if it's what you want to play you can make it work, but it's less capable than other classes of doing what you are looking to do.
---
Soil - Breaking me down
---
You misunderstand peoples ability to be wrong on something. It's DM, but my god the VC people are crawling out of their pits in this thread...
---
You don't want to play because youre worried about your **alt** getting ganked in a zone you'll spend 1 day in? 
---
Do the autists come out at night or what because sorting by new at midnight is mind blowing?
---
That's what boomer originally meant and indeed still does in context, but language evolves my dude.
---
Oh, now that is interesting. Are you a beta tester? If so, it would actually be a good idea to go to the same location, repeat the jump (ideally with a 60% mount to reach the same distance) and compare the actual fall damage percentage.
---
First episode when he calls the technicians morons in the same way as Friday night dinner was funny. Don't know if it was intentional... was hoping for a "shit on it" when he discovered the truth of what happened.
---
Raids took 20 hours to complete? ... pls stop with this crap
---
So basically it will be exactly like Vanilla was then? Yay for no changes!
---

Hammer and magic helmet?

They removed the RPG from the MMO.  Everything was on cooldown and you had to wait until the next day to do anything.  It ended up where I felt like I was paying $15 / month just to have the game tell me I wasn't allowed to do anything.  I barely touched Cata because it was awful.  I want to say it had the most dailies and the worst RNG for hoping you'd get the daily quest you needed for an achievement.  The game just wasn't the same and every expansion kept promising "more!" while giving less and less, paired with terrible daily quests and BoP currency grinds.  Like some other posters have said here, it turned it all from a game into a job.  That nagging feeling of being obligated: "I gotta get home from work and log in to do my dailies!" /vomit
---
Damnit.......
---
Probably bfa.
---
Really? That is so cool, I did not know the origins of Fraps!
---
And now I know a guy who knows the guy who made Fraps! ;-P
---
Someone try this! I’d roll a pally just for this, theorycrafting off specs is my favorite.
---
lol someone just got Jebaited!
---
Well, my job is done here... good day ;)
---
Better not play a hunter then because there won't be a trainer in the noob zone. Also it takes over 5 minutes to run to stormwind, thats wayyyyy too far. That will be a rough 1% of your characters overall playtime.
---
I was sure I was going to main a troll warrior tank this time around just for the chance at thunder fury.
---
I mained an orc warrior off tank in vanilla and the only thing I liked about him was the badass shoulder pad size. I hate orc melee animations but enjoy their casting.
---
Now I’m thinking if it’s really worth all the hassle just for thunderfury.
---
Another thing is (which I think I could do) is be there every raid but I am an adult with a job so.... life comes into play and main tanking is a huge responsibility to the 40 people you are with.
---
My second choices are orc warlock, shaman (would love enhancement) or Druid heals for raiding and bg’s.
---
Really hate having to pick one. Oof!
---
But that thunderfury though......
---
I don't even consider to roll a hunter honestly .. I was thinking about rolling a mage but until I finish molten core and Onyxia I have to stay frost which is sooooo booooring : Frost bolt, frost bolt , frost bolt, frost bolt, frost bolt and so on... And after I finish molten core and onyxia (If I clear them) I have to respec(25 gold) into fire , and thats dope in my opinion, but it's soo hard to get there... idk what to do............
---
The early Cata dungeon difficulty was bound to blow up on them simply because they had just implemented the cross-realm LFG tool in Wrath.  Where once you had to gather a group and coordinate, suddenly five random people were shoved together and they expected to get their loot quickly.
---
In Cata, Blizz decided that dungeons should be challenging again.  Unfortunately, they had just spent a year+ conditioning the players to expect aoe spammed loot hallways.  I think this is a major reason why many people disliked Cata (right up there with the half-a-raid tier that was Firelands).
---
Disable graveyards in the world (no effect on bgs), only allow resurrection through character action (spells or item use).
---
&gt;Hammer and magic helmet?
---
 Red Snappah!
---
You hit the nail on the head.
---
Until that one sour moment that happens to every warlock... Use you for a summons and then kicks you. I still remember that day.
---
After returning to retail after a year people were using these terms all the time and I had no idea what it was though.
---
In my vanilla guild it was given as a reward to our highest attendance member out of our Shamans/Warriors as it was known that no matter who got it would just be using it for fun on the weekends for an off spec.
---
The mats weren't that bad if you were in a raiding guild and quite a few guilds on our server had them long before AQ opened let alone Naxx.
---
In theory, it might be great but it all comes down to what you want out of the game.  
---
It by no circumstances has the modern style of games and it is difficult and can be boring and grindy to play at times but this is what a lot of us enjoyed.  
---
If you are looking to experience what it was 15 years ago to be a MMO player and GRIND, make friends along the way then you will not have any problem.  
---
If you want something to jump into and be rewarded for purchasing and logging in then it's not the game for you.  
---
Classic wow was from a age of people who expected to work hard for a reward that you remembered because you went through a journey to get there.
---
When a random Inn in Elwyn forest has a higher population of Draenei women than Exodar does.
---
Gunna miss a few but sunder armor , curse of elements/shadows, faerie fire, shadow weaving if theres a lot of locks, winter’s chill, nightfall, curse of weakness/recklessness, demo/thunderclap on prog for dmg reduction, piercing if you are melee heavy
---
I was thinking about a war too but for pvp I need a pocket healer... And If i go tank I couldn't do pvp the way I want to do it
---
...
---
And the correct answer is: "No it isn't".
---
A class-based RPG game CANNOT be balanced, that goes contrary to its core design.
---
&gt;This is my idea and i would definitely give it a try
---
No shit you would try your own idea. This last paragraph is just you deep inhaling your own fart and orgasming over how great your terrible vision of a hard core server is.
---
"Disable the ah no one would use it anyway" Look at POE hard core servers to see why this is wrong.
---
Theres just nothing good about your idea at all. That being said a hard core version of wow where when your character dies it's dead would be cool. They could do it just like POE or diablo where they have seasons and ladders, once you die your removed from the ladder and your character pops over to softcore.it would be neat if they did crazy twists like POE does also like with the rifts and the shrines and shit that add an extra challenge and reward.
---
Oh okay. I've just been leveling a priest on beta and I found myself constantly having to calculate which healing spell is the most mana efficient before running a dungeon. And because every 2 levels only some of the spells get new ranks then it would shift around often. 
---
So my suggestion would be to sort the spells from most to least mana efficient and filter out the spells unavailable on certain level. For example: for my 30lvl priest it's showing greater heal but not lesser heal for example.
---
Based on polls it's what 1/3rd of NA players used as the acronym for Deadmines. Luckily the other 85% of the world uses the correct DM. Also they have a discrepancy in explaining why they use it. Most will say it's to avoid confusion with Dire Maul (terrible argument) and some will say it's because of the quest (better argument).
---
Undead mage checking in
---
&gt;no chance of surviving Barrens chat.
---
That's because most people here have no idea what that was like, hell most were not even born when it was a thing.
---
What is the name of this meme?
---
Its not easy to take them out though.
---
&gt;Warlocks can't DOT the boss in raids because of the debuff limit.
---
You would need to have a crazily optimized raid to warrant filling them up, there is almost always space for at least CoD/Corruption.
---
I think people over estimate locks in pvp. They are hard countered by warriors (the most common class in the game) and hard countered by rogues (the most common pvp class in the game) if they don't have Death Coil up. They obliterate everyone else though.
---
I remember trying to do Deadmines with no tank. Me and another hunter brought our bears and tried our hardest. I really cant remember if we ever made it through the end, but I do remember several wipes.
---
Its not good and it is a black hole of mats. It should just be open to anyone who actually wants to make it. Maybe a bid of sorts between those who want it. And none of the mats should come from the guild. At least that's how I'd do it.
---
What I mean is having lvl 60 dudes camping redridge killing the same people over and over again and corpse camping, I think nowadays Blizz considers that harassment and will punish people for it, whereas in pservers more or less anything goes, 60's will camp redridge for hours on end meaning if you're in redridge levelling and get ganked the only thing you can do more or less is go to a different zone which isn't always possible.
---
Cause Boggs doesn't get beat, he go beat
---
Warlocks are lots of fun! But don't let the polls dictate what you play. They are unreliable and even if they're true the difference between classes will be marginal. Play what you want to play!
---
Will you farm the plans with your bs? My bs should be warrior but heard leveling is pain and unless the arcanite plan is BoP I prefer farming it with my main
---
Listing every possible debuff in the game doesn't mean they are all applied. No one bothers, e.g. with Curse of Weakness
---
If you still have your account details, you will be able to recover everything and play all content up to the latest expansion. And you will be able to play Classic on release.
---
an undead rogue who cant beat a warlock is playing the wrong game. they should try solitaire instead
---
That sounds like way to much work! Just add the option to copy a character to the new expansion server.
---
I always found warriors easy as a lock in vainilla. Rogues and hunters would give me much more trouble. As a lock you're supposed to control the fight the whole time. Rogues play the same way and with hunters it's always mayhem which made it difficult
---
I personally think that Blizzard is kinda done with retail. They are releasing older content while working on wow2.
---
I´m having a hard time deciding between Undead Warlock and Undead priest. I leaning towards Warlock because i want to be able to world pvp, but priest looks really fun aswell. I played a NE Rogue in Vanilla, but i want to try something different this time around.
---
This subreddit is heavily skewed toward min-maxers and the focus is on competitive raid progression.
---
Realistically it doesn’t matter, and (mostly) all content is doable with a wide range of compositions without popping full consumes on every fight. Play what you want — you might not be in the “cutting edge” guilds that clear new content the first two weeks after release, but you may find the game more enjoyable that way.
---
So many questions about an item you don't even know the name of.
---
well played, thought you were serious with this shit.... reading everyday on this subreddit misinformation sperged out by streamers and player who have never played vanilla made me certain that everyone here is serious :)
---
Fuck PVE realms I guess. Also who can in good faith truly argue that you aren't immersed in a world when you can fly above it, see everything and even find hidden spots high and away from the normal ground level.
---
normies mad
---
Humans have Sword Specialization making them the best PVE rogues
---
A concerning choice but I don’t hate it.
---
Why judge a literal turd against other turds, after all, it’s just another item on the menu. Who cares if it doesn’t taste as good as tendies or steak, the turds on the menu and is good to be thrown at people so why can’t people just eat turds.
---
My friend back in the day played a retadin and i played hunter, we did alot of content as a duo, but we were never geared enough to do dungeons. I think at level 60 the pet can be talented to be pretty tanky, but since it doesnt scale with your gear it has an upper limit.
---
OK, but that's kinda the same thing?
---
You'd just copy your characters over to the new servers.
---
Open beta in 2004. Rolled an orc warrior and remember spawning in the orangeness that is Durotar. That's the only memory I have of my first character. I was 18 years old.
---
This was a good tier explanation
---
I dislike caps and cooldowns.  If I have the time let me do what I want with it.  Gating everyone behind caps and cooldowns rather than actual challenging difficulty is what every garbage mobile game does.  I don't like paying a monthly fee just to have a game tell me I'm not allowed to do anything.  I understand why they utilize daily quests, caps, and cooldowns, but if you look at the actual bottom line reasoning it's "we don't have enough content so we're going to dribble it out in tiny bits until we feel like a certain percentage of the player base is all on the same level of completion, and hopefully by then we'll have some new content."
---
I know Vanilla WoW has some major Quality of Life / convenience issues and it's not just the rose colored glasses blinding me here.  I've been seriously considering getting back into WoW just to play Classic again because I felt like I earned things, rather than "welp, I logged in and redid this same thing for three months and all I got was this lousy t-shirt."  The quest lines to get keys to access new areas and gearing up to enter more difficult dungeons...  I felt like I was being compelled via logic of the WoW universe to do those things, not because I need some arbitrary number to be bigger on my paper doll.
---
Now?  Last time I was poking around you can't enter certain dungeons until your gear's item level is high enough.  The game is boiled down to the base mechanics behind it all the and no one cares about the screwed up lore or story anymore.  
---
I always hear the same argument: "no one is forcing you to do anything," but this is a bit of a strawman fallacy which tries to deflate someone's opinion on hating this stuff.  No one forced anyone to get keyed to Scholomance by completing that long quest chain back in the day but if you didn't do it you'd end up standing around yelling in chat, begging for another player who had the key to open the door for you.  The concept is similar.  All Blizzactivision has done over the years is shuffle the grind around while telling everyone it's new and improved, when it's still the same old XP grind, BoP currency grinds, reputation grinds, etc.  The issue today is they don't even try to cover it up anymore.  You can log into WoWhead and see exactly how many days it will take to repeat daily quests to get exalted, or whatever the reward is.  It's mundane and boring.
---
IIRC Enchanting is really only profitable if you’re the first one with sought-after recipes, like Crusader or Spell Power to Gloves. It’s still okay if you run a lot of dungeons and DE the BoP drops, as long as shards don’t flood the market.
---
I recall target calling/discipline being the major factor. I never felt really hampered by not having engineering.
---
Seems about as likely as coming out with TBC and stripping away all the new things they added to it because people have a stick up their ass about flying.
---
Nope. Female troll everything that can be troll.
---
How many zones are contested territory vs ones that aren't? It won't just be 1 zone you spend 1 day in it'll be many zones. I only mentioned Redridge and Duskwood because those are the low end areas that are worst for it and that you hear no one complaining about back during Vanilla yet they are areas that get ganked constantly by top end players in pservers.
---
So either you're one of those sad people who find it fun purely ganking low end people in BiS gear at 19 or at 60 or you're just being completely ignorant to what I am saying.
---
I made that mistake. Don't.
---
\*insert "But why?" meme
---
Maybe not my earliest but one of my favorites from the very beginning. My very first roll, a Tauren Shaman, I'm level 5 or 6 and working on Bloodhoof Village quests when I encounter the Alliance for the very first time. A high level Gnome on a mechano strider who stopped, said some things which were garbled by the cross faction language obfuscation, emoted a few times, and ran off. The sad creature's pathetic attempt to communicate, I thought, how adorable.
---
It was quite a magical encounter.
---
So much this.
---
the old models are really showing their age haha
---
Lmao right? Everyone brings these up as if they were necessary but if you were on your shit or in a good guild dailies weren't essential. 
---
Dailies offered extra gold, some rep and some gear you could use if you just didn't have good gear.
---
Yea Blizzard really held a gun to your head there!
---
/s
---
No idea what you’re talking about mate. Plans for making Mooncloth and transmuting Arcanite are from vendors. Nothing is BoP and there’s no farming involved.
---
- favorite race is dwarf
---
- enjoy playing priest
---
It just happens to be meta aswell...guess im just lucky
---
If you're playing on a private server right now, what you're experiencing is only because Classic is about to come out in two months. Gold doesn't matter. Progression doesn't matter. The only thing left to do is to go kill some folks.
---
When players feel there is progression to be had, they mostly tend to focus on that. Gearing up, farming gold, gathering for consumables, etc. 
---
So no, it won't be as bad as it presently is on private servers. Yes, there will be gankers in Redridge still, but it won't be nearly as constant as it is presently nor will the amount of gankers be as high.
---
You mean I don't even have to stop playing when I go to the toilet?
---
Come back at 60 for your revenge and you might, if you're lucky...
---
Yessssss.
---
Activision® market research isn't going to do itself.
---
Am i the only one that actually likes playing priest?!
---
I've definitely heard people saying that Blizzard considers corpse camping and stuff harassment nowadays because it completely impacts a players ability to play the game, if one person keeps camping you and killing you over and over again you basically can't play, all you can do in that situation is take rez sickness which means 0 questing for 10 minutes and then hoping that after those 10 mins you can go back to questing, and thats assuming there isn't another person camping the graveyard, and to your point about asking for help, that isn't always possible on pservers as the amount of times when playing a pserver I have been ganked by skull levelled players heavily outweigh the amount of times I've seen any high level people helping the levellers in that zone, yet you will constantly see people in general mentioning how there is someone ganking. With that being said, allowing people to do that will probably affect peoples drive to play the game, meaning either people will quit or PvE servers will get even more populated.
---
Considering you'll be leleving/grinding as shadow i think you underestimate shadow world pvp potential.
---
Also mcing someone into guards/off the cliff is boatloads of fun
---
if there were millions who still played (including me, I had fun) during the one year of siege of orgrimmar during mists of pandaria there is no doubt people will continue playing this to the end of days
---
Why do I remember all the videos and songs by heart after not hearing them so many years ._.
---
Warlock is the best if u want to dps but still have good chances to join a raid
---
It's a simple concept, if you have the choice between a class that does 1k and a class that does 700, why wouldnt you bring the one that does 1k? Obviously these are example numbers and not accurate but you get my point, outside of utility it's pretty cut and dry in a perfect scenario.
---
The main issue I've seen, and this is very prevalent in retail aswell, is that people over estimate the importance of themselves and the content they are doing, ultra minmaxing is only necessary for the very bleeding edge guilds who are really pushing the content, for regular and even fairly hardcore players it's actually irrelevant which they bring to a raid, especially in vanilla where you are 1 in 40.
---
I think it was a distinction mostly between regions. "VC" was pretty prominent right from the beginning in NA servers probably due at least in part to holdover habits of EverQuest asking to go in dungeons for particular reasons when they were often frequented multiple times for different quests. 
---
On EU servers, VC as a reference to anything Deadmines never really took off, or so I have been told.
---
VC of course means VanCleef, so people on NA servers were calling for a group to Deadmines specifically to kill VanCleef. This stuck on certain servers, particularly in North America, and there was not a huge amount of contention about the two different naming references until regions started combining more on private servers.
---
Based on private servers i worry that there will be soo fucking many healers compared to vanilla. Back then you were in demand. In private servers (in the instances healers actually want to run), you are the LEAST wanted player. Usually you cant even find a group.
---
Then again, you can just run with your friends, so...
---
Thanks for the discord link brah 👍
---
&gt; like they have to do something and then it becomes a job and not enjoyable. A lot of people would rather just not play that game then feel that bad feeling.
---
Like you said how is this different than no life grinding? Who cares if it offers a more casual approach to gaining one thing in the game?
---
Like what?
---
So unless you can just no life grind the same mobs over and over you won't deserve the rep or feel rewarded?
---
Thought it was a lock, mages have the blue robe ?
---
When I'll transfer to classic BC I'll be done with my main on classic.
---
From a cosmetic stand point whatever. Orc in classic is hands down the better minmax race.
---
So SEP basically.
---
Exactly! WoW on-the-go and while-you-go!
---
I want to be SM/Ruin and be able to use corruption for those insta cast shadow bolts. Highly unlikely ?
---
Most of the QoL stuff required in Vanilla came by way of addons and mods.  All the stuff that was added to the actual releases over the years has been directly stolen from all those addons.  I mean, I shouldn't say "stolen" because the ToS and EULA state that Blizzard is allowed to do that stuff, but still.  All these people out there working on their mods and updating them for every patch, only to have Blizzard take their idea and implement it while acting like they thought of it was kinda lame if you ask me.
---
We don't know what the servers will be like yet so I guess we don't know, I doubt it will have as many servers as retail but I think it'll have more than just the 1 PvP and PvE server as is the case on the Beta
---
Lots of competition to getting gear and lots of rogues trying to get into premade pvp aside from that you'll be fine.
---
Mighty generous to call some blog, youtube video or facebook post a news publication.
---
alliance: gnome for intelligence, escape artist, and engineering  
---
horde: undead pvp for wotf and horde pve for berserking
---
Yep.  Each new expansion was basically a whole new game completely unrelated to the previous.  All the achievements were copy/pastes of all the ones you just spent six months working on.  I couldn't stand it.
---
If alliance is easy mode why are you going alliance?
---
I understand, thanks for reading. I realize talking about money really cheapened my point and triggered a hell of a lot of people.
---
Although I don't know the numbers I don't think pservers will have way more population than classic servers, especially since any pserver will be stealing Blizzard's game at that point since they will finally have their own classic servers and they may try harder to shut down all pservers.
---
Ferals are actually great, also the best tanks for the first runs of MC, Kitty is dope with powershifting, won't outclass rogue warrior but not far (and they buff the group, provide great utility spells, can be emergency tanks or even healers with the right tree)...
---
Appreciate your input anw, I am moonkin main and the only class that I felt was the closest (gameplay wise) was SP, I have affection for SP and will probably play one in later stages.
---
yes And no.... once you have enough of a certain class to cover raid requirements (trans in hunters case) you then start seeing them more for their dps output. You lump all dps into one group and pick the ones with the biggest numbers.
---
Yes I am, since Brack has said that Classic Wow servers would continue to be maintained even if the player base was incredibly small.
---
Not really, you're competing against every DPS on the board, not just your class. Classes that do less DPS or HPS tend to have some kind of utility to off-set this. Its why people bring at least 1 Druid despite every other class being able to perform better in per second value. MotW, Battle Res, and Innervate are powerful utility spells.
---
WoW on Stadia?
---
The game gonna last a long time so you can play multiples
---
Rotate leveling so u always got rested xp
---
Why play Gnome if your paladin slave can freedom you?
---
Been learning norsk and holy shit.. what I heard about danish being the red headed step child of the scandinavian languages seems rather true.
---
Hey do me a favor and post what server you join on launch so I know how to avoid you.
---
I was talking about Arcanite Reaper sorry I should have been more specific x)
---
HUNTERWEP
---
Hi, /u/Blundergun
---
Yeah, just google LUL emote/Kappa emote/Pogchamp emote and you'll see them.

You had to raid to get the best gear in slot until BC came out with all the segregated PvP and Arena rewards.  It was put in because of all the complaints by the vanilla PvP player base.  They felt like it wasn't fair to have to raid and be sociable to get the best gear.  I can see their point but being forced to do PvP as a PvE player to get certain rewards just flipped the coin over.  It didn't actually solve the issue.
---
Where are the movement buttons??
---
Maybe dot an add?
---
Nope. Much better on an offtank spamming hamstring or hunter spamming wing clip
---
I have played on many different pservers and have played on ones since before Classic was released and this has always been a huge issue with all of them, the zones are almost constantly being ganked at all times, making it near impossible to quest there especially when they're killing quest givers.
---
It is really hard to say. Low-level ganking will happen on PvP server 100%. Will Blizzard do anything about it? If they follow their old guidelines from back in the day probably not. The pserver you are probably talking about has this group of "special" individuals who have chosen their end-game to be the total lockdown of redridge. It won't be as bad on actual classic unless those same people/people like them roll on your server.
---
Its not really that bad as long as you stay flexible in your attitude. A certain zone being too hot? Just join some BGs for the night instead or pick a different quest to work on. Certain areas are always active like STV, but I never remember getting hassled all that much.
---
People told me pservers have 10k+ player online at all time. Blizzard servers were capped at 2.5k and I'm sure layering is meant to lower those numbers drastically. Day1 maybe we see layers with only a few hundreds players.
---
Oh man, such a cliffhanger!
---
Nope. Troll is better. The orc racials are nube traps.
---
I tried to twink myself as a 19 rogue (9 years old) using only that characters money. I leveled enchanting and ran dungeons painstakingly, realized I would level to 20 before I was ready, then grinded dungeons to 29 to get the best loot. I never really had any money, sometimes I sold gear to afford my many repair bills
---
I was obsessed with the weapon enchants that glowed, and went through something like +3 or +5 damage I think, beastslayer, fiery, lifestealing, looking for the best weapon glow.
---
Finally I was 29, I had bullshitted my way to phat gnomer loot, glowing daggers, everything. I even bought potions, thistle tea mats, etc.
---
And I was terrible in BGs anyway lmao. I was an UD rogue named Bonestalker
---
Using the "Click to Move" option in the interface menu lets you right click on terrain/objects/enemies to walk to them.
---
Yea I never tried doing pet tank for dungeons at higher levels.
---
What's the other 5%? How are hunters?
---
Why so toxic over me pointing out obvious issues with pservers?
---
Well who's to say it didn't happen?
---
My guild once spent 8hrs clearing ZG, this was back before they nerfed that bat bitch boss and her fire bombs.... but yeah the meme was in good fun and if anything I will miss the two day long AVs
---
Sounds like the early days on any server.
---
I see Asmongold in title, I downvote, simple!
---
Just make a one time copy to a gay BC server and let the character also stay on the vanilla server. If blizzard gonna do something like, copy your char to bc and lose it on the vanilla server they will lose so many players cause of this.
---
I know that day. Nothing like being alliance and running all the way to Shadowfang Keep in your low 20s from iron forge because you didnt have any closer flightpaths just to summon someone and get the boot.
---
Some dudes are just default angry all the time. Not a healthy way to live.
---
A priest main from vanilla. NEVER use SW:S in a instance. Its horrible heal/mana, you shouldnt have any problems keeping the tank up without it. Only thing you can do in low level instances is A) with asspulling run out of mana (or if the tank is blind and pulls when you are oom) or B) bossfight if your tank/dps takes too much damage/you dont have the dps to kill the boss fast enough. So using a shield that wastes the only thing between a wipe and success, dont use it.
---
Just do the BIG HEAL+renew combo and try to get regen from 5s rule and you will be golden.
---
I think the private server vets will have a rude awakening finding that raid bosses work a lot differently than they are used to.
---
I'm planning on an Undead rogue. If I ever roll alliance it's gona be a Night elf hunter. Those 2 classes are what's fun in my book. I've been debating on what to roll and finally settled on the faction being the deciding point. Sure orc hunters are powerful. But nothing comes close to nightelfs shadow melds and it's applications. That's just my opinion
---
Don't give the ideas!
---
* Sunder
---
* Faerie Fire
---
* Curse of Recklessness
---
* Curse of Shadows
---
* Curse of Elements
---
* Thunder Clap/Thunderfury (same effect)
---
* Gift of Arthas
---
* Annihilator 
---
* Winter’s Chill/Improved Scorch
---
* Shadow Weaving
---
* Nightfall
---
* Demo Shout/Roar
---
* Ignite for later raids
---
That’s 13+Ignite. Probably forgetting a few. Didn’t put Judgements (of light) since it’s alliance-only. Also didn’t put the 2nd Thunderfury debuff but that one will be there once you get a TF.
---
What the heck, did you post this from the future? The countdown I'm looking at still has 78 days
---
You are right. The min-maxers are planning on farming and speed running the raids. Clearing the content is not that hard and Blizzard will give enough time to more casual guilds.
---
Warlock summoning stones...so raids are only 30min late instead of 60.
---
Oh I thought you were talking to me, I don't use reddit that much and don't understand it that well. Sorry!
---
This is basically 100% accurate
---
unfortunately it has been tested and doesn't work
---
Agree with this comment. Shedo shows the routes to maximize your time running Gnomer to get the pummeler and so forth as well. He's very committed to the concept of feral DPS. Keep in mind, seeing the practice of what is required to be a competitive may turn you off the idea entirely. It is a lot of work. 
---
For bear tank, look up Skarm. He has tank videos for different classes, but he shows how you can bear tank even through Naxx. Of course, this probably won't be the case for bleeding-edge progression guilds, but bear tanks can be quite viable.
---
Getting lava MCed leads to player vs keyboard
---
You’re right, the bosses having less armor than they do on pservers is going to make things fun and challenging /s
---
File this under things I forgot I was going to have to do again.
---
I think we'll see more warlocks this time than back in the actual vanilla. 
---
I know polls on this sub don't represent the whole playerbase, but almost in every poll on this sub warlock is in top 3 classes, meanwhile rogue and hunter are below. Hunter is like in the middle.
---
There are dozens of us!
---
No Skada planned?
---
Yeah, it's funny because it's **really** not that hard. Like, in Vanilla if a guild were to all pop consumables and flasks during BWL progression they would have probably gotten laughed at for wasting a bunch of gold to try and easy-mode the fights. And that was back when half the players were keyboard-turning clickers.
---
As alliance, do you think it's pretty similar at 40-60? He hasn't finished alliance as of yet and I'm currently 52 on a private server testing out for when classic launches
---
Thanks, I see why there's no place for a ton of poisons and dots.
---
I'm still deciding between rogue, hunter and warlock. I'm thinking about it every day, and every day I change my opinion.
---
I'll probably roll a dice before release.
---
Reeeee
---
Didn’t seem like he was legitimately complaining. Just telling about when it happens. I highly doubt he (whom is a big PvP’er) is particularly scared to roll on a PvP server.
---
Apparently it wont work anymore
---
Thanks. I hate it.
---
eh, but playing a priest is fun (or is it only me?) 
---
I'll be playing either Night Elf or Human priest tho
---
Daily quests are horrible. They were introduced into WoW by Jeff Kaplan. They leverage what is called "loss aversion." If you don't log in then you feel like you missed out on that gold you could have earned if you had completed the daily quest. This is unethical a form of psychological manipulation to get you to log in every day and keep playing.
---
Lotus was 50 on nost pve
---
If I may ask here. I don't understand the point of stadia. It isn't a console right? I see it like the steam box where you still need to have your PC on it just broadcasts the games from your PC to your tv. Am I guessing what it does correctly? Seems cool if that's what it's goal is but I was so confused what it was
---
I use this site literally every day lol thanks for what you do!
---
My first AV I got into was going on for 18 hours already, I played the last 2 and had the time of my life in my hunter.  I found I could jump over the horde base wall with aspect of the cheetah and flanked the horde from behind stuns boxes.  (Too poor to have a mount at all thanks to leveling engineering)
---
Leveling, it's just a matter of fact you will be drinking water a lot. Get more int to have a larger spell pool, use Mage Armor so you can regen at higher ranks, like rank 2 or gets a lot better
---
Next level fishing
---
Cant learn how to tame a beast in stormwind, would have to run all the way back to their starting area again for the quest
---
Can you still get reputation for grey quests? 
---
I've been seeing mixed answers on my searches for this one.
---
I think @cursor came in... Legion?
---
Whenever I saw an opposing faction member flagged for PvP and AFK sitting on his flying mount I'd hit him with whatever insta-cast spell my fire mage had and then cast slow fall on myself with a /wave at the enemy as he splattered.  People would switch characters and whisper their rage at me.  It was so worth it.
---
Lvl 30 grenades by themselves are enough to make engineering significantly better than every other profession. If you level it up and get reflectors/net/boots/helm that's just the gravy.
---
&gt; They are unreliable and even if they're true the difference between classes will be marginal.
---
The point is not having to wait half a day to get even a 5man going.   
---
I remember in vanilla I could spend hours spamming LFM as a DPS, whereas as a healer (in later expansions), I was basically chosing whether to go or not, and tanks probably had it even easier.
---
I'm going human rogue to be a rogue/mage killer. I know there will be a LOT of undead rogues, and mages; I hate forsaken, and I plan to sweep Lordaeron clean.
---
Can you explain how is this possible please? Genuinely interested.
---
Unless you can prove it with screenshots or a video then it's def. not fact
---
That's the bot farm right? I saw in news some time ago that they lost case in Germany or something like that and had to pay Blizz
---
It was 2006. Like usual I went to my friends house after school. On the way he told about this new game he got, World of Warcraft. It was pretty cool game and world is big, he said. So we go to his house and launched his PC. He had troll mage, around level 10. He allowed me to try that game. I killed couple mobs and asked what other things you can do in game. He told me about professions so I went to collect couple herbs and I did some fishing.
---
I thought it is cool game so I asked mom if we can get it. My friend said that it comes with 1 month free game time. I knew it wasn't easy to make my mom to buy game that has monthly subscription fee. But as there was free month she agreed that I can try it. So next day we went to local supermarket and got me my copy of World of Warcraft.
---
Installation progress was long like we all know. And of course after installing game from disc, it required me to download patch. Which again took quite some time. Well after this I was able to create my account but disappointment for that night was huge. You had to actually buy game time to get that free month. Well my mom has always been sceptic with internet stores so she didn't want me to use her credit card. So I had to wait for next day when we again went to supermarket and bought 60 days pre paid game time card. I used those cards for a very long time. When I got my own card it for some reason didn't work with Blizzard services (and not with many other online stores either).
---
After many days of waiting I was finally able to log in to the game. I created my first character, a tauren druid. Before that we had time at school to talk about different classes and after hearing how druid can take forms of different animals, I was pretty much sold. From there started my almost 15 years journey and that noob tauren druid has grown up and still walks in Azeroth today.
---
Basically the games run on Google's servers and they're streamed to your device (Chromecast, Phone, Laptop, whatever) without you having to have a good PC at all.
---
I feel like normally it’ll be pretty even this time around.
---
But apparently in PvE servers, the ratio is like 2:1 for the alliance
---
On horde side troll is top tier for pve.
---
Gnome camera height is also nauseating.
---
Ah I see, thanks a bunch. Didnt understand it when I saw them talk about it on stage
---
I feel like you are me. NE rogue main back in the day, and I'm debating both choices as well.
---
DONT SHOW THEM THIS
---
Sure, it's a touchscreen laptop and I turned on the "Click to Move" option in the interface menu. The only other thing I had to do was to swap the bindings of left and right click so I could tap the screen to right click.
---
It's crafted thorium ammo, I made a killing on the ah making that stuff.
---
It streams the games from google’s servers to any device of yours, be it a PC, TV, or even your phone. Seems like a good idea but the biggest concern is latency.
---
Got wow on my 12th birthday in 2006, and made a dwarf paladin. My best friend and I both got it on the same day, so after some levelling we ended up trying the stormwind glitch that our other friends told us about. We both got stuck endlessly falling under the world, and didn’t know about GM tickets or anything so we deleted our characters and made humans. Then another friend gave me 1g and I felt like the richest mofo ever
---
Like what are you looking for? Macros for changing cVar stuff? Or general use macros involving character spells?
---
Usually the more commonly used complex macros for skills would be something involving whether it cast at their mouseover, target or themselves. Some possibly with modifiers for shift/alt/ctrl to also have the ability cast at their focus, if one exists.
---
People who complain about people deciding "something so simple" on this forum are absolutely insufferable.
---
Definitely seems like a concern. If it works with wow maybe it'll be a good investment? Heard it's only $130 for it??
---
Why? When at full health that racial gives precisely 0 extra frosbolts.
---
What sort of end game are you talking about? Like just generic 60 stuff or getting the hard to get shit
---
Getting the hard to get shit, like truly end game stuff
---
Fishing and cooking
---
Personally i am yet to stumble upon a server where alliance outnumbers horde..and with more man power comes more chance of winning
---
You officially ruined my day
---
Yeah it cant proc itself due to an internal cooldown :)
---
I think the pet is good enough to CC and thing in the healer by pulling agro off the healer.  But it won't tank a whole group.
---
Yeah but you need 5/5 t2.5 for seal fate and death's sting to make it viable (lose aged core leather gloves).  All of your non human (is that a thing?) dps warriors want death's sting as well because ds+pugio+aclg are bis for non human warriors.
---
Alchemy and tailoring/bs/enchanting
---
All of then have rare/sought after crafts that will always sell well
---
I will have to look into this! Thanks.
---
The mail telling me i have acces to the beta !
---
Alliance have longer queues and players had more gear because more guilds doing PVE content.
---
Horde had better premade, easier to rank and had more guilds that focus PVP. Solo player you would get groups of kids playing rogues, not an enjoyable experience.
---
Yeah, I hated daily quests too, repeating the same fucking thing everyday, deteriorated my love for the game too
---
There was an addon that people used to make sure most of the 40 man was in the same battleground before they even entered and would just decline and reque if it wasn't a majority.
---
That’s for the controller. And you definitely won’t use a controller for wow. Stadia is free, you only have to pay for the games if I’m not wrong. There is Stadia pro for 10 USD which i believe is similar to playstation plus. Besides, if you want to play games with a controller, any controller would work, not necessarily stadia controller (I don’t remember its name).
---
You got facerolled for this post, and rightfully so
---
I really don't want wildcard to end, it's so much more fun than you'd expect.
---
Harder to rank
---
Haha it's ok! My comment was in response to the one directly above it.
---
Which spec is best for priest? Holy or Disc?
---
Haha I had that exact screenshot too! Thought I had found the most secret spot in the whole game.
---
Really? I never would have thought those two.
---
Maybe fishing I could see with like rare stuff to catch?
---
Is it kinda like skinning where you can eventually skin Nax if you have special gear on to up your 300 profession skill to I think 315?
---
And what about cooking does it just have big pay off in the end with high quality food that sells well?
---
These are just wild assumptions because I generally really didint think of these two for end game
---
Engineering is super strong in general (bombs/gadgets for stuns in pvp, pve utility (the aspeed chicken, sapper charges for aoe, repair/vendor bot), general utility (some teleporters)), and is generally recommended for pretty much everyone looking to get an edge in both pvp and pve.   
---
Alchemy is also good because you will want those consumables for either gold making or raiding anyway.
---
A green staff dropped for me in the corner of teldrassil on the night elf Druid I started on (and quit after seeing my first priest in shadow form and deciding that was way cooler) over by where you have a quest to kill a named furbolg that’s outside.
---
Just look at the rest of our gear, do we have BiS in any slot even? Different times back then. I wanted t2 robe for a long time but i never had most dkp when it dropped. Im happy i got the naxx robe tho.
---
Demonic runes?
---
There is a list: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_mind_controllable_mobs
---
Feel free to add stuff. It's not only buffs, some mobs can basically murder their entire pack or be fairly competent healers. I always liked my Thuzadin in Strat zu save mana.
---
No fair, I need it for my auction house quest.
---
 
---
###  Demonic Rune's
---
True,but thats got nothing to do with op asking which side will dominate
---
"Cloud gaming services" like Stadia and GeForce Now are currently against Blizzard's TOS, so that would have to change before I'd ever consider it.
---
The super rare recipe and mats are raid drop. They will go to the raid tailor/enchant/skinner etc...
---
Haha this hit home for me. I'm in the exact same position only my classes are paladin -&gt; lock -&gt; rogue -&gt; hunter. I have through all expansions tried to main a different class but eventually returned to my hunter. I would love to main a human rogue but I'm fearing the pre-bis gear grind and not having any utilities to bring to the group.
---
Enchanting is probably the one that’s most accurate to what you’re looking for. Engineering is mostly just used for PvP. Tailoring can be since early in vanilla you won’t get the really nice recipes until later raids. 
---
LW and BS are pretty strong most of the way to max because of leather/mail users needing agi or intellect and there being a ton of warriors (and pallies if you’re alliance. Alchemy is probably gonna be one of the big profs too since you need so many consumables for raids. 
---
So in short: enchanting is probably the biggest payoff since it’s hard to level but great to have enchanters with high level chants. Plus if you get things like crusader you’ll be a huge asset if you’re in a raiding guild or even in a PvP one
---
That's very wrong though, atleast for E.
---
They are also one of the better pets for pvp. Their root is nuts. Decent tank for leveling. I would advice a gorilla but they are picky with food
---
It still increases 10% at full health with mqg that is a massive increase.  Frostbolt is 2.5 second cast.  At full health it is 2.25 seconds.  That is more frostbolts.  You could also just use demonic rune.
---
While I expect there to be more of them than originally in vanilla, healers are still most likely going to be in very short supply (relatively), so I don't think it's going to be an issue of over-saturation anyway (unless you mean over-saturated among healers).
---
Black smithing is pretty bad unless you get some rare shit like lion heart helm, if you get that you’ll make a shitload of gold.
---
 Tailoring is good for some casters because of bloodvine but it won’t make you much gold.  
---
Alchemy is great if you get flask recipes, you’ll make a killing if you have the right recipes.
---
Leatherworking has 3 different types and none of them make a ton of gold outside of the devilsaur sets, but you’ll have to get devilsaur leather somewhere. There’s also the onyxia scale cloak that everyone needs
---
Engineering is a gold sink for sure, it won’t make you any money directly, but it’s by far the best profession in vanilla. You get access to so much more shit with engineering that it’s pretty much necessary if you’re going to pvp at all and lots of raids will even require it.
---
Oow sounds cool does that give enough for an extra cast?
---
Yes but that's a player created channel. Anyone can create that channel and put a password on it so that nobody can join. I'm talking about default channels.
---
Source on this?
---
Alliance will have better premades and faster queues on pvp servers. Most go horde for the racials but paladins are so good in organized pvp
---
Well, people were shouting 1.12 at Blizzard for over a year so it's no surprise that that's exactly what we're getting.
---
You get important buff from food. A lot of people don't bother leveling it but will buy them. Consumables are always needed.
---
Don't talk about stuff you don't know or experienced.
---
Haha thanks for that advice!
---
It's not. Cat dps is literal shit. I've had (good) cat dps almost bring outdpsed by tanks.
---
Hi, /u/CrookedHillaryShill
---
Tauren warriors Always make up for that stun resist with having a crew of healers with them. Every op tauren warrior i knew back in day seemed like some op leaders who always had two healers following.
---
Dwarf rogue reporting in
---
If I had 15 years to research AND had a bunch of addon's along with next to no knowledge of the raids, I sure as hell would think it would be hard, too.
---
Spot on thanks
---
You're a shadowbolt machine and forego the dots

That section was recently added, and GeForce Now removed Blizzard games from their "Supported" list shortly after that change.
---
They are fun and strong but you need a lot of soul shards to be super strong. If you get caught out and you have no shards your only big survival tool is 1 voidwalker sac which is still a huge shield. They’re still super strong though, especially considering wpvp there’s a good chance when you fear somebody they will get mobs aggrod on them too.
---
I lost it when you said get a fucking job. Normally I hate when people say shit like that but for some reason this time it made me laugh .... hard
---
I agree it’s the most useful profession.
---
On laughing skull we had a dude do this with ele shaman.  I too have nightmares of those 5x chain lightning +5x frost shocks.
---
The classic experience was a bunch of kids saying dumb racist shit in the barrens chat as well. In fact my most vivid memories of vanilla are dumb kids being dramatic constantly. Nothing has changed
---
## It turns out the pservers were laughably wrong regarding the parry chance for bosses. So, what does this mean for feral druids, Tanking warriors, and fury dps warriors?
---
Pally is the best healer ever
---
I still feel like the inflated ass prices for things on retail are going to carry over too classic. There's no incentive for people to put up a stack of copper bars for a fair price rather than just jack that shit up to like 20g.
---
Maybe if they actually released an RP-PVP server **at launch this time** things would be different.
---
Yeah people like to take this way too far on one side of the spectrum. When in reality there is 100 percent a middle ground. I play warlock always have, but ffs give the paladins a damn taunt
---
Do you know where the “Susan express “ name meme came from? I truly would love to know
---
please play priest or warlock to deal with the mage overpopulation
---
Wouldn’t you like to know, weather boy?
---
You're competing only with other players of your own class in terms of 'who is the better player/more geared/has brought more consumables/got luckier'. You are competing with every player of your role in terms of 'who should be brought'.
---
alch and herb
---
It’s like one shadowbolt every 75 seconds of corruption uptime. The reason you’d want corruption up is it’s just a flat dps increase to have it up, it’ll likely get knocked off though so if it’s getting knocked off it’s just a waste of a global and mana.
---
Yeah your 'source' doesn't have any relevant data
---
Levelling in the barrens while watching Liverpool AC Milan 2005 champions League final. Good times.
---
I played on Defias Brotherhood (EU) and the community was amazing. Almost everyone was friendly, pleny of cool events, great RP and even a lot of guilds dedicated to RP in different ways.
---
In TBC I was in a competitive guild, can't say we fought for World Firsts, but we weren't that much behind the top servers, like any other regular PvP or PvE server.  We had 2-3 other guilds we competed with on both sides, so players were poached etc. Fun drama.
---
The community was the amazing part though, no toxic spasm-spam  like the regular servers will have today, with all the twitch-kids. A bit more mature, but focus on having fun.
---
Healing spec take talents from both tree.
---
Shadow is one of the best caster in pvp and guild will bring one in raids for the shadow debuff.
---
Their gatherings? On RP-PvP.. World PvP events  are the gatherings. And if Stormwind is under attack during one of your in game meetings, you're up for some amazing RP.
---
Nice to hear. I love fishing and cooking. The main profession is the hardest one for me to decide. :D I'm going to play druid and heal dungeons. Skinning + LW could be worth it so I can keep up with the feral gear with that.
---
Dude, these are so good. Warlock is my class and I saw your plagueheart one and it’s super good.
---
Shadow is very viable as a dps.
---
It generally fluctuates between 50-80, but they have dynamic spawns so all of the people testing leveling runs for classic has ballooned the server pops to 14k+ and drops the respawn time down to 2.5 minutes without increasing the farmers which has dropped the price significantly.
---
The RP-PvP servers before BfA were: 
---
Maelstrom, Venture-Co; Lightninghoof, Ravenholdt; Twisting Nether and Emerald Dream.
---
The RP servers before BfA were: 
---
Argent Dawn, Blackwater Raiders; Cenarion Circle, Earthen Ring; Farstriders, Feathermoon; Kirin Tor, Moon Guard; Scarlet Crusade, Sentinels; Shadow Council, Silver Hand; Sisters of Elune, Steamwheedle Cartel; The Scryers, Thorium Brotherhood and Wyrmrest Accord.
---
Every single one of the RP-PvP servers except for Emerald Dream were and still are extremely low population.
---
Was on Khadgar, Ally seemed like they had more people 04-06
---
just remember whatever the race female is BiS
---
I have no idea what that means as I started playing wow by the end of MoP. No clue what you mean by trees nor shadow debuff. Also, is it easy to swap specs every now and then?
---
Whats the drop rate on those? They synergies great with troll racials.
---
Well that’s just an objectively false statement.
---
But their called boomers because there was a boom in childbirth as a result of all the sex deprived veterans coming home from war. Why not just use the term millenials?
---
Should be said tho that utility and even gear spreading is a thing and it's the reason why guilds don't just bring 28 fury warriors as their roster even though that would be the optimal dps if they were all geared.
---
That's true, but you need a lot less than 40 slots for utility and gear spreading, and there's going to be a lot of slots that are decided, at least in part, by damage.
---
Yeah, there won't be reinforcements; those came in BC. But they came in BC because the new AV desperately needed a way to end if people turtled, because things like the NPCs and summoned bosses no longer had the power to break lines like they once did.
---
Former Keeper of Stromgarde here.
---
I forgot about mind control :) But at 60 i would have to keep switching build between raid healing and shadow, on a warlock i can play sm/ruin for both pve/pvp.
---
I leveled several character to 40-44 before I finally leveled my 60 paladin. 
---
One of my first memories is farming earth elementals on my 40 undead warrior to be able to afford the mount. 
---
I abandoned him directly after getting the mount and rolled a NE warrior instead.
---
Thats funny :) the rogue was and awesome vanilla class, i just want to try something new this time so either healing or rdps :)
---
What I hope is that the fact that Blizz added them late last time (of course resulting in lower pop because people don't want to reroll) hasn't created a false perception that these realms are doomed to be low pop.
---
The big 22k survey says they're 3x for desired than RP-PvE for Classic. I believe I saw a similar result on a smaller survey some time ago but unfortunately can't find that one.
---
Fishing requires a bit of patience to level, a lot of people don’t have it when there are so many other things to do. Lots of alchemy ingredients come from fishing, certain fish oils for example.
---
Also some of the best cooking recipes require fish and as has already been said a lot of people prefer to just buy the food from the AH. It’s a great low key way to make money and get important buffs at the same time
---
Big yes
---
You raid as healer and respec shadow for grind/pvp days..50 g at level 60 is really not that much
---
Wow isn't an esport
---
Rofl, did you ever play 1.12 on a decent server? SL locks faceroll warriors and rogues need to play perfect with reflector in order to win a 1v1.
---
I use a 32" 1440 and wouldn't go any larger.
---
As others have said at lvl5 a character can learn disenchanting. It doesn't matter if your DE'ing a lvl 5 green or a 60 epic-it can be done by that character.
---
Yeah this basically. I do 2 nights a week on pserver now progging naxx and were halfway through after 2 lockouts.
---
You can look at lights hope class stats and prove yourself wrong right now. Kronos also has similar class distribution but the stats page has been down for some weeks. I also remember a 3rd server with class/race demographics that showed similar.
---
Pretty much every server has warriors most pop, slightly behind warrior is rogue mage with all 3 of those being a cut above the rest of the classes in pop.
---
Honestly , this would be amazing to see

Night Elf hunters are what you choose when you don't know any better, like how Dwarf Hunters are better in every single solitary way.
---
On the order of 9% less damage done, therefore less threat for every dps.  Increased parry will increase bosses parry haste making tanks take ~5% more damage, but even larger they will take more spiky damage.  Human warrior for tanking even more important.  DPS melee need to take more care to be behind boss.
---
Tbh I think it’s gone on way longer than it should have already
---
That’s very true! Everyone always buys the stuff but not a lot of people make the stuff, so I could see it being very consistent money wise
---
I only put 1 bleed and nothing else. 1 debuff slot that is totally worth it when calculated (if the powershifter knows what he is doing).
---
On every major private server, devilsaur respawn times have ranged from 10-15 mins.
---
Pservers are wrong regarding all values, whichever ones are correct are pure coincidence. Tanks generate less rage through attacks and take more damage, whatever that means from a hps perspective remains to be tested.

Rp-PvP were in vanilla. I rerolled a Shaman with my college guild when Maelstron was released.
---
Ya stuns are your main headache however, that’s why I’ll be rolling an Orc. 30% stun resistant SL Warlock lmao broken af 1v1.
---
Ok but explaining how often you raid there is still relevant to this topic.
---
I've seen someone do 15 jumps a row, pretty sure it was posted on the wow subreddit
---
Yeah they were harder than retail vanilla. 
---
Bugged skeram and bugged firemaw are harder than anything in retail.
---
Idk, I'm doing some 1-30 runs presently to test out my routes and the only zone that is particularly bad is Redridge. Maybe your threshold for what is acceptable amount of ganking is lower than mine.
---
It's 50 gold each time so 100g to change back. People will tell you that you can make that in an hour. I remember it taking all weekend. Also you would need 2 set of gear and gear is harder to get. Don't expect beeing able to change spec if your are casual.
---
You have a spell as a shadow priest:
---
"Shadow Weaving
---
Your Shadow damage spells have a 60% chance to cause your target to be vulnerable to Shadow damage. This vulnerability increases the Shadow damage dealt to your target by 3% and lasts 15sec."
---
It's good because it gives warlock a big dmg boost. That's why you want to bring a shadow priest in raids.
---
The talents in classic are chooses individualy:
---
 https://classicdb.ch/?talent#b
---
You will take a few in both disc and holy to get some key abilities.
---
Hunters are the fastest levelers though. Aspect of the cheetah before lvl40 + pets that can tank anything. Hunters aren't amazing at endgame dps but if you know how to play your class you will still get in raids for being useful.
---
Also, not all the raids are going to be released initially. You can afford to hit 60 a few weeks after the first wave and still not miss too much imo
---
Short answer: yes
---
do the rogues you fight not have kick/gouge on their action bar? you arent getting a fear cast off with a rogue in your face bubble or no bubble
---
On my server we never used engi stuff in duels we thought it was downright cheating, sure its useful in pvp but its not make or break imo
---
Night elf hunter who thought using a ranged weapon was a choice. Raptor strike two-handed axe spec all the way.
---
It will vary server to server. I'm sure Asmon's server will be heavily Alliance favored and will probably skew the odds of wPvP in their favor.
---
If you're referring to BG's, Alliance tended to have an advantage in general but in particular AV.
---
You can see Rag from Golemagg?
---
I always wished it was more populated. It's just not in a good spot for high level players. Love the city.
---
You get to use mind control to tank in naxx
---
I'd want a one time copy per character, limit to 10 per server so people don't delete and make new character to xfer over or maybe limit it to only lvl 60 toons. I'd like to keep my Classic server character intact with the option to go back to that character, while having them copied over to BC so I don't have to start fresh for that server type.
---
With pre-raid BiS feral druids out-dps other melee, by quite a margin in some cases. That is quickly pulled back with MC weapons and gear (just a single weapon makes rogues pull ahead, and BWL is just painful) until T2.5 when they get a little more love, and start approaching the PvP specs once again; T3+ they go back to just out performing ret palas once again. 
---
A lot of the feral druid hate came pre-1.2, when they really did suck, but the 1.12 world is a lot different, and the players who stuck with them had to know how to perform, the method of maximising dps is well known (and will kill your joints).
---
Then why bother if it's the same thing?
---
Yikes, I’ll stick to the in game OST like the proper OGs do
---
You kind of need engineering as a hunter to craft ammo. Aside from that there are a lot of trinkets that are very useful in PVP, but some also in PVE. You can pull off tricks like feign death + jumper cables to revive a healer saving from a wipe. Engineering is just super useful for hunters at 60.
---
But there is also the factor that not many people will keep LW + skinning, so certain items that are in demand can make you a lot of money.
---
That's pretty common for dueling to not use consumables, but I was referring mostly to wPvP and BG's. Its definitely make or break in wPvP.
---
That's exactly what I meant, yeah
---
This makes sense, I was only playing PVE servers and alliance seemed invincible especially in AV.
---
It's the BiS PvP profession. If you like to min-max, engineeing is the way to go.
---
You will get value out of LW/Skinning, don't worry. You can always level with them and swap out skinning at 60
---
so you are telling me that bosses will die even fastern on classic?
---
Deleted my first character ever(tauren shaman) because I ended up taking a Zeppelin to UC, got lost in the city and couldn't make my way out.
---
 Decided to delete the character because it sounded easier to level up to 9 again instead of trying to exit the damn city
---
Good times.
---
Well from what I have heard from people on private servers warriors dont do particularly well with solo grinding
---
We didn’t even use threat meters until Naxx because it felt like it trivialized fights.
---
Some weeks ago there was a poll and there was a crazy amount of paladins and shamans. (Lower number than most other classes but you need to also consider that all other classes need to have their numbers split between alliance and horde).
---
I checked it out and its actually a proc from 6 piece set that makes you get holy power which increases the chance to crit with heals by 5%. combine that with the talent and the massive amount of crit from Naxxaramas gear. you got yourself a heal bot. works better on dedicated healing targets.
---
I might just have to main a undead priest :)
---
I sort of went the other direction.
---
Stated out wanting to play a rogue and just bum around doing whatever, then switched to mage for the control and AoE grinding potential, then shaman so I'd be able to find groups easier if I wanted to, and right now I'm thinking warrior because having to run PuGs with terrible tanks makes me want to end my life more so than any other role.
---
Every expansion I've tried something new and I always end up tanking on my warrior, so I figured just to go with the warrior :)
---
Only googles are still using the term "incel".
---
Thanks. Which version of WoW is it?
---
What about vanilla?
---
Honestly, I'm very hype for classic wow but I couldn't care less about the beta.
---
&gt; No one would kick a hunter who's been in the guild in preference of a random warrior, so why does it matter if hunters scale bad if they are still in the raids and still good in pvp?
---
Maybe not, but many guilds will only recruit like 2 hunters because it's required and then get 10+ dps warriors. You're not competing for the raid slot once you're established in the guild, you're competing for the guild slot when they're looking for DPS and want to fill it with the option that does the most DPS.
---
A good resto should be able to outheal most players.
---
Nothing in particular. Just want to see what the top of the macro game looks like in retail so I know what I'm working with in Classic.
---
Aye, but classic servers will be high popularion realms. However, they did not yet report the exact player cap on a realm. So it will be hard to predict how this is exactly gonna work out for dungeon finding.
---
I was a tauren warrior with the paladin Lightforge Spaudlers from UBRS. I was embarrassed that I had pally armor so I took them of in Orgrimmar. Then some dude came up and started asking why I had no shoulders on and bullied me into putting them on.
---
That amazing moment looking around at the bodies, you say to yourself, “phew I barely made it thank God that’s all of them”. You plop down to eat, soon as your character takes out his bread... you hear MRAWGRGIRGLEMRAWGIRLLL every damn time man.
---
Warlocks are very good at leveling. Very little downtime, they can handle extra unexpected mobs aggroing, they're very fast levelers. 
---
The only thing that holds them back is a lack of mobility in both leveling and wPvP. Warlocks are amazing duelists, Soul Link is very powerful PvP spec. However, they don't have a way to chase someone down who is disengaging. 
---
I suppose you could county someone fleeing as a win, but I personally don't. In a cage match, Warlocks are beasts tho.
---
Say I have all the classes I need for utility and buffs/debuffs, I have my tanks and healers. So now the rest of my raid I just need the top dps I can get. If I have 1 slot and a Druid, priest, and mage whisper me for it I know what I’m going to be picking.
---
You see the trick is to make friends with a healer and/or tank and level together or whenever you are online.
---
Add them to your friends list and then send a message whenever you're online and ask if they wanna do a dungeon.
---
I think the whole 'making friends with people outside your guild' thing hasn't been a thing for a few expansions
---
The other 5% cases are the fights where are you get rly unlucky or your opponent trys insane hard.
---
\- Shadowresi gear
---
\- Shadowabsorb pot
---
\- Unlucky resist in a "harder" matchup deathcoil for example.
---
\- UD Mage with Gear and 2 Blocks that gets a few lucky crits
---
Its classic there are allways random factors or more consoums that can go "wrong" and even the most op class can be beat.
---
"So you've made your decision then?"
---
Yea but then you're stuck looking at a troll for a character
---
Yeah it would definitely be make or break in the best premade min max groups for bgs
---
They literally were all dead servers except for emerald dream
---
A race's emotes are clearly the way to gauge which one should be played
---
While the higher pop is true, the class distribution will likely remain the same, so the ability to find groups will likely be roughly the same as well (assuming the sample pool for this example are all looking for a group as well).
---
AGM is good at max level?
---
It wasn't until one of the recent patches on beta. Now its heavily decayed (from 150 down to 15 rep as an example)
---
SM/Ruin warlock.
---
Holy/prot paladin.
---
Swiftmend / feral charge FC druid.
---
In frost we trust the classic guide to aoe leveling

---
He also have an alliance one pretty simular to this one.
---
Somebody kill this thread before a Blizzard/Activison employee sees this....
---
It's not like you get exclusive rights over the healer/tank. And they can make other friends as well. And it's not like you're both on at the same times always. As a healer/tank they definitely have privileged treatment in getting a group, meaning they can get a group with or without you whenever, so it's not really that reliable either way.
---
I reckon stoneform from dwarfs is even better.
---
Exactly! I want to kill 10.000 mobs in one session and be done!
---
Jea there is a good chance that on a pve server the Ranking pool could be to small for a rank 14 to exist in p2.
---
Here is a very good video from a multi r14 that explains the system:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I\_5Gwx2NjM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I_5Gwx2NjM)
---
Yea
---
I still have the original tears of neltharion trinket from my Vanilla BWL days.
---
Do you think that'll help me get a beta key?
---
i died.. lol
---
A lot of people claim they can solo level 60 in under 3 days /played so I have no doubt hyper optimized groups of experienced players could do all that working together provided they can play like 18 hours and use the other 6 for sleep in the first 7 days
---
Staysafe made a video on how to do the example you suggest.
---
But from what people say in the comments, it won't be possible to do by 40. Still, if you want the mount eventually, you should gain rep as you level, like you say, minimising the rep grind later
---
Mage. More self reliant, flexible, strong. Portals, Food help you get socialized...
---
Good chance that the ranking pool could be to small for a r14 to exist.
---
But besides that, Ranking is depented on your server so np.
---
Here is a video that explains the system very well from someone that did r14 more then 1 time:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I\_5Gwx2NjM&amp;t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I_5Gwx2NjM&amp;t=1s)
---
Seconded!
---
Yeah, but the minmax...
---
In my case:
---
* Prot Warrior
---
* Holy Priest
---
* Mage
---
* Well, I am a Retri Paladin now! I am retarded but in shinny armor and I protect the innocent!
---
Honestly a lot of guides involve running around the world from zone to zone then comming back to the zone only to repeat the cycle over and over again.
---
I am personally more inclined towards grinding/dungeon grinding which not only gives good exp but some sweet loot/gph aswell
---
Try pservers and try 1-20 and see what you best like. Doing the same thing atm
---
My top choices are Gnome Warlock, Dwarf Priest, and some kind of Hunter and then I'd maybe be thinking Rogue.
---
More reliable than making 0 friends is my point.
---
Classic is easier if you make friends and quest together. Modern expansions can be played just as easily solo since you don't even need to group to get a tag.
---
A tank/healer is going to get through the quests at a slower pace than a proper dps class. 
---
Making new friends for me is going to be just as important as trying to gear up my char. Makes the game less of a chore and more fun.
---
WOW THANKS FOR THE 10 GIFTED SUBS FANBOY234, THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU I REALLY APPRECIATE IT
---
More disingenuous than a politician. It's like they're jaded to the value of money despite many of them not having it for most of their lives. They forget just how fucking lucky they are to get paid 6-7 figures for literally existing in front of a camera at their desk. I guess that's what happens when you win the lottery several times a day every day.
---
fuck dude this is my exact thought progression but in horde.
---
yes its still a lot of hp, and imagen you absorb a deathcoil with it, since its absorb the WL dos not get healed so you did absorb a lets say 900 Deathcoil and prevented 900 healing for the warlock.
---
If you are a melee vs a SL warlock it can be usefull, for example a Hunter used it in combination with Shadowreflector to beat me, since SL warlock wants to use void against melee classes.
---
As long there is no despell its very strong.
---
Better than looking at a gnome.
---
Whatever dude. In 3 months you'll realize that you were wrong

Played a human rogue in vanilla. My noggenfogger bill was insane

It involves a lenghtly dungeon run among other things. Imo youre better off just grinding to gather the required gold and then completing the mount quest later on.
---
West coast checking in at 78 days 8 min, maybe it's time zone dependent?

Excuse me but spamming /lol and /train on a gnome are the pinnacle of wow
---
I could be wrong, but just from my memory the reason I and others called it VC on my server was because people got a quest to kill Van Cleef, and didn't really know what dead mines was (I literally had no idea what an instance was when I joined the group until my brother told me, he was quite mad when I proceeded to hog the computer for the next 4 hours in there). This was before dire maul even existed.
---
So basically people were just forming groups to finish their quest, so they just said LFG Van Cleef (or VC). Also it had a memorable last boss, as opposed to RFC or WC (I couldn't even name them).
---
Go rogue.
---
Nothing says i am a solo player like a backstabby rogue.
---
my vanilla privateserver file is less than 10 tho
---
What a cancerous meme
---
dwarf hunters with boars were all the rage for gold farmers back in vanilla if i remember correctly it was report on sight lol.
---
Wow just like Overwatch’s closed beta
---
30% of the time anyways :)
---
Warrior as a solo player is the hardest you can pick out of all classes.   
---
I would pick the rogue, its probably one of the most fun class in open world pvp for a solo gamer.
---
If you want an easy leveling experience, stick with the hunter.
---
No it's not. What class is orc objectively better for?
---
I understand your reasoning and at first I was thinking the same,  but I think your last assumption will be very important for this. I dont think this assumption will hold, cus group finding behaviour will change depending on populations. Simple example is that on pserver (with a large player base) so far I didnt have much issues finding tanks and healers as well. So it does seem to be affected by the number of people online although there could be other causes as well ofc.
---
My earliest is killing imps in Shadowglen with my hunter and then again on my Druid. I rerolled at 20 to a Druid and then regretted it for years lol. My stepdad was playing and I saw he had Cat Form on his account so I wanted to switch.
---
You aren't the only one working in prime raid hours. Just find a guild that accomodates your schedule and play your warrior
---
How much percent of these dmg numbers where due to TF proccs?
---
You mean like the 18,000+ survey that showed RP-PVP to be over three times as popular as regular RP regarding server choice? Also, Emerald Dream would like to have a word with you.
---
You forgot serpent sting

I believe you'll need full updated launcher for the current  expansion in order to play classic (honestly got no idea how much gb that is but im fairly sure its more than 15)
---
Okay, here is a parse from the last raid my previous guild did together. All healers in this parse besides Souldirt had been playing together since MC progression. https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Viewer/?id=32183&amp;exp=0&amp;upl=50902
---
I can't speak for other guilds and their healers but in our guild where most of of our healers were BiS or close to, our druid still had top HPS. And keep in mind most of these players have been playing vanilla for years now and know what's up.
---
Well yeah but if i play something less enjoyable ill achieve a 0.54% extra DPS
---
Never preshield a rage class, use shield as a catch up skill.
---
I think they would just take content from other expansions and just rework it to fit Into classic
---
Healers would become ambulances...
---
Because rage starvation is real and warriors were having trouble tanking or just building rage and in turn priests had trouble healing without shielding.
---

As a Diablo veteran, this feels so much more intuitive than playing wow on an old desktop computer.

Yeah. Looking for the convenience. Cant spend that much time on the game any longer, so this gives me the edge that makes me like the game.

Yea and I think you can also trigger it more often by strafing. I mained a night elf and at some point I stopped counting because I could do it almost infinite amounts.

Druids fucking suck in vanilla and are literally only good for a free mount and innervate. Can people here stop pretending like this 15 year old game is going to cure cancer, bring their dad back from the cigarette store and find them their true love without using tinder? Class balance was a spectacular mess in vanilla, and pretty much all "hybrid" classes got the stick and sucked at literally everything, only being used for healers because you can't stick priests and paladins forever.
---
Oh sorry haha what I meant was "no  your class choice is so great, its so great, it does everything great, haha its great, nothing about vanilla is anything other than great, isnt that great, hahaha" fuck off

Pugs were often small guilds of 10 or so wanting to raid without wanting to recruit

---
Worth wearing a few pieces as a Rogue, it was nice to have about 5k hp with a mix of Deathdealers and HWL gear.
---
Are you asking what classes has the worst rank 13 set or are you asking what classes perform well without ?
---
Because thats a total diffrent question, i would say warlock is the class that get the least out of ranking since the pve sets have so good pvp stats and if you run SL you kinda want to have t1 or t2 5p, but warlock rank 13 set is very good and you can use it very good to complete sets.
---
And then there is rogue, where you often can argue not wearing even 1 pice of the set, but for rogue too it can be good to have 2 or 3 pices depented on the state of the game.
---
For BiS sets with Naxx gear alot of classes tend to use only 2 or 3 pices, but for real BiS rank 12 dos not cut is because often you want rank 13 pices.
---
Like the other here said Shammie set is kinda bad and so is the druid set (but every druid gear is bad :/).

It looks like up to this point private servers have been wrong...as in they buffed the content too much, and it still gets steamrolled.  So yeah, classic might be even easier for some of those hardcore guilds.
---
"spell hit chance" a stat found on gear such as bloodvine disagreees with you ;)
---
As someone who played as a rogue a lot in vanilla, there's not really a spec where you're good in both PvP and PvE. For PvP you mostly want to go for big burst damage, while for PvE you're going to focus on white damage. Both require entirely different specs.

Nonononononononononononononononono. Sure, Bokmål is fairly good and straightforward, but Norway has like a million dialects that are hella f\*\*\*ed up and way worse than Danish. I lived in this old mining town for a couple years, and what they spoke wasn't even close to understandable. Despite being Danish I had to have everyone speak to me super slowly, like I was a small child or mentally deficient, for the first 6 months.
---
Everyone in here acting like 90% of noobs didn't keyboard turn and mouse click. This isn't much different.
---
For both pve and pvp? Literally every class they can be. 
---
UD are better warlocks if you choose to purely focus on pve. 
---
Trolls are better hunters if you choose to purely focus on pve. 
---
If you choose to engage in both major aspects of WoW, pve and pvp, the orc is mathematically the superior race option for people looking to minmax and do not care what race their character is. 
---
Any easy google confirms this from multiple guides from various years. This is a 15 year old game it’s been theorycrafted to death. We know what the objectively best race class combo is. 
---

---
Those are two easily findable but they all pretty much say that for heavy pvp, or someone thats spending equal time pvping and pveing orc is king. 30% stun resist is god tier and literal fight changers( 25% resist from racial and the 5% resist all races have by default.
---
Just make sure to call it Lègôlås...
---
Awesome man, I need this for priest.. Anyone?
---
Most of the 40+ zones are neutral, so they are still the zones to go to, but their quests will be different because your encampments will be different. I would still follow a similar route to what he has listed there. The only location I really think I skipped as Alliance was Swamp of Sorrows. I can't remember how many quests you have for that place, but there's no main hub for Alliance there. You have to get quests from the little Draenei Village.
---
You should check out DS/Ruin! Is the best alternative!
---
First class was a human warrior. I got to level 7 and wondered around lost. I was killed by some murlocs and logged out. Then I made a tauren druid. Played him till wrath. 
---
When I knew I was actually getting better at the game was when I switched to resto from feral. A friend whispered be to tank strat and I told him I went resto for raiding. He was very upset. I apparently was his token tank.
---
I'm not the one enforcing a kind of twilight-zone-esque "good feels zone" about some 15 year old nostalgia for a game, with a whole community of people doing it.
---
You people have got some serious fucking issues if you can't be honest about a game this old, just because you have a cult about insisting it's better than the modern form there-of. Christ on a fucking stick I am so done with this place. like /r/the_donald for 30 year old men who never got over a video game from their teenage years. Fuck the lot of you.
---
Fair point about the pservers. I certainly hope it won't be too hard, as I most enjoy Rogue and Warlock, both of which are in higher supply than demand. I do intend to level a paladin eventually though (but only when I can finance some early level twinking, because they're too goddamn slow for me otherwise)
---
I am sure, and I hope, that the market will correct itself if that happens. 20g for a stack of copper bars is insane.
---
Of copper bars are 20g per stack, then the higher ranks will be even more expensive and basically, only the 0.01% of the server can buy shit like that.
---
I am sure the retail scrubs will soon realize the true value of those items, I mean, you cant ask for money the players don't have.
---
To this day, those long AV's are the most fun I have ever had with WoW's PvP.
---
It honestly felt like a real war was going on and nothing has had that feeling since.
---
Agreed-the T0.5 sets should had been released much earlier than the AQ patch. Hopefully it's something they are willing to alter.
---
what's with 39 mage? why 39?
---
I know that Tauren can't ride undead horses and if I remember correctly only gnomes and dwarfes can ride the gnome mount. Otherwise there are no restrictions.
---
1. Vendoring early on is an option.
---
2. There's almost always action on the ah from the first week.
---
3. You don't have to sell things immediately
---
The gear wont be an issue leveling because you'll get a majority of your upgrades from Quest items. Once you hit max level, that's when it will matter. You guys will have a lot of overlap. All casters do. Highly suggest not having the same professions. If one of you goes Tailoring/Enchanting, the other can just feed them the materials they get. The other should pick totally different professions.
---
Orc Rogue &gt; Orc Warlock &gt; Gnome Mage.
---
Currently levelling a mage on a pserver which has confirmed that ill mage play in classic (so far)
---
Wow dude, relax it's just a game people are nostalgic about.
---
Forgot to mention, I'd like to focus mainly on PvE since raiding is very close to heart, but I'll be doing as much PvP as possible once I free up time from the gearing/grinding related to raids!
---
Having engineering is not only PvP thing like most people talk about, it's true secret is how it enables better and faster and more reliable strategies. For instance viscidus when it splits, is normally focused a few blobs at a time, but if the raid has 20-25 engineers you can aoe prett easily all of them directly, and if almost everyone have it, the timing don't even have to be good. Suppression room and bug cave in aq40 also benefit a lot, including the bosses you fight at the ends of them. It's always good in pve to have and brings many utilities such as resistance trinkets and arcanite whelp.
---
Unless the Warriors have used sunder, in which case there is not a slot for expose armor.
---
Wtf why would retail be a better indicator than private servers? Copper bars won't be 20g.
---
It just seems like it's pretty set in stone, that dungeon sets are coming with AQ, according to all the "release stage charts" they have showed off.
---
But one can hope, they should honestly be there from the starts or when dire maul hits, in phase 2, because some dire maul gear is actually better then he dungeon set. The nullification of the dungeon sets already starts there.
---
You're asking for a system that nobody realized was toxic and could not be balanced around.
---
You need to remember that a lot of hard lessons were learned from Vanilla. Lessons that are clearly *problems* of game design that need solving.
---
You're providing a very idealized version of how the gameplay loop would go, but by the end of Vanilla it was clear that type of grinding was unsustainable in the long run.
---
What have you done!
---
And Blessing of Wisdom... i think earliest that we actually used BoW in bossfights was last two bosses on NAXX.
---
Its not about fun gadgets. Its about useful gadgets. Its by no means mandatory but if you want to minmax then engineering is a must on any class, any spec, pvp and pve
---
strangers can't make your mind up for you, same with all the what class should I be ect. How tf  do we know, we don't know the people asking . But... having said that
---
For the Horde!
---
Well that's not true. Most classes yes, but either way one shotting something with a windfury totem and oneshotting something with a bug are inherently different and it's weird I'm having to say that.
---
I really wouldn't expect Blizzard doing something for stuff like that. Classic is Vanilla, they didn't do anything back then, they won't do anything now. It would go against the all concept of keeping the same experience. When things like that happened back then you could: A-call for help (and you usually got it) or B-logout to another character, do other stuff for a bit and then go back. 99% of the time the ganker was gone. If you think of playing Classic with a different mentality I'd say don't play it, or go on a pve server, otherwise it will be a frustrating experience for sure. Personally, I really hope they won't interfere, the awareness of knowing something could go wrong while levelling was part of the excitement and it was one of the thing that made the vanilla pvp experience great.
---
Yeah pretty close. The only think you're missing is improved shadowbolt, hunter T2 8set bonus (only one hunter, at least on our server it can be up multiple times), as well as shadow word pain (gotta get/keep up the shadow weaving somehow).
---
We actually didn't really use thunderclap and demo shout except on some bosses that actually hit hard (Broodlord, Chromaggus, Nefarian). Plus a lot of bosses are tauntable, so that can be 1-2 additional debuffs that push off other things.
---
Usually it is best to not fill it to 16 because just one mistake will push off something, then someone recasts their assigned debuff and starts a cascade of ruined debuffs.
---
Thats not how it works right? Now you’re calculating chance on 6 flips in a row, regardless if there was a flip in front of it or not. By your logic,  you could then also say the chance is 1/5^5 if you start counting after two flips. The first flip should definitely be part of the chance calculation
---
Yes but less.
---
&gt; Every time they expanded vanilla WoW, it was great (BWL, ZG, AQ, Naxxramas).
---
Those are not expansions.
---
So that means if I would like to have all four alliance mounts in the far future, I can't go human to save on the rep grind? :(
---
And then try to loot them all and pull a whole lot more and die anyway 😂
---
It is a joke :p Expose Armor overrides Sunder Armor since it can reduce a lot more armor. And then Warriors can't use Sunder since the debuff isn't applied so no threat is generated. 
---
It's a way to make you wipe on for example Onyxia since the tank can't hold threat.
---
I'm really relying on memory here but I am sure there were some race/mount restrictions. I am sure that mechanostriders (gnome mounts) could only be used by dwarves and gnomes. On the horde side, once again I could be wrong, Tauren were restricted to wolves and kodos. The exception was the rare mounts such as the ZG tiger/raptor, the horse from Baron Riverndare and the PvP mounts(rank 11 and AV rep ones)
---
After phase 2 drops, sure. People were definitely doing that. It will take longer but as a twink you'll be strong and it will probably be more fun as a pvp player.
---
Asuming you are under 49 by the time bgs come out, I'd say go for it.
---
I always used MC as a form off CC when there was a good cliff nearby. If it was steep enough they couldn't walk up it they would get stuck in mid air. Eventually they would completely reset, as in no longer in combat. I'm not sure if this is something that will be fixed tho.
---
I wouldn’t over think it, it’s classic have fun with it! Just pick what you’re most gravitated towards and get to it. I played a Ret pally from vanilla til cata, and got better and better.
---
This might be the single most exciting thing for me with regards to Classic. Finally won't have to watch NA in world chat.
---
Yeah, I quit Defias when WLK came and started to play on Sylvanas. What happened to the server after that I don't know but with how WoW evolved, I can guess RP servers overall kind of took a hit.
---
RP-PvP was great during vanilla and TBC though. And not having one in Classic would completely ruin our hype =/
---
Hey,  
---
So I know this is a subjective question, but the reason I asked for a personal opinion is so that I'd get some insight on the thought process behind their choice. I hope this clarifies the question for you.  
---
Lok'tar ogar friend.
---
Mine is Orc Warrior Prot --&gt; Tauren Warrior Prot --&gt; Human Warrior Prot
---
Humans can ride everything but mechastriders
---
Dwarves can ride everything
---
Gnomes can ride everything
---
Nelfs can ride everything but mechastriders
---
Not quite sure how it is for horde side
---
Haha that's karma for you. I started playing with them as social in wotlk, but ended up raiding as they needed bodies. Had some fun runs but it was definitely not the strongest raiding team. Decided I would leave the guild to raid with some friends, so I went ahead and did VoA solo instead of with luv. Chant went batshit crazy, did the /gkick and then went ahead to spam trade chat that I was a traitor and should not be trusted lol. I was Versaith the rogue.
---
It can be worth it for a pvp player since being undergeared at 60 is a pain in bgs, and not everyone wants to do PvE. 
---
As a 49 twink you are grinding while being one of the strongest chars in the bgs you play as opposed to being one of the weakest at 60.
---
I just want something that can hold its place in wpvp.
---
Play alliance like the rest of civilised world.
---
Unleas you're 14 y/o cringelord,then you should roll undead
---
Some people enjoy playing somewhat efficient? I might hate dailies but i enjoy the progression of my characters so not doing them would be even less enjoyable? This really isnt a good argument at all. Dont like lfr? Dont do it. Dont like flying mounts? Dont use them, dont like transmog? Dont do it. Dont like that there are teleports everywhere? Dont use them. Dobt like that every new raids makes the previous one irrelevant? Do them regardless.
---
You can grind the PvP mounts. Iirc those don't have restrictions
---
Yes
---
You're a mage. Level to 20, get your Teleport trained, and teleport /hearth when you need to train. It's almost cheating its so easy.
---
There are so many time-consuming variables with enchanting. 
---
You have to deal with:
---
* Vendor Price
---
* AH Price
---
* Material Price (disenchanting)
---
Calculating that takes time, which is why most people skip enchanting.
---
Plan is to level a warlock and paladin/shaman to 60 and then once those are max level and stable economically, eventually level a warrior.
---
Still can't pick alliance vs horde ugh!
---
https://discordapp.com/invite/2r25M8Z
---
Typically you'll still get it but can afford to do it a few levels later so you have a bit more leeway with gold spending early on. Even if you don't get it, it will only slow you a little bit.
---
Thank you
---
You can bet that within a couple weeks my level 60 orc will be punching lowbies to death in redridge (naked ofc)
---
Dont like lfr? Dont do it. Dont like flying mounts? Dont use them, dont like transmog? Dont do it. Dont like that there are teleports everywhere? Dont use them. Dobt like that every new raids makes the previous one irrelevant? Do them regardless.
---
I guess bfa is a great game. Just dont do whatever isnt fun right?
---
There is no delusion and forced wholesome on this sub, you're just completely unable to see how something not being S tier doesn't automatically put it into F tier.
---
Literally everything that was mentioned about druids are true, while calling them a great tank might be a stretch, but that's it. They still have tanking niches though.
---
No one on this sub is doing what you are saying, pretending every class is equal and the game is perfectly balanced. You just saw the words "druid" and "great" used in the same sentence, but you're illiterate and can't differentiate between "great" and "best class ever, does everything better than everyone else".
---
My choice is whatever characters I want to to look at for many months :)
---
And despite that, it's easy to see that a lot of those theory crafts are literally completely incorrect. They aren't using the proper information or are basing their results on Private Server data. All this time and knowledge and people are still guessing.
---
It's not just pservers - people have posted Who info from beta and consistently priest is one of the top 2-3 classes by number of players.
---
Still, I wouldn't worry anyway.
---
Just vendor everything you need mount at 40, i only ever save lvl 48+ greens since those mats will be useful at 60 for my gear
---
On Alliance side, Humans and Night Elves can't ride Mechanostriders.
---
On Horde side, Tauren can't ride Skeletal Horses or Raptors.
---
For all racial mounts except your own, you need Exalted with that race's faction to get the appropriate training.
---
Rare mounts (such as Rivendare's Charger or the ZG Raptor) are exempt from racial restrictions.
---
Do you know how much less? I am planning to be rather completionist during my leveling process and that means inevitably doing grey quests some of the time.
---
You don't need sw:p.
---
Daisy's voice isn't as deeply embedded in my unconscious as Harrison's so I just read the first part as you would read anything. The second part though I actually heard in his voice inside my head. :) 
---
"Now lets launch this thing so we can all play!" - Just a little license taken with the quote :D
---
Also plan to sit around for hours if you plan to reserve anything. "Reserving" Is just childish shit. Get a group of 5 guildies or friends or shut up. "Reserving" is just another way of saying "I get all the good stuff that you guys worked for."
---
It was great during Cata an MoP aswell! However the Draenor time traveling and Legion artifact weapons took a silly turn
---
I still remember some very quality Dragonmaw and Pandaren rp
---
Rofl what a sad little man you must be
---
Gotta love how all answers are about balance viability, completely missing the point.
---
Herb/alch to make potions, recommended if it's your first character.
---
Engineering if you have other ways of farming or alts. It helps quite a bit when it comes to dps.
---
Gl!
---
If that's the case, I dont mind picking it up at lvl 48. That's still useful.
---
this, hunters end up being alive, because of feign. It's so useful to save time in groups
---
I too plan on picking up enchanting only to d/e all of the soulbound stuff/stuff that's not worth auctioning.
---
I am still not decided on whether i should ah mats later on or just powerlevel enchanting but either option will make you some money in the long run
---
Mindflay soulburn and taunt eat debuff slots as well.
---
Yep go lock or something better
---
Extremely useful for me, thank you for this comment! This will definitely help me making up my mind, and so far I've been leaning towards Alliance anyway, so it's good to hear that the classes would fit.
---
Until you get Deathcoil, you're fodder for Rogues because you can't get any breathing room. Warlocks are really fun and efficient levellers. IMO PServers have had Voidwalker aggro way too strong so I still think Affliction is best for levelling. It's also the most interactive spec to play since you're constantly trying to balance your health and mana.
---
Multiple people posted numbers from testing on the beta here, but I cant find them now. It was around 20-30% less but if you search a bit more you can probably find the actual numbers.
---
This and a few other important, legitimate reasons are why the majority of people are complaining but as per usual the OP posts a strawman and everyone claps like trained seals.
---
The best middleman in this story should be for streamers to be able to delay their broadcast by a certain amount of time. 
---
Not sure if their software has this feature. 
---
Then again it beckons the question as to why suppliers of streaming software haven’t looked into this as a means to counter stream sniping.
---
There is a reason why every multiplayer games has lootboxes /s
---
Yeah there is a reason, bjt that reason certainly is not to male the game better. Its taking advantage of addictive behaviour, and to create artificial content. Its only good for the devs, not the players.
---
Holy Reckoning looks good atm.
---
You can easly raid with that specc, you can just stack Reckoning and Oneshot ppl in wpvp if they dont have that mutch gear.
---
Ive done alot of duels with that specc and managed to win against every class, and in open pvp you can do alot more shit, a precharged reckoning can be insane against cloth classes and kiting and LoS can be your friend too.
---
Getting a nice 2h will be abit hard but if you have it you will have fun.
---
Frostadomus verified that fishing pools are spawning.
---
Thank you for the comment! I'll definitely pick the faction that I find more interesting.   
---
On another note, how did you find Retribution in Vanilla? This would've been my first choice, but seeing as they have a really hard time competing against warriors when it comes to drops in raids, I just thought that I'd get off easier not picking one. Also, I've no idea how they perform in raids in general, so I'd like to ask specifically how you did on the damage meters?
---
2 words
---
Auctioneer
---
Enchantrix
---
Define worth? If you value leveling fast then no its not worth. If you value mot having to go back to farm mats to level them up when youre 60 then yes its worth
---
What is wrong with you? Did someone hurt you?
---
Retadin or Protadin, I start a mob, go write some code, loot, repeat.
---
Somebody is mad their mum didn’t touch their goodies tonight.
---
Reflectors and bombs are so powerful it's criminal.
---
Depends on the class really. I mean you dhould because you're gonna want it anyway at 60. But as a druid you dont need first aid while leveling
---
The dungeon 2 sets added extra encounters and loot to dungeons. Effectively adding more difficult content to dungeons for higher rewards. I think that value is still there - like, some folks won't raid, so this content tailored to them.
---
And if they did add the loot before the AQ phase, what do you do about Valthalak, Jarien and the other bosses you summon along the way? Some of the loot is legit. (e.g. https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=16042/lord-valthalak for example)
---
As fury, engineering isn't that urgent, I agree. But if the OP wants to tank, too, engineering comes in really handy. I will roll warrior and do this: start with mining and enchanting. With 60, I'll farm the ore to level engineering and drop mining. This way I have engineering for my utility and enchanting as a gold maker. As a tank I will get a lot of gear and a lot of shards.
---
I legit saw a "Dirge" the other day
---
Do you like civilization, showers, societal progress, etc.? Pick alliance.
---
Are you a savage who likes living in a dirt hut? Horde's for you.
---
Source?
---
Maybe we should build a wall around the server so the streamers can’t in other servers. Stupid
---
I just started reading those books a few weeks ago and instantly got it!
---
well crafting isnt really needed unless you are maybe a caster
---
I mean I think crafting is mostly a waste of time. The only good stuff are Engi if you want to tryhard in pvp, Alch if you very lucky to get flask recipes, Maxed ench if you very lucky and a special snowflake in the guild to get those epic formulas. Besides that you might as well make money in other ways which will still yield nice monies.
---
I think its valuable if u plan to do lots of dungeons
---
like you could get herb+ench and do stealth pickpocket runs in RFD and disenchant boss loot and get some grave moss along the way. Eventually the same in Mara when u get good items with ghost mushroom  herb it was there.
---
Yeah, you ain't winning against a good rogue
---
That sounds a lot like what a progressive private server would do-just to confirm, are you saying they'd keep level 60 and just make TBC content level 60 comparable but maybe with slightly higher item levels...or did you have another idea? 
---
My instant vibe is "it's terrible and everyone would instantly shun blizzard" but I might not be understanding you completely.
---
I'm glad to see that Blizzard was right in thinking that Diablo players are into playing on their phones.
---
Flying pigtails?
---
That makes somewhat sense but i clearly remember beeing in DM before i got the quest for VC. Perhaps because i just was adventeuring or i did something else there. I also think the fluff quest text describes the mines
---
So your first link explains nothing and just parrots the same crap everyone else says with no justification.
---
The second one lists trolls as the best for most classes for pve with rogue as the only one it doesn't rate. 
---
Unless you are 100% hardcore PvP only pve will be the majority of your gameplay so the race that is better at PvP should be your choice.
---
it has some cool stuff but the cooldowns seem too long
---
and it is kind of a hassle to aim those grenades
---
Make a lvl 5 bank alt and learn enchanting, you can disenchant any item at that level and you don't have to waste a profession slot on your main just for the DE
---
pepeLaugh
---
MOAR DAWTS
---
tfw they fail
---
Actually he is either tired or high af :D
---
skinning and disenchanting
---
The rewards were too good to pass up, everybody and their dog knew that daily quests were the quickest way to get your character ready to raid *if you only had two hours of playtime per day, which is what the thread is about*
---
do you have proof of the 45 silver vendor price in official patch 1.12.1? if so, please report it to the bug sheet.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I97ulkYYSTE
---
Yeh, pretty hard to disenchant soulbound items from my alt and I have an empty profession slot anyway.
---
Because it wont be just people from private servers switching over. Theres going to be a bunch of people switching over from retail, including all the kiddos who want to play with their favorite streamers.
---
Hopefully when they are tired of dying on classic because they cant pull an entire dungeon and their spells aren't as flashy, they'll hop back over to retail and the market will correct itself.
---
Horde racial are pretty cool. Orcs get stun resist and temp attack power boost. Trolls get attack speed boost. Both of those also have extra weapon skills for favored weapons (more hit). Lauren get 5% more hp and a short aoe stun. Undead get a limited CC break and an extra dot (i think this is priest only.) Also undead has the ability to eat your victims for extra insult and a good heal.
---
Can't say I really know anything about alliance save for dwarf priests get fear ward. And also no eating corpses.
---
This makes 0 sense to me.  Streamers stream their screen to hundreds of thousands at once.  Why does any PC struggle to mirror it's screen to one device?
---
herbo/alchi u will need thoses mana pot :p
---
I really hope blizzard doesn't go all carebear with regards to PvP servers, if they do that's a change in mentality from how they operated in Vanilla and a huge change to the game itself.
---
I'm really looking forward to fearing that one orc rogue who lives in menethil 8 hours a day, or having to organize a raid to clear out redridge of horde because they've locked us out of the HUB for the last x number of hours, etc.
---
If they get all "Oh you killed this guy 3 times, you're now a griefer, here's your punishment" they're seriously moving away from what vanilla was for those of us that endured and loved high pop PvP realms.
---
Hell we were allowed to lock the other faction out of finishing their legendary quest lines if we had the manpower and the time to dedicate to it, which some did for as long as was possible.
---
Please don't give them ideas!
---
I believe you can. But that’s not related to Stadia.
---
Just wait a week or two and then world chat will be full of people complaining about lack of tanks while themselves are all either warlocks or hunters.
---
Try them all, decide when you know what you enjoy the most.
---
77 days 13 hours here in the future (Auckland, NZ). It's a 10am release on a Tuesday morning me and a few mates have Tues-Fri off work!
---
Assuming you're healing at 60, Lock would definitely be better for wpvp at that point
---
We’re MC Raiders!
---
WoW was for some time on Nvidia streaming service but it was pulled down by Blizzard as such service could hide some cheat apps usage from their system. There were also problems with addind addons to such WoW.
---
so you're saying that stoneform is not a big deal? what consumables actually could work like this racials?
---
Heroic strike must be fatter
---
it was in the game exactly one day before getting hotfixed.
---
I think having these over the top numbers are more fun than playing 100% by the books when it does not even matter.
---
Hunter is great solo, mained one vanilla-wotlk and regret nothing. Pretty solid in pvp if you can play them right as well. 
---
Rogue would be harder to level, but being able to stealth past stuff (especially enemy players) is nice, and good in pvp.
---
Warrior is a bad class for solo players imo, one of the hardest classes to lvl and not great in pvp either.
---
I think it was added in 2.3, that's the first patch i remember reading the notes for.
---
The flip in front is guaranteed because it's the initial condition for calculations.
---
Genious idea! I'll pay money for this
---
I believe you can but that’s not what Stadia is.
---
undead warrior vs undead priest vs undead rogue... I want to be a best 1v1, push rank 14 and have high skillcap.... gg me
---
Table came in wrath i think
---
Hey man I explained it as politely as I can. If there’s any youtube content creators you personally enjoy watching, who also have made class and race guides go watch them. Madseason and frostadomious come to mind. 
---
If you plan on hardcore pvp’ing you’re going to be clearing raid lockouts just as often as pvers if you want to stay competitive due to both aspects of the game being so closely interwoven in classic. 
---
At the end of the day I’ve seen enough videos and write ups people far smarter than you and me who have played some form of classic for much longer and at higher skill levels than either of us and they all agree; if youre going horde, your class can be an orc, and you care about minmaxing your best choice is orc. 
---
The content is out there. Find it and educate yourself or remain ignorant but I’m done here. This whole topic was OP asking between orc or undead. No idea why you would even bother to bring up a non option anyways.
---
*begins to call the spanish inquisition*
---
Quick downvote, so they don't see this!!!
---
I played at the very Beginning of Classic, where we only had RP-PVE Servers. I also love RP and World PvP, and i would love to experience a RP-PVP Realm :)
---
I dont even make friends with people inside the guild...
---
Show me on this doll where /r/classicwow touched you.

Retribution!

Hi, /u/justsomespecial

You need way more than such disenchanting will give while you loose money early on needed for mount and other leveling needs. People picking enchanting do it much later when they are prepared. It often involves having lots of cloth for tailoring greens or even leather to push it through a leatherworker. At 60 you can take the level advantage and farm mid/low level cloth/leather much quicker too plus you have the funds to fill in the missing gaps. 
---
Also Enchanting on it own is worthless. If won't have the recipes it won't give you any benefits. DE can be done by a level 5 bank alt no matter what level the BoE item is. You will have to farm various reps, farm world drops from specific mobs and then on top of that start getting raid enchants.
---
I'm thinking about getting enchanting on my mage at some point, not finalized yet and to get extra resources I even plan using temporary engineering to turn stashed mining resources into guns and other greens that can be DE - [https://i.redd.it/z3295lh1e0331.png](https://i.redd.it/z3295lh1e0331.png) plus as a mage it's quite convenient to farm cloth or mobs for rep.
---
Sorry for trying to help I guess.
---
If you want the fastest and safest way to profit while leveling pick skinning and vendor all the leather, vendor all your soulbound gear.
---
It will be faster than Enchanting in the end and you won't need to switch characters and manage auctions.
---
PS:
---
If you want to level enchanting later anyway, save all your cloth during leveling and level tailoring and enchanting at the same time at 48.
---
The 0.5 sets are ridiculously harder and expensive to acquire to the point where it’s debatable if they’re even worth it at all.
---
I always fantasise about a flip jumping tournament, with gold fee and prize.
---
Gbank?
---
Alchemy is not only flask recipes. You can make a wide set of consumables that will constantly sell. Flasks are a luxury item - it's potential for high profit, but not something reliable.
---
I compared a couple of numbers, the classic hit harder
---
Torn between dwarf priest for the racials.. NE priest for the MC/shadowmeld and looks... and human to be  basic.
---
But I want to go spriest so like... undead is the only way right?
---
Tier 0.5, extra bosses, extra item drops  are all catch up tools.  
---
They were implemented to allow non raiders to catch up a little with the raiders in order to maybe get into raiding.  
---
Much like the badge gear.  
---
But tier 0.5 would be absolutely overpowered to have when you start doing MC.
---
I'm guessing to stay within the 30-39 PvP bracket
---
Soulbound items will be a minor amount versus what is needed for this profession.
---
Nightfall is such low uptime on enhance because of 0 instants and enh does so little damage it's 100% better to just get another pure dps class.
---
Tauren Shaman -&gt; Tauren Druid -&gt; Tauren Hunter.
---
I guess cows are cool.
---
That is fucking horrific.
---
You're a brave soul.
---
you sir, are full of shit.
---
It wont be, 1.12 AV wasn't like that sadly
---
classic fury warriors aren't going to get Tfury probably
---
Nothing is needed for this profession. You can disenchant without leveling it..
---
My friend and I have just been playing Rocket League &amp; Divinity: Original Sin 2 to save our mmo-virginity til Classic comes out.
---
Definitely interested in a source on this - Super curious which exploits will be patched
---
Right, got it! Thanks for the explanation:)
---
Again, the biggest concern is latency. If you've watched stream for a while you would know it isn't constantly up to date. There's a latency.
---
Also, the frames are sometimes skipped and the resolution falls out as well.
---
This would all come down to a bad experience if you tried to cast it onto your TV. That being said, it's a totally different thing with streaming i.e. latency doesn't matter that much as long as you get a nice resolution.
---
There is software out there which can make for a good result if you wish to cast your gameplay onto one of your devices, but the main concern would still be latency, as the other guy said.
---
&gt; That’s for the controller.
---
Pretty sure it was the Founders Edition, and the Controller was like 70.
---
The dungeon sets weren't available early vanilla and even if they were available at launch of Classic not everyone would be interested as most of it isn't BiS. The upgrade quests would be more valuable for the extra loot it can give and not nececarily for the T0.5 items themselves too.
---
Drops 5g a month, so yea people will definitely be at cal even if they only respec a handful of times a year.
---
Wait, you mean you don't understand the point of streaming games. What about youtube, twitch, netflix or spotify, do you understand the point of them existing and why they've become the main way to consume their corresponding art form/media?
---
For cloud gaming, that means everyone will be able to play without investing in a gaming pc/console, so you play a freshly released game on your 10 years old laptop at max details. Unbelievable, right?
---
Also playing a modern game on your mobile phone/table.
---
Beta
---
Thanks mate, that's why I basically wrote a disclaimer at the top as I anticipated the comments on balance, but it didn't seem to work lol.
---
My heart is telling me go alch and herb. I just worry about endgame gear (and you need everything you can get to stand a chance raiding so I've heard) I suppose if I really have to I can drop alch for tailoring at lvl 60. Just seems like a waste of time lvling a skill to then loose all that progress. 
---
But thanks, GL to you too!
---
True.
---
Enchanting only if you get end raid recipes, if not it's close to useless. Alchemy is always in need with various consumables constantly being in use.
---
He still does those WoW comics.
---
what is this pog shit?   
---
i also hope they leave LFQ channel alone
---
Its the main reason I want to play back classic. Word
---
Disc priest! 😀😀😀
---
Is that the weak spec for priests in classic? I dont know much about them. Dont think I ever even touched priest until like... MoP hah.
---
If you want to train enchanting to 300 you will need a lot of mats and you will need levels to lear higher tiers of enchanting plus rods which for the last tier do require expensive arcanite bars. If you want to DE only then yes, you don't have to put anything into it to be able to do it.
---
Its a different type of streaming, not the one on Twitch or Youtube. Streaming the game on a different device like your phone or another PC and play like that. Something like playing via TeamViewer. Blizzard disallow that because people use it to bot like that.
---
Balance druid, for fun and unique leveling experience and the challenge of proving yourself as an underdog raider to all the haters 😉
---
https://ptr.wowhead.com/forums&amp;topic=109437/troll-regeneration-is-overpowered
---
A good read
---
The game will have to be approved by the developers before it's avalible on Stadia.
---
Or do you think Netflix and HBO just throws up some movies and series on their platform hoping no one will notice?
---
In the long-term, Blizzard can offer transfers (or even cram servers together.)   
---
I think the probability of there being several low-population servers is low.
---
Yeah, plenty of idiots out there that hand over their cash so easy right ?

Guys...this is satire. Don’t dignify it with a serious response, it makes you look idiotic. His name is “ClassicPurist” ffs.
---
A lot of people will misjudge how much free time they need to dedicate to the game for sure, but I don't think it will be that big of an issue
---
should have summoned him somewhere deep underwater, or on those floating islands or with a graveyard or something
---
Hell ya brother! Druid will be my second, though I'll be feral. Back in the day I would play a bear/cat hybrid type spec and I demolished in pvp with it. But warlock will always be my main, till the day I die!
---
Ok I'm worried especially about low levels like 10-30 not having enough people 2 group with but it is blizzard if that happens they will probably lower the price
---
Earliest memory is reading about it when Wc3 was released, the game book had information about it.
---
In game? Tried beta a bit but didn't play much. Made a human mage running around a bit. But I do remember the release date, it was insane! So many people.
---
Stop spreading false information!
---
The pricing is as follows:
---
\- free for 1080p/60fps with the games you already own
---
\- Pro subscription allows for 4k/60fps/HDR streaming and includes a list of games. It's launching in 2020. 
---
They're doing a 'founder's edition' which is basically a package containing a Chromecast Ultra (70$), Stadia wifi controller (70$), 3 months of the Pro subscription (30$) and another 3 months of Pro subscription to gift to a friend (30$). As you can see, it's a 200$ package sold in limited quantities for 130$ for who wants it.
---
If you want to play it on your computer, you only need the Chrome browser and that's all.
---
The attitude of some is annoying and then YouTube decides to shove their click bait in your face all the time.
---
With the fact it's not keybound, probably so he didn't misclick.
---
ankhs ... considering on their cd and usefulness, running out fucking sucked
---
I would go Undead. The 10% casting speed boost for 10 seconds is really minuscule. Unless you get 30% the racial is not that great.
---
That's not only for the controller, the founder's package includes Chromecast Ultra (70$), the wifi Stadia controller (70$), 3 months subscription to Pro (30$) and another 3 months for gifting to a friend (30$).
---
Cool! Similar to mine which is: Orc Shaman &gt; Tauren Druid &gt; Undead Priest.. Now going over to thinking "hmm maybe rogue?"
---
I'd like one too. Where do I sign up?
---
I think the first 3 months it will be super populated, Than probably ppl will find it too hard/long to gear up and quit
---
What’s Chromecast Ultra?
---
When I was kid, I always wanted to be the good guy. Alliance screams good. I fell in love with Stormwind and the fantasy of the Alliance. That side I love the identity of the Horde, just some savages trying to survive. That is until I went to Orgrimmar, that place is ugly as sin. Horde made a fatal mistake not making Thunderbluff the hub. For that I say FOR THE ALLIANCE!
---
I was choosing between hunter and mage, until I realized I could just combine the two and roll a warlock.
---
Been changing my mind a lot recently too. 
---
I'll be playing with two friends of mine. One of them is gonna play NE rogue, another one is mostly gonna play NE Arms warrior. I feel like playing priest to have a good group, being able to do crazy stuff in pvp as a 3 man group, leveling is smooth, you get to find groups easily in both pve and pvp.
---
But at the same time I want to play mage and pew pew stuff in both pve and pvp but I'm scared it would get hard to find a group, and we would be missing a healer. 
---
In a way, 70 days left to decide is a good thing.
---
Again, i dont want to level enchanting but just disenchant for extra money.
---
But there isn't enough gold being put into the economy from mob kills to justify 20g for such a low level item.
---
It's not a meme, that was literally the gold selling website iirc
---
I started wow during TBC as a human paladin. Around level 10, I went to Westfall just to get my ass kicked by harvest golems.
---
I was so frustrated that I decided to go back to elwynn forest and grind murlocs until I gain a few levels. Around level 12 or 13 the murlocs didn't give xp anymore... so I believed it was a bug and opened a GM request.
---
To this day, I still remember this GM explaining me what's the difference between Grey / Green / Yellow / Red / Skull NPC in term of xp.
---
But that's all the fun about it .I'm in no rush if It takes me a week to go from lvl 10 to 11 I don't care I just wanna explore take it easy enjoy the game and secondary professions and stuff
---
In classic anything goes. Its a sandbox game. Thats why there are always multiple zones for you to level in incase you are getting ganked. 
---
You are always free try to leave and you have the right to get killed on a pvp realm.
---
There is always the option for PvE.
---
The same can be said about retail, but less farm for it
---
Disc is actually pretty decent.  You could give PI to other people, so in PvE people loved Disc priests.  In PvE you also always spec 21 points into disc as a healer so it's got some good talents.
---
Mainly the extra abilities really help to get you back to a good spot around 40.  By 40 you can sit mostly in zerker stance for extra crit and WW, MS, and Pummel with occasionally stancing to battle for overpowers.  The 20s and most of the 30s you are just sitting in battle stance waiting on overpowers and doing occasional slams/rend.
---
Your entire leveling journey as a warrior is definitely weapon dependent.  Part of my problem I imagine in the 20s and 30s was weapon based.  I had a nice power spike when I got corpsemaker from (RFK?) but then had to use that until I got ravage/WW axe around 40ish.  Really cant remember when I got WW axe TBH and I doubt it was like in beta where they get it at 30 usually. 
---
Leveling might be easier if I get the staff from the wailing caverns quest and it fills the void until corpsemaker, will have to wait and see.
---
The only real way to play this game hehe
---
Then a bank alt fueled by leatherworker/tailor greens, although better effort would be cenarion circles blues into large brilliant shards, war effort turn-ins also give boxes with greens too.
---
Nightelfs have the highest agility gains of all the races, so i have no idea how a dwarf min/maxes more. Is it because of the gun specailization? Because that is shit late game there are no good guns, you will never be using guns once you step into raiding. Xbows/ bows are the weapons you get out of raids that are the bis items.
---
I'd suggest Tailor/Engi for final professions and mining/herbing, while levelling for some extra ah gold on the side.   
---
Tailor, because bloodweave will be BiS for you for quite some time and engi, will bridge some of that DPS lack of yours in raids and give you even more utility in PvP.   
---
I'm sure you'll find a raidspot with some non hardcore guild. There's plenty of people around this time, that just want to have fun.
---
Great to see some more druid love!! I played feral back in vanilla and loved it, but ever since I learned about the Moonkin form it's all I've ever wanted to play. Just back then I was too young and didn't have the know-how to make it work. Looking forward to the challenge now.
---
Also good to hear about playing as a hybrid, I myself plan to play balance with some spec into feral to make good use of feral charge in PvP. Lots of people underestimate us but don't expect it when we use our full kit. 😉
---
Then how do you apply shadow weaving without knocking something else off?
---
It will mostly depend on which faction your server is biased towards. Whichever side has the higher population will have more guilds clearing endgame and doing the honor grind which means more premades and better gear overall. If it's one of the few closely matched servers horde usually seems to have more pvp oriented players in my experience.
---
You can already stream your own games from your own pc to another device, both on your local wifi and also through internet.
---
It's a night and day difference between how youtube/twitch work - they're only streaming a pre-buffered video, so when your connection is going bad (which happens frequently), the video gets delayed, buffered and so on (up to 30 seconds delay vs the realtime video) - no, the twitch streams are not realtime, there's several seconds between what happens at the streamers' house and what you see on your screen. For game streaming you can't afford 'several seconds', you can't even afford one second delay, that would be completely inacceptable. Even half a second delay would be unplayable - for game streaming we're talking 100-200ms delay (and even sub 100ms), so it's going to be insanely tricky to do 100-200ms 'realtime' video encoding and streaming, in terms of the video quality itself.
---
Ty for a good laugh, more “realists” like u plz haha
---
you can play almost every raid composition in vanilla.
---
having alot of mages,warriors,rouges and warlocks is just the most optimal way for DPS
---
If u pick a hunter for example, you will still find a raid spot and have value in the raid, but most raids will bring 2 instead of 8hunters (but they will bring 8mages)
---
its a numbers game, if u wanna really be good at your class, it doesnt matter at all.
---
If u know u are below average, you probably dont wanna play a class that has a hard time finding a group.
---
even a bad mage is a good Damage dealer, that cant be said about hunters for example.
---
PS: I personally would love to play a rouge or hunter in PVP; but im just too bad, i can enjoy a mage or warlock alot more because the playstyle fits me more (i can execute it better)   
---
so im gonna stick with that because im good at it and its more fun.
---
I think that when it comes to pvp maybe that agi plus doesn't really matter.
---
Are you going horde? You are welcome to join ny guild if you are. We are a group of 10 irl friends that are all going to play together and be the core leaders of our a guild. We need more players for raids and such.
---
I'm really hoping wow classic goes the way of osrs after a few expansions. New content that is true to vanilla please.
---
They literally did this for a special everquest server.  FFA PvP, with full loot.  Die and you drop to level 1.  If you died in PvE you might be able to get back to your body to get your gear.  Was fun for a while and definitely memorable.
---
Horde?
---
Just remember that the AV we get is not the long one.
---
Hmmm I did not know.
---
People here think that you can't finish a ride if your composition isn't perfect. everyone should have perfect specs, gears and items
---
Them = who?  
---
Ideas about what? Wow is being streamed to phones since like 10 years ago, just unofficially. Given the fact that the entire gaming industry is slowly (but steadily) moving towards game streaming, it's going to be just a matter of time until Blizzard will do it too. 10 years ago it was only a niche thing, these days it's becoming industry wide/accepted.
---
Fuck it up the ass. Horde can have it as far as I'm concerned.
---
Read the thread, it's pretty obvious.
---
My bad, didn't know this was r/SpellingBee
---
I wonder if that’s why Blizzard hasn’t been advertising classic as much. Maybe they’re keeping that up their sleeve just in case population gaps are large.
---
Not in AB. The LM, BS, farm triangle heavily favours horde in the start of the match.
---
This actually amazing, keep up the good work!  
---
Would love to see a warlock T2
---
I literally spent ages telling my old guildies i was gonna be a pala and i was getting all hyped about t2 and shit... then I remembered that last server i played on i was a resto druid and i got sick to death of rebuffing people - and it was only gonna be worse on a pala
---
i then checked out one pvp vid of a hunter, saw him do big numberz with aimed shot and i was like "im playing a hunter."
---
i've never actually played one seriously before as well so its something new

---
Your rank depends on how much other people on hour server play so it's hard to guess beforegand.  But once the game comes out, yes there should be websites that can predict how much you need to play per week to get what rank.
---
Wild guess would be rank 7. But cannot remember how long it took me to reach rank 10 where I stopped. I think really important is the population on your server and what amount of honor the people of your faction collect.
---
100% agree
---
Next modern wow expansion goes to mobile, it will be free2play and you get gear with lootboxes !
---
I love you postmaster. Don’t think he did jobs like this back then
---
I expect the going price of lesser magic wands to be around 20 silver.
---
Im gonna be a druid tank, because fuck warriors.
---
Funny enough, I used moonlight to play both stress tests on my phone and got to lvl 5 and 10 this way.
---
Yew.
---
Thanks for this, really reinforces trying to learn Shaman tanking for 5 and 10 man stuff with my friends when it comes out!
---
It’s weird they didn’t include it in the pro subscription.
---
You're right that min/maxing isn't necessary to do most of the content in WoW, but man having the right classes makes everything so much easier.
---
I upvoted you. You are 100% right in every word you said. This sub needs more people like you.
---
I have been looking out for a good price on this in Melbourne. Saw quite a few videos of people playing Skyrim , Witcher and WoW on ultra wides. May as well get the widest haha.
---
My brother keep deleting the chars I worked on all saturday.
---
They've been around for a long time. They are way less bugged than wrath or tbc servers, too.
---
It's not. Math even says a healing priest with shadow weaving is more damage than a pure sp and take a real dd in
---
Yea, I think we will get an oversupply of warlocks. However, they are also fun outside groups so they atleast get compensated through leveling. I wonder how paladin tanking at low lvls is gonna be cus on pservers they dont seem to give you time to get some agro and without a taunt you quickly start to feel useless.
---
I think in an effort to incentivize people to play every day they ended up pushing away their players.
---
So the ranking goes to the guy with most honor or honor kills ?
---
I hate you for that ...
---
Could use rank 1 mindblast maybe?  I personally don't really know what a shadow priest does rotation wise.
---
Ya def agree. That downtime due to eating is still pretty average though even though you down mob quickly.I got my ww axe around 37, I remember the main issue was downing the boss at the end of the quest, i couldn't get other pplz to help because i was leading the push to 60 on a new server.
---
Surv hunter once i lvld my priest

Thanks for the trolling tip!

Aussie Classic Guild  \[Drop Bears\]
---
Hey everyone, we're looking for more members for our Aussie Classic guild, we're going to go Alliance on a PvP server, obviously Oceanic servers if we get them. The ultimate goal is 40 man raids and PvP so class balance matters but we are not going to tell anyone what they have to play.
---
Raid nights will be Sunday and wednesday 7:30-10:30 AEST with 20 mans done over the weekend. With our raiding we're not going to be some hardcore guild aiming for server firsts or anything like that but we do plan on moving at a steady pace. People have jobs, families, social lives etc so we aren't about to crack the shits if someone cant make every raid. Raid loot will be DKP, it seems to be the fairest option. Other options can of course be looked at.
---
PvP is also something that a fair few of us enjoy and have had some success at in Vanilla and various expansions. So we will be looking at doing regular premade groups. Regarding Officer/ Recruitment positions etc within the guild these are all up for grabs, be helpful and help promote the guild and you'll be one.
---

To ding r14 you must be rank 1 that week. Getting 13 is a lot easier than 14 partially because 14 has insane restriction to even advance where 13 is a lot more lenient just time consuming
---
I definitely would, but I'm working this summer so I have to plan ahead to maximize my efficiency :-/
---
If your tank uses Sunder for TPS he is doing something wrong.
---
Warlocks are incredibly rare on the alliance side it was hard for my naxx guild on a ND to keep more than 2-3 at any time. If you stay with a guild that is good you will get fed gear as an alliance warlock. Plus they are very easy to level and also reallly good at pvp.
---
Probs 3/4
---
The amount of times i have outplayed people with shadow meld and a non stealth pet is astounding. Stone form doesnt even come close to equating to Shadow meld.
---
With all the daily and weekly stuff in retail they have bred a mentality of "efficiency" so a vast majority of players are not doing any of the "fun stuff" on the sides.
---
They just do their efficient stuff and then wait for raids. Either because they are strapped for time and choose to spend it efficiently OR because they find all the side-stuff to be inefficient.
---
Gaming shouldnt be about efficieny, it should be about having fun. And having daily or weekly quests is not fun, especially not when its just repetitive content that you have done before.
---
In BfA there was a quest chain you could do that advanced by one step each week. It was kinda like a weekly quest but you didnt do something you've already done but with better rewards - it was a completely new experience.
---
*runs away in fear*
---
Back when I started playing in WotLK, this was my reasoning as well. Now that I'm quite familiar with the game and how progression works, I've found that some sort of concrete reason for my choices helps me out in the long run, but I will always keep this in mind. Thank you for the comment!
---
These random numbers people throw out is funny. It will take some time but it mostly depends how your server sets it up between the pushers
---
Ur mum
---
TBH, I like to think of myself as a savage who enjoys showers. \\o/
---
life is good man...
---
i dont like the look of gear on dwarves much, but everything else about them is just good fun.  i love the voice lines.  I love how cheeky they look.
---
I'm always reminded of the laugh of the dwarf in 'the illegal danish'  
---
there is an imposter amongst us... and he touched my ass!!  SEEEIZE THE ASS-TOUCHER!
---
+1 for skipping SoS -- it's a slog, you're better off doing some dungeons or farming similar level areas. 
---
If you're playing as a duo and have mounts -- SoS isn't half bad. (again, from memory)
---
Is Brazil getting an classic server? Any guilds for hardcore (3+ raids day / week) PVE recruiting? Planning on ally warrior, but that may change until release...
---
Can I Bind AZ5 to RBMK ?
---
Cannibalism is always a +, but as for the class fantasy aspect I think that I'd only feel at home with an Orc Warrior. But if I somehow end up playing a priest or a warlock, Horde definitely has the upper hand!

 **&lt;Senile Chieftains&gt;** | EU Pvp Server, Horde | Casual pve raiding guild     
---
**Introduction**    
---
"Senile Chieftains" is made for people who would like to see all the classic raid content (again), but are not able or willing to spend 8 nights a week playing. Of our 4 raids that we will run every week, we only expect you to attend 1. There are options available for people who would like to raid multiple days.    
---
Senile Chieftains is made by ex raiders who have grown to old to raid to many evenings a week. Back in vanilla we cleared aq40 until the 'twin emperors', but because of the "tbc" release the guild disbanded.  One of our officers has all the tbc server first under his belt up to kil'jaeden. So you can expect a mature and experienced raid environment    
---
**Expectations from members**   
---
We are looking for experienced and skilled players to realize our goal of clearing all classics raid content. New players are also welcome, but keep in mind that most of our players are now 30 years and older so we will have a more mature guild environment.      
---
**Raid information**    
---
Raiding days will be Mon-Thur 20:00 - 23:00 (server time). Once available, we will run organized raids on off days for lower tier content for alts and those who want to complete their tier/bis sets. Loot will be distributed by a loot council aided by a hidden dkp system.   
---
Check [https://www.senilechieftains.com/](https://www.senilechieftains.com/) for more information!
---
Druids are S tier levellers, the best flag carriers in WSG, great for soloing and can fill every role in a 5 man dungeon. They suck at raiding, yes, but these raids are gonna be so fucking easy I hope you don’t bank on them being your main type of on content. Class balance is a mess but literally every class has something unique and something they’re the best at. Also wtf do you mean free mount?
---
But but please dont tell me summon stones are not a vanilla thing.
---
Fair enough.

I personally prefer it over nelfs and humans (gnomes are out of question tho,that just looks miserable).

**[Horde] [EU] [PVE]**
---
**&lt;Hero Association&gt;**
---
A guild formed by a group of IRL friends, &lt;HA&gt; plans to be both a social hub as well as an active raiding guild. We like to maintain a laid back attitude outside of raiding, but take progressing seriously both in terms of preparation and during raids themselves. We do not aim for server firsts etc, but we do want to steadily progress through and clear all the content.
---
We aim to maintain a good community of friends without sacrificing endgame progression. We're looking for solid players who want to properly apply themselves to the challenges Classic brings, while also being reliable and social. To us, quality is more important than quantity - but we are welcoming of new people, and will be happy to show and teach you, to help you progress with us. All we ask is that you put effort into it, and have a similar passion for the game as we do.
---
----
---
Our raiding days will be announced closer to the launch, but we will have 3 days per week dedicated to raiding, with times of **21:30 - 00:30 Server time / 20:30 - 23:30 UK time**.
---
We require consistent raid attendance, however we will also be understanding if some events make you unable to participate at a given date, as long as you let us know in advance.
---
Looting will be done via DKP/EPGP (or similar) system for 40man raiding, and rolling for 20man raiding (barring a few exceptional items). 
---
*We are currently recruiting most classes and roles (except shadow priests and main tank), and we are always open to non-raiding socials (so you are welcome to bring your friends or family with you!).*
---
If you have any questions, or want to apply, feel free to PM me here on reddit, or contact me **(ThirteenEra#8084)** or our GM **(Sir Krabby#7625)** on Discord.
---
Cheers!
---
Nope, Bloodvine can be worn by anyone, just the extra set bonus requires Tailoring.
---
This is actually me, except it cycles daily.
---
Its like that one guy who made it back in Cataclysm, back then I wont even lie. Being able to play WoW on the go sounded like fun, but there is just so many flaws not just with how you play the game but how you playing on mobile effects others playing the game
---
&lt;Ravage&gt; Oceanic // Horde // PvP // Semi-Hardcore
---
Who we are Bunch of Aussie lads who have been playing WoW since Classic. Many of us have been both Guild leaders and raid leaders in this time. The best way to explain the type of environment you will be joining, is a group of Aussies who are chill to talk to and hard to offend.
---
What we do Firstly we will be semi-hardcore raiding. We won't be raiding 12 hours a day everyday, but when raid time comes you will be expected to take it seriously. World PvP is a big yes. Raid groups will be formed to push Alliance shit back in. We will also be ruining streamer events on both Alliance and Horde. If a streamer is doing an event on the server and the guild is not busy we will be fucking with them. If your online you will be expected to attend these large scale stream sniping sessions. Put simply we will be active in all forms of content available in classic.
---
Raid Schedule We will be heading into MC around the end of week two with the people who have hit 60. If enough have hit 60 we will kill bosses, if not we will farm trash mobs for T1 Belts and Bracers. In week 3 the raid schedule will look like this.
---
8pm-11pm AEST Wednesday (More days TBD)
---
Loot Distribution We will be using Loot council. Here is a quick explanation for anyone who has not used it before.
---
Loot council is a relatively simple way to distribute loot. Whenever an item is involved in the loot system, a group of individuals decides who gets the item. Ideally, this group of individuals takes into consideration several different factors, ranging from attendance, performance, size of upgrade, and attitude. It's worth noting that Loot Council systems are the most popular method of loot distribution in world-class raiding guilds.
---
Recruitment We are recruiting everyone and everything at the moment (Other than Main Tank). From those who want to no-life it, to those who want to play casually. You can play whatever you want class or spec and the guild will take you. But if you want to raid you will be expected to play the spec that the guild wants you to.

Doesn't fireball have a debuff too, when it comes to Ignite?
---
That is true, but many druids are shiet and this is not taking gear into a count. A lot of druid healing comes from overtime healing and managing that can be hard for some. I can just speak from my own experience and thats if druids have equal gear they provide just as good healing if not better than most
---
Just wait for av and get the av exalted ram

**&lt;Nebula&gt;**
---
(EU PVP Alliance)
---
**About Us:**
---
Nebula began as a small group of friends, some of who have lived the vanilla experience given to us in 2004, some of us haven’t. Some of us hardcore, some are not.
---
Yet the main goal for all of us is the same. This is a game we are super excited about launch and simply put can’t wait for the fun times ahead. We are a group of adults, 
---
from each corner of Europe. We love banter and a good atmosphere.
---
Guild reputation is important to us. So, whether your jam is smashing skulls in AV, grinding Timbermaw rep or competing with us in end game content, Nebula would be happy to host your stay. We also foster a very active Discord which has grown steadily along with the build up towards launch in August!
---
Our philosophy is: **For the guild, not a person.**
---
**Our Goals:**
---
Straight up raiding. Our ranks include many highly experienced players who have spent 14 years raiding on wow. Our raiding environment will be serious, yet positive and enthusiastic. 
---
If raiding isn’t your jam, our ranks also include many socials/ pvpers who are here for ride! 
---
**Raid Times:**
---
Wednesday + Thursday + Sunday 18:30 - 22:30 BST (or 19:30 - 23:30 EU server time). 
---
**Recruitment:**
---
Recruitment has been very positive as we inch towards launch. Surprisingly, we are still lacking a lot of DPSers! 
---
Our current recruitment update is as follows:
---
Rogue x 2 
---
Mage x 4
---
Warlock x 2
---
Holy Priest x 1
---
Resto Druid x 1
---
**Application:**
---
Please apply via this link: https://www.guilded.gg/r/EnNEavPo4j?i=x4oZnqGA.
---
Or contact Shane#2310, Zyepox#1969, Ethario#1412 or Nakkie#3039 on Discord.
---
At the end of the week, everyone in your faction on your server is ranked by honor gained in the week. Then, based on weekly standing, you are awarded an amount of Ranking Points. These ranking points are sort of like experience for the bar in your honor tab, except they do decay over time, so you'll eventually lose your rank if you stop pvping.
---
Low level dungeons with a turtle it’s doable but once you get past level 35 it’s more of a pipe dream to be honest. I had a group of 5 and me, another hunter, ret pally, priest and a lock. Since we had essentially 3 off tanks it wasn’t bad but far from easy. Past 35 though and it was wipe city :(
---
If you dont like streamers dont watch, that's the best advice you can have. Streamers will always have more benefits than " us." And i don't mind it.
---
i will playing Classic 27th august, while all streamers are burned out of the game.And less viewers because the viewers are playing the game to.
---
So dont worry guys it's gonna be alright :D
---
I see you missing MOTW and a druid in the screenshot idling!
---
If the extra content outweighs the original bis items in any way, it is automatically shit and ruined imo
---
Agreed. Really hoping they make at least one. Im not even super into the RP side but usually the server is more mature as a whole. 
---
What reason could they possibly have to not at least have ONE single rppvp server ?
---
Do you mean private servers? Because Alliance usually has a big population advantage on most of them. It was really bad on ND at the beginning.
---
I remember not being able to mount once you enter the stone foundation of the arena, but being able to mount in the middle of the arena on the sand area. 
---
It could have been patched in 1.12 though. Never went to the arena when bc was on the horizon.
---
Why would they do that? If any, the gamepad would make more sense than the Chromecast - Chromecast is only for those who want to play on a TV and you will need the wifi controller as mandatory to play via Chromecast. Not sure who would include 140$ hardware with a 10$ subscription, especially when that's only one of the ways to use the subscription - main usage being streaming it on any computer with Chrome or on mobile phones/tablets.
---
Playing shortly after release with my friend by my side. We took turns playing on my computer, leveling a Tauren Shaman. My settings or what-ever were all wack and the sky kept blinking and stuff, which was really bothersome. We had a bunch of fun though. I remember just about every single thing that happened that day/night. It was glorious!
---
 I tried the playstation now service so I could finally play The Last of Us. Besides a few hiccups it played smooth as silk, that was a year ago. I assume it's only gotten better.
---
My comment got removed for mentioning server names but you can look at the top servers with class stats available and very clearly see warrior/rogue/mage are always the top 3 most played by a margin higher than the next played classes. Warrior usually is a little more populated than rogue mage but all 3 are a cut more popular than the next most tier.
---
This is information you can verify yourself right now with Google provided by server data and not voluntary player polls.
---
That is not really the intended purpose of the tool, since the selection of which spell to cast is highly situational, it's not really possible to make such a prediction. 
---
In addition to this, down-ranking isn't really a thing until you have acquired quite a lot of +Healing, which means that during leveling you will most likely always use the highest rank of your most potent spell, since it will be the most efficient. Lower ranks are really only cast when you're OOM and need that heal to prevent a death. 
---
But I will consider this, and see if I can extend the tool for pre 60 dungeon running, though my priority at the moment is for it to work correctly at level 60.
---
Have you tried using shazam or
---
Typing the lyrics in google??
---
yeah literally hahaha
---
It's part of the top upvoted thread at the moment, more and more starting to realise the direction the sub is / was heading toward.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bym7eq/literally_this_entire_week/eqjjjt5/
---
These wouldn't get 5k upvotes if atleast a part of the community is starting to notice it
---
Well yeah, all the idiots who refuse to tank will have an awful time in 5 mans. Pretty much all your gear will come from dungeons as well, so gimping yourself by not playing your class properly is a really bad move.
---
I actually think its quite the opposite. A druid would need to be massively overgeared to outperform other healers, or those other healers would have to be braindead. HoT is just too weak. You can't stack them and anyone and their to prone to just being turned into overhealing by any healer with a flash heal.
---
Just make your own group. Sure sometimes you can spend an hour looking for a tank + healer but it's better then not running the dungeon. Most newer players are afraid of making their own groups out of fear of not knowing what to do. You can use this to your advantage.
---
trash
---
Oh god, pls no...
---
Lmao
---
Who the hell is asmongoloid ?
---
I remember being one of the 3 maintank healers at the AQ40 twins with blue gear and medium mana pots i still had from questing.
---
It was a random raid too, although a fairly ambitious one. Also did the first few bosses in Naxx.
---
I honestly cant remember, but I don't believe they are lol. Hope someone corrects or confirms though.
---
Looking for guild: NA, Alliance, PvP server preferred. 
---
I'm looking for a casual-leaning guild to raid with. I say casual-leaning because I have never raided in vanilla, so my knowledge of the raids are limited but I'm very willing to learn! Most of the week I work evenings, but I am free on Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday evenings. My timezone is central. If raid days are on other days I won't be able to make it unless it's past 11pm or if my work schedule drastically changes before launch.
---
My main will be a priest healer!
---
Please send me a PM on here so we can discuss further!
---
&gt;Also Enchanting on it own is worthless.
---
Not true. Take like DME jump runs, those blue items sell between 1-3g. If you DE them, you can get something like 5-8g from each shard. You get like 3-5 shards per run. For best profit your healer would have herbalism+enchanting and warrior would have mining. Problem is that almost all highend guilds REQUIRE you to have engineering, even as a healer.
---
So if you have a class that can easily farm DME lashers solo, you want to get herbalism+engineering and if you do jump runs, then enchanting+engineering. Alchemy on main is iffy in phases 1-2, as black lotus is BOP, so you need both to get any real usage of that.
---
GOT U TY ALOT
---
This 100%. lool
---
I would assume that input delay is gonna be terrible but you do you
---
I have no idea. A healer for sure. Beyond that I'm so torn. I don't want to have more than one level 60 healer lol. Doesn't seem like a good idea.
---
Not really.  It’s worse than having another mage or warlock.  
---
For PvP it’s good though.
---
Idk, in pvp that feign death-trap-drink-meld every 30sec can be OP.
---
Revoke her beta access and give it to someone who will use it.
---
I much preferred them to the current rep grinds. 
---
You could grind them out at your own pace, be it fast or slow. You only really had to do the ones relevant to your class / profs.
---
Ive played retail and only a couple of pvt servers
---
They are decent in pvp while leveling, against warriors you just sac vw and warriors can't do anything. On 60 though until you get t2 you basically die to coldblood evis, unless you're playing soul link, but it's a very boring spec that only good for duels. In t2+ gear you're basically a god.
---
Right! Everyone keeps saying "other classes can do what you do but better." But none of them can do it all at once like druids can!
---
Pain to watch.
---
Preach it!
---
I really enjoy cooking though. I'm looking forward to it being really worthwhile again.
---
Alot of warriors is good, you’ll be thankful whenever its time to form a dungeon group at 60.
---
Troll isn't even that good in vanilla pve. On retail you can cd stack giving you way more benefit from the cast speed. In classic most classes don't even have a damage cd.
---
Been up against plenty of good rogues and won pal...
---
Timegating is a fucker. I have about 20 hours a week available to me, but it's not evenly distributed. I'd much rather the freedom to do blocks of time over an even weekly spread.
---
Ohhh I see interesting, I need to look up the extra bonuses. Do they give extra spell damage?
---
I’m going full Lightwell with my priest. One of the worst talent spells out there haha.
---
Why?
---
Because WoW classic has been played out and everything has been done. So rather just spend the time with silliness and having fun.  Nothing against those looking to play super serious but for me thats all been done long ago so progressing as quickly as possible holds nothing to me.
---
When I first started playing, I picked Horde just because Undead chicks looked cool as hell. I wanted to play a Warlock, and that felt to be the most fitting choice.
---
Recently started playing Alliance, and its like a whole new game. The zones are pretty. The music is relaxing. The quest chains feel like someone put time and effort into them. 
---
I tried playing Horde again and it felt hollow. I feel like I've abandoned my home.
---
And what should a tank do when he initiate the boss?
---
+healing and lesser rank spells is most efficient.
---
There wasn't cross server bg's back then. So your server was dependent on population stats. Now there is. Should be more balanced.
---
pls Blizz, pls!
---
&gt; I think the private server vets will have a rude awakening finding that raid bosses work a lot differently than they are used to. So optional builds that worked on the private server won't.
---
Example?
---
Lore has been overly discussed the last 15 years. PVP strats are fir elitist, changes are No. Rp events can't happpens when the game is not out yet. Meme's is Art, believe it or not.
---
But all these things get discussed but these are not the topics we upvote. If its funny its get upvoted.
---
Try sorting by new and search for intresting topics there.
---
I mean, presumably since you played at least Wrath, you picked a faction at some point. How did you decide on that faction? Just pick the same faction because its familiar and nostalgic, or pick the one you didn't pick for a new experience.
---
I wanna say a hunter because that's what I was when I started, but probably a priest because that was my favorite class overall.
---
It's not about pleasing others dude...  It's the difference between having 5 hours of content to play after work, compared to 3 hours of content and 2 hours of waiting because your class is not currently needed. Logical reasoning. If I was a teenager, I'd just go whatever because it pans out at the end if you can keep up with average 6-9hrs of playtime regularly.  Gotta make smart choices as an adult
---
If you play pvp 4 hours a day its no problem getting rank 10 eventually, my suggestion would be to focus more hours into the BG weekend if possible.
---
the thing i dislike most about gnome (and tauren) is the different camera positioning.  on gnomes you feel sunk into the ground, and on tauren you have real issues in low-ceiling areas.  BFD is absolutely HORRIBLE on a tauren
---
Thanks this is a really helpful post. How do you make training eng work without the gathering profession? Or would you stockpile mats from lvling/buy everything on the ah? Sound expensive to buy mats all the way to max prof
---
Technically, dwarfs can ride mechanostriders, but in reality, there’s no way of reaching exalted with gnomeregan before the AQ patch and repeatable turn in quests
---
# BRILLIANT!!
---
Looking for a EU casual raiding guild preferably on a PvP server. I'm a 23 yo male from Russia planning to roll a shaman (but I'm also okay with playing as a warrior or a warlock). I'm okay to be convinced to roll as Alliance because why not?
---
I started playing in 2009 as an orc shaman. My raiding experience is pretty much limited to clearing ToC and ICC 25 man normal but I enjoyed it very much. After the WotLK the game wasn't the same for me anymore.
---
I previously played on Russian servers but this time I want to experience a true multi-cultural gaming. So I'd like to find an English-speaking guild with more or less mature players. Socializing, normal pace leveling and eventually raiding is what I basically need.
---
Timezones are a bit tricky so the earlier - the better but I'm okay with 19:00-23:00 CEST. 16:00-20:00 CEST would be perfect but I know it's rare.
---
Please add me on Discord even if you aren't a recruiter but want to find the same multi-cultural gaming experience: AndreyP#8084

---
Depends on the fight. Take visciudus for example were raid dmg i guaranteed. Also flash heals often overheal and quote me if I am wrong here but I don't think that's taken into a count while calculating HPS on parses.
---
Damn, how long have you been a virgin? 23 years? 30?.  Get laid dude. That's your problem
---
Sounds nice!
---
Need confirmation on the alcors sun razor proc. On pservers it was the best tank weapon until tfury. Someone pls test.
---
troll post
---
They we dont but we do.
---
I played on ED and i will tell you the delay over adding rp-pvp in the game really fucked the pop on those servers.
---
Ion needs to stop being so data driven and take a leap of faith on this. Otherwise it will never convince me they truly are doing classic for the community and not for their convenience
---
If there are no rp-pvp realms ill have to roll on asmons realm and pepega all day
---
Walking in Kharanos and stumbling across the MechanoStrider vendor. 
---
Looking up at those Robot Chickens and realizing that I would be riding one of them someday.... The feels.
---
Mindflay.
---
That's my point, by the time they come around, they are near pointless which is such a shame.
---
Especially the dungeon 2 set, it's so expensive.
---
It always ends in stealth archer doesn’t it?
---
I didn't play retail wow, is it really that easy?
---
HAHAHAHAHHA pretty much everyone after the 1st week on classic...
---
And all the streamers.
---
I planned to return as a Warlock, the guild litterally told me that they were packed and that I need to to Rgue. 
---
Guess that is some lucky turn of events.
---
According to chart, I should pick Hunter as alt since I am allready in the guild and could well aswell roll the "fun road"?
---
It's a game... If someone gives you shit tell them to fuck off
---
This x10000
---
I would argue the total cost of the set approaches epic mount levels. It is a pretty cool quest chain though.
---
It's good on a few bosses like broodlord and chromaggus
---
That is true, they are powerful, but so is dire maul and that comes 3 stages before dungeon sets.
---
It just feels off, to wait this long for dungeon sets, when gear like dire maul is dropped in second phase.
---
imagine paying someone money to play a video game for you
---
And I need you to knowww
---
Exactly this. Now all just want to get easy itrms in first month. Looking forward to classic grind and deserving an item.
---
The only thing I'm deciding now is if I want to roll male or be a hipster and roll female Dwarf hunter
---
Yeah I did :D Thank you glad you dig it
---
Best WSG flag runners aswell. All round nice class.
---
The extra encounters, I didn't think about. That is a problem.
---
The value is there, but by the time they come around, there's better an eqy easier gear to get.
---
It feels wasteful, for such awesome sets. They will be forgotten once again.
---
As if playing on rp realms is all about doing gatherings and larping like a sperg
---
You guys have no idea what rp-pvp servers are about
---
You'd need an alt with mining. 
---
If you want to DPS as balance, there really isn't any way around Bloodweave for you, as your main DPS cast has the longest cast time and you can't afford to miss, leaving you with 1 slot for professions. Engi is the most suitable for PvP and PvE as it gives you utilities for DPS increase (sapper charges) and gimmicks for PvP, like helmets, trinkets and tools. 
---
If you don't want to go through the effort of levelling an alt, go for tailor + herbing and then have a friend/guildmate craft your pots etc for you.
---
LOL YES!!!! This is the EXACT reaction I’ve been waiting for this entire time. Thank you, OP. I cannot wait for this shit to happen on The Regular upon release. 
---
The salt turns into sugar as the tears touch my tongue. Mmmmmmmmm.....
---
I didn't see any rogues. Immersion ruined.
---
no matter how many times you try to force this meme it will never be the reason why streamers are hated
---
So, Pawn addon?
---
My worry is blizzard fucks the game up with some stupid patch or addon that noone wants as they usually do
---
one of the ooga gang goy her lol
---
The incentive is that copper is never going to sell for 20g. Someone will undercut it and sell it for 19g, then someone else will undercut it for 18g etc.. until it's low enough for it to be affordable.
---
Supply, demand and average gold in circulation drives prices up or down, not retail or private server mentality.
---
Which also drop lots of wool.
---
As a caster main (warlock) I always enjoyed a light well. Cant really expect a tank or melee dps to hit it, but ranged classes that are in trouble find it helpful.
---
What are you doing bringing your retail philosophies here? There is not one spec in Vanilla that is useless.
---
That's my point, even at launch its wouldn't super good, because there are other BiS items and the upgrade price is a bit crazy.
---
The dungeon sets has so much wasted potential, it saddens me to make the same mistake again, for nostalgia sake.
---
Yes. In fact there are whole servers dedicated to pvp. Your starting zones are protected, so you aren't flagged for PvP (no one can hurt you).
---
Around level 17-24 you'll enter your first contested zone. Everyone here is flagged for PvP. They can hit you and you can hit them.
---
Beyond that there are battlegrounds, which are a more coordinated PvP objective based game.
---
Not worth it. It does comparable dps to DS/ruin but as you get more and more gear with crit on it the spec lags behind. In vanilla dots can't crit meaning a big portion of your stats is useless. Also dots don't have a lot of +damage scaling. Prior to tbc blizzard was afraid dots would be too OP in pvp so they purposefully made them weaker than hard-casted spells. When tbc pre-patch went live they buffed the damage scaling on all dots across the board by about 30%.
---
Spoken like someone who didn’t experience a fresh realm launch during vanilla. 1-10 will be a pain. 
---
That being said, the only way to effectively get ahead of the pack without luck (managing to be one of the first who can log in/landing on an empty layer) is to forgo sleep
---
Short answer: Yes.
---
Long answer: It's free up to L20, go try it. It'll only take you a couple of hours to hit that.
---
Enhance Shaman!!!
---
Almost? it was the main mechanic of the fight mate :) Razuvious would one-shot any tank in seconds, MC'ed adds tanking him was the only option.

They were basically forced due to the incentives. You felt really stupid if you didn't take advantage of them.
---
Our guild won't fit you, but i wish you luck in your search. However i wanted to let you know something - just to make sure you're aware - rolling a shaman in classic means either PVPing as Enhance/resto or PVE as pure resto. There are no enhance/elemental shamans in pve. So just make sure you know that when deciding on your class :P
---
Good luck!
---
Yeh, that in it self will stop many people from ever considering it. Which is a shame, because it is very cool and the sets looks awesome.
---
&gt; But but please dont tell me summon stones are not a vanilla thing
---
You need a warlock in your group to summon a person. 
---
"Summoning Stones" were near the entrance of a dungeon but you couldn't summon a person with that stone. It opend a shitty LFG chat window. I'm not sure if they are called "Summoning Stones" in vanilla. I called them just ... stones
---
If you can't tell the difference between the ips and the TN unless they're next to each you must have it set up wrong or an awful ips. 
---
Link me the ips with the same specs if you can please dude I'm really interested to see this.
---
All specs are viable, its only what you like to play, yeah its hard to find spot with some specs in raids but its playable, with good people, nice guild, i think you will have spot with every class you play, ofx if you play it good 😊
---
What you expect:
---
Carefully tailred mix of armor reductions, curses, demo should etc
---
What you will actually see:
---
8 slots taken by deep wounds
---
Lol its trash half the raid was afk.....
---
I ran a Darkmantle xmog on my Brewmaster Monk for several expansions. I never could complete it on my Rogue in vanilla though 😂
---
How dare you believe enhance shaman too be weak. Those 2 hander windfury procs are the dream.
---
Still not TBC dual wield levels though. 
---
THE BURNING CRUSADE #NOCHANGES
---
Yes but that's completely separate from Classic. That said I think my Classic only installation is currently sitting at 8GB or something.
---
As a rogue... Fuck them. If the tank might die then I sprint and vanish. The rest don't matter.
---
Mindflay takes up a debuff slot as well. Plus you can't move.
---
Much easier to just have your shadow weaving priest spam SWP until the shadow weaving sticks, then refresh it between heals.
---
This is not a discussion of viability, just wanting to hear from those who will be playing the spec that min/max hardcore players deem unworthy.
---
&gt; warlock
---
As a Warlock you can summon a Infernal in the auction house, and release it. It will go on a rampage and kill all the level 1 bank alts.
---
Also fucking DEMONS and shit are awesome.
---
....
---
Black lotus is BOP
---
If you are quite efficient, you could aim for a 2- mob kill per minute, making it:
---
16,330/2 = 8165 mobs every minute
---
-
---
8165/60 = 136 hours of farming
---
136/24 = 5 days and 16 hours played to lvl 60.
---
Grinding for 5 days and 16 hours = A traumatic experience and an immediate hospitalizations at a mental facility.
---
HAHAHAHAH yes we classic Players good everyone else bad hahahaha this bich got pwned omegalul kappa
---
I had legion installed, when i installed beta into that folder, it took \~4.5-5GB or something like that. If i had installed into another folder it would have been about 9.5GB. I did test that out by changing the folders.
---
I did it on my mage, but it was so late in vanilla it felt like a stupid side mission, that had no real impact or purpose. I got gear from so many raids, before the dungeon set even came around.
---
Such a shame, because the sets are great and amazing raid entry items.
---
The murlocs on darkshore hurt me :(
---
They are not. I mained lock, I should know.
---
"I don't have time for this I'll just play retail"
---
Goodbye! We didn't want you in classic anyway.
---
SEEYA
---
I will miss my felguard in classic...
---
Frustrated, degraded, down before you're done
---
Rejection, depression, can't get what you want
---
You ask me how I make my way
---
You ask me everywhere and why
---
You hang on every word I say
---
But the truth sounds like a lie
---
Live to win, 'till you die, 'till the light dies in your eyes
---
Live to win, take it all, just keep fighting till you fall
---
Obsessive, compulsive, suffocate your mind
---
Confusion, delusions, kill your dreams in time
---
You ask me how I took the pain
---
Crawled up from my lowest low
---
Step by step and day by day
---
'Till there's one last breath to go
---
Day by day, kickin' all the way, I'm not cavin' in
---
Let another round begin, live to win
---
Yeah, live, yeah, win
---
Live to win
---
IM ONLY FIGHTING THIS HARD BECAUSE I WANT IT TO ENNNDDDDDD
---
I was super young when me and my friend used to play. I remember my friend showing me a video of a Tauren going straight from the starting area to a wall, and then jumping into the wall and becoming level 60 instantly.
---
I was an idiot and we spent hours jumping against a wall trying to find the right spot. Didn’t realize it was fake until recently since I stopped playing so long ago.

On a more serious note. The reason the kobolds are desperate for candles is because they are afraid of the old god minions in the underground darkness.
---
Natural selection at its finest. Good job ooga gang!
---
Tanking is not that stressful. Remember it's never the tanks fault just blame everyone else .
---
Ooga gang doing god's work.
---
I've seen rage quits before. Everyone has. But I think this is the first time someone tap out to go play essentially an easier version of the game.
---
THIS IS BULLSHIT. FUCK BOWLING THE GUTTERS ARE TOO WIDE. I'M JUST GONNA GO PLAY BUMPER BOWLING.
---
^^^tilted?
---
Theres always BfA for the bad, the weak, for those that crave no challenge.
---
What a waste of a beta key.
---
Actually I played a couple of hours like this by using chrome remote desktop + custom interface.  Quite awful experience. Still good enough for farming mobs.
---
Imp scorch/winters chill
---
Please don't. It's already ruined as it is...
---
Basically along those lines. Not copy and just shove into classic but take the concepts and rework it to fit into classic.
---
Keeping the Classic world but adding stuff into that world rather than moving on from it.
---
Something along those lines
---
Now that was mature
---
I've 100% fished in fishing pools.
---
Undead lock &gt; Orc hunter, but I'm stopping here. Good for pvp, good enough for pve and superb for farming/leveling.
---
The overwhelming majority of tanks suck ass so don't worry most people are used to playing with retard tanks
---
I joined Incoming rather late in the day.  They had BWL on farm and progressing through AQ40.  Was there for first horde kill of Twin Emps though! was good times - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmaN0mi8TFg
---
Well, if your gear is WORSE than t0.5, you are not going to be doing AQ40 and getting them BIS items.
---
What. If the market decides a stack of copper is 20g then that is the fair price of copper. You are not the god of deciding what is a ‘fair’ price.
---
Southwind Breeze is a Classic Alliance guild focusing on a casual timetable with hardcore results.    
---
We want to build a community that can enjoy the game without the constraints of a traditional guild. By keeping the quality of player high we hope to make a home for all those who still want to experience all of classic on a real life timetable.  
---
So far we are majority of Liverpool &amp; Newcastle lads. Anyone's welcome and we encourage groups of friends to apply as one. 
---
Info at a glance:
---
* EU PVP Server
---
* UK evenings for Raids / Events.
---
* 2days raiding once the launch hype settles down.
---
* We are looking for people to have a laugh with and experience all of the game, that means laid back, fun to play with, but also fun to work with. 
---
* We Intend to keep the riffraff out, part of that is advertising before the game is released on not relying on general chat spam.
---
* UK Core of very strong players which we hope to expand. 
---
* Strong players does not mean a power leveler. If we have some members who we know to be good people but take months to get to 60 that's not an issue. There will a lot of great players who will take their time and we would love for them to be able to use the guild though all levels.
---
Who we are and our vision can be found in better detail on our website, please check it out. I wrote this post with my boss hanging over my shoulder in under a minute, the website is more thought out!

Did I make this post in my sleep?
---
Mind blast has a cooldown so once 5 stacks of shadow weaving are up  it can probably be used to refresh it. Getting up 5 stacks just with mind blast is probably too slow. Also if it resists SWP needs to be used and might mess up the debuffs if not planned for.
---
Because no one will have any money to buy it and if it doesn't sell, you lose your AH deposit. 
---
The low level stuff will start to sell better as the phases progress and people have gold to power level, but at the beginning, most people will be saving for L40 mounts.
---
\&gt;  I don't think it will really be used as nobody wants to spam /sit during leveling but who knows. 
---
Don't underestimate the power of autistic neckbeards.

She went and did a dungeon then came back after the guy that killed her left, why is that grounds for removing her beta, do you think Blizzard is going to give it to you?

For any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to message me here or on discord. (tom#8446)
---
The irony of this is Druids are probably the one Hybrid class with a popular build that lets them do just that.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxoxscrdxVxf0xo
---
Really? I felt pvp-wise warlock and druid, hot/dot classes were really so OP.
---
That's true. makes it all the more serious this constant kobold-bashing.
---
how much are you paying for her feet pics?
---
I guess unpopular opinion, but in WotLK you could achieve almost everything without doing daily quests, and they were in fact optimal.
---
&gt;"viable"
---
The word you're looking for is optimal.
---
Unless your tank is a Pally, shaman, or pet. You can pre shield them.
---
Yeah, after months of thought, looking at tier sets, looking at bis, changing my mind 8 times, watching pvp videos, reading class guides and browsing this sub I have come to the conclusion that I Just kinda like Druid more than the other classes.   
---
Predictably Druid was my very first thought on hearing about classic, so I just spent months arguing with myself only to come to the conclusion that I was right all along. \*This happens every time.\*
---
This feels familiar. My first char was an nelf rogue, and I had only picked rogue because a friend at the time picked a rogue as well. I didn’t know that the humans (I think my friend said he was human) were in another area, and I didn’t know how far away i was. But I did get a scale of how big the world is, just zooming out and out and out on the map. Was insane to me. I got to like level 4 and ran all the way to Darnassus, through the Bear tree and saw a boat pull up. I got on and arrived at Darkshore and that’s when I saw my first high level dwarf. I was so overwhelmed! I realized how far it would be so I rerolled a human rogue. We played together and he quit at like level 13 so I was alone for quite a while. I remember playing in the Northshire vineyards and saw my first level 60, was a gnome lock with a giant felguard, was so insane and I had no idea what I was looking at.
---
Yes and no. Arena and RBGs didnt come until the burning crusade expansion. Classic pvp is open world pvp, duels and battlegrounds with no elo/rating system.
---
The whole point of playing a hybrid is that you make a hybrid spec so you don't *need* to respec. Otherwise you're not  a hybrid, you're just respeccing to a different play style.
---
Everyone watching her stream is pathetic, and is definately not wafching for quality content.
---
Would apply but your raid times are simply too late in the evening. 00:30 Server time is 00:30 real time for me, which wont work for me as I work full time standard office hours (and for others too i would presume) so if you'd by any chance change your raid time to start around 20:00 server time and end 23 server time hit me up.
---
The thing about balance druids are that they run out of mana in less than 30 seconds (not accounting for pots/innervate/dark runes) and have no way of getting it back. Bosses have high nature resist and pretty much 50% of bosses in vanilla are totally immune, there's no curse for increasing your damage, you can't put any debufs on bosses which means you can only spam down-ranked wrath/starfire. Even if you manage to make it work you will still do less damage than a tank.
---
That along with people just flying right over you or being afk while flying
---
This is the dumbest sixth grade logic I've ever seen.
---
A few memories from classic Wow:
---
1) I made a night-elf alt, and found a spot I could jump off the world tree. It's a LOOOOOOOONG way down.
---
2) I had an idea that cross-faction trading would be mega-profitable, so I took a level 10 alliance player to Gagetzan by dieing a thousand deaths. And didn't come back until I was level 50. 
---
3) Probably closest in spirit to your question: I was exploring Ashenvale, and found a road going north. I sauntered in, and right away a ??? bear started chasing me. I was torn between trying to find a map point to at least have a bit explored, and trying to stay alive. I wound up doing neither.
---
Go feral and farm a couple of 50% buffspeed hammers from Gnomeregan and go bonkers at any bossfights, never telling anyone your secret. It sure adds some layer of farming, but it's worth it.
---
Ah, that's true. So much PvP in the beginning :D you just reminded me of that, good memories actually.
---
Gold sinks in an mmorpg is what leads to a healthier economy and an overall better game that requires decision making.
---
Yeah you're right, this is probably what I'll end up doing. Although if I was to take tailoring I was considering using it while I level to pick up some decent bits of leveling gear too? Not sure on what is worth crafting for lvlers though. 
---
Not planning on rushing through the leveling experience so I don't mind taking the time to work on a crafting profession along the way.
---
Thanks! Yeah, I know. I raided as a resto shaman and I enjoy classic totems which I had a chance to experience in WotLK so being a chain healer + WF buff machine is alright :)
---
Yes, you dont need to be full resto to heal a dungeon or full feral to be able to dps. That is the whole idea of a hybrid, switching gearsets can do the trick.
---
God. I think the mechanism that is vanilla which filters out these sort of players is it's single greatest quality. Can't wait.
---
14 years later, i have found another like me...
---
Holy shit
---
THIS IS BULLSHIT. FUCK BOWLING THE GUTTERS ARE TOO WIDE. I'M JUST GONNA GO PLAY BUMPER BOWLING. tilted?
---
**__&lt;Light's Hope Survivors&gt;__**  ll  **:horde: – :NA: – PvP**  ll  Loot Council for BiS + DKP
---
**🕗 Raid Times:**
---
Tues &amp; Thurs 8–11 EST, Optional Monday for progression
---
Our goal is to be competitive in raiding as well as battleground and world pvp. To foster healthy competition, players that go the extra mile with regards to performance get rewarded with BiS items via Loot Council Lists, DKP for other items. 
---
We tuned our methods on pservers and bring that experience to the table for Classic's release. We plan on being active in wPvP and with world bosses, and expect to join Horde coalitions and partner with like-minded guilds on our server to that end, as well as forming premades for BG in the latter phases. We strive for success in PvE as well as PvP, but having a good time is of equal priority. Lok'tar Ogar, For the Horde
---
**Our Experience:**
---
Our core played together on a pserver as a second raid group for our parent guild before F R E S H happened and the war of attrition became too much. As a guild we went 8/9 AQ, Separately, We have 15/15 Naxx experience.
---
**Expectations:**
---
Members must be ready to excel in a competitive environment.  This means they will bring all required consumables and world buffs, and perform competently each raid. New classic players are welcome as long as they are willing and able to learn at a reasonable pace.  We strongly encourage PVP participation for both the gear and teambuilding, but it is not required.    
---
__Exceptional players are always considered__ 
---
 Right now we are looking for:
---
-&gt; Shaman heals
---
-&gt; Druid heals
---
-&gt; Rogue 
---
-&gt; Mage

---
Class and profession stacking of super hardcore guilds is not something to consider if you aren't in one. Also picking professions focused around one spot and narrow set of resources is also limiting or boring.
---
Right now i'm gathering mats for T3 tokens turn ins and for that I make a lot of various potions, no flasks aside one 30g contract to go and craft titans for one person. 
---
Also BoP lotus was confirmed? If not it will be 1.12 just like fishing is.
---
Yeah.. uhm, not sure if you realised it yet. But it was designed like this because they intended for you to be able to pick one, and maybe change now and again.
---
Not switch specs every week..
---
Iktf. Dps warr is something I'm considering after my inevitable NE hunter. After.
---
&gt;is it really that easy?
---
it has an easier and more forgiving access, and the overall experience is way more casual.  
---
However, if you are looking for serious PvE challenges the top difficulty of retail raids are way way more difficult than anything Classic had and will have to offer.
---
Nah just 2% spell crit.
---
Are you ok?
---
HAhAA this is the perfect filter to weed out these weak players
---
You are wrong. Use your common sense, Kid.
---
You could have just posted the link you know
---
Its the best for Warlocks since they scale the best with gear. But its an reward for having done all content so its not "Needed". But still my guess is Lock &gt; Mage.
---
Was Horde on Khadgar at the same period, was a very noticeable alliance to horde ratio. Also playing Aussie times on a us server didn’t help me either.
---
Kid, you can get Raidspots as a fucking Survival Hunter in Classic. /facepalm
---
Play fury warrior, forget the thunderfury though. I wanted to tank, but I am no longer 20 and have a full time job already. :(
---
You forgot improved shadowbolt debuff 20% dps increase for the warlocks pretty important.
---
There's no internal cooldown on Windfury. But it can't proc itself.
---
we classic players strongest players... other players BAD stupid players worst players.... classic world of warcraft is the single most hardening experience of a mans life.....
---
Once you are very knowledgeable and confident ego is a natural development of tanks. It's not a bad thing, but you will always need to check yourself and make sure you are actually as good as you think you are.
---
How bad are the ones you're removing? Because the ones you let through are mostly horrible.
---
I know this is joke, but the male nightelf model is ugly af. It resembles nothing how NEs were displayed in Warcraft 3. So i chose a female NE hunter back then.
---
Didnt say I was nor did I give an example of a fair price. I gave an example of an unfair price (by classic standards) because I believe that the younger more impatient crowd that swarms too classic and no-lifes the game will jack up their prices to something ridiculous. They will be the richest players strictly from having more time to farm than those of us who are older with more responsibilities. 
---
They will set absurd prices and someone will be impatient enough to buy it at that price.
---
lmfao
---
She looks like someone who thinks that 1+1 = 11 and won't back down from it cause in her tiny universe it all makes sense. No idea who dat is. Just judging by that clip.
---
cant wait to gank this bitch
---
Its like natural selection, bye bitch!
---
RuneScape says hi with regards to grinding for days.
---
Classic wow is still quite tame considered against a lot of other games.
---
No. You don't need anything for it to work. Just go on your computer or phone and pay the monthly 10 to access the full library of games. If you want to do it on your TV you need the controller and chromecast which is 130.
---
Oh shit that sounds good. Thought the 130 was for the program. Thanks a bunch
---
I'm one of those people that needs to get a main to 60 before I feel like I'm playing the game, and I'm in the same boat. I think alot of people are in the "I've narrowed it down to X, Y, or Z and I just can't make up my mind" faction. The way I figure it we will have the Name Reservation time to solidify server choices and faction choices with friends, and then it will come time to wait the last couple days until Launch Day.
---
I think it's vital for me, and anyone reading this like me, to make a firm decision to stick with their choice. Whether it's finally settling on a class, or rolling dice or flipping a coin, once you've completed that first quest on your chosen class it has to become your main. In that very moment, you are no longer deciding. You are decided.
---
Or you can spend the next 3 years in Alt Hell. Either way have fun.
---
Haha I know that more than well, warlock was the only class I played back in the actual vanilla.
---
I've been DK main since Wotlk, but I'm warlock in my heart. I guess I like those badass looking classes. 
---
I'm just thinking about the other classes too, to try something else. Who knows if I won't go with warlock in the end tho, it's nice to play something you know and remember.
---
The peak of enhancement shaman pvp in WoW. The shaman review in vanilla destroyed the spec, and it's never been very good since.
---
There are many achievments you can go for there just isn't an achievment tab telling you wich.
---
No idea who this is and it's such a short (probably out of context) clip. Presumably she's getting camped and got frustrated. This sub is so damn toxic, what is she supposed to do?
---
i'd play it
---
For hunter herb/alch is an option for easy pve consumes. Eng gives you great ammo though as well as things like seaforium and jumper cables so it's hard to argue against it.
---
Skinning/LW is good for devilsaur set, that's it.
---
Still salt bud, we don't want those kind of people playing classic.
---
People have turned down game difficulties before...
---
Go to the doctor for more pills.
---
To me that sounds kind of dumb. Would be cool to play on the phone for a bit while still leveling my character up. But if it's against TOS it's against TOS
---
extraordinary

While you're never topping the DPS meters I very much doubt you are doing less DPS than a tank. Most boomkin content creators state you will be middling in the DPS tables when you are at peak performance which doesn't sound great but you can bring other things to the table to make yourself viable. While I doubt you would ever get any spaces in a hardcore raiding group I'm sure lots of casual groups are open to boomkins which is sort of what I'm aiming for. 
---
So in summary, yes you are right that on paper they aren't really great compared to other classes. But the impact of a boomkin on a raid group has been incredibly exaggerated, and I'm sure most raid teams can get on just fine with a few of them in their group. And they wont even be dragging the raid down :D At the end of the day it comes down to how much fun you have, I can always roll a rogue alt or something if I want to be a DPS master.
---
Don't even watch this stream, but I didn't know pointing out something obvious riles up the boomer spergs
---
Given the fact it's a somewhat rare zone BoE, an hour farming to get it is quite lucky as is!
---
Barman Shanker debuff
---
Is this that new Diablo immortal game?
---
Yeah, I just saw esfand spamming it on his paladin while tanking for threat, so, you might be right.
---
Don't catch you slipping up
---
I'm remember her whining in Asmongold's stream that she didn't have a beta invite.
---
I mean you're gonna get the usual full green nonset of silk/wool/linen etc for your extra int with tailor, but there is no +nature/arcane dmg gear in there at all.
---
And +anyspell dmg comes at around lvl 40 with mageweave.
---
Skilling tailor, is one of the easiest professions to skill up due to the sheer amount of cloth you get from grinding humans.
---
People got banned for using Nvidias cloud gaming service. 
---
A few of current concers:
---
Your credentials are used/stored in the cloud, geolocking is no longer very reliable.
---
It makes it easier/cheaper to bot.
---
My bad, never been much of a rbg player.
---
Classic wow won't be for everyone and that's fine. Some people will have to learn that the hard way. No need to flame someone and revoke beta access over that. This sub reddit sometimes...
---
"LF HEALER FOR HOGGER. PAYING 5G PER RES"
---
First of all there's a delay. Second of all the quality usually varies over time, you're not seeing 1080p. Third is that twitch is one way streaming. With game streaming the server sends you image and audio data and you send back controller input in real time. It's two way.

I didn't know bird's played wow ... :P

You were this close to perfection blizzard this close 👌
---
No, but this is legally different. When you watch a movie, you don't have a license to that movie, you only have a permission to screen it for yourself. When you buy a game, you buy a license to that software, Google only provides hardware for you to run that license.
---
This post doesn't deserve to get down voted
---
Altho dm it is
---
i would play classic on my ipad/iphone, i prefer it than sitting in front of a PC for hours
---
typical streamer who never played a hard game in her life.
---
did you gather a lot of /crys?
---
You're*
---
Either farm to fund your constant and unnecessary respecs or don't respec all this time. People managed just fine during Vanilla and people will be just fine during Classic.
---
The first day will be nuts, and depending on login queue times it might or might not be interesting/fun to play with hundreds of others in the starting zones.
---
&gt; Class and profession stacking of super hardcore guilds is not something to consider if you aren't in one.
---
Aka, i need to consider it. T3 tokens in classic is like 1.5 years after launch. The mat requirements arent even that high. Something like 1000g total ? Or one L35 alt and 2months of CD's with it.
---
I appreciate that he stunned her, did a lot of damage but then let the mobs finisher her off so she takes durability damage. Its the little things.
---
Also the OogaBooga gang gives me hope for Classic.
---
Im just sad that guns aren't close to top tier and a dwarf with a bow feels weird.
---
I tried it out and rolled a priest, Smite gives an absorption effect now so you can literally spam Smite against elite mobs and never die. Shit was boring as fuck.
---
Yeah, well we won't see these type of players there for sure, leveling to 10 takes too much time. No instant gratification for these idiots.
---
Don’t forget the circlejerk that is retail bad,, classic good
---
You dont know about hit cap. I wont hold my breath waiting for you to tell us how to tank as a hunter :D

Blizzard don't develop add-ons

Did you say leather belt? [Level 18?](https://youtu.be/bIVTT4fgPQI)
---
Could you do priest T2 and mage T3? I Love those Sets!
---
It is in closed beta. You cannot play it without an invite.
---
Release is at the end of August.
---
It's not out until late August. In closed beta now.
---
Gotcha, thanks!
---
This game is in closed beta at the moment, you can opt in for a chance to join the beta pool in your bnet account settings.
---
The game has release date set to 27. August 2019.
---
cccccya scrub
---
Not classic because my first real raid experience started in tbc. I was playing furry warior and I got no idea what rotations, hit cap etc. Was. So I got a guild and went to kara with them. I was bottom of dps all the time. One mage left and we got a hunter. Guild leader was complaining about how bad my dps was and asked what rotation I use. I answered: dafuq is a rotation and he should stop complaining because my dmg was infront of the hunter (hunter joined 5 mins ago and I didn‘t clear my dps meter). Needless to say I got kicked from raid and the guild.
---
Blizz probably gave it to her as a social experiment, now they know Retail streamers think they do but they don't. She gon get OOK OOK'd in Classic if she decides to play.
---
Being ganked in vanilla is one of the best reasons to get lvls and get better gear - basically it pushes you to play more and be better because leveling is slower and harder and more dangerous.
---
Retail basically created "Safe space" = It's ok baby! (player) you don't need to risk going into that dangerous world! you can just sit in your nice city, queue for dungeons and get loot :) and everything will be fine ! Oh you got ganked by someone ? Not to worry we will decrease XP needed and make herilooms and make everything faster! So that does not happen to you again!!!
---
This clip is very interesting because it shows this perfectly, she instead of confronting this problem by (Changing zone, asking /1 general chat for help, inviting friends to help, going to dungeon to lvl etc.) at least doing anything to solve this, nope she just goes to safe zone AKA retail...
---
Kevin jordan confirmed dynamic respawns were a thing in vanilla
---
23×60 isn't enough for it. So 24 would be correct.
---
Mindblast and down ranked mindflay. Sw:p ticks don't refresh the debuff.

You can see his imp too

NO ! Don't give them ideas !

1300 here with ah prices.

My twink will be a survival hunter because later in classic they became good because of the agility boost

this is super cool 😎

Flip flopping between dwarf and gnome rogue myself.

I remember being like 12 years old, making my way to Ironforge as a Gnome mage and being completely baffled by how massive and grand the city was. Then shortly after I realized there was a world map at which point I knew I wanted to explore them all :)

TL;DR:
---
* Intended region - EU
---
* Intended server type - TBD
---
* Intended faction - Alliance
---
* Intended raid/play times - TBD
---
* Any priority you may have in a guild - Raiding and Social Experience. 
---
* Any pertinent rules - Fluent in Norwegian, 18+ years old
---
* A preferred form of contact - Discord: https://discord.gg/MkFa4rW
---
Hello! 
---
Like a lot of people, we’re super hyped for Classic and thought it’d be a good idea to have a guild ready before release. The goal is to have a place where Norwegians can find other Norwegians to level with from day 1, eventually progressing through dungeons and raids together. If we can gather enough active players ready for release, the plan is to compete for server firsts! If you’re looking for a new guild without an existing power structure consisting of friends who’ve known each other for over 10 years, where everyone starts as equals at release then this is the guild for you.
---
There are no strict conditions that need to be met in order to join, at least not yet. And to begin with, everyone will be able to invite their friends. The most important aspect of WoW is the social one, and that’s why this guild exists! The only rules are:
---
* Speak Norwegian fluently
---
* Be 18+ years old
---
When August 27th get close, we’ll make a plan of how we would like to approach the game as a guild. Things like which server to play on, how hardcore we’d like to be, raiding schedule, how to distribute loot, etc. 
---
If you played during vanilla and/or really know what you’re doing and would like to take on some extra responsibility, PM me on discord. We’re looking for officers.

hows the damage in pvp? i know immo trap does some nice damage with melee even though it doesnt scale
---
Just doesn't make any sense. If you put copper for 20g on the AH, people look at it and think "Wow, either this is an amazing way to make money, or he's scamming me." In either case, the correct response is to go and mine yourself and thus the copper remains unpurchased and this leads to the price to drop. 20g is 20g homie, can't spend that on copper in vanilla.
---
Deep Wounds is a low priority debuff, every single DPS warrior will use it, and no it won't knock off anything important. Clearly no idea what you're talking about. Rend however.. no one should use it.
---
I think I might have needed to include the sarcasm disclaimer.
---
Alexensuals crusade against streamers seem to be very successful indeed, he has managed to manipulate a large group of people into blindly hating streamers. The irony is that he himself is a streamer but for some reason that doesn't count.
---
I was talking about the 8 steps each level. 8,16,24,32,40 etc. would be more logical (:
---
Jesus the "stop spreading false information!" Seems like an attack. I didn't know I watch one video on it and was confused ;-; sorry. But thanks. Didn't know this. Good to know now :)
---
My first character was a human mage in February 2005. I wandered out of the starting zone and was getting destroyed by level 5 wolves for about an hour until someone guided me back into the starting zone.
---
Thanks for sharing all this. Sounds exactly like I remember it. Can't wait for August 27th.
---
Well I think you've convinced me! I'm going to roll tailor/Herb :)
---
I actually really wouldn't mind if this exists as long as the pc version is still their main focus. I love that OSRS has a mobile version for when you want to cut some wood while havin' a good ol' shit.
---
There will be market manipulation because it an easy way to make gold with the flawed AH implementation. However it will happen with rarer goods and not with copper because maintaining an artifically high price with such a common item will not be possible over the long term. You can beat market manipulation but it will require some patience and pricing knowledge.
---
It only happens **once**. If you can be there, don't miss it. Even if you're leveling incredibly slowly, you're part of the first wave, you'll never be able to replicate that again (excluding new servers but who cares).
---
It's the same with every sub.  I find more meaningful discussion in the top comment and the bottom comment then every single one in between.
---
You assume that means they will be prot. The majority will be dps'ing.
---
Got WoW at the end of my freshman year of high school, played all summer. My first memory was making an orc warlock and chatting with a buddy from school on that old x-something chat client. Then I rerolled a shitload until I settled on a human warrior.
---
Why is it dumb?
---
If you stand still and says "okay, what are the odds that I will make 7 flips, starting from this next jump", then the odds are 5^7.
---
If you jump around untill you make a flip, and THEN go "okay, what are the odds that I can make 6 more for 7 in total", then the odds are 5^6.
---
It's not a hard concept.
---
i personally am gonna wait a bit to even attempt to play, there’s gonna be multi hour queues and probably a few million people logging in in the first week
---
I really didn't get what it was. Watched one video on it and it seemed hard to believe. That's all. If it's really as smooth as they showed off on the stage then I'll try it out.
---
Please no
---
Makes sense. Thanks
---
Because I was 11 in 2005, the earliest and most detailed memory is laying siege to Dun Modr with two humans "white heart and purpleheart" as a drawf hunter named "snow ranger"
---
I think it has been posted before, but it is such an amazing trailer so I don't care.
---
nice yeah Played with the BG Death Dealers

Monday 26 to Thusday 27 august at 0:00.

Some douche "influencer". If you have the mentality of a 12 year old or the intelligence of a goldfish he is appealing...
---
That was my first gearing guide. It's up on my blog and YouTube channel ;)
---
Though since I was just starting out, there were a few minor issues with some of the details, it's still mostly accurate. ;)
---
Maybe Asmongoloid and his army of Asmongoloids will get their own server, who knows.
---
Aww, he sounds like a really nice guy. Glad to hear that!
---
Took me a few seconds. I first thought he was in bath or smth.
---
Classic is a challenge?
---
Ooga gang were the absolute highlight of this beta period.
---
Believe it or not, Most people don't need streamers to tell them what to think about streamers.
---
OOGA GANG
---
Hi, /u/antelic
---
It became tradeable in later patches.
---
Unfortunately the reason we picked our raiding times was specifically because majority of us cannot make it to raid earlier due to work etc. 
---
There will be plenty of guilds offering raid start at 19:00 server time (which is the "standard" usually), we offer a place to those for who that's a bit too early.
---
Wish you best of luck though!
---
&gt;Clear raid each week and you're done 
---
I think you are confusing BfA with Classic. First, there is more than one raid in Classic (at some point there will be 7) and except AQ20, all the other 6 will be ran on a weekly basis. Even casual guilds will still run Ony, MC, ZG, BWL and AQ20 for a LONG TIME. In BfA there is ONE raid : the one that comes with the newest patch.
---
Except mythic, clearing LFR, normal and heroic is easy peasy, can be done in PuGs, and no consumables are needed. You can wipe 1,000 times and repair 50 times in one day...gold is IRRELEVANT in BfA.
---
In Classic, you will still run 5 men dungeons until the game dies. For PLENTY of reasons. You will farm gold on a daily basis, if you want to raid.
---
You will help guild members alts gearing up in MC and Ony...which you will STILL run every single week, even if you are farming Naxx.
---
If you think that in Classic you could just raid log...no wonder you don't know shit about Vanilla, hence, your reply is absolutely stupid. Ignorance is one thing...but I thought people today are more informed. So, being ignorant willingly IS stupidity.
---
Great ! ... thanks for sharing this with us :) ... very realistic and positive opinion ... and this is a reason why I come to this group and I believe there are more people like this who wants to just play this great game and enjoy it ! :)
---
Well if you choose to run Strat, that's definitely something to pick up. The idea for this guide is to get geared as efficiently as possible (meaning most good items in the least number of dungeons possible).
---
Yep :P Actually this reminds me, in between queues I'd be in Silithus PvPing and trying to find 1v2 1v3 situations just for fun (and farming HK's in the process). Poor Alliance players haha. It sounds very over-the-top-hardcore but it was a lot of fun to have your mind set to a goal and really go all out on it. Plus the comradery of your premade team, whom you spend every single day with in ventrillo, and just the fact that you're really on top of your game because you're PvPing all day long every day, made it a tremendously enjoyable time. But yeah, no wife or children allowed :P
---
and she got beta access ...... yay blizz !
---
Now Kith
---
can't wait to have my "gone fishin" chat tab with like whispers n loot only
---
I understand that not doing them feels less optimal and this you felt compelled to do them, but that’s not the quests fault. You didn’t have to feel like you had to play optimally. 
---
Play to have fun. If you want to pvp or help a friend through that dungeon go do it. 
---
There are a ton of content systems and features constantly being added every expansion to engage end game players and give them something to do. If you don’t like them and prefer to do other things in the game, then do those other things. 
---
Daily quests, dungeon finder, raid finder, scenarios, pet battles, garrisons, world quests, warfronts, island expeditions, and on and on. If you don’t like those, you don’t have to do any of them. There still a lot of game out there. Those additional things are for people who do like them. 
---
I get that there is a feeling that by not doing those things you’d be behind or playing less optimally, but this whole subreddit has been about play what you want and how you want. That’s why I’m still having fun in retail, because when the new stuff got unfun, I played the things I want.
---
Sure there are some game design aspects that are worse than other in every expansion, but the game is still out there with loads of other fun things to do.
---
This comment reads like a clickbait article but I love it.
---
I had a friend who used to go through the auction house and buy out all the 30silver stacks on linen cloth.
---
One day he accidentally bought a stack that was listed for like 1000g and lost all his savings.
---
the classic move :)
---
I was 11 or 12 years old and playing with my little cousin (in RL). I ran away from him and unintentionally I smacked a door in his face. Ofc he was crying out loud and felt so bad because of this. My uncle came to me and told me:  "Do not worry, just be careful. That happens when a lvl 13 warrior is fighting against a lvl 1 cousin." No idea why but this experience burned into my memorie. Ofc he is fine it wasn't a bad accident.
---
The real sad part is knowing that people actually watch her
---
They won’t be like the retail ones either
---
yea there is  
---
because it works

**&lt;Informal&gt; [NA][A][PvE][Semi-Hardcore]  MORNING EST**
---
**INTRO:**This is a brand new Semi-Hardcore guild being made from the ground up. I am looking for dedicated people who want to get in and clear content. New or old, If you are dedicated, I want you on the team.
---
**GOAL:**
---
-week 2 or 3 MC clear
---
-Clear all content quickly and efficiently
---
(example: phase 1 should be 1 raid night, except for off day ONY)
---
-Clear Naxx, full T3 guild before BC release
---
**EXPECTATIONS:** I value maturity and honesty above all else when it comes to my members. I expect everyone to set an example for our server on how quality players should behave. I want everyone on and ready 15 minutes before raid begins. During progression I expect full consumables to help us get the kills we need. 
---
**LOOT:** Council and roll decay. Some loot is too important to be simply bought or rolled for. Others are not so much. So we will be using a mix of these 2 systems.
---
**SCHEDULE:**
---
RAID TIMES - EST, MORNING
---
7:00-10:00 AM EST
---

20g for copper is a bad example I admit. I wasn't trying to specify this exactly, I was just giving an example of an item clearly not worth much but being jacked up to an absurd price.
---
o.0 So weird. I'd imagine more people do this than turning the difficulty up especially if they're rage quitting.
---
Lmao /sit levelling is slower than normal levelling ya know nothing noob.
---
will you be playing on a pvp server? :)
---
Horde Defias Brotherhood here until TBC. The main draw was the single-race guilds that made an unofficial alliance called the Covenant. I remember PvP-oriented events being frequent, and were the main draw for me - a few in-character warcries and then steamrolling through Ashenvale/STV/Hillsbrad etc. Orcs of the Red Blade, Second Gurubashi Empire, The Old Lordaeron, Mistrunner Tribe were the main four I remember.
---
Also shoutout to Sixty Thieves who were a 90%+ rogue guild who regularly tried to mug me in the Drag, and Burning Dawn who were the progression guild folks raided with sometimes.
---
You can already try game streaming from the cloud today (since 2018 actually), with Geforce Now, Shadow or Parsec - there is a latency/delay there, which greatly depends on how good an internet connection you have. For the majority of players, the delay will not be perceptible or bothering --- this, as it is whit these existing services. On top of this, the future Stadia service from Google promises even lower latency, by using their advances in reducing the lag (both input lag, video encoding lag and internet packet delivery lag) and coupled with using Google's unrivaled physical infrastructure, it truly has the potential to one-up the existing cloud gaming services. There's already - as it is - many people that have abandoned their gaming computers and are gaming purely with Shadow streaming service - there are a ton of youtube videos of people playing any kind of game through Shadow streaming - yes, it's not something competitive for the pros who must play at 144 fps, but for the normal gamer it's already 'good enough' as to not be a problem.
---
What discord?
---
You can try it on a private server. Look on the r/wowservers sub for more info. The experience will be very similar and you can download and set it up quick.
---
Alternatively you can try it on the current retail wow - just make an account and download it and you can play for free until level 20. The game and classes are very different now but you can still get a general idea.
---
Lol what a stupid bitch, It’s not hard to pull one mob at a time omegalul
---
dude lost a roll on something he wanted to a hunter and never got over it.
---
MAD TV I believe
---
Lol these comments. Classic community is going to be toxic af.
---
Which is why we're asking for a single RPPvP server.
---
what do you mean more items? every item is a hunter item!!
---
Look what im whippin' up
---
Nice! Would like to see some aoe farming from Maura and DM when the release it on beta
---
Remember that everyone’s a rando on the internet and who gives a fuck what they think dude.  I used to be in a us top 50 guild and I almost failed my trial because I was trying to hard not to fuck up.  Towards the end I was like fuck it ima just enjoy myself and hopefully see all the content before I got the boot and my play improved a lot drastically.  Everyone makes mistakes you just gotta learn to relax and play.
---
If u cant hold agro over a wand reroll
---
Addons means something else. You mean expansions.
---
Also, there are multiple posts about EXACTLY this every single hour and people like you who keep making them are just spamming this sub.
---
For real, wtf is this shit you are spouting noob. You scan the ah, and it remembers the price of enchanting mats.. The addon tells you the estimated price of disenchanting items. That takes less time than checking vendor price vs ah price of the actual item, and it nets you more gold almost every time. The only greens that sell for more than their enchanting worth are items with nice stats.
---
Her response :[https://i.imgur.com/Qo2rT9I.png](https://i.imgur.com/Qo2rT9I.png)
---
imo horde has the better male models and alliance has better female models
---
That's pretty cool for sure. Thanks for letting me know about this kind of gaming. Never thought you could game like that :)
---
Private servers. Can't name them but there's one which rhymes with Blights Cope which is highly populated.
---
Is this a April fools joke or something?
---
Oh for sure. For me I love the aesthetic of Alliance. The not always hunched with beautiful cities and a righteous cause. Plus leveling zones. I love Dun Morough, Westfall, Duskwood, STV. That whole route to me is just fantastic.
---
People need low level enchanting mats too dude. The only profession materials you should ever be vendoring is lower level leather.
---
*any item that is of green or higher quality
---
lol, such a basic bitch...glad she wont play classic
---
No, she's RQing because of the rogue ganking. That is like playing bowling but a guy focuses just you and keeps using a stick to disrupt your ball.
---
we know, we been playing pservers before you were even born
---
Looking for guild, EU PvE with later raid times. 
---
Trying to find a guild, Alliance pref, that plans to raid a little later in the evening - 10:00 CET or so, to let me get my kids into bed beforehand ;-) I'm UK based and plan on playing Warlock, just like in Vanilla, though I hope to suck a little less this time around...
---
Paladin. Love the class lore/aesthetic, particularly Retribution.
---
And what's the cost of scanning the AH periodically to get current values for items? *Time*. 
---
This is what OP said:
---
&gt; So the only real profession that has the potential to increase your gold a bit without adding any /played time (or at least no more than an hour total) is enchanting.
---
Enchanting will add more than one hour /played from 1-60. Absolutely, 100%. Maybe read before commenting? Cheers.
---
Changed in 1.7.
---
Since it's and item I think it'll be released non-bop, assuming this from blizz saying all items will be in their 1.12 state.
---
Only 78 more days.
---
Awesome, can't wait for Classic.
---
Yes, having to work for stuff makes it feel very rewarding!
---
So in the full clip she did what so many people suggest in this sub for when you're getting camped. She logged out for a little and came back when they were gone.
---
&gt; Lmao right? Everyone brings these up as if they were necessary but if you were on your shit or in a good guild dailies weren't essential. 
---
That is like 20% of the player base.
---
What about the other 80% that weren't in good guilds and didn't were on their shit?
---
A mage wouldn't survive 3, that is a level 8-9 lock ( with fear, without voidwalker )
---
This is Copypasta msterial
---
Greetings, fellow brother of the light. Ret for life baby.
---
What is this sorcery? How did you do this sir?
---
Right now there is a lot of levelers and "no beta access" guilds. People are playing hard.
---
Ofc it is.
---
Imagine calling someone kid just because you disagree, fucking idiot.  
---
Are you 16?
---
If you have bothered checking any fucking poll on this sub, you'd see who's wrong.
---
haha epic troll 😂😂👌
---
Then I don't see any problems with their service and Blizzards EULA
---
I went Engineering on my Rogue specifically to Vanish -&gt; Jumper Cables.
---
So basically, she gives up because she encountered some players of the opposite faction? Sweet retail child.
---
And what part is challenging?
---
Fishing is great for low levels especially because some of the alchemy fish sell for a few gold a stack.
---
&gt;  what is she supposed to do?  
---
Make some friends and engage in some good old fashioned pvp.
---
Yeah, but blizzards ToS can say whatever they want it to say, until legally challenged, they can and will have any set of arbitrary rules.
---
sell your kids for game time
---
Uhhhh there were PVE servers in vanilla. Not everyone enjoys getting ganked. It's not the end of the world if someone plays the game the way they want to.
---
Deathcoil
---
Latency isn't a concern when streamers stream because their is no input from yourself.
---
In other words.  You press A to jump on the controller, that button press needs to be sent over the internet, to Google's servers running the game, processed by the game, the character jumps, and then the resulting video feed of the character jumping is sent back over the internet to your devices.  The game will look smooth (if you don't drop any packets containing video)...but the time between you pressing the button, and seeing the resulting action on your screen is delayed by the round trip time of the requests.
---
Classic is simply, not for you.
---
I hope your joking, but if not;
---
The game is just what it is. If you dont want to play a game where you have to walk alot or dont have the time for it, go play another game. You cant expect them to change the game or add portals just because YOU dont have the time. 
---
And its not “somebody had to say it”. Walking long distances is just one thing that was a part of the game in vanilla. I also have kids. Its your own choice to play the game or not
---
As much as mobile works great for an MMO like OSRS, WoW just has too many buttons and mechanics to ever actually make decent progress with anything on a phone. Maybe you could level but I bet it would be painful. OSRS has the benefit of that you literally just use your mouse for everything in the game anyway, so porting it to mobile is as easy as just replacing clicks with tapping.
---
It's possible to hit exalted with a gnome but it won't happen until you're mid 40s. You have to be perfect, too. There's an excel spreadsheet out there with all the quests and level recommendations but I can't find the link right now.
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
Lets try it like this.  
---
Tim Jim and Slim.  
---
Tim is hardcore no lifing the game 24/7.   
---
Jim is a hardcore casual who min maxs but doesn't have as much time as tim.   
---
Slim is a super casual who enjoys the game when he can.  
---
Vanilla:  
---
Tim grinds his reps dungeon gear gold enchants etc all in the course of a few days all in a row like 8+ hours a day. Hes happy.
---
Jim cant play on monday cause he has to go do stuff IRL , but on tuesday hes free the entire day and can play 8 hours and make as much progress toward his goal as he wants. He's Happy.  
---
Slim can only play 1 hour each day before bed. He can experience the game at his pace and slowly work toward his long term casual goal.
---
Time gated content:  
---
Tim is pissed off because even though he can play almost the entire day. Theres no point because once hes run his daily and done his quests the effort to reward ratio is greatly diminished or non existent so he may as well go play another game. IE Daily gives 1000 points run gives 1.
---
Jim is pissed off because he can't log on monday due to IRL stuff and he misses his 1000 points. He can play all day tuesday but there's no point playing after his dailies.  
---
Slim is happy he can play his 1 hour do his daily and after a bunch of these he gets a really cool item.
---
The good thing about classic is that we already established this "NoChanges" thing. Everyone is allowed to whine, cry get mad or sad about stuff they dont like. Thats there emotional investment. But we already made clear that Blizzard is not there to interfere. 
---
I didn't like to get ganked and camped. But its part of the game, a way to get emotional invested. A game must have bad experiences to highlight the good ones.
---
This day and age people seem to cry more publicly, make salt forum post, asking for campers to get banned, asking Blizz to stop allowing it etc. But we just ignore these guys like we did before. The community itself will be good. But the comminty is what you see ingame, not what you see written online.
---
32 years ago, mhmm.
---
I haven't really thought about that yet, but I think I'll just pick a server where I'll find a good guild/my (future) friends are at. It doesn't really matter to me that much, although getting ganked is a turnoff :-P
---
Also sometimes you actually have competition and your druid gets caught and feared.. it's nice to have someone fast to bring him flag midfield.. although rogues can get there pretty fast too if they can sneak behind and sprint to an exchange.
---
just stand in the fire a bit
---
Ye, one of the pixels is him.
---
kamehameha cast animation is top tier
---
WIth South Park it would be more probable if he was covered in semen.
---
I've played enough private server launches to know these polls are seldom accurate for predicting class distribution.
---
Mage &gt; warrior &gt; rogue &gt; hunter&gt; shaman/paladin &gt; priest &gt; warlock &gt; druid
---
This is generally how things pan out.
---
In raid environment you will get healed in 2 seconds or less though.
---
Seriously, the things people play games for today...
---
I mean I'm not shaming, to each their own. I can appreciate the art in walking simulators but it's just not engaging enough to me.
---
I need engaging gameplay above all. That is why I game. A cool story, multiplayer, good graphics, music... all these things are really cool if they're there but if the gameplay is shit I don't see why I would not rather do something else like watch a movie.
---
I used to play Counterstrike 1.5 for hours on end because the game play was so much fun to me. Then I heard when CS:GO was launched, the title was pretty unpopular... until they introduced weapon skin gambling.
---
I CANNOT wrap my head around this. If the game was fun before, why wouldn't you play it just because of skins? If the game wasn't fun before, why the fuck would you play it now just because it got skins?
---
lul resto druid lack versatility... you're joking right?
---
a resto druid with 3k hp and pure +healing gear might not be versatile but who says you have to wear that gear?  this is vanilla, it's FAR more varied than people realise.  the 1/29/21 spec (if i remember that right) is probably the most versatile thing in the entire game, and is exceptionally strong in pvp.  You can build a mixture of gear and be super hard to kill as well as do moderate damage and decent healing, with very strong cc too
---
the only reason stuff seems balanced in retail is because around the time of wrath/cata they made all the classes the fuckin same
---
Aaaaaarh that's what he meant! Thanks!
---
These are all noobs with noob gear he is fighting. He has a MC Hammer (ha MC Hammer) but itll be outdated as soon as people get in naxx gear. You dont understand but, enh shaman is only good around launch and you're banking on that 1 out of 8 hits that'll proc a good windfury crit. 
---
This guys montages are only clips of where he is successful, he doesnt show the amount of times he gets kitted or killed
---
if you dont care about the release hype just wait a little. personally i can’t wait for the rush of people, it will be a slow start but memorable and so much fun!
---
I went with Human initially, then faction changed to an Undead at some point just to try out Horde. Back then I enjoyed Alliance more (insert 10-year old Alliance joke here).
---
weeker? really?
---
Any part you want.
---
DON'T GIVE THEM IDEAS
---
skarmtank:  "Why warriors are better aoe tanks than palas"
---
... proceeds to tank stratholme on his t3 warrior, using engineering items and the helmet from gnomeregan to pull some groups of mobs.  he's a fail for sure
---
Inefficient!!!
---
I don't know the first thing about this person so I'm not going defend her specifically but I think it is worth saying that there IS NOTHING WRONG with retail players who don't have the time or patience for classic. This is a funny clip and it made me laugh but I hope we're mature enough at this point not to just ooze elitism and assholery and get a reputation for driving away retail players. Let's not be the souls community.
---
That distract &lt;3
---
Uaaugh!  Oouhuoogh!
---
Yes, it's almost as if you have two make a meaningful choice and stick with it!
---
Most of them will be tanking 5 man dungeons for sure
---
My route was: mage -&gt; paladin -&gt; hunter
---
I played a warlock originally, I remember envying hunters for having more powerful pets. Also I don't want to spend any time farming soulshards this time... I feel like hunter will also be more solid for world pvp, especially against rogues, who were pain in the ass for a warlock.
---
This copypasta was posted yday. Reported.
---
Too late. All is lost. ALL IS LOST!
---
Not a real screenshot. We all know pulling one murloc pulls every one in the zone.
---
I raided aq40 and naxx in vanilla, never had an add on, and I didn't know they even existed. In pretty sure I clicked alot of my abilities as well... Lol, good old 15 year old me.
---
Good sustain damage and great burst when you get the trinkets. Good 1v1 potential against most classes. Against melee you kite with traps and stings and when they catch you, pop deterrence and hit them back in melee. Against range you can run up and snare them and delay their casts with your high attack speed. Warlocks and Spriest s\*it on you though.
---
i personally think the danger of the enemy faction at any point makes the game soo fun, but each to their own i was just curious as you said you will mostly pve! gl in your adventures on the 27th man
---
i am with you with the dice, but probably it will be a random(1,8) function call since i cant even single out one class to not play (beside shaman/pala depends ok fraction)
---
Man i remember that Elwynn forest quest where you gotta find those bodies of the guards and get like 5 murloc fins or something and every time you go near a murloc it pulls the whole place
---
Basic bitch
---
Put wow classic on switch and I can finally play vanilla wow 24/7
---
On the pc at home, on the switch at work and when out and about etc.
---
"Great healers" "great tanks" i dort Think so Mister, Tell me how u want to Come close to a Priest heal or a warr tank as a druid
---
Just so you know, casters are the easiest to kill as a rogue. Pull em one at a time, or sap/blind adds to take em 1 on one. Wait til the last possible second to kick, going, kidneyshot their casts and they will hardly scratch you.
---
He doesn't get it man. Let him be. Retail players have a mindset that blocks them to actually understand even a basic difference between "doing X because the game only offers X" and "doing whatever the hell I want because the game is offering whatever the hell I want".
---
I used the remote control for my HP Media Center PC to play TBC while lounging on my bed. That beast had 20 or so buttons I key mapped.
---
&gt;i have 5 fucking kids
---
If you didn't fuck around so much, you wouldn't have that problem
---
A dmg meter, DBM, healbot, and a quest tracker.
---
5/7 bait
---
Blackrock Mountain complex pretty much.
---
He litteraly typed in the question: " What honor rank can u possibly reach without doing a battleground? "  
---
Which means which is the maximum rank you can theoretically reach ..............
---
On the start with lots of people it will be a great journey, some will take it slow, some will go fast. The feeling of love I have for this game is growing.
---
I think complaining about streamer hate has become more common than streamer hate.
---
Shield slam&gt;revenge&gt;sunder for threat
---
Revenge&gt;shield slam&gt;sunder for threat per rage.
---
Shield block is for blocking, not threat.
---
Kek @that attitude when you are so wrong
---
Are the t0 dungeon sets not in game at start? They were in vanilla
---
Ion has been playing like this for years...
---
I dont care if streamers are getting Prio on this beta. Its not a beta for testing alone. Its also a publicity stunt. These can go hand in hand perfectly.
---
No one cares if 20 out of the 20.000 get prio. No one will say "damn I had to wait 0.5 seconds longer because this guy cuts in line" 
---
About the Name reservation I would say sure, give these guys there own name. If any of us would call ourself Asmongold, Sodapoppin, Mcconnel or whatever we would be shameless copycats anyway.
---
"But thats unfair if streamers get prio!" 
---
On picking there name...? C'mon do people really care that much?
---
But ofcourse, on the other hand, they life by the same rules, so no reporting for "streamsniping" or crying when facing the downsides of a PvP realm.

I mained Enh Shaman from june 2005 until Cataclysm, what do I not understand?  
---
Ofcourse this isn´t a representation of normal gameplay, hence the montage-video of highlights. Still impressive though.
---
Glad these people won't be around. Good riddance!
---
Or half that with rested exp
---
Sounds like you just don’t want to play Classic WoW to be honest...
---
This man tanks
---
Holy shit the vitrol in this thread. Nobody likes having their questing camped by the opposite faction who are 10+ levels above you.
---
Hey there! [Come check us out!](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/byvs2i/looking_for_group_monday_june_10_2019/eqmbgcv/)
---
Well if you have 5 kids to feed and dont have the time to walk to stratholme, dont play this game. Sorry but thats just how it is my friend.
---
I read it well before the raid of downvotes so that could have something to do with it. I think if people see 10 downvotes they automatically read the post in a negative way, or think it's a bad post, regardless of the intent. But with it being completely neutral to me I read it without any negativity, and thinking about that is kind of interesting hmm. But anyway, the OP could have definitely been more pleasant in their responses, so it is what it is.

But but... dual wield!!11 =)

Guys you know you are not the only people playing WoW, right? I'm waiting for Classic with all my heart, but I know I won't be able play it all the time because of my job. Now my job is pretty much 26% work and 66% down time (8% is my glorious lunch). I'd love to slowly but steadily level up my character instead of being bored at work. It's not like it'd affect any of you nor the gameplay in any way.  What's the matter with you all? Instead of allowing other people to enjoy the game you want them all to play the way YOU like. If you can say that everyone should play the class that is the most fun for them, why can't you say the same thing about the game itself?
---
I believe they were originally just Meeting Stones :)
---
its fucking killing me, i resubbed to BFA but havent had the guts to log in because i know i'll be disappointed
---
And you think that everyone else is like you?
---
Breaking news : They aren't.
---
Warrior, Mage and Shaman/Pala seems to often be 3 of the top 4 of these polls in some order
---
Druid and Hunter seems to often be 2 of the bottom 3
---
With Priest, Rogue and Warlock changing a lot in each poll
---
2/10

 **&lt;Legacy&gt; | US PVE| Alliance | NA |**
---
Intro: Legacy is a guild composed of people from varying experiences in classic WoW, ranging from first timers to boss kills in Nax. We are semi hardcore with a twist in that we are open to all dedicated performers of their appropriate role.
---
**Who do we want?**
---
Just as we are a group of young adults with full time jobs/classes, we understand that WoW doesn’t always come first. With that being said, we play this game to have a fun time while downing bosses at a consistent rate and are looking for fellow passionate players to do the same with. As has already been mentioned, we look on the individual more than the spec you intend to play, if you perform we are happy to have you.
---
**What roles are in current demand?**
---
At this current time all roles will be considered but we especially have a high demand for dps at the moment, especially warriors/rogues/mages
---
**Misc:**
---
Raids will begin with the first couple months of server launch, evening weekend (EDT)
---
* Again all are welcome, we will be spam farming dungeons to help those interested in farming prebis (even  
---
those with little interest in raiding).
---
* World PVP groups will be organized as long as there is interest from both factions in doing so, especially in the earlier phases.
---
* Loot rules are still to be determined however we are leaning more towards a MS/OS+1 style approach with certain priority items (Absolute BiS trumps over minor upgrades, etc).
---
**How to join?**
---
https://discord.gg/YSwVxBK  
---
 , we are still in the process of setting up appropriate tabs. Feel free to ask any questions/contact us either in discord or through this post.
---
Full make up streamers are not streamers ....
---
Yeah it does have it uses but getting people to use it and not just keep clicking on it is half the challenge haha.
---
Benefit to swords in PVE.  Also, for melee attack animations and the way armor looks, humans &gt; gnomes - none of which matter on my gnome mage, he wears robes and casts.
---
Sapping enemy gets you out of stealth and in combat, forget about blind... You will either have no money to buy materials for them or you won't find herbs to make powder :D
---
Line of sight is our only weapon and you can't use it in many places.
---
Druid can do all that.
---
I will main druid in classic :)
---
Shit just tell your group you are new to tanking and haven't tanked this instance before, people won't kick you and when they know you are new they will help you.
---
You stream from a google server computer and use their hardware to play games. There are a few streaming services out there already but the biggest problem is latency. For example you could play a game on your tablet, that's streaming from a computer with a 2080TI graphic card. Cloud gaming is obviously the future, but it will probably take a while before they manage to fix the latency to an acceptable level.
---
Issue I'm having is that the dwarf priest is actually something I love. Love the look, love the levelling...but I've been told that priest healing for raids is actually quite skill intensive, and that's scaring me off a good deal. So I'm wondering if Id be happier on a mage purely because id be very good at casting frostbolt and summoning drinks for my slot.
---
Addon that sells all the grey items in your bags automatically. Literally pure time saver and nothing else.
---
It's a years long dream of many. It just happens that now we have both the tech and the willingness in the gaming industry to turn it into a real product. Eventually, 10 years from now, we'll look back and laugh how could we pay hundreds/thousand dollars and buy a console/gaming computer to play games locally processed/rendered. In 2020 already (with Stadia and xCloud) we would be able to stream any modern game at max settings on our phones (or literally any other screen connected to the internet).
---
The top addons used in the Vanilla days that I can recall:
---
AtlasLoot
---
AtlasQuest
---
Questie
---
KLHThreatMeter
---
DPSMate
---
EquipCompare
---
MobHealth
---
Bagnon
---
SellValue
---
Enemy Cast Bar
---
OmniCC
---
Big Wigs
---
Decursive
---
Grid
---
I expect Blizzard will retain certain improvements made in the game throughout it's lifespan which will result in certain addons not being needed for the Classic version (i.e. EquipCompare, MobHealth)
---
This is what makes Id/Bethesda’s Orion game engine so interesting. We’ll have to see if it holds up to the hype.
---
you can run around the beautiful continents of Azeroth hunting the enemy faction. i could pvp all day it never gets boring
---
For the many, many non-raiders.
---
I still have faith modern wow can be fun. But they have to make such big changes and I think they are afrait to make them.
---
Also they have no idea what they are doing.
---
As a smaller hobby streamer 20-ish views average, this makes me afraid of streaming this game when it comes out \*cries\*
---
This makes me sad.
---
Make your kids grind for you. EZ
---
There are currently private vanilla servers with thousands of people playing, a lot will probably migrate to the official servers so they don't risk losing progress with Blizzard shuts down the private server. It's going to be fine.
---
Also, that distract into causing her to blink the wrong way, so satisfying...
---
Hope so
---
You can pull all the murlocs in elwynn forest and not only live but kill them all without running out of Mana as a lvl 5-7
---
AWWW DUDE
---
I'm not sure why people hate this so much. Even if it we're a thing, it's not coming at the expense of the version you want. I'd actually be kinda happy if they did do this.
---
To be honest, I think this would fit retails streamlined nature a hell of a lot better. Just with Warriors, for example, I can't imagine stance dancing with that interface.
---
When I first thought about the idea of a Classic app, I immediately rejected it. Then I saw Classic Winds's video on this exact topic, and he actually makes some valid points.
---
I suggest you go watch it.
---
mobile gaming will always suck though.
---
Fair point! Should be an "oh shit" type button just like the healthstone
---
Lucky for her she is hotter than pinkysparkles cause the rest shesh
---
3 mobs lol
---
Thats not half bad,grinding a couple of levels post 40 seems like optimal way to level
---
Meatn Shield Slam :) And if you don't spam Sunder Armor you'll be at 100 rage 24/7, so who's wrong with using sunder armor as a threat generator for highest possible TPS?
---
Listen to your heart
---
PvE servers are for scrubs tho...
---
Also, no one enjoys being ganked. Everyone enjoys exacting retribution on those who have ganked you. It's one of the biggest dopamine rushes the game has to offer.
---
I'd say if you just want a chill experience I'd go alliance as it is much easier when raiding. Myself I choose based on which race I can stand to look at for my own character. The biggest gripe that i have that makes me go horde is that I don't want to play a human or gnome on my mage, they just don't look good to me.
---
&gt; One of many reasons 
---
Absolutely. There are so many reasons that I don't want TBC, and yes, dailies is one of them. Among a shitload of others.
---
I hope that Blizzard sees the light, and while TBC will have enough popularity, they should release two options after Classic : TBC and post-Naxx.
---
Keep the player base playing AND playing.
---
That is why I do quests, dungeons.  I keep the grinding to the absolute minimum, and I don't care that it's slower.
---
Good point actually... Just I got the frustration part of it. I've switched char / logged out because of getting camped.
---
Play Alliance, the Horde doesn’t need indecisive people.
---
To young to have an account on your own. Always watch your brother play, finnaly he is out for the weekend. Ask if I could play. Level all weekend to level 14.
---
Bro get home, kicks me of the Pc, logs in. Sees I'm level 14. Log into my char. I proudly show what I managed to get.
---
He vendors all my stuff, mailed the gold to his main and deleted my char infront of me.
---
It was sad indeed.
---
Lol dude this must be a joke, hilarious post.

**&lt;Chaos Theory&gt; - NA \[A\] EST PVP Server - Early Weeknight Raids! (Tu, W, Th 7p-10p EST)**
---
**Introduction**
---
Greetings! &lt;Chaos Theory&gt; is a mature Alliance, PVE focused guild based out of North America (EST). Our goal is to work toward raiding progression as a raid team. We will be playing on a PVP server for Classic WoW.
---
**Member Expectations**
---
As we prepare for the Classic WoW Launch, we are looking for new members to help us build our core. The main requirements to joining the guild are active participation in Discord, a good/positive attitude, and a desire to progress. We are building a community of like minded, mature players to enjoy Classic WoW and now is the time to join us!
---
**Specifics in regards to desired classes/roles:**
---
* Druid (Heal)
---
* Hunter
---
* Paladin (Heal)
---
* Rogue
---
* Warlock
---
**Raid Schedule – Early night EST Raids!**
---
Our raid schedule will be 3 days a week. The core raid days will be Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursdays from **7pm to 10pm EST**. If we complete content early, we will take days off if there isn’t additional content available to clear. We plan to use a hybrid **transparent** form of Loot Council. This will include open dialog with the entire raid and potentially a rotating member of the council.
---
**Next Steps**
---
If this sounds of interest, please join us via Discord to proceed with next steps. We currently have a Discord and Guild Website ready for your enjoyment. We are looking forward to adventuring in Azeroth with you this summer!

---
the double distract lol. #OOGA
---
&gt; i have 5 fucking kids
---
Well, that was your choice to have so many kids. Can't pin your lack of time on anyone else.
---
&gt; I will have way less time for my kids, just remember that. YOU are responsible for this shit not me
---
No, you are responsible for your own life/decisions and the ramifications of your decisions. Just because the game isn't designed around you does not mean we are at fault. Not all games are based to be inclusive of everyone. That's just selfish entitlement. 
---
&gt; As a dad, I can't stress enough how toxic this community has become. This sub was fine 5 months ago when all the nerds were still playing on private servers
---
The community has always been based around keeping the core foundations of the game "Classic". Also, complaining about toxicity and then proceeding to belittle people with a different opinion is laughable.
---
Sounds like retail is the game for you.
---
Also, don't blame other people for your lack of time. Next time, consider family planning - i.e; A condom.
---
auto repair / refill arrows / ankhs / buffstuff / water / food
---
i would like an addon which tracks my dungeon boss kills. stratholme undead 82times/23times not completed
---
something to keep statistics about death/rezz and so on
---
I have had people on here tell me they like getting ganked because "It adds to the feeling of danger" or some shit. I totally don't get it. I rolled PVP in vanilla but I'm going PVE in classic. And yes, I will enjoy my hugbox.
---
I've played rogue since vanilla and have played recently, it hasn't changed. I'm telling you how it works. Part of playing a rogue well is pooling and managing energy. It sounds like you wanna make excuses instead of taking the advice...
---
Yes, clearly that must be the only reason, he obviously is wrong on everything and all he says is baseless. I just don't understand why nobody sees how black and white this whole thing is!
---
mate, this is cringworthy
---
Hi, /u/Lars-Redzinx
---
Where do you get underestimated from?
---
Currently on private servers you get 2,6% hit for 5 weapon skill (other benefits too) and judging from that post in classic you will get only 1% hit (and other benefits). But post is unclear on total benefits, there could be more hit besides that 1%, but most likely you just get 1 hit.
---
We had multiple people snipe rankings on the Deathwing server on Alliance in Vanilla too.
---
we must cleanse the vermits of redridge and and exterminate the alliance
---
You are looking at live Wowhead, and not Classic Wowhead. The Classic version of the site doesn't show 1.11, but does show the correct stats.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=8345/wolfshead-helm
---
The version on Classic Wowhead is 1.13, not 1.11. This reflects datamining to the Classic client, which is all 1.13. We have a plan in the future to add "Added in Phase" info.
---
Same. Undead just look the best
---
 [https://www.twitch.tv/trillebartom](https://www.twitch.tv/trillebartom) 
---
also pretty chill
---
&gt; There are many positive things too! =)
---
I'm confused, what you mentioned above this were really positive things already.
---
We need more Ooga Gang content, I hope they release some videos.
---
Most people just quit before turning the difficulty down, especially the people who are prone to rage quitting.
---
I cant take this seriously due to gnomes. 
---
But the skill in editing shows. Keep at it.
---
Seriously this subreddit is ridiculous. Neckbeards talking about vanilla like war vets talking about D-Day. Calm down people, you're taking this shit way too seriously.
---
I could accept a TBC that removes all the bad shit (lvl cap, dailies, flying, resilience, badge gear, etc.) and retunes the raids for 40 men, while keeping Azeroth relevant, and Shamans and Paladins on their factions.
---
A remastered TBC with additional content for Azeroth, would be a good option. I just don't know how will it work, since there will be a lot to be balanced.
---
Give TBC players a TBC server option, and give Vanilla players a post-Naxx content server option.
---
you posted the same thing 11 hours ago and it got removed lmao... I am not sure if this is a joke you are doing twice or you are just an idiot but either way its hilarious
---
You always go for a safe pull and it turns out theres 6 hiding behind a tree with healing pots waiting to ruin your life
---
Yep this 100%!
---
You can flip the coin on this too and invest in mats when they are cheap and resell them with profit when they are higher in demand and people start to level professions.
---
you can also roll female gnome warrior, everybody will forgive any mistakes because you have pink ponytails
---
It is bis for human warriors too, before naxx at least.
---
I always find these posts so funny. There are always shattered dreams.
---
No one is ever going to reach rank14 !
---
"There is always this one chance"
---
NOPE, RIP DREAMS.
---
There will be 1000x as much people clearing Naxx than there will be rank14s.
---
Tits.
---
Oh god you just triggered so many memories. Specifically of my time in Wetlands.
---
Gonna melt all the faces with my Shadow Priest!
---
with bad raiders they could
---
Main: Dwarf Priest
---
Let me start with - I've never played WoW before - so I am looking for a guild that would be patient and casual/ sherpa nature. I've played other MMOs like Runescape, and am familiar with raid style fights, and grinding 
---
My knowledge will be limited but I'm very willing to learn and do research to get there. I work 6am EST till about 3pm EST, and play mostly in the evenings/night.  I typically can dedicate 3 nights a week to playing maybe more during launch. I've starting playing some on a private server to familiarize myself with the game and get a starting path down but after that I'll be experiencing a lot of things for the first time. If you want a mature member who is dedicated to the grind and excited to have fun, raid, and chat while drinking a cold one I'm your guy!
---
Please send me a PM on here so we can discuss further!  Discord friendly!
---
It's more like opting to play bowling in an alley specifically designed to allow you and others to interact with your bowling experience, and then raging because someone is interacting with your bowling experience.
---
I get they have no choice on the beta and would likely roll PvE if they were to play classic, but it is a PvP realm so it just comes with the territory.
---
Green items usually vendor for more than the mats are worth unless you get max yield. Even more if you sell boes on the AH.
---
I remember when I got ganked in Zangarmarsh a while back (in War Mode). It was a Rogue who kept killing me over and over but I kept coming back because it was one of the few times I felt genuinely challenged by a fight in the game. They were pretty cool about it, kind of bewildered that I kept running in just to die over and over, but the fights were always fun and it offered an opportunity to learn something new. 
---
And yeah it's annoying when some max level just one shots you, but I don't mind that much either. It makes the world feel dangerous and full of possibilities, like going out into the wilderness is an adventure where danger can lurk around every corner.
---
..and some ores, but yeah this pretty much!
---
Also, grats on the cake day!
---
That was my assumption as well
---
Lol you expect to get a belt like that an hour into the game? Funny.
---
Yeah, and I bet most people commenting like this barely did anything of note back in vanilla anyway.
---
I believe the best all around pet stat wise is still the owl. Their screech is really strong as well as their dash ability.
---
warrior if you wanna hate your life
---
nope... that’s the only pic without that "an hour" sign xD
---
This game does not fit me, that means its community is bad!
---
WHat kind of polls there have been 2 horde polls sof ar.Shamans were at the top even from warriors. With a sample of over 2000
---
I wish you the best of luck, but if you find yourself in a situation where you either arent brought to raid or arent given loot, dont come here telling people that every spec is valid ;)
---
Her vocal fry and upspeak aren't at all annoying.
---
Most people who need it already have skinning themselves. The only people who need to buy it are tailors and blacksmiths for specific recipes. You can skip them to level, and they only need a handful for items they want, so there isn't much demand.
---
5 Days 16 Hours played Time isnt that bad
---
LMAO can't wait to gank the shit out if people like this. Man Vietnam will be glorious, the thunders of war echo the lands and paint Azeroth with blood of poopies like this.
---
They don't have to kill me in the first place. I would annihilate them anyway. I just really hate Murlocs...

 **&lt;Awakening&gt;** NA, Alliance, PVP Realm
---
**About Us:** We are looking to have a very successful Guild in both PvE and PvP with dedicated leadership to make sure everyone is enjoying their stay and time spent. The guild will have a dedicated bank which eventually will help fund the raids consumables and repairs. Team is composed of experienced players competitive and casual in both Vanilla and Retail WoW, FPS games, and others.
---
**Schedule:** Raids will be 3 nights a week *8 or 9pm until 11pm or 12am EST* (will discuss and go with the best time slots). Off nights will be PvP, farming, and other guild activities.
---
**Rules:** Have fun. We plan on clearing all content being the best we can be but having fun while doing it. I am sure things will get stressful here or there but ultimately let's have fun.
---
**What We Expect:** Mature players who will do any learning before hand or ask for help before it is too late. Come prepared to raids with consumables and be ready for invites at least 15 minutes prior to start time. We expect players and teammates to help and give as much as they take and receive.
---
**Contact:** Best form of contact will be sending me a private message here or sending me a friend request and message on Discord ***voltx#1384*** Please let me know on Discord you are messaging from this post.
---
Personally, I think the chaos of a launch day like that is half the fun. Layering might make bearable, maybe not even bad. If it is horrible though, I'm not going to be mad. You have to set your expectations for these type of things. If It's fine, then you get to play Classic, It if it's atrocious... hey you get an unrepeatable experience.
---
Not great, not terrible. (sorry)
---
The guy is right..playing rogue is not just mindless spam of one damaging attack.
---
You need to micromanage your bursts and your ccs/kick and always be in total control of situation.
---
Then again,youre leveling as sub so you are clearly not interested in optimising your gameplay
---
I was a mage throughout vanilla back in the day and let me warn you, mage is the class that gets the most unwanted tells of all. You get literally spammed by players wanting ports day in day out( most of which wouldn't pay if their lives depended on it. So much so that when I was in a capital city I would often make a circle of all the portals right in front of AH and just stand there inviting people just to thin it out a little so I can go about my business. 
---
Also had a warlock and they do get the occasional fuckwad that whispers from across the land asking for a summon but it's nowhere near as bad.
---
Are there not players on RP servers who play with War Mode on in retail?
---
Haha, pretty close to Joana times actually. But god, you would go crazy keeping that pace up only killing mobs
---
Hey Guys look up The Pygmalion Effect, because all of you are affected by it
---
Pooling energy is one of the initial steps to learning how to ‘master’ a rogue. Using gouge well is another, basically a free instant CC.
---
When a Stacy tries to cash in on the classic hype
---
&gt;Thanks to your stupid threads and arguments I will have way less time for my kids, just remember that. YOU are responsible for this shit not me
---
I hope you're fucking joking. F**amily is and should always be the first priority in your life**. Not a game. It's disgusting to see that you put a game first and then the family second.
---
You should really rethink your priorities, man. I kinda feel sad about your wife and the kids. They deserve better than you.
---
M girlfriend and my family are the first thing I tend to. Job comes second. Then friends. And then hobbies like video games and stuff.
---
Good*
---
Exactly.  Easy access panic clicks.
---
Yep
---
It does
---
You mean EULA?
---
Yeah, I think we need to temper people's expectations.
---
It’s sad a moron like this is allowed to have 5 kids.
---
As long as you have the Internet connection. Which means as long as you live in a big city and not in a rural community.
---
Playing through a phone is probably closer to classic then modern computers
---
No one said its wrong to use sunder armor to generate more tps.  
---
You were wrong claiming it was better than other abilities(i.e. shield slam, while also saying shield block was something to use for threat).
---
I just corrected you.
---
Casting ignores the armor you get from leather gear. That’s also a big thing. If you aren’t prepared, and can’t initiate the fight, casters should have the advantage.
---
Must have? Threatmeter
---
Nice to have? Auction tool, unitframe-replacement, actionbar-replacement
---
Orc shaman -&gt; tauren druid -&gt; orc shaman/troll priest hrrmmmmm
---
&gt;  the bad, the weak, for those that crave no challenge
---
Meanwhile I suppose REAL MEN are playing a safe, known, solved, fifteen year old game they have already played through multiple times because they CRAVE A CHALLENGE? Mmm.
---
Being a jack of all trades removes identity.
---
If respecs were free. There would be less feral druids in raid because why the fuck would they not heal if they can swap to heal for free.
---
You may play feral in solo content more but everyone will know you and expect you to be a healer. Thusfar your identity is that of an healer. While you see yourself as a feral. Having multiple identities removes a true identity.
---
YYYEEEEEA IT'S WORKING GET THESE FUCKING CASUALS OUT HAHAH!!!!!
---
I have mixed feelings about daily quests. I think they were good forna lot of people. My casual guildmates at the time were able to log in, play for an hour, and make enough gold to buy comsumables for their raids, alts, etc. 
---
Most people dont seem to remember that most of the daily hubs rewarded average gear and special mounts, nothing BiS until isle which was the final hoorah of TBC anyways.
---
I ran dungeons hardcore and did arenas. I enjoyed dailies as a way to afford constant respecs from pve to pvp specs. To be fair, i thought dailies were 'too' rewarding when it comes to gold. Dailies over-inflated the economy. Granted it deterred gold farmers but the vanilla economy was better imo.
---
I enjoyed the badge system in TBC. It gave fresh life in doing heroics late into the games progression. You had to do a LOT of dungeons to get a single piece of loot. Personally i dont feel that badges cheapened the progression considering they were not top tier loot (unlike WOTLK which allowed for trade-ups)
---
I have no opinions on flying. It was both good and bad imo. As much as people want #nochanges vanilla I enjoyed TBC for everything it was. To me it was a very good expansion.
---
That being said im stoked for classic and cant wait to do vanilla raids again.
---
I haven’t played BfA, but up through legion I’ve noticed a significant decrease in the necessity of CC. In vanilla, and I hope in classic, it’s absolutely mandatory. Part of what I loved about the game when I started in 2004 was that it mattered much more that you played smart, rather than being strong.
---
True :) Mistake was made.
---
 [https://willitclassic.com/](https://willitclassic.com/)
---
Every day I go from NE Druid to Troll Shaman. Back and forth, back and forth. Guess I just need to decide if I'm going ally or horde.
---
I was! 
---
Rogue - Ezi. 
---
I played a lot with Surge and Epocs. I was a transfer tho.
---
I leveled a lock to 60 on LH when it launched, leveling was a breeze compared to my previous Vanilla leveling experience (Shaman). I haven’t had more troubles with Rogues than usual, maybe because I was an Orc, but most Alliance Hunters I’ve encountered past lvl 40 considered me to be free HK and unfortunately they were right most of the time.
---
On this note, do we know if the engineer specialization changing book found in tanaris will be in the game at launch? It’s in the beta now and is working but was added in patch 1.10.
---
I wouldn't necessarily call it challenging. I would probably say it is punishing.
---
You don't need to change talents for a dungeon. You might want to for a raid though (not everyone does). 
---
Some people just grind a few hours a week to afford respecing before and after raids, other pick builds that work for both but are slightly less efficient - it's a trade-off.
---
And if you get bored and switch it up every month or so, it's a lot less than 50g - it will cost you 10.
---
When all she had to do before was put on makeup and press buttons for a job now requires you to actually put effort forward and learn as a human.
---
"Fuck this, I quit."
---
This is why your spec choice is meaningful. I know it sounds like a shitty copout but this is what was intended. So your choice of spec has more weight to it and you can't just respec whenever you want. If you're a DPS, you'll be able to farm easily and kill mobs solo faster. However, you won't be as sought after in a group as a healer, who can't farm a lot of mobs but people will be looking for a lot come raid time.
---
Imagine being such a loser that you get angry because someone prefered warlock
---
*kid* go fuck yourself
---
YES Get the fuck out you fucking casual bitch!
---
Well now the only reason I'm responding to your post is because of your edit
---
If you are happy to wait and it doesnt bother you then I suggest you wait a day or two for the initial rush to avoid the pain, personally I plan on trying to get ahead of the zerg ball myself but thats because I have no patience and I love new game releases (I know call me crazy).
---
I would be hesitant to compare Private Servers to Classic as you need to factor in multiple things, some servers are going to be way more populated than others, Classic will have layering to help with the population issues at the start so the numbers should technically be less than you see on private servers (who knows how well this will actually work).
---
Thank you, yea i am going for Gnome Warlock due to the racials so i just made it identical.
---
The most appealing point of stradia is you won’t have to buy top of the line expensive pc parts to keep up with the ultra settings in games. With one controller and a screen you can play anything you want as long as your internet supports
---
@op
---
Don´t underestimate the brainless fandom some people have for their advertisement whores on twitch. 
---
I don´t think that streamers should not be allowed to join a regular server, they are players like the rest of us with a subscription and free to do what they like. If they join on your server and you are uncomfortable, then switch. But i doubt they will do it, all of their troll armies would have to follow them. I think they will choose one and stay there.

Super Nice post, thx for sharing!

**Risen | NA-PvP | Alliance**
---
First team: Tues/Sun, 8pm – 11pm CST 
---
Second team: Wed/Mon, 7:30pm – 10:30pm CST 
---
Loot Council with Wishlist
---
**Introduction**:
---
Shard, founder and GM of Risen, has been playing WoW since February, 2005. In retail Vanilla he led one of the only 23 US guilds that were able to clear Naxx prior to TBC launch (Validus of Mal’ganis). During TBC and WotLK he raided in &lt;vodka&gt;, one of the most prominent US raid guilds that has ever existed. For the past 3-4 years Risen has been based on a private server where we quickly took over as the top NA guild in raid progression for AQ40 and Naxx, and built a reputation for world pvp dominance. Perhaps you’ve seen us in one of Pronker’s “Buff Watch” series of videos! If not, go check those out on youtube!
---
We have some pretty lofty goals for Risen in Classic! Not only do we want to be the dominant guild on our server but we also want to create the ultimate Classic community—a guild with 2-3 separate raid teams within it! Picture a guild where there’s always plenty of people online to do stuff with—that’s what we want to build!
---
**What you can expect from us:**
---
•    High-end leadership with a long track record of success
---
•    The most well-organized guild you’ll ever be part of—ask any of our veteran members what they think
---
•    A fun, competitive atmosphere embracing the hardcore mentality without most of the silly no-lifer requirements
---
•    Dedication to server dominance in all aspects
---
•    2-3 raid teams within the guild, which means there will never be a shortage of activity!
---
**Currently recruiting:**
---
Team 1 High-performing Priest
---
Team 2 1 Fury Warrior and a handful of Healers.
---
Team 3 Looking for a guild or group of individuals to kick-start and lead this team!
---
Check out www.risencc.com for more info about us!
---
Yep! Never go full-cultist!
---
Totally not worth to use a healing item for that but yes
---
The OOGA gang is like Darwin's natural selection in WoW. The first month or so on a PvP server will be glorious.
---
Best way to explain this I saw in a post before was that dailies start to make you feel like a hero doing daily chores where as vanilla makes you feel like an average guy trying to become a hero
---
You're welcome! ;)
---
I always enjoy this type of topics, thanks man. But hey, elites are not suppose to be soloable by any class if they are your level. People usually group up with proper heal, tank and dps
---
What would happen after "sitting for 1 year on max Level" after TBC is released? Would you want WotLK? And then MoP? Et cetera.
---
Play retail if you want all the content. Blizzard have said that, for now, Classic is just the old world of Azeroth, kept in perpetuity.
---
So in theory... I could farm a healing set. 
---
This will go well with my +spell dmg set for arcane/stings.
---
Sad!
---
Is it still a fallacy if we call it something else? What if I say "Consequence Cascade"? It seems that someone claimed the slippery+slope combination on a few websites and attached "fallacy" and so now we're to believe that a cascading, predictable sequence of events no longer happens in real life? But it still does. It always will, no matter who calls it fallacious. 
---
Regardless of what some sequestered philosophers/skeptics/postmodernists say, this is a factor people deal with in real life. The predictable cascade of events that will follow a specific type of action. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission would have less work to do if they weren't scouting out insider trading and stock price meddling....which decrease investor confidence....whose decreased investment/ total divestment would lower stock prices....which would cause people to take their money out of the market....which leads to a crash. 
---
I appreciate skepticism and philosophical thinking but there is truth in the world. In this specific case, the "Consequence Cascade" would stem from the people behind the changes rather than any specific change. Look of "tone from the top" if you're unfamiliar; it's not that a specific change in and of itself mandates a slide, it's that the fact that the people behind the scenes have a philosophy that will predictably slide somewhere bad. Balancing, for example, and arenas, and the never-ending struggle to balance classes against each other, against new PvE content, against 2v2 fairness, 5v5 fairness, etc. Once they make changes in that direction you can expect much more of it because they have told you that they seek to use one system to appeal to multiple different groups.
---
That's why I hit 60 in April after the November 23 launch.
---
Of course we also had the disadvantage of not knowing what we were doing. For the first two weeks I thought Elwynn Forest was the entire world - because you press 'M' and that was the map.
---
Then I discovered you could right click the map and it was zoom out. And you could right click it again and zoom out even more.
---
Oh boy.
---
Ha... this guy. Ranting on them internets.
---
Yep. I hope I don't regret going Warrior, but the last time around I actually went Hunter. I was really good at Hunter, and enjoyed every bit of it but... man they just didn't scale well in the longrun :(
---
Fights ensued?
---
The classic "no u"
---
Looking for a PvP EU guild focused on PvP. Raiding with the expectation that we are doing it to get PvP gear, premades etc. 
---
Haven't decided between playing a priest or mage - can adjust to what's needed.
---
PvE players &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; PvE realms.
---
Problem solved. If you are on a PvP server, no much how you twist it...you ARE a PvP player. Whether you want it or not, whether you like it or not.
---
There is no such thing as a PvE player on a PvP realm.
---
Sure they are. But you are meant to stare at their tits, not their gameplay.
---
I was too distracted by the sound of nails on chalk board escaping her mouth I didn’t even think to look for tits.
---
Checkmate boomers
---
Yeah that guys opinion is great for when we actually level alts and already have an established amount of gold.
---
I plan on being tailor/enchanter at 60, I'm going skinning tailoring to start with and then drop skinning once I have my mount. :)
---
I feel like "lfr heroes" Couldn't give a shit about beta, she has no Idea who the classic community are.
---
He was 4 years older and bigger. So nope.
---
Same story each week untill I had my own account.
---
Yourself included?
---
Laptops solve this problem too. 😉
---
I wonder if the TTK to XP ratio for lower levels makes it similar, i used to use an addon in vanilla that showed you the amount of mobs to kill for the next level and generally grinded on green UD as a paladin to just nuke them quickly.
---
Took 6 1/2 days played but i did quite a bit of PvP as i leveled, was only like rank 5 but a decent bit of it was during the day long AV period after 51 and it was done over months so rested was a factor.
---
You can quote me on this when it inevitably happens: they types of people who make this sub toxic are going to run classic into the ground or in the very least give it a reputation as a haven for no lifer elitist players.
---
&gt; If your tank uses Sunder for TPS he is doing something wrong.
---
?  No I did not. Did you even read?
---
I remember this so well, aggro a bunch extra murlocs. Somehow manage to survive with pots and every trick in the book, 50 HP left, phew..
---
Sitting down to eat, from the distance, but closing in:
---

I die because it crits me sitting down to eat..

---
Tired of \[r/classicwow\](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow) to tell you that you won't get into any raids as a spriest/non-resto shaman/feral etc?
---
Feel free to join us in our adventure to clear the entire of classics raiding challanges while still maintaining our identity!
---
We will raid 2-3 nights a week and won't require too many consumables.
---
Our goal is to clear all PvE content while sticking with whichever classes/specs we have!
---
Everyone is welcome so feel free to PM me for the discord link!
---
I’m out of the loop. What is the Ooga gang?
---
Soo, not to "every person". Just Alliance.
---
I have never played recent retail wow but this is how I imagine it will become from what people on this sub say
---
You think we can get WeakAuras? I've never seen it discussed in any of these "what add-on?" questsions
---
Good Lord the complete lack of knowledge on technology lol
---
I’m getting some serious incel vibes ITT
---
But imagine being able to play WoW while taking a dump or a shower or while you’re playing WoW in your computer. The possibilities are endless!
---
Didn't really want to say this, but yes.
---
The only race that matters besides horde? 
---
Yah.
---
Lfg when classic release
---
Thats sad
---
You're dumb
---
Will gathering nodes spawn on the same places always? I remember this being the case on a bc private server I played on but I’m not sure how classic handles this as I didn’t play in vanilla and i don’t know how this works in retail with the phasing and such. 
---
I also remember that there were addons for these spawns so you could farm them and it would save the spawns you discovered:
---
Thanks a lot.
---
Poor Joe, got caught pretty damn quick.
---
!remindme 3 hours
---
I guess it just makes sense to me even if they ragequit. They’re going to play the game again at some point, whether a couple of days down the road or a few minutes after they’ve cooled off (unless they just outright quit instead of rage quitting). Lowering the difficulty seems like something normal they’d do since they can’t do the harder difficulty.
---
You'll still be better than feral and balance druids, just no chance of hitting rouge mage warrior lock.
---

Dude you edited your comment. Kek bye
---
No, people are dumb and every neckbeard is theorycrafting with no knowledge.
---
You'll be fine just dont expect to top dps/dmg matters
---
This clip is completely taken out of context. This subreddit is worse than Fox News and CNN combined.
---
I don’t understand the origin of the toxicity and vitriol spewed here against streamers.
---
That's happy.
---
You're smart.
---
I can't see what [raid progress](https://www.wowprogress.com/character/eu/twisting-nether/Fawcan) in BFA have as relevance to this, I don't deserve beta more becuase I'm 9/9.
---
There's way more people that actually have a real interest in testing Classic for mechanics bugs etc and not for their streams.
---
And to sit on twitter literally crying to get an invite becuase you're a streamer makes it kinda... yeah...
---
naw thanks ❤️
---
Heresy.
---
ty for the support
---
you dont understand it actually sucks
---
This is not a phone. It is a computer with touchscreen
---
My plan is:
---
* Midnight release: Get in, reserve additional names, set up my character UI, maybe get some quests done, go to sleep.
---
* Next day after work: Try to get as far away from main crowds as possible
---
* Next day after work &amp; day off after that (i took a day off a few days after launch, not on launch day!) - hardcore grind/quest to get as high as possible
---
But yeah. Dont expect to get far on launch day unless you're really, really hardcore and minmax/plan every move to stay ahead of crowd.
---
No they aren't and no they weren't. Dungeon sets were introduced with the AQ update in vanilla. Which is a shame, because cause they are worthless at that point.
---
If you can't handle PvP, whether it's a camp or not, it's simple really.
---
She's not the first and she's won't be the last.
---
Also her twitter response is pathetic
---
Although Winterspring saber is probably #2 for horde, maybe even tied with white raptor. It's not every day you see horde on a typically 'alliance' mount.
---
“I don’t have time
---
To deal with this” haha. Love classic wow.
---
Just grind winterspring.
---
Ah it all makes sense now!
---
Can't imagine I would be looking forward to classic if there were 3 people dedicated to ruining it for me as much as they can.
---
Hello everyone, I am planning to go to my original classic realm (depending how they do this) of Stormreaver but am more than welcome to change to a more populated one. I am currently planning to play warrior as its combat is very interesting to me at the moment. Originally i raided half way into AQ as a resto shaman so a change of pace this time is pretty exciting.  
---
* Intended region (NA/EU)
---
   * EU

* A preferred form of contact (PM, Discord link, website application)
---
   * PM or reply to this comment.
---
It worked wounders for osrs because of it’s (click to move) gameplay, But for classic wow it would be horrible to move around, and all the spells that exist would just clutter the small screen
---
One of the best things about Azeroth is exploring everything for the first time...sometimes I wish I could experience everything anew...I dropped current wow and played some time on private server running WOTLK...yeah sue me! I am wotlk boi and I love it...but now I am super hyped about classic coming out...and I can tell you that you shouldnt feel intimidated...simply dive in and explore...read quest logs and youll have fun.
---
Flying kills immersion ( and without immersion, an MMO dies a slow death : look at WoW today). Flying makes the world much smaller. Flying kills interactions between players (be it PvP or helping an ally do a quest). Flying SPEEDS UP the game, which means it LOWERS the time you need to spend in game (and that led most players spending much less time in game, prompting Blizzard to design relevant content on a patch based philosophy instead expansion philosophy, in order to KEEP players login as much as possible, while giving them quick and easy rewards, regardless of what the players do or how long they play).
---
Flying basically is what led to LFG, LFR, Titanforging, Warforging, removal of professions, implementing portals all over the world and heavily instanced content.
---
People don't see it, but FLYING is the root of all problems in WoW. Because of flying, the player base mentality changed towards faster play style, which led to dailies, which led to LFD, which led to LFR, which led WF and TF, which led to showering epics left and right.
---
should have sheeped one of them ... noob
---
She looks pretty trashy, though. Aren't there more attractive titty streamers to jank one off to?
---
I'm glad I was able to clear that up for you :) 
---
(It's a bummer, but at least we still have other options)
---
She is the classic definition of mad because bad.
---
If you can't take people mocking you when you play like shit maybe you shouldn't stream.
---
(DSP, I'm talking to you too.)
---
One of my buddies was actually rolling arcane hunter back in BC.
---
He was basically stacking arcane spell damage and stamina and just arcane shot people to death.
---
Shit was dumb as hell, but super funny when it crit.
---
I mean...by all means follow your dreams if it makes you happy.
---
I just think you (everyone for that matter) should aim higher than alienating themselves from the real world.
---
Fake.
---
It works for the devs sure. Doesnt mean its good for the players.
---
Lol... most people will never see the inside of naxx or aq, much less clear it.
---
That's a big phone, how do you fit that in your pocket?
---
Druid has tons of versatility though, and tons of people will want a Druid. You have great efficiency with rank 4 healing touch and can feral/balance in a pinch with hybrid specs. They're obviously not one of the stronger classes but they have flexible roles and are still always wanted. The only real worry is not having a rez in dungeons, but if you bring a paladin or something then it's not a problem.
---
Smart lad &lt;3
---
Ooh rah gamers
---
classic itself actually isn't a niche at all, pvp servers are.
---
Being a jack of all trades is not part of vanilla class design. This is part of the reason why people are excited to go back.
---
typical girl gamer 
---
would be nice if women could stop actually proving misogynists right 99% of the time
---
Well everything is valid if you're casual enough. ;)
---
Chaturbate is free and is just 100% tits.
---
If you watch a streamer because you like their tits just go to a fucking free cam site.  There's actual unrestricted access to tits there.
---
I dont ever pop nor do I get retribution.  Speak for yourself not everyone
---
You can run both before needing to reset, and it will only count as one instance.
---
this may be a whoosh moment for me but, do druid bears use str as their main stat?
---
Cross-faction collusion I'm pretty sure is against ToS
---
**&lt;Nightshift&gt;** | Server: NA-PvP | Faction: Horde | Off Peak Hours
---
**Intro:** &lt;Nightshift&gt; is a guild for any Classic WoW players who want to play and raid during off peak hours on a US realm.
---
Regarding raid days and times, there is a survey in progress but the plan is to have 2 scheduled raids a week. At the moment the days most people can make are late Wed night/Thu morning, late Thu night/Fri morning and late Fri night/Sat morning. And so far 1-4AM/2-5AM/3-6AM EST raid times seems to be most popular.
---
But it's still early days, as the guild grows and the game progresses there's always the possibility of additional raid days and/or raid groups.
---
20/40man Raid loot will be distributed by a loot council - made up of officers, plus 1 random raid member for transparency.
---
**Looking for:** Anyone with an unusual schedule or in a different time zone who has a passion for Classic and a good attitude. We are mostly in need of dps as well as resto shamans, but all applications will be considered. If you're interested in an officer position, please be sure to provide more information on your application. Purely social members are always welcome.
---
**Moving forward:** We will seek to be a semi-hardcore raiding guild that pushes to clear the latest content all the while enjoying ourselves. We may strive for greatness but our primary goal will always be having fun!
---
**Apply:** If this sounds interesting please apply using the link below:

---
No one say their name two more times or we'll summon them.
---
The best times I’ve experienced came out of that box. 😊
---
Be a Troll Priest, cast Shadow Guard, get hit 3 times by the boss. Easy.
---
Go hard, go fast, go crazy is my personal approach!
---
Agreed, it's aimed at non raiders. But since it's phase 5, that means nobody will get the dungeon sets for 1-2 years after classic launch. Which is a damn shame and makes them worthless when they finally come around.
---
&gt; Dungeons feel simply amazing. Gathering group, traveling together, making plans on the fly, good stuff. Wipes happen but you talk to each other, change plans. I sap this, you poly that and we can make it TOGETHER.  
---
&gt;Getting horse in beta is soo rewarding =))) I immediately went exploring high level zones and died many times during my travels.  
---
&gt;Using auction house is something very rewarding - especially when you can afford new weapon or that quest item you are looking for.  
---
&gt;Weather effects are fantastic - huge rains, dust clouds, dark nights.  
---
&gt;I played with game music and it was very enjoyable.
---
Yep. Can't wait to relive this and be able to enjoy it with IRL friends at launch and otherwise with an audience!
---
Im depressed because I wanted beta to be a platform for me to start streaming and build a small community for the actual launch.
---
But how does she turn her character 180 instantly without moving the camera? 
---
She does it when she blinks.
---
to my knowledge the Ivory Raptor is not present in 1.12
---
&gt; Or given that TBC doesn't seem to garner the same passionate "#nochanges!" crowd maybe we could get a TBC:Remastered version that acknowledges that flying mounts, dailies, and badge gear were epic fails.
---
---&gt; Also the following massive downvotes against me/upvotes for anybody who responded to me lead me to believe that people aren't merely "Suggesting it".
---
It was the rogues distract that caused that.
---
That's why everyone is mad
---
Came here to post this....there are now more shit memes like this than actual complaints about streamers.
---
This is horrible. Turn on auto-loot.
---
#metoo
---
He's good enough to clear current tier mythic content while playing on a phone? And being a Lead Designer for WoW at the same time?! Well, goddamn me!
---
&lt;Calamity&gt; is a EU guild that is going to focus on competitive and efficient raiding.
---
Many of the guild's members have played at a high level on previous private servers as well as on retail vanilla. From our experiences, one factor that contributed massively to a guild’s success and positive raiding environment was developing and nurturing an ethos in the guild based upon working as a team.
---
Additionally, having a good core and community is important to us. Meaning that we want players who strive to better themselves and play for the greater good of the guild.
---
We're all playing this game because we enjoy it, a key aspect of enjoying the game is to raid with likeminded people who put in the same amount of time and focus into the game. Achieving this will allow us to enjoy raids further yet still maintain the competitive aspect.
---
While having previous experience of everything vanilla has to offer is beneficial, it is not mandatory. We have the knowledge and facilities to help you learn and improve as a player. All that we require is the ability to take and utilize constructive criticism, good attitude, be able to communicate, be reliable and have the ambition to get better and perform to your best abilities.
---
What can you as a raider expect from the officers and class leaders of Calamity:
---
Everyone in a position of either officer of class leader will have extensive knowledge and experience from various vanilla servers.
---
Your class leader will take the time to get to know you, what is important to you in the game and what your goals are as well as listen to any feedback you may have.
---
Officers will prepare raids setups before each raid so that all assignments are done to make the raids smooth and efficient for everyone.
---
As we will be using loot-council regarding raid drops you can expect that officers and class leaders have the long-term goals in mind when assigning loot.
---
We need members to understand that performance, attendance, improvement and attitude will directly reflect upon the loot received.
---
What is expected of a raider in Calamity:
---
First and foremost: teamwork. Working together as a team rather than 40 individuals is something we strive towards in the mindset.
---
Be competitive and motivated to always perform well.
---
Be able to use a microphone with push-to-talk and speak English.
---
Members should act appropriately in and outside of raids, when interacting in world chat or in dungeon groups.
---
Though Calamity is primarily a PvE guild we will be rolling on a PvP realm. While many of us enjoy engaging in PvP we expect members to behave in a manner that would not negatively reflect upon or impact the guild. Thus, if your intentions are to grief other players or guilds then either do it on a character that is not in any way associated with Calamity or look for a guild more suited to your interests.
---
Preparing accordingly with various buffs and consumables prior and during each raid.
---
In time we will expect all raiders to have the engineering profession for grenades, chickens, sapper charges and harvest reapers. We understand that certain specs require the use of an alternative profession(s) before making this switch.
---
Have a mature attitude and listen to the raid leader and officers directions. While we often joke around and have plenty of opportunities to socialise during the raid there are moments where you will need to listen and keep voice comms clear.

you never played on private servers so shut up
---
my vassal in asheron's call told me to check out the open beta, he was going rogue so i went druid for lots of stealth shenanigans
---
Don't give them ideas.
---
Please.
---
Steady Shot
---
If your guild truly needs a specific spec out of you for a raid, then they should be more than willing to pay your respec.  If you can't decide whether to tank or heal, maybe you should try BfA.
---
Nooooo don’t give them ideas 🤣🤣🤣
---
Troll Shaman, probably 30/ 0/ 21
---
That would be admitting defeat. They just come back for round 2.
---
Edited what comment?
---
When they’re finally all dead, and then you realize you’re out of breath and 30 yards under water inside a sunken boat... /cry
---
She's got style, she's got grace, she's a lady.
---
Anyone who gets it and can wear it will use it because they won't have anything better. But you are right, it doesn't seem to be designed with any class in mind
---
Yeah, I remember those names. SGE was big aswell, they had crazy RP rituals ging on
---
I think this one falls under griefing more than any other I have seen. This would probably result in a ban.
---
That’s not true at all.  The regular dungeon sets were in the game at launch, or very shortly after.  It was the quest line to upgrade them that launched with AQ.
---
And it will be the same for Classic from what I understand.
---
GaMEr gIrL
---
I know.
---
;)
---
It's a subreddit full of people that by the way they're behaving and talking about it, it seems that Vanilla WoW was the only time in their life they've experienced real happiness and haven't felt it again since.
---
It is genuinely pathetic and pitiful.
---
Fresh server
---
Sorry but what content was locked rep in wotlk? Was there some super secret raid I missed out on because I never farmed Tuskarr rep or whatever?
---
I would just call it time consuming. And retail and classic are so different from each other you might as well call it 2 different games. I've played on a private server and played on retail to raid mythic and do M+ and I know I'll be playing classic to just chill out a bit and enjoy the game. Classic is much easier but also relaxing at the same time.
---
It’s not optimal. Speed levelers always quested as a primary source of exp. There is some mandatory grinding to supplement questing but on the whole grinding is like taking the bus to work, working 9-5 and not getting a paycheck. In other words, slow, painful, boring and not worth the effort.
---
Shouldnt be but probably is because blizzard is catering to the carebear whining community.
---
Imo that's awesome way to play the game and fits perfectly with the rogue class.
---
Having said that you might get lucky on rppvp server(if there will be one)
---
&gt;https://willitclassic.com/
---
Look there.
---
There will be queues the first couple of days.
---
Layering is a very unique thing that I hope blizzard takes advantage of... they said they were able to open, close, increase and decrease population caps of layers of the fly...
---
My hope is that for day 1-2 they go bonkers with the amount of layers so the starting areas can take the normal 1-3 hours, it would have to be dozens of layers for that to happen and then after 3 or 4 days they would have to condense the layers hardcore.
---
If I could choose I'd say zero layering and just have a fat 6k+ queue on every server, but that's not going to happen.
---
With layering guaranteed, I just hope they are able to utilize it and make the 1-10 experience as little crowded as possible, but of course we're still going to have hundreds of players in each of the starting zones so we'll see how it goes.
---
Just to make sure you’re not misunderstanding... you are aware that the dungeon sets themselves were in vanilla from launch, and will be for Classic as well, right?
---
It’s only the upgrade questline that turns them into T 0.5 that launches with the AQ patch.  Your point still stands, but it sounds like you may not be aware that the sets will be avail as the T 0 or regular dungeon sets from launch.
---
Fair enough
---
Sounds supper fun tho, i recall in a game called archeage i was selling info of tradeships leaving ports and loads of other things :D
---
As side from saying shield block/slam, which is a writing error, you didn't prove him wrong. Sunder armor IS the spammable threat generator.
---
Good, fuck off!
---
Yes, you'd be banned. You can have a second account on the same pvp server if for some reason you wanted to play the other faction , but you cant do stupid shit like that.
---
And time consuming, there is hardly anything in classic that is hard to do lol. The difficulty of classic is grinding and spending a lot of time doing shit to get to your goals
---
Draenei.
---
We are going back home...
---
Do you want to farm gnomeregan every day during vanilla? If not then dont play feral dps.
---
The only issue is it's in phase 5, which means they won't be out for at least a year, maybe even two years. Which means, people who don't wanna raid, don't have this to do either.
---
The dungeon set is somewhat overpowered for MC and Onyxia, but it should be there for BWL in phase 3 IMHO.
---
No he didn't. It's too weak to be used on a raid boss. Hunter's Mark on the other hand.
---
it seriously does read like a bad copypasta
---
people like op make me feel ashamed to be a part of this community
---
Who are you correcting buddy
---
That is not relevant or even true, lmao. The people who seek out and take measures to play an illegal version of the game are not at all representative of the average person that will be playing classic.
---
No, ppl are mad because this is a change to original vanilla and they could SO fucking easily sell the non armored mount in phase 1. They just plain refuse to do it.
---
Thanks man! You too :-)
---
Yeah, people like her can stay with BfA and I don't mind that at all.
---
Id much rather just grind some mobs at 1 place for hours instead of running to 17 different zones following one of the guides
---
It isn't "if" classic will 100% be successful and populated for at least 2 years.
---
If they actually cater to the vocal minority and create TBC, make those servers separate and have all 3 of them be able to be transferred to.
---
I'd rather stick with classic with those that actually want vanilla and not the expansions.
---
 Imo that's awesome way to play the game and fits perfectly with the ~~rogue class~~ **Turbo Nerd you are IRL.**
---
FTFY
---
Not true. Not literally and not figurativelly.
---
Rather presumptious, but each to their own.
---
Why the hell roll on a pvp server when this is going to be your reaction?  There is a really easy solution to it - select a PVE server and you will never have to deal with this happening.
---
Messaged
---
They changed their TOA into a universla EULA. But here is relevant information for your question: [Blizzards Code of Conduct](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/42673)
---
### Cheating
---
You are responsible for how you and your account are represented in the game world. Cheating in any fashion will result in immediate action. Using third-party programs to automate any facet of the game, exploiting bugs, or engaging in any activity that grants an unfair advantage is considered cheating.
---
Exploiting other players is an equally serious offense. Scamming, account sharing, win-trading, and anything else that may degrade the gaming experience for other players will receive harsh penalties.  
---
# Behavior
---
Behavior that intentionally detracts from others' enjoyment (such as griefing, throwing, feeding, etc.) is unacceptable. We expect our players to treat each other with respect and promote an enjoyable environment. Acceptable behavior is determined by player reports and Blizzard's decision, and violating these guidelines will result in account and gameplay restrictions.
---
While we encourage you to report players that are behaving in a disrespectful manner, falsely reporting another player with the sole intent of restricting their gameplay is also unacceptable and will result in penalties to your account.
---
***If you're unsure if your actions violate this code of conduct, reconsider them. We reserve the right to restrict offending accounts as much as necessary to keep Blizzard games a fun experience for all players.***
---
everyone keeps saying horde outnumbers ally. but if we look at the old official date it was a 3 ally to 1 horde radio overall in classic wow. (thats why they gave horde belfs to level it out).
---
If we look at the most popular private servers data its overage 60% ally 40% horde.
---
Another proof girls shouldnt play. Or just play retail hehe.
---
I agree it would suck to not play on a pvp server. But if they want to run around with 50 of their friends ganking anyone they see in their way why shouldnt they be stream snipped? If people broadcast their location people have every right to use that against them because thats just poor defense on the streamers end. 
---
Streamers could go PVE though and tag themselves for PVP when they wanted so they have some control over the streamsnipping.
---
You couldnt be more wrong. I believe you when you say that you had feral dps outdpsed by tanks but those didnt know how to properly play feral or didnt care
---
Actually the surprise comes when they work.
---
This is why you don't just do something - you plan it out or have to spend hundreds of gold.
---
You aren't meant to be able to play every spec every day. 
---
It exists and you can play it in bfa.
---
&gt;reserved
---
You can also play the latest games with your friends who might not care to invest hundreds into every new console and constantly upgrade their pcs. It makes gaming a whole lot more accessible, which is a good thing.
---
What the actual fuck is wrong with you?
---
Is /s mandatory nowadays for all jokes big or small?
---
That's horse poo. Valor warriors with black hand doomsaw existed before aq
---
Don't. Logic doesn't work on the people watching these. For them it's probably more "personal" and a camsite would do away with their suspension of disbelief. I don't get it, but that's how it probably is.
---
Ill just stick with my tokens ah thank you very much.
---
the amount of people who genuinely think they're better than the 'fucking retail casuals' is insane
---
when it comes down to it we're all playing wow, get off your high horses you nerds
---
Yeah it wasn't all about efficiency back then... Was about fun.
---
Rerolling a Hunter in Beta because i thought only they get long caps, because my brother got one and i dont.
---
Well, you cant be punished without a challenge. Not sure what sort of logic that is. If it was truly easy you wouldn't call it punishing imo
---
I know you are trying to be facetious but you are kinda making my point. If you don't like those things then find something you do like. If you hate all those then maybe you would have more fun on another game. Which is fine, it's your leisure time you should enjoy it.

Raid Times: M TU W 7-10pm PST

System: Loot Council
---
\*\*About Us:\*\*
---
   Hi Everyone!  Incarnation is a Hardcore Alliance guild looking for passionate and competitive players for Classic WoW. Our goal is to raid and clear content efficiently while promoting a healthy community.  
---
   We are a fresh guild, meaning that we do not have “core members” or “clicks” yet like many other guilds. Just because we are fresh does not mean we lack experience. We have a wide range of experience ranging from World competitive (14th) Naxxaramas clears in Vanilla WoW, private server Naxxaramas clears, server first endgame content of different expansions of WoW; as well as multiple PvP achievements including but not limited to rank 14's in vanilla wow, rank 1 arena gladiators from various expansions and even pro gaming experience through various games.
---
   We do not expect all our recruits to have this level of experience, however we do have high expectations for all those interested in joining. 
---
\*\*Expectations\*\*  
---
   We expect all our recruits to know your class, game mechanics and how to progressively adapt into the later phases of Classic. 
---
   We are hardcore in the sense that we put a lot of time in preparation for the raid (farming consumables/pre-raid gear, knowing all boss mechanics) so that when we do zone in to a raid, we are fully prepared and ready to clear. We are raiding 3 hrs per day for only 3 days and not excessively long hours like some other hardcore guilds as we shouldn’t need to.
---
\*\*Goals &amp; Philosophy\*\*  
---
\-Build a positive and strong community.
---
\-Strive to effectively and efficiently utilize time invested in the game to be the top guild in the server.  
---

Thank you and we are looking forward to hearing from you!
---
Anyone from Scarshield Legion?
---
No. Heroic strike is faar better. You have dps warriors each apply one sunder at start of combat
---
Yeah and they use "don't wanna pressure players" as their cop-out excuse. So the lack of Ivory raptor/unarmored wolves and all the rest, is why people, myself included, are miffed. At least we can take solace by hating ourselves for months trying to get a pretty purply tiger.
---
Rogues are literally anti caster. In that they have access to so much control, casts can't get off to do damage. I can't believe I am having this discussion, but I will answer these questions honestly. 
---
   
---
I am not being snarky when I say this: if caster mobs give you trouble as a rogue, you are doing it very very wrong. As a class that not only can interrupt from gouge at level 5 and  kick at 12, but also get access to ccs such as sap and blind, not to mention kidney shot and mind numbing poison, you should destroy casters. Even elite casters are possible with proper bandage/consumables and rotating cc.   
---
Just so I can make it clear. If a mob us channeling a 3 sec cast, they aren't hitting you, if you kick it at the last .2 sec(latency depending), they will attack you for 5 sec, then try to cast again for 3 sec, you can gouge this, wait while you pool energy, then go back to beating em. That's already 11 sec of the. Only auto attacking you for 5 sec.   
---
Can further abuse this once you get kidney shot.  If you really need to get away, you have vanish, gouge(then Sprint), and crippling poison to try again or bumrush one mob out if a pack, reset, and do it again with one less enemy.
---
Currently playing a private server introducing my friend to the game and he decided to play warrior. Since he's going in with no knowledge prior, i'm not looking forward to trying to teach him how to properly tank lol. Probably will have to do some RFC runs with him using my higher level account
---
what's the ooga booga gang? i've heard of them but i dont know what they do
---
Yo sage. I try pressing the link but it says ‘not found’. Is it a problem on my end?
---
I have done this also when I was tired, this is why people put up cheap items up for a lot of gold to try to make gold off of people making a mistake.
---
Kanye Westfall 😂 you win the internet!
---
Lumberg still needs you to raid to work on Saturday
---
I'll never understand that thirst.
---
With the amount of retards I see here I would say yes
---
Interesting how you could get all the way to finding this sub, creating an account and posting a question... and not be able to find out if a 15 year old game has pvp.
---
The only race that matters IS horde.
---
Filthy alliance scum.
---
The kind of people who cried enough on the forums that blizz thought majority of people felt like it too.
---
Finally going home boys
---
It's not even new. Stadia is like the same thing as geForce Now, or PSnow. The only difference is that it aims at devices that can install stadia app, and can obviously connect and map controllers correctly. Or shadow, which just streams the whole PC over to you.
---
Else, beyond latency, there's also the problem of bandwidth. Not everyone is under fiber, and not everyone can afford a box on which WiFi won't be laggy once someone start a stream. You also have to be sure your devices are connected to wifi with the best bandwidth available (some router fall back on the 2.4GHz by default, even if a device can connect to the 5GHz one).
---
The world is not there yet, maybe all big cities from developped countries yes, but not the villages. France for example is aiming at 2030 for the whole territory to be covered by high speed internet. Yet, it's only available on big cities, or where there was enough money to afford one, given a big city nearby have it. It only starts to deploy outside the cities.
---
There is definitely a sexist component to the extreme hate this clip is producing. Has no one ever raged quit WoW because they were being camped while questing? lol. If people were tar getting me to specifically make my experience worse I'd get frustrated and log off too.
---
It's easier to find a casual raiding guild that will accept a MS warrior than a premade that want you without MS. Doing PvP in vanilla without a premade is kind of like pugging raids.
---
Flip a coin. Make horde heads and alliance tails. When the coin is in the air, you'll know which faction you really want to play on.
---
**&lt;Hate&gt; (EU, Horde, PvP server) is recruiting knowledgeable raiders.**
---
**About us:**
---
Back in the days of glory, &lt;Hate&gt; was one of the top dogs on Boulderfist-EU (2006). More than a decade later, friends and old guild members are excited to announce that &lt;Hate&gt; is still alive !
---
Having a fine legacy at both Raiding and PvP, &lt;Hate&gt; scourged Boulderfist-EU, being nicknamed the “High Warlords Guild”, since we had the biggest amount of R14 players (names like Quatro, Zoby, Efe, Artificial, Hiphopyoyo, High come to mind). On the PvE scene, we almost cleared AQ40 and reached Naxxramas, and if we wouldnt’ve been a bit late to the party, with TBC around the corner, these raids would’ve been toast too. On a side note, we invented several strategies that are used even now, ahh, the times when everything was at first hand and you couldn’t possibly find tips and tricks like today...
---
Our plan is to rebuild &lt;Hate&gt; and push the envelope even further, aiming to assemble a very competitive raid that will last from first UBRS raid till Naxxramas. However, should be noted this time we’lll use a slight different approach and not go for the full hardcore experience. Instead, &lt;Hate&gt; will start as a semi-hardcore guild, thriving to build a really tight community of talented players that will be able to overcome everything. Now that we are older (but wiser!), we are fully aware that WoW Classic is a game that doesn’t evolve around who clears Molten Core fastest, but around which guilds still exist by the time serious stuff like AQ40 and Naxxramas is released. And as you probably know by now, statistics are quite grim: over 70% of the starting raiding guilds fail at clearing Blackwing Lair. Hence our approach.
---
**​Our future raid times:**
---
&lt;Hate&gt; is going to have 3-4 hours raiding sessions, for 3 times a week (2 weekdays + 1 weekend day), starting late afternoons / early evenings. More closer to release we will update this post with new info.
---
​So, if you trully know that you are a talented player, don’t be shy and apply at [https://www.hate-guild.eu/](https://www.hate-guild.eu/) ​ or check our Discord here [https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK ](https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK) 
---
May this be the start of something truly spectacular.

I enjoyed reading this. Thank you for sharing! It was really well written, too!
---
We've already determined it wasn't funny. Might as well go ahead and explain your joke now.
---
I can't imagine streaming on a pvp server if you aren't 100% familiar with Vanilla.
---
God rest all the future slain wrath / cata kids...
---
Came for this. Was not disappointed.
---
I tremble in the pools of blood dropped by the savages of the Alterac Valley
---
Nice one,really got me there.
---
How is it any different than investing 18 hours a day killing people for few pixelated letters in front of your name or grinding consumables and putting up with 39 idiots for hours multiple times a week to get a new piece of gear though?
---
It's a mmorpg meaning it doesnt have a set progression curve but rather opens up world for you to play any way you friken want.
---
There's no such thing as a PvP realm any more. This isn't a discussion about classic, where there is no flying, full stop.
---
And of course it concerns PvE players, you're all arguing for removing or nerfing flying across the game - which is why I suggested mixing it up so some people can have flying and others not.
---
Wow this video really brought out some bad traits of people on this sub lol
---
you'll be fine. I played a hunter main in vanilla and raided naxx. While I was behind the good mages, I could hold my own, and was a good player. I turned up on time, had all the consumables I needed (ie food buffs, pots / exilers), gear all properly enchanted..... and I wasnt a drama queen. 
---
If you are in a good guild with like minded people and know how to play your class well, you'll still do well. Your DPS is not that far off, and only the top guilds who min/max everything will have an issue with you. 
---
Also, if you are all decked out in T2 and more, and still PVPing, you'll hit fine, and still do good damage.  Again, a good hunter who is a team player is highly valued.
---
Who's favorite race is actually Dwarf?
---
I was like you. I played Horde only for vanilla through a month into Cata. Recently I started dicking around on servers trying to pick a main. I played Alliance toons. My thought was since I'm going to roll horde, this is a good time to see what life on the other side is like. 
---
It's better. The zones are better. The music is peaceful. Not everything  is a brownish reddish rock. I even grew to like some of the races, though Dwarf I still cant stomach. 
---
I'm not going back to Horde. I tried playing it to reconnect with my roots, and it just felt wrong.
---
You only really need the defense cap when tanking super hard-hitting (melee) bosses like Mograine in the 4 horsemen fight, 1 or 2 BWL bosses, and I think a few bosses in AQ20 and ZG.  With the exception of Mograine you can still kill the other bosses if you're not defense capped. 
---
Defense does 2 things - it provides increased chances for your RNG mitigation. Dodge/block/parry all scale equally per point of defense, .04% per point. So 25 defense gives you 1% to all 3 stats. It also works towards lowering the chances that a mob will land a critical hit on you.  At 440 defense, you will be immune to critical hits. You can also mitigate critical hits by having very high shield block %. A blocked attack cannot crit. If you don't have the defense gear, try to stack +shield block % and ALWAYS make sure you pop shield block when it's up when tanking a raid boss.
---
I think the best strategy is to start as early as possible and to get ahead of the leveling mob.
---
That's massively different than changing very specific parts of classes.
---
I've done sub variations as well, it should be even easier as sub against casters. People have it in their mind that rogues number one threat is damage. It's not. It's them making 2 players you there and watch while blinded and sapped while you beat their friend, vanishing to sap the blind while you kill the second, then working on the third.    
---
Rogue control is scary in live and in Vanilla it's on a whole different level.
---
I want to read all of it!
---
thats actually "worse" than that but you got the idea
---
Those are going to be long-ass dumps and showers
---
Well, take a look at every guide there is about tanking in vanilla. Not sure how it is in retail now but Sunder was the best threat generator you could spam (outside of Revenge and SS).
---
Rogues doing a 1 point Expose Armor would still eff up those Fury Warriors so the trolling is still on point! :D
---

Is the beta only a PvP server? I'll never understand why people who get salty about this kind of thing play on a PvP server.
---
If they don't, just gather your community and select a regular pvp server and take it over. They can rename it later
---
Just watching this is incredibly frustrating.
---
I levelled 1-20 on a private server just to familiarise myself with the starting zones. In Westfall, there was a rarely a moment during the day where every mob in the entirety of the zone wasn't dead. It's incredibly busy on there at the moment.
---
Burn it with fire!
---
Elemental shaman?
---
Really the more I see this the more I am considering it for my warlock or mage. Seems like a good way try and get some world drops by just constantly killing shit.
---
Blasphemy.
---
Go hard or go home, right?
---
Log in at midnight hopefully, i say hopefully as if anyone remembers the gates opening for BC then lol its going to be a rough ride. Reserve a few names for alts. Take my main as quickly as i can to level 10 (which i've been practicing on private servers) to get away from the mass carnage that's going to happen in the starter zones for the next week or two, which ive accomodated for with a couple of days off work so i can then leisurely (hardcore it some more) quest at my own pace, all whilst being a 40 year old dad, husband and senior IT manager. Yes us oldies are coming back too bitches, make way millennials.
---
Imagine being that much of a loser
---
These people should be banned from wow and forced to go out and improve their lives so actual women will like them
---
I like the ud epic mounts the best! The skulls and the shiny 🔥👌
---
Yes she sounds whiny, but what would "good old vanilla pro" do?
---
There's absolutely nothing you can do if you get targetted by max level player of opposing faction. It's even worse when he can check your specific location and follow your every step effortlessly (that was not possible in vanilla obviously).
---
I guess shitting on gamer gurls is trendy now, but even if she was multi R1 glad, how are you supposed to counter rogue 20 levels higher than you?
---
There's NOTHING you can do about it.
---
Looking for guild: NA, Alliance, PVP, raid times 8pm est but my availability is wide open almost every day and time to play, prefer most classic loot raid and dungeon loot systems with the exception of round robin, looking to play mage(started in BC as mage, played it in the beta stress test and retail). Please drop a pm or Discord information with a time to see if I be the right fit for your guild.
---
DAE hate streamers. Retail stupid classic good
---
Hey man, really nice post. Sounds like you are experiencing the game to its fullest. The challenges of questing, and navigating through Azeroth, makes the world seem dangerous and huge! 
---
The play style of each class is so much more dynamic when you have to use all of your abilities, and items to survive. 
---
Have fun man, thanks for the read.
---
Charisma ? Damn.. I’m too old to see it then.. 
---
I am a huge fan of WoW, I am hyped by classic but I can’t stand this guy.
---
Hunters are like the DPS version of Druids. You'll never top the charts,  it's probably better to bring a different class in terms of value per second... but you bring enough unique utility that it counteracts the the lower DPS/HPS
---
I would level my bank alt to 5 so it can disenchant.
---
I know , now ppl do 30 min bwl speed runs xD
---
It's really not bad at all to just hit up the fruit vendor for a few stacks every now and then
---
Anything. Then play on a Normal or PvE Server and avoid PvP.
---
I honestly think Zulian tiger would be the dream
---
So many /crys
---
What ever big streamer is on that server that’s what the chat is going to look like. I won’t be there.

---
Troll female is an awesome model
---
Would Angwe be banned today?
---
I didn't say it was hard to understand. I said it was a dumb piece of logic that has no real world application.
---
Maybe she's bad (I don't know her) but out of curiosity, how would you counter stealthed rogue who attacks you after you have 2 mobs on you AND is 18 levels higher?
---
Ele shaman provides the burst damage for Horde in PvP, as well as purges, off- heals and other utility.
---
Damn I am mixing things up then. That's my bad, I dunno why I thought "tier 0" aka dungeon set 1 was part of the "tier 0.5" aka dungeon set 2 update.
---
Hmm that's my bad folks, thia changes it alot. However, I still feel like the dungeon set 2 fits better with the BWL update, then AQ update, it's just to late down the road.
---
With current 1.12 meta (and no world buff and on single target)
---
In MC after few lockout:
---
Warrior&gt;rogue&gt;hunter&gt;mage&gt;lock
---
Warrior dealing 100% more damage than hunter on single target if recklessness is up other wise 50%, rogue doing +25% more, mage doing 15% less, warlock 40% less.
---
In BWL: 
---
Warrior&gt;rogue&gt;hunter/mage&gt;warlock
---
Warrior dealing 125% more if reck up otherwise 75%, rogue 50% more, mage 10% less, warlock 40% less
---
In AQ:
---
Mage with ignite&gt;warrior&gt;rogue&gt;fire mage/hunter&gt;warlock
---
Mage who got the ignite 1st will do 200% more, warrior 150% more, rogue 75% more, mage who never got the ignite will be equal to hunter, warlock will be 10% less
---
In Naxx gear:
---
Hunter will be last.
---
Note, that by hunter i mean someone who mastered his pet and his rotation, other hunters will be under retapaladin.
---
just sayin... someone that plays games for a living doesn't have time for a game?
---
She sounds like a South Park character.
---
Also, I'd like to know who the fuck watches this trash. 
---
Also, I already have the answer to that question. It's the pathetic white knights in this thread who are donating in hopes she'll say their name so they can clip it and masturbate to it for the next couple of days.
---
Disgusting.
---
I appreciate that analogy.
---
Yep I mixed things up there mate. My bad.
---
Locks where sad for leveling in pvp if you where not topped off. But I also remember the other locks and myself in MC and BWL making a game about pulling trash off tanks with raw DPS. Its only when we did it in AQ, people other then the tanks would get pissed off.
---
Locks are worth it in the end if you can make it.
---
Practice
---
Yeh it's bullshit alright. I mixed things up.
---
Do you guys not have laptops
---
I played on Frostmourne horde in a guild called Dropbears, any relation?
---
Good thought, knowing that ultimately either choice will appear will usually force you to have an opinion about it. I'll eventually resolve to this if I'm unable to decide the normal way.
---
How do you think gold income is choosing this method?
---
It's such a shame all that stuff doesn't stack. Not from a balance or gameplay perspective, just from a theorycrafting perspective. Imagine how fast you could delete someone with a nice windfury crit on a big two hander w/a damaging proc, buffed with a big weapon damage enchantment, a weightstone, and shadow oil or something. Poof. Gone.
---
The open beta. Just following a trail of players to Ogrimmar, passing Ashenvale. Had no clue what to do or where I was. Just following the horde to kill some Horde.
---
Seems silly to start counting on the first flip and just ignore all the failed attempts in-between and say "hey it's only 1/15000 chance" when in reality you will only get this jump 5^7
---
Why does she have beta invite and I dont
---
Basically Hunters get a mere +2ap upgrade from bis BWL gear to bis AQ40 gear. Meanwhile other classes get cool upgrades. You'll still be able to make top 10 dps or so but that's about it. In Naxx you get T3 which is cool, and the KT xbow eventually, but those only keep hunters in the same range compared to other classes by which I mean you'll still be working your ass off to make top 10 or so.
---
Personally I think it's not as bad as people claim, but yeah as the guild gets into late AQ40 and early naxx they'll boot spare hunters for better dps if they can.
---
How the heck do you handle corpse camping? I thought logging off for a while is common practice.
---
I have a 60 Rogue on a PServer. There is no single spec where you will dominate both PVE and PVP. You gotta pick one or respec.
---
Honestly that seems to be just about all Activision does these days.
---
LOL no... if anything I believe people are very much underestimating the amount of staying power that classic is going to have.
---
There will be a drop off, but there will always be new players joining between launch and naxx.

From what I've been studying, Hunters seem to cap around 1.2k dps or so come Naxx/AQ era. This is BiS territory too. Warriors/Rogues for example, can easily hold 2.1k dps. You'll end up as a middle of the road DPS, beyond hybrid classes, but behind other damage classes, but still useful and man you'll have an easy time doing it. You also have some good and sometimes specifically needed utility to boot.
---
It’s like this:
---
What are the odds of rolling 3 of the same number on a dice in a row.
---
Since you done care about which number it is the first roll can be any number, really your saying what are the odds of rolling a specific number 2 times.
---
So your equation would be (1/x)^(n-1) or (1/6)^2
---
This is how calculations are constructed for calculating sequences of numbers.
---
I believe it’s online multiplayer games that people are mostly concerned about.
---
Well in the end Vanilla was never hard either. What some people misleadingly call "hardness" is just combination of two things. First is time consumption. Retail players know how easily you can get pretty good gear. In Vanilla it took a lot of time to get gear. Mostly because it was more rare. You did run dungeon with 5 people really many times and when item finally drops, you still have to win the roll (or have some kind of deal if you are running with friends). Getting gear was not hard but it took a long time.
---
Second thing was that there basically wasn't noobs and pros.. only noobs. Game was new to all of us. We didn't know the most effective ways. We didn't have simulation software that gave us best items in blink of an eye. We went there and we tried. We did stupid things. Game wasn't hard, we just didn't have as much information as we do have today.
---
So I'd say Vanilla definitely was easy as well. But as it was more time consuming you felt a way more accomplishment when you finally got that one piece of item.. even if it was just level 55 ring from dungeon. It might still be on your character for a very long time before you managed to get upgrade.
---
here's the really dumb and ignorant question:
---
why fucking play on a PVP server then?
---
It really will.
---
Druid bear would use this. Str &gt; Agi for the most part if I am remembering correctly.
---
Is your favorite movie still Shrek 2 ?
---
Unless you are a Hunter, mage, or warlock.* (For easily soloing elites)
---
If you are bad at pvp and play a class that can move fast and self heal to get out of trouble. You dont have to fight just run away and hide instead.  
---
I think druid would be a good choice.
---
Sure. But wow might still be your favorite game despite all its flaws, and if im gonna play it im gonna play it in a way that i enjoy which is progressing my character in an efficient way. You are shutting down criticism, you are basically saying that if someone doesnt like something he should just stop playing the game.
---
Ok. I'm rolling warlock now
---
He doesn't kill the bosses until they've been nerfed 3 times 2 weeks before the next raid I wouldn't call tbat current.
---
If they intended for you to be able to extort the enemy faction, you’d be able to talk and trade with them. Don’t you think the barrier might be there for a reason?
---
Scanning the ah takes ZERO time away from the game. You do it in your downtime. You know, humans take bathroom breaks? And they also eat food. And lots of other things. People go back to the city all the fucking time and take a break. You scan the ah. Boom youre done and you have relevant data for at least a week. Use your fucking brain before replying to me. Cheers indeed. And no one mentioned  leveling enchanting BRO. You level your bank alt to 5 and youre done. You need level 1 enchanting to disenchant, and that's it.
---
Alts.
---
They are too strong for launch.
---
Yeah but the odds on that dropping and the odds on winning it, keep dreaming lol

A lot of good advice from you guys. After pondering about this for most of my workday, I've decided to go Alliance. The reason for this is just the fact that it's what I have more experience on, and I've enjoyed the zones and cities more than their Horde equivalents.
---
Thank you to everyone who responded. Your input was very valuable to me. I do not regret posting this as my first one here, even though it was a difficult question to answer in the first place, and its all thanks to you guys being friendly about it.

If you can't tank a dungeon in heal spec as a druid it means either you're retarded, you have no tanking gear, or both.

Try everquest if you think vanilla is challenging

Is there a guide on how you did this?  I'd LOVE to know!!

This won’t be popular but...

I’d really like to be able to use action house / mindlessly grind while on public transport.

---
I played a gnome rogue back in ‘05 to lvl 60. Loved being able to stealth and ambush casters in world PVP. 
---
*Decided to do a free trial yesterday and do a gnome warlock, actually really enjoying it. Seems like you can do multiple mobs at once and imagine the fear would be quite fun in PVP.
---
I hit you up on pm. lmk!

Retail is very easy on the low end - that is, all the content accessible by everyone is very easy. Normal/heroic dungeons, leveling and questing are all easy. On the other hand, the top end content (mythic raiding and high m+) are far more challenging than anything in classic  WoW. The current setup in retail WoW makes it so that the player has an easy road to get to the hardest available content, hence the easy gear from warfronts, world quests, and so on.
---
Whereas in classic WoW, the hard part is obviously the leveling, the grinding, the fact that quest drops aren't high % drops and so on. In the top end however, raids and dungeons are very easy. Almost no mechanics compared to the simplest BFA bosses. What makes classic raiding hard is that it's very time consuming, especially when having to farm gold for consumables. In BFA, a raid-logger can do just as well as the player that farms M+ 8 hrs/day, while in classic, a raid-logger will be easily left behind by someone who farms consumables and runs dungeons for 8 hrs/day
---
Epic Mount at 60, more or less without exaggeration. Especially if you choose skinning along the way.
---
Lucky, and you get an epic or two.

I don't have anything against streamers but I can break down why people are hating in this situation.
---
It's because she's getting all salty about it and seems to be having a bit of a whinge. Pro tip to any streamer; laugh off things like this - it's endearing rather than annoying.
---
You are also wrong. When geared for TPS you heroic strike over sunder. Its actually better. Early on sunder is better, but as you gain gear heroic strike will outperform sunder, so you only use sunder as a ragedump. Also Shield block is actually for threat as it procs revenge.
---
Due to how bad retail is and the lack of a decent MMORPG competitor, I think classic will be really popular.
---
using a tablet you cheater!! who the fuck has a 10 inch phone?
---
Nightmare fuel
---
To each their own? Lets not start a superiority complex just because we play classic :D
---
Protection Paladin. We’ve been at the top, we’ve been at the bottom. Doesn’t matter to me, it’s what I love.
---
To top it off, most classic raids were easy as shit compared to now. The hard part was getting in. The same people telling themselves they're playing the "harder wow" are the same ones who havent touched a raid or mythic dungeon. Classic was punishing and had less rewards making when you got them feel better. Classic is for people with a large time sink, not the more skilled or anything of the sort.
---
Every online community is toxic so long as the ability to post anonymously exists.
---
People leaving Shadowbane for WoW.
---
You don't really do T0.5 for the set, but for the extra bosses, and cool items they drop. Well kinda, something like that.
---
Wowhead has a classic version.
---
Lmao what exactly gave you that impression from the 10 second clip?
---
/sigh and /laugh at them for ganking with that much of a level difference.
---
Find somewhere else to quest and/or call my guild to come help.
---
But someones gotta win it right? Could be you
---
The difference is that farming for raids you can do every day a little bit, do everything in one day, alternate between doing or not doing. While with daily quests you're gonna have that daily routine.
---
Are you twelve?  This seems quite a bit like projection.
---
Yeah, but if the battle starts out and you're already at max range, that makes it more difficult. That's what I'm talking about.
---
Not everything is supposed to be worth grinding, it was added later for different type of player. Loads of ppl did that just for fun. Not every last part of the game is supposed to be played by everyone.
---
Its vanilla.
---
Why are people getting mad if someone doesnt want to play classic lol...

On top of my friends being there, Horde to me feels right, it's always been my favorite faction. However it doesn't feel right that I don't main a dwarf. Khaz Modan is my favorite region, ironforge best city (tied with org maybe), dun morogh has my fave soundtrack in the game too. Man it's hard to pick one

&gt; Weapon Skills: We do not need to level weapon skills when in Feral form, we are always considered to be max skill for our level. A level 60 Druid with 1 point of staff skill in Kitty form is presumed to have 300 weapon skill when usings claws.
---
Given this, aren't Bears going to be penalized for being unable to bridge [the weapon skill gap](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-weapon-skills) between themselves and a raid boss?
---
&gt; This means that the so-called “hit cap” is in effect 9% rather than 8% for a player with 300 Weapon Skill fighting a level 63 monster with a Defense Skill of 315. With a Weapon Skill of 305, such as from Sword Specialization (Humans) or Axe Specialization (Orcs), this hit modifier is no longer in place against +3 level monsters, provided that you are using the appropriate weapon type to gain the passive bonus. Needless to say, this makes +Weapon Skill very good against raid-level monsters.

I never even figured out what that was about? What does that mean lol
---
I'm talking about Wikipedia, not a game database.
---
I know this sub is a circlejerk against streamers (especially those who dont like vanilla/ didnt play back then). But this is completely fine, she tried classic, doesnt like it and went back to bfa, she didnt demand any changes or cry on some forums.
---
She wont play anymore and if blizz see's that the beta pop is too low they will invite more new players
---
What is it you're worried about? Raid spots?
---
Explain how to kill the ooga gang solo
---
stop playing in pvp servers and streaming it to the public you lil bitch. call the whambulance
---
The short list is being deep frost with high level engineering.
---
&gt; Yeah and they use "don't wanna pressure players" as their cop-out excuse.
---
For some reason blizzard doesnt have any problems when ppl do WS grind or do ZG for ever to get even slightly different mount. Because those take a long time and that equals a multiple month or year sub.
---
That excuse they said clearly showed that the same idiots that ruined the game are still there.
---
I'm not good at making friends so I'll go healer and let other people be friends with me lol.
---
Great kid, don’t get cocky.
---
Post master is the MVP, going through all the dead bodies of everything I killed to make sure I got all the good stuff. What a champ. If only they would bring the loot-a-rang back as a tool everyone could use. But that was too fun.
---
Thanks for the positive post mate. Too much negativity about Classic has been pretty frustrating. The game and the community sounds exactly like “how it used to be”, which is what so many of us fell in love with back in 2004. 
---
If only I could dedicate 8-12 hrs a day playing, like back in the day!!! That’s the dream.....
---
As a lock?
---
You actually caring about this is even more sad tbh.
---
Because it's so difficult to keyclone the same ability on 5 casters and oneshot any mob/player.
---
Gearing is a different story, I agree that gearing a multibox team is almost as difficult as gearing 5 alts one by one.
---
I have no idea what the fuck you're talking about, my dude.
---
Explain why you're in this thread white knighting for that twitch thot solo, though.
---
Fun for some people is doing something they consider meaningful within the context of the game. Hard to grasp?
---
Not exactly. This turned into a bit of a slippery slope discussion way back. The original material is that dailies are the most efficient but OP hates them. My point is you don't always have to run the most efficient if it's not enjoyable to you. If you are someone who likes mount collecting or transmogs or LFG/R or crafting and gathering etc, you should do that so the time spent is fun. What I am saying is there is a lot to do and if you don't have fun with one, do something you do enjoy. With you're earlier comment where you listed a bunch of things someone might not enjoy...that's when I say maybe it's not the game for you if there's nothing you enjoy. 
---
Critism is fine, but saying you hate the most efficient method and it's a chore (when others may enjoy it) is unproductive.
---
Unless you're logging in only to raid I don't see why so many people care about being top DPS. The class is still brought into endgame raids and is amazing in all other aspects of the game.
---
Yeah I completely disagree. I've played Enh for most of my WoW career, and Vanilla enh is subpar as fuck. Sure u can make a video of crazy 1 shots, but in reality it's RNG that barely procs after the Nerf, which is what we're getting. Along that, you get kited to oblivion
---
Just pvp more. You will get better and have less anxiety when someone attacks. Druid or rogue are decent choices as both can just stealth and hide
---
No but thats something you can work around,like many other things in the game
---
Thanks for adding context. I believe 95% of clips are taken out of context just in their nature of being a clip alone.
---
Your last point is spot on. I’ve seen so many poster say that getting camped is normal in Vanilla, and it is, and they always say you can just log out and do something else like play on an alt. That’s pretty much what she did and people are calling for Blizzard to revoke her beta access? Lmao
---
Absolutely nothing wrong with her reaction. /r/classicwow has become a fucking shithole
---
It's a good copypasta if it is one
---
shadow priest, you have 4 important buttons to figure out and you'll beat most people 1v1, it is by far the most powerful class for a bad player
---
Delete this abomination right now!
---
She's pretty doe :)
---
Nah it's correct.
---
1,000 - 2,000 damage averages at 1,400 to 1,600 per swing at .50 sec a swing that's 3,000 DPS.
---
Paladin is really annoying to kill especially 1v1, and if you end up doing some pvp you can just be a pocket healer
---
Its also hillarious that mods allow this, i guess the rules dont apply if you insult streamers. But they do ban legitimate members of this subreddit for minor reasons without responding to their appeal so i dont know what im expecting
---
Classic is gonna be toxic as F
---
All I see is a pole in that image so assumed it was a mage, cos what retard would play a lock at such a low lvl? You gotta boost those straight to 60
---
I didn't say that you can just raid log, I said that if people think that on live you can just raid log and do weekly myth+, than you can say the same about classic. Maybe I don't know many things about vanilla, but you don't know anything about BfA, you can't get gold doing nothing like in WoD or Legion. It's possible on retail to just log on raid, but you have to farm ap/gold and other shit in advance, and the same can be applied to classic.
---
I helped my guildmates alt with mythic+ last week, and they helped my alt, I guess you just have a shitty guild, don't blame game on it.
---
My best azerite piece comes from Engineering and best trinket comes from Alchemy, so I would just say again that you don't know anything about retail.
---
And answer honestly, do you really think that vanilla raids are hard AND REQUIRE CONSUMABLES to be cleared? The only thing that you right about is old raids being irrelevant on retail (and it was a thing for 10 years, not just in BfA)
---
Over the last couple weeks I’ve been leveling a couple new alts just out of boredom.  It really struck me how easy the game is now.  Granted I have heirlooms, but I never even remotely feel in danger.  It’s so easy, that it really makes it mind-numbingly boring.  We even have a mount at level 1, for Christ’s sake!
---
Classic can’t get here fast enough!
---
It's a game but if you're bad because you don't want to learn you're a PoS
---
Imo you are underestimating the wow classic community 
---
You'll, probably able to do it once, cuz you're gonna become the black sheep of the realm
---
&gt; We are not going to discuss raid specs. Raiding is for getting gear, for killing players. Please dont go down that route.
---
What?
---
Fair enough, if they indeed get money from fighting goldsellers/botters.
---
I wasn't thinking about limiting accounts, but to limit actual multiboxing, like private servers do, would in my opinion be good for the game.
---
But PvE servers are boring.  I'd rather get destroyed on a PvP server than play on a carebearish PvE server where there's no sense of danger in the world
---
Thank you Mr. Sherlock.
---
Who hurt you? What's wrong, why you have to be so mad? :)
---
I'm with you. If you "crave a challenge" you should be playing Mythic+ or trying to no-death run Sekiro with no upgrades or something. Not levelling your ninth hunter in Classic WoW.
---
I think it'll be fine.
---
People will be doing this regardless of Honor because fighting other players is FUN. You might see a slight uptick but there will be plenty of action before the honor system hits.
---
I've leveled on some PvP heavy servers back in Vanilla and while it can get messy, overall it didn't allow things down much and just added to the experience.
---
I've been debating between mage or warlock. I am now sold.
---
I loved stacking portals on top of each other so it was like portal roulette. One to stonard and the other to orgrimmar. Especially after raids.
---
not realistic
---
It depends on how flexible you are as a person and your ability to overcome and adapt to situations. 
---
Whether you yourself is a PvP god and can indulge in a bit of fun instead of bumrushing to 60.
---
Whether you can find safety in numbers and quest in groups.
---
Whether you're willing to leave a spot and find a more isolated less known or more tedious place to grind instead of more popular quest hubs.
---
At the end of the day it's entirely up to how you can overcome an obstacle.
---
It's a challenge you won't get on a PvE server. On a PvE server, your biggest challenge is whether you can tag a mob or not.
---
Class wont matter until you learn to bind your abilities and are able to press every single one of them without moving your hand out of WASD position, or looking at your keyboard. Also your right hand should nevber leave your mouse. All your turning should be done with the mouse. You should be strafing on A and D, not turning. Aaaaaaand, if you still suck.. idk mate, stick to solitaire?
---
In the end we are all just playing with pixels, nobody wins :D
---
How do I do this? I’m currently without a computer and would still like to enjoy classic wow
---
Tanking isn't actually hard even if you're new. Just play it super safe, make sure you don't pull extra packs (pull with ranged weapon), wait for healer mana, and so on. Regular trash mobs are very rarely particularly dangerous, so even if your dps pull aggro on stuff that's mostly on them and you shouldn't stress too much about it, the healer can deal with it. Depending on the dps you're playing with, keybinding skull and so on for a kill prio target might make your job a lot easier (predictable threat). 
---
Obviously you can do a more or less good job, but just being an "ok" tank that people are happy to run dungeons with is really easy. 
---
Also, don't bother with shield block, waste of rage in dungeons except for proccing revenge. And even then, cleave might be a better use of rage.
---
Bbnnn
---
I'm just so glad of all the women I've played with none of them have been whiny bitches like this.
---
I've heard so much shit about women causing guild drama and never understood why it was such a big deal. But now I see why.
---
If you have kids this post could be used against you to prove that you're an unfit parent.
---
Wouldn’t you essentially need gigabit internet to play an FPS over stream? How big do they think that market is?
---
Come on Lake, just answer the noobs plea for guidance.   
---
"Play a Mage..."
---
No, whats pathetic are the neckbeards getting angry over someone not liking the same game as they do...
---
Hell yeah can't wait
---
Seriously this, what the fuck man. How do you even survive at that point?
---
Holy paladin. Just spam heals on your melee friends and enjoy never dying. If you get nervous, just play more pvp. Try to remember that dying doesn’t really matter, you’ll respawn and get another shot. Even if you’re getting dominated just accept that you’ll die a lot and eventually you’ll start to catch on and be much more comfortable.
---
Welp, couple of minutes with nothing to do while waiting in a hotel lol
---
And I'm a huge lore nerd and love MC for its lore the most. The war of three hammers is my favourite piece of WoW history.
---
Questing where someone is corpse camping has a fairly predictable outcome.  Move along if necessary.  Not that tough to avoid.
---
Hellllll yeah brother
---
Difficult to tell, when she has more paint on her face than a Buick.
---
Again, fun for me might be progressing my character. The fun part at the end outweighs the chore to get there. Doesnt mean the system isnt trash.
---
Warlock//shadow priest
---
MuH tOxiCiTY
---
Warlock with SL is very good. Even in R10 PvP gear. You'll survive by attrition most fights.
---
Go back to where you belong
---
It's going to be very difficult 47+ (or whatever the cutoff is for gaining honor at 60, don't remember off the top of my head).
---
It won't be impossible because you always have the option to run instances to 60. You can also try to level in less populated zones, since the 60s will try to maximize their gains by farming where the most people are.
---
Why would you judge someone of a short clipp of someone who is getting ganked?
---
Anything you want and duel a lot for practice, at all levels for fun ^^
---
Jeez, it's like I can smell your body odor through your comment.
---
so are you suggesting that stoneform is for noobs and sm for people who know what they're doing?
---
Wait a sec. Me explaining why dude is wrong makes me mad? You 14 or just a crybaby?
---
For sure, I'm just kind of thinking - okay we are near the end of phase 1, MC and Ony are available, but anyone who only wants to pvp will be raiding (maybe) then specifically going out to pvp
---
Maybe it will just be increased a little, but I think a lot of people will be interested in ranking those few weeks without having bgs.
---
r/incel is leaking
---
I think they were called "meeting stones"
---
of course, I was just pointing out that it's kinda funny for someone who plays video games all day to say they don't have time to play one
---
So you're fighting 2 mobs at the same time (which is not trivial on it's own in vanilla), stealthed rogue 18 levels above you ambushes you and you pwn them all at the same time because of engineering tools?
---
Not that I don't believe you, but I'd love to see that.
---
So you just gonna sit for hours and hours getting coprse ganked by 3 rogues 10+ levels above you? She is salty because she logs out for a while? Allrighty then.
---
Well, I can tell you two things that ARENT on my list of how to handle the situation
---
1) log out.  
---
2) play retail.
---
Yes...what that reply says is that 23 is incorrect. In fact, the number needed *is* 24.
---
To be fair, the vast majority of people on this forum are trash tier and would probably struggle with mechanics even in LFR. Plenty of 30+ year olds acting like they're 12, pretending to be experts on everything to do with classic wow. 
---
Stop being so salty. Stop worrying so much about beta. You'll get to be terrible when classic comes out. :)
---
Haha, yeah women should cater to your narrow definition of attractive.
---
This.  i was thinking about how thats not actually that much slayer
---
OMFG THIS IS WHAT I FUCKING NEEDED!!!!
---
No you wouldnt. 
---
They have given info on minimum speeds required.
---
If I just said "Ele is great in pvp, wtf are you talking about?"  
---
You, or some other idiot would chime in that they were talking about raiding, and then I'd have to explain how the game is not just about raiding.
---
Agreed but that's the regular notion for a pvp server - I'm thinking there is going to be a crazy amount of organized pvp holding zones while people try to specifically rank while bgs aren't available :)
---
Yes lol :p
---
instead of her being a whining lil girl she could have just asked for people in chat to come pvp that rogue classic players love world pvp someone would have shown up eventually, hell shes in a guild she could have just asked them for help lol...but instead she got way too upset over a rogue ganking players in redridge. 
---
my brother use to camp redridge on his level 49 rogue twink for months on end back then and people eventually just stopped questing there shit was hilarious.
---
Mods ban his thread please.
---
At this point, it’s looking like the only reason that I’d want a Blacklist addon is if it blacklists people who post on this sub frequently. There are SOME good people here but if this thread is anything to go on, avoiding all of the absolute spergs would greatly improve my community experience.
---
The toxic mist keeps all the babies who can't take the stench far away.
---
Ayyy there it is, the true colors!
---
I just don't understand why there needs to be a guide to this sort of thing? Are people that inept? Just play, have fun, ignore flamers and learn. It's not like tanking is hard. No one is that bad and even if there is someone like that what ends up happening is someone else takes your spot until you learn. Big fucking deal
---
If they dumb retail down any further, this is all we'll be left with.
---
1 hours into classic should be a 6slot bag.
---
Right, they are usually an extra melee dps they don't really want or need. That said, a decently geared feral cat could be middle of the pack competitive for sure in the right group.
---
I keep seeing people saying druids were awful in vanilla, and it's just really strange for me to see, because I remember thinking they were amazing back then. I leveled one to 60, even. I loved resto, and it was no problem finding a good raid group.
---
But isn't that why people want to play classic? They feel it is superior to retail. Otherwise they wouldn't be playing it over retail.
---
You really want more "LOOK AT THIS CAKE I BAKED"?!
---
Probably because it's an invite that could have gone to someone who isn't garbage.
---
you really are brainwashed aren’t you
---
Wait, so the retards in here screaming about illegal softwares, chrome cast, and don’t give blizzard any ideas were wrong? It’s just a touch screen laptop? 😂
---
And for weeks on end - I feel like it's going to be a huge thing for anyone trying to rank as soon as phase 2 starts.
---
Will be fun / interesting to see how it unfolds.
---
Just gonna need to farm 10-15 hours a week, nbd lol
---
5g says hello, you're stuck in the past
---
Not every elite is soloable by those classes either :)
---
yea because thats the PVP server experience, getting corpse ganked by 3 rogue 10+ level above you for hours, how come that has never happened to me in my 15+ years of wow on PVP servers? And when i did get corpse ganked for a long period of time, i would log out and take a break, thats normal practice in vanilla, did you even play vanilla?
---
I personally don’t think it will be much worse than it was vanilla. Are you gonna get ganked? Yeah probably, sometimes back to back even but I think by that point in the game a lot of people are already going to have given up due to the difficulty or lack of the quality of life changes. Idk how quickly I’m going to be able to actually level compared to how I played in vanilla but I do plan on having atleast one level 60 on horde and alliance in classic. I will be leveling with friends and we’ll prob restart our old guild so worst case you call in reinforcements from the guild and end up in a guild vs guild brawl somewhere. Now that’s classic haha
---
You won't be top 10 if you're in a guild that has a decent composition and doesn't suck ass.
---
Then the answer to your question is this :
---
Git Gud.
---
hopefully the tourists will be gone in a few weeks
---
At some point they made animations class specific not race specific.  Race specific animations still exist, they're just really rare to see.
---
Simplest answer is that you probably don't, as you might've guessed :P
---
But I didn't feel like the skill level was the target for criticism but rather the attitude towards failure in this instance.
---
Short version, some really mediocre rapper tried to make "based" a thing, meaning "being true to yourself" or something. Gamergaters started calling everything and everyone they liked "based", to the point where it stopped meaning anything other than "oh shit it's a gamergater get a brick".
---
The true colors of...  what, exactly?  Calling out white knights?  I've been doing it in the thread already, my dude.
---
What is that quest chain? I only remember time gated quests from WoD/Legion. Legion/BfA overall improved with removing daily stuff, except rep, you can farm AP or gear whenever you want. No shit like daily quests and daily heroics.
---
Would this beat out a manual crowd pummelling owl using the same chilli strat spamming a moonfire (for dot) followed by downranked moonfires?
---
Sure they are, but that wasn't the presented argument.
---
It's called "twinking" it is when you remain at the absolute top of a PvP bracket with eventually the best gear you can get for that bracket range. You then proceed to beat up on lower levels in the bracket ranging from 30-38. If you come against another 39 you're probably fucked because the whole point of twinking is to just beat up on weaker players. If you go to 60 you will be on an even playing field, but you suck because you're a twink, so you don't do that.
---
Also note that honor kills gave less and less honor the more you killed the same person, but but reset every day.  So it's often better to play 8 hours spread across two days rather than 8 hours one day since honor might gave completely decayed for some of your kills.
---
Whatever they do on PvE server.. It wont compare to 10% of the fun being had on the real servers.
---
Totally disagree.
---
That's stupid lmao what's with rappers and trying to start trends and shit?
---
The key component isnt "another game" its specifically "retail". As in "I cant handle Classic so instead I'll play a gimped version". Dont roll on a PVP server if you cant handle getting ganked. She's being a child.
---
We dont want you either tho
---
I feel sick.

ℹ️ **Introduction:** If you’re looking for some pre-BG PvP action or you’re a PvE raider who’s looking to put that gear to some good use whacking Alliance in the face with it, you’re at the right place. Everyone earns their roles here, whether they’re Social, Raiders or PvP-ers.
---
👀 **What we are looking for:** Players of all different schedules and backgrounds willing to be part of an amazing community regardless of how much time they have on their hands to play this game.
---
🎯 **What we are aiming for:** Clearing all raid content, acquiring all epic items and scepter and be one of the most respected guilds on the server. We aim is to be decent in PvE without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing this game in order to spearhead the advancement of structured WPvP in the Classic WoW community.
---
❓ **What we expect of members:**
---
+ As a PvE raider: Knowledge and desire  to improve in your class, as well as getting to level 60 and able to raid within 8 weeks.
---
+ As a WPvP raider: Show up at 3/4 of our weekly WPvP raids.
---
+ As a Social: Participation in various social activities. (recruitment, social events, writing a 5 minute report etc.)
---
You are free to choose any combination of those roles within our guild. Currently recruiting all classes.
---
📅 **Our Raid Schedule:** Current plan is min. 3 major raids per week. (1 WPvP raid + 2 PvE raids) with Loot Council. Additional details (such as raid times, spots etc.) will be handled after the game launches. The WPvP raids are not to be mandatory, but they will provide an advantage as a Raider in ties against other players when deciding for loot. Our timezone will be around GMT+1 (CET/CEST).

You’ve got to understand that you’ve got 51 talent points when the trees only go 31 deep. A 31/0/20 spec or whatever is appropriate for your class is already a 64% hybrid spec if you think about it. You’re playing a class in vanilla, not a spec.

&lt;Bourbon Raiders&gt; [NA] [H][PvP]
---
Hello everyone. I would like to introduce Bourbon Raiders. We are a casual family-oriented guild recruiting for classic. 
---
Goal: provide a guild for people who are older, work 50+hours a week, or have kids, and dont have time to put into the game to make a hardcore guild.
---
We will complete all end game content, whether its is pvp or pve oriented, but at our own pace. Whatever your goals are in classic we hope to help you achieve them.
---
Faction: Horde
---
Server: PvP, NA CST

If interested pm me on here, on my battletag: Breakout#1905, or on discord: Algammon#1375.
---
Thank you.
---
I plan on vendoring greens until I have enough gold for the level 40 mount. I do not think a solid AH economy will have developed by the time I hit level 40 and the value of 60% extra movespeed is more important then the potential future profit of DE mats.
---
UUUuugghhhgghhhgh!
---
Make Azerot Great Again
---
Nicely written and a good piece of advise. Upvote 👍 But, my warrior will start at dps-alt and will never, ever tank in pugs.
---
I'd personally like to see BC and more classic content. I think BC was what vanilla could have been had they continued to develop and correct its issues, but I honestly really liked the new talents BC introduced too. Affliction warlocks have been my favorite since vanilla, but it honestly wasn't the best in Vanilla from memory.
---
Why are you calling me an idiot when we're have a civil discussion?
---
Raiding is endlessly easier than retail
---
Doesn't matter how far into a patch cycle it is, if you down a boss a week before the next raid then it's current.
---
Alternating between Loch Modan, Westfall and Redridge will be more then enough to get 10-20 without a hassle. I wouldn't bother going to Darkshore if you can't train skills in Darnassus.
---
Probably will have 1 PvP and 1 PvE server, since there's 15k players currently playing on BR realms.
---
But I'd advise against it. Most BRs don't want to play a challenging game, instead just want to farm pets and achievments. So I think the BR servers will kinda dia after 6 months of classic.
---
I'm really thinking about rolling on a regular US PvP server. The latency will be the same anyways... :(
---
In PvP some warriors taunt pets before deliberately walking into freezing trap to break it, could a hunter counter play this by putting their pet on passive or is it out of combat only?
---
Who knows! It's an organic unknown. Every server will approach it differently. 
---
Expect a lot of people farming PvP in Eastern plaguelands and burning steppes due to rare good lategame materials and good gold farm. 
---
Those two zones will highly likely see a lot of action also due to the levels giving honor etc. 
---
In the lower levels it's more spontaneous encounters as peoples prime focus still is leveling. A gank may occur if you happen upon each other, but may also not depending on individual goals ^^
---
For example, if I'm not sergeant yet and still leveling, I'd gank if target yields honor. If I am sergeant I wouldn't bother and focus on leveling/self defense.
---
A lot of people won't care much about PvP until the incentive of honor is introduced. I'm sure I'll PvP a bit organically, but I won't actively seek it out until Phase 2. 
---
Even when BGs are active on private servers there's very active world PvP from players maximizing their honor gains by roaming around between queue pops. P2 is going to be pretty intense.
---
Live to win...

Trying to get grand master in overwatch. I keep getting so close... I will get it before WoW classic!!
---
This cherry picked clip doesn't say much about the streamer but it sure has brought the misogynistic assholes on this sub out of the woodwork.
---
&gt; sexism
---
This clip actually would have been funnier if it was Tips.
---
how would they even give you the ransom money tho
---
Take away the heirlooms, and it both slows down the pace and makes it a bit more difficult. I don’t even accept quest rewards, which are often overpowered at this point (they tried to hand me an epic just for completing one of the main quests in Elwynn! An epic!). I only wear what I can craft. It still isn’t as hard or slow as Classic, but it is significantly different than playing with heirlooms.
---
That's not at all what he said. 
---
I personally don't find her look to be attractive in the slightest, but that doesn't mean I think she needs to change. There will be plenty of people who *do* find her attractive, most importantly she probably likes that look herself. No need to change to fit in with my tastes.
---
I guess we are arguing a difference of opinions then. I never was big on dailies, I'd do them occasionally but I enjoyed playing the market or crafting so my currency came mostly from that. I did rep grind for mounts but it was so infrequent I didn't get the "daily slog" feel. Either way each to their own, but as I get older I realized I should spend more time on what I found enjoying rather than what I felt I "had to do". If you feel different then by all means work towards your happiness.
---
&gt;Enemy faction sometimes was ruthless to me and that's OK.
---
You were playing a rogue.  Even players who tend to be more friendly and peaceful with the opposing faction tend to kill rogues on sight.
---
Themechanic did 12 on stream a few days into the beta.
---
Seek help
---
Ah shit, here we go again....
---
Actually yeah. When you have gotten used to running the group (which you will as a tank, sooner or later), and you group up with someone sort of challenging that, it's easy to get a bit dickish about it. 
---
Being humble is always good, in life in general actually.
---
This poll makes me want to play a shaman more and more, except I really want to stick with Alliance. Decisions...
---
It's not about winning the fight, it's about survival and minimizing a terrible situation. Nade blink and run while frost provides the slow for your escape forcing them to pop sprint. If you've achieved them popping sprint on your first death. Your next life will be much easier to escape them.

This response is clearly a defining moment of fight or flight separating the brains from the idiots. You want to play the game but others don't want you to have fun. Learn to get good to get back to what you enjoy and out smart them or ragequit and use any derogatory insult to make yourself feel better about being bullied.
---
Yep, can tell by barrens chat on pservers with the influx of people playing.  A lot of racism/homophobic shit being echoed.
---
No, he played on a pvp server and shut down Menethil Harbor which is contested. I think its the extortion bit that takes it too far. If you are locking down a contested area on a PvP server that's fair game. Its also why I avoid red ridge.
---
i really want to downvote this
---
What she meant to say was she doesn’t know how to deal with this. She has time.
---
Are you having a stroke?
---
Lucky I’m not an idiot! 😁🤘
---
Warrior is always the top class on Pservers and it will be the same in Classic.
---
Country roads...
---
Too weak? At max rank it reduces both str and agi by 68. That's about twice the amount of AP reduction than demo shout.
---
I wanna give another tip.
---
Play druid if you like to, don't play warrior because others tell you to.
---
Because Druids are way easier than Warriors and until 40-man raiding, no one cares if u are Druid or Warrior.
---
To tank 40-man raids u have to explain people that still worry about druid tanks that u are simply the better tank in terms of threat leading to DPS being able to do more DMG leading to faster kill times leading to less healing required + your dmg income is more predictable.
---
Those guilds will be casuals guilds though and therefore be happy to just get 40-man together. More progress oriented raid guilds have the experience ready and therefore know what Druids are capable of.
---
Ye the new information that bosses have 14% parey Chance was critical at first. But remember that bosses on private Servers were overtuned and it was still no problem for a druid to maintank.
---
Most likely you won't even be a maintank(but you absolutely can be if you want to) and therefore DPS/Heal as 2nd Role, depending on the spec u go for.
---
I hope that i could convince some people to go for Druid if that was ever ur wish but u were worrying about their viablity.
---
No, she was ganked over and over by 3 rogues who stream snipe her, so she took a break with retail and came back to classic. Wannabee elitist.
---
GAMERS RISE UP
---
Saw them gank Swifty yesterday morning man was that shit hillarious. Started Rp walking afterwards saying ooga ooga lol
---
These are the type of players who cried for years and eventually had wow turn into the abortion it is now. Back to retail they go. Good riddance!
---
Do you go SL?
---
You should take a break and go outside. Life's good. Not fun to spend it angry.
---
I think there will be an extremely healthy population at launch, and due to how they are handling layering it could stay healthy as some of the initial influx of players leave. Add to that the implantation of content over phases and you’ll see some people who left come back to complete the “newly” released content. 
---
It’s gonna be epic!
---
Correct. Practice makes Perfect in this game. Even against Hard Counters, it can still be possible.
---
I hate playing mage I have to idle in silithus for peace and quiet.
---
I’ve thought about that, but I really like the idea of only wearing what I can craft.  That’s a whole new twist I didn’t consider.  I’m totally going to do that!  Thanks!
---
Garbage? Explain how you deal with 3 rogues ganking you, you just gonna sit there for hours upon hours taking it? Did you even play actual vanilla? Its normal to log out take and break and come back when the ganker/s is/are gone.
---
It will be chaotic and Ill just farm lashers for gold in the meanwhile :)
---
It doesnt make YOU superior.
---
For me it was some time around 2007. I never had Internet access before as I lived in a rural place and my parents felt I didn't need it.
---
I remember the WoW commercials on the TV (Those with famous people in them like Mr. T, they had some spanish dude in them for our country versions). They hyped me as hell, I was thrilled to "live" in the game. Also, the ads were showing that WoW had a trial! So a few months since the commercials started I got internet, and practically the first thing I did is to install wow with the trial (and MSN Messenger ofc).
---
The first memory I have is just to create an Orc and... wander around. The starting zone felt huge and then... I went out to Durotar. Holy sh\*\*! That was a wonderful world to log in and live in.
---
Another I have a blank space between that and the end of the trial on my mind. I remember I couldn't get my parents to buy me a subscription and as I said I lived in a rural area so to buy a WoW sub card I needed my parents to take me there, so I found that private servers existed and joined one. 
---
My next memory on that was making my first Tauren, a warrior. And discovering all of mulgore and the barrens. Then I found in chat that orgrimmar was the place I should go to see people and in the way to there I saw a dude with a santa hat equipped. I asked him where he got it and led me there to get myself one too (in between orgrimmar door and the zepellins, that was TBC I think). There I made my first wow friend...
---
It's neat to remember all of this and reflect a bit on it. Thanks for the post!
---
Speed isn't as much of a concern as latency.
---
What are you going to do when two people refuse to pay and they are on different ends of the zone. Your rogue cant be in the same spot as both. Therefore your threat falls flat on at least one player. Your reputation is gone, there is no more fear. THEY WILL RISE AGAINST YOU!
---
Rogue.
---
This is me going back and forth between alliance healers. I'm worried paladin buffing is going to drive me mad. Like incessant water trades on mage do.
---
I agree with this tbh, especially if the lock isn't SL.
---
A few thousand extra players won’t prevent servers from dying.
---
WeirdChamp FeelsWeirdMan OMEGALUL
---
I will be streaming my leveling from 1-60 when classic goes live :)   
---
And I will make a new aoe leveling guide once I know what spots is doable.  
---
My plan in the future is also to make gold guides.
---
Cry laughing
---
People suffer from all sorts of problems in their lives which can cause anxiety even doing things they enjoy, like games. Even some forms of autism fall into that category. Have some respect that everything in the world isnt perfect
---
Can you elaborate why you disagree?
---
Why start throwing insults at the poor guy...just trying to have a conversation
---
You are claiming she is bad, explain how to deal with 3 rogues 10+ levels above you corpse ganking you? Im not white knighting, i hate toxic people and their blind hate.
---
what a waste of a fucking beta key, nice one blizz, gj so far on these beta invites, streamer btw
---
This is the truth
---
enchanting gets my blood going apparently.
---
What UI changes did you use to get bigger buttons
---
Oh I get that, btw you can just say the average is 1,500...
---
(Min+max)/2 *(weapon speed)
---
But look at all that crit and ap!  That thing would white crit for like 5k
---
Very similar to me.
---
UD Priest - oh yeah I hated playing priest in vanilla
---
Tauren Druid - Hmmm the only good spec at 60 is resto...
---
Orc Shaman - Fuck it I just want to be able to hit things hard with a  big axe and off heal occasionally
---
This is usually where I roll my eyes at the higher level dude bored with life and try to decide if it’s worth a spirit run and risk corpse camping, play another toon for a while, or so something else entirely.
---
It isn’t worth the whine. But if she’s not used to it.. *shrug*
---
Well, it is not too far away from the current version.
---
Cloth turn in will be there from the start.
---
True. From private servers AV was lasting anywhere from 30 minutes to 4 hours. Sometimes longer.
---
Dwarf rogues are rarer and look awesome.
---
&gt;I don't care if they signed up because their favourite streamer plays it, or if they played back in the day, or if they play BfA and thought they'd check it out. I don't care if they're streamers, or teenagers, or private server veterans. I don't care if they know their BiS list, or how their skills work, or what the meta talent specs are. I don't care if they're raiders, casuals or nolifers.  
---
&gt;I just want people to play the game.
---
I wish **everyone** else felt this way, and would stop being so concerned over streamers and how they'll "effect" the game. I like your attitude, my dude. I'm in the same boat.
---
Yes you can ride rams as a human. At 60 you can do cloth turnins to get exalted with Ironforge.
---
Seriously, what is with all the people in this sub. As if going back to vanilla is some heroic thing that only the BEST OF THE BEST will get through alive. People here honestly seem to think they are some kind elite force that are the only ones who have the balls to play vanilla.
---
News-flash: Vanilla is easy as shit. Everyone knows everything. The raids will be cleared within the first day they're released.
---
I’m REALLY struggling to see how you are paralleling optimizing honor gains for top tier gear to gambling on weapon skins lol
---
The game is superior, not its players.
---
to be fair she's getting stream sniped. this is what happens when you stream
---
It depends on the level of regeneration and damage. With two innervates and also the ability to switch places for awhile to regenerate it should be quite possible to outlast many Bosses.
---
Its basically like this in every thread. Assholes who mock retail players for no reason. Its getting old and obnoxious VERY quick.
---
The good thing is that everyone is in the same boat. World PVP will happen all over the place because of the honor system. I dont think leveling will be any harder. There "should" be plenty of your faction about too, doing the same leveling as you are, so it shouldnt get too bad. Also, if mass world pvp pops up and you dont want to be part of it, just head else where or to the end of the continent or other continent. ;)
---
Alliance outnumbers horde on most private servers.
---
she probably had a good shot at escaping if she didnt stand around trying to exit the game while in combat lol.  then again later there was a small window of opportunity to frost nova as soon as she aggro'd the orcs, which MAYBE would've caught the rogue.  probably would've resisted it anyways, but maybe...
---
Thanks I’m going mage for sure
---
Paladins everywhere rejoice!
---
BYE
---
First, agro range is way less than Max cast range. Second, rogues have the ability to vanish and reengage if needed or blind at range instantly ( though it is a non trivial reagent). Also, vanilla in general is about situational awareness. A caster doesn't just sneak up on you.
---
If it's a player, that's pvp and a whole different topic. But, the scary part of a rogue is they get to dictate when they engage and disengage with stealth and vanish. You are right, if a caster gets an opening with frostbolt, while you have Sprint on CD, vanish on CD and no blinding powder, you might be in trouble if you are already low life or just AFK.    
---
Vanilla is inheriantly dangerous when you are solo.   
---
The concerns you have are shared among all classes to some extent, you just happen to be trying to argue that one of the classes that have the most inherent advantage against casters doesn't.   
---
TLDR: If you play a rogue like a warrior you are gonna have a bad time.
---
Also add resilience in PVP gear to the list, which made PVE gear useless besides 1 or 2 pieces.
---
I wasn't talking about her playing.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asqL-FU_9ok
---
Oh for sure it’s gonna be crazy with everyone trying to rank up fast but at the same time until that happens you have to deal with more city/town raids until dishonorable kills come to picture. Either way though I’m rolling a pvp or rppvp because the chaos of world pvp and all the ganking made the world feel fun and alive to me.
---
Alliance outnumbered Horde in Vanilla. Alliance outnumbers Horde on private servers. Alliance will outnumber Horde in Classic.
---
Getting stream sniped and ganked by 3 level 40 Rogues as a level 27 Mage. "Mad cuz bad"
---
Theres some very loud idiots on this sub, I have no idea why classic players feel the need to mock others.
---
&gt; no reason
---
Sure buddy.
---
spirit res, go somewhere else, like a normal human being? wtf is this allowing people to actually stop you from playing the game bullshit
---
Being a jack of all trades or hybrid spec is exactly part of the vanilla class design. It’s built into the original spec system. 
---
In retail you pick your spec and it comes with only those abilities and play style, which is then augmented by the newest “talent” system. 
---
In vanilla you can put points into which skill tree you want and totally go hybrid, leveraging spells, abilities and bonus’s from different specs.
---
She's being a child for logging out and playing another game while she waits on a ganker to leave? The log out and wait strategy is one of the most effective ways of getting rid of someone camping you.
---
Oh boy that sounds like a blast! I can’t wait to copy my character to Wod my favorite expansion of all time!
---
i remember death and taxes. they had the most drama of any wow guild that i can recall
---
Jeez, its like I can see your ugly personality through your comment.

Being essentially unable to step foot in a bg without respecting for 50g made so much content obsolete for people too.

I was 29 and managing a GameStop when it came out. All the other store managers and many customers couldn’t stop talking about it. I caved in and bought it. I was immediately hooked.  There was nothing like it back in the day. This was before Thottbot. Everything was a mystery and the urban legends were rampant.  It was honestly some of the best gaming in my life. ALL my friends were playing it and we had a pretty fun guild (OCHO DURO).  
---
There truly was nothing like vanilla WoW
---
 Wherever we saw someone deliberately target normals, we killed those people with extreme prejudice btw. Actually most of my time was spent in the arena, annihilating other 39 twinks. But I won't expect you to be convinced, so keep right on being butthurt :)
---
For a guild to kick you they’d have to invite you first.
---
"No wonder you're wearing cloth" LMAO
---
&gt; It's even worse when he can check your specific location and follow your every step effortlessly
---
Whose responsibility is it, that the specific location is broadcast in real time to your opponents? Your enemy's, or your own?
---
&gt; You are claiming she is bad
---
Am I?
---
&gt;explain how to deal with 3 rogues 10+ levels above you corpse ganking you?
---
Asked and answered.
---
&gt;Im not white knighting, 
---
Ya are.
---
&gt;i hate toxic people and their blind hate.
---
I hate white knights and their blind defense of thottery.
---
the white knight has arrived boys.. pack it up
---
It's about ranks... Hundreds of people will aim to be among the first to get R14. Further, they'll avoid actual PvP because it reduces their honor per hour.
---
I think those wPvPing for FUN will have a rude awakening when they're smashed by ranking premades.
---
There is no way I am missing the server launch. Everyone will be starting at the same point at level one with nothing with the whole of Azeroth to explore. You could try picking a lower pop server. We have to see how effective Blizzards layering will be.
---
It did up til at least TBC:

No, but they can solo alot, which is infinity more than some classes, which can't even with insane amounts of effort and consumables.
---
true, but I'm in my 30s now and work 45-50 hour weeks on average, so gear scaling isn't something to worry about as it will likely be awhile before I ever set foot in anything beyond MC/BWL.
---
Hilarious! Looking forward to see those cloth wearing paladins in classic again.
---
&gt;log out.
---
Logging out is sometimes a good choice.  You've been playing for a while.. getting camped.. lets go take a shower and grab some lunch and see if we have better luck when we get back
---
that's scorpid sting, serpent is a weak dot.
---
That's a similar design to how Diablo 3 works with Paragon Levels, except they share the levels across your account instead of just the level 70 characters.

.....right....

Projecting? How? Are you saying I'm in denial about watching this absolute vomitous Twitch shit and donating in hopes of being mentioned? Sounds like you're reaching.

# &lt;Reforged&gt; Alliance | NA-PvP | Hardcore

Thanks for the context. This sub is equal parts lack of quality content and spergs angry they didn't get beta invites. 
---
Kinda turning me off classic as a whole.
---
Great, i have account from 2005 but i am not a "streamer" I am sick of this new games promotion beta where everything is fucking twitch.
---
God forbid people want classic to have a friendly community
---
Resilience gear wasn't something that led to another addition in game.
---
Flying, dailies and badge gear were. This is why I don't put resilience on same scale. It was BAD, but it didn't led to a change in game long term.
---
Yes it will be like that but not as bad at first at least. And there may be more people willing to help kill them aswell. My advice though is if you are leveling an alt have your main close by for quick hop over if needed.   
---
Remember you dont have to have the town completely cleared, you just have to get the quest turned in/accepted before you are killed.
---
The last thing people wanna do is waste time to find a new tank.
---
Oh, and thanks for the backup. I feel like I am taking crazy pills. People really are in for a surprise when classic launches.
---
I mean trying to exit the game in combat out in the world is pretty funny.  Can't we just agree on that?
---
TBC was the pinnacle of WoW
---
I thought the same thing.
---
FOR THE HORDE!!
---
Er...how is anyone here white knighting?
---
Resilience, as bad as it was, did not forced adding new features.
---
Flying, dailies and badge gear did.
---
**OLD FASHIONED** 
---
A future Horde guild looking to raid 1-2 times a week on a PvP realm, while arranging recurring social and PvP events.
---
Why you should join &lt;Old Fashioned&gt;?
---
We’re community first - meaning everyone can join and, if you join early on, you’ll be sure to have a say in deciding raiding days, social events,etc. We have an experienced core of members ready to help you out, and to ensure a good environment when raiding and more
---
The goal for &lt;Old Fashioned&gt; We will be a casual raiding guild with plans to raid 2 nights a week with a dedicated fun night for battlegrounds and high level dungeon runs. We want a friendly atmosphere where guild members can suggest ideas and be given the support to have them realised for example guild duel tournaments or attacks on the filthy alliance. If this sounds like your kind of guild we want you to get in touch! 
---
**About &lt;Old Fashioned&gt;**
---
We are a number of groups all connected in one way or another. We have people who has previously launched reroll guilds. One was a cap-oriented reroll guild, where we stopped at each lvl cap (60, 70, etc.) to complete the content at the appropriate level with gear restrictions. The latter was a reroll guild that aimed for top-end raiding on a 2-day schedule. It was one of the leading horde guilds on Magtheridon from end-Legion up til Uldir in BFA. We have learned from both of the mentioned guilds and want to bring that knowledge to launching &lt;Old Fashioned&gt;. Furthermore most of us have played since Vanilla WoW and have raided at a high level both back then, but also up to BFA. Meaning we're an experienced bunch looking forward to re-live Classic, and make use of our previous experience.
---
 **How do I get in touch?** 
---
Head by our Discord (https://discord.gg/awshzNY). We’re looking forward to get to know you, and have you join us going down nostalgia avenue.
---
Currently all classes/roles are open (except nightfall enhance).

Gnome mage LF semi-hardcore to hardcore raiding guild:
---
NA/PvP/Alliance
---
Available ~6:00PM - 11:00PM EST M-F, 11:00AM - 11:00PM EST Sat-Sun
---
I was a semi-hardcore progression raider on retail from Ulduar through Tomb of Sargeras raiding anywhere from 8 to 15 hours/week; the only tiers I was unsubbed for were Hellfire Citadel and Emerald Nightmare. I played the same warrior the entire time as a tank until Firelands when I switched to DPS and never looked back. I am a min-maxer when it comes to my DPS, subject to threat limitations (and decursing needs now that I'm a mage). I would like to be in a guild where a majority (but not necessarily all) of the other raiders enjoy optimization.
---
I'm looking for a progression raiding guild focused on quality over quantity (9 hours or less/week); a well-managed group that is knowledgeable and prepared with consumables farmed and ready to burn. I have a number of very experienced RL friends (including vanilla OGs) that will be playing as well, but I'm most confident in 3 others (a warrior, rogue, and paladin) sticking with it this time around. We'd probably be a packaged deal.
---
I'm scheduled off of work for launch week and plan to grind to level 50+ during that time. I have beta access and I'm actively practicing my leveling route. I would love to have a guild with a designated bag/wand-maker on launch night that others funnel cloth and greens to in return for wands and bags (maybe a player that isn't looking to sprint to 60).
---
My short-term goals (phase 1): 
---
1) Level to 60 quickly with enough gold to purchase my mount at 40 
---
2) Max tailoring at 60 and craft Robe of the Archmage 
---
3) Acquire UBRS key while farming pre-raid BIS 
---
4) Get attuned to Onyxia's Lair 
---
5) Progress Hydraxian Waterlords reputation to unlock Aqual Quintessence (should get most/all of this done farming essences for (2) in Silithus) 
---
6) Max first aid, fishing, and cooking
---
My medium-term goals (phases 2-3): 1) Unlock rank 7 Conjure Water 
---
2) Purchase swift mount 
---
3) Level engineering to 300 
---
4) Get rank 10 (or 11 subject to RL constraints) 
---
5) As much of the scepter quest as I can (it's okay if I don't make it) 
---
6) Maybe level an herbalism gathering alt (big TBD, I don't enjoy playing alts)
---
My long-term goals (phases 4+): 
---
1) Kill KT 
---
2) Atiesh if the guild thinks my dedication has earned it
---
Things I won't do (just don't have the time): 
---
1) Grind past rank 10-11 
---
2) Winterspring Frostsaber 
---
3) Any other reputations not directly beneficial to raiding
---
I've played different versions of this game for over 10 years and I love it to this day. PM me if you think I'm the right fit for your guild!
---
Orc hunter it is then!
---
I agree with OP. IMO, phase two on PvP servers will be pure aids, full of premades in every 48+ zone.
---
Leveling will only be possible in zones controlled by a premade of your faction.
---
But she didn’t log onto an alt. She went back to retail after complaining she “doesn’t have time for this” while streaming a video game. It’s kinda lol and her tears and your white knight sweet taste so sweet. 
---
I’d say I’ll see you in retail, but we both know that won’t happen.
---
Well yeh, because by the time it comes around, tier 0.5 is worthless.
---
I'm just saying, it would be actually worth it, if it came earlier, so it wouldn't be underpowered to get. The price tag is huge, it doesn't reflect the power level at all.
---
&gt;I’ve noticed a significant decrease in the necessity of CC. In vanilla, and I hope in classic, it’s absolutely mandatory.
---
The need for CC decrease with gear. I remember absolutely facestomping whatever 5men dungeon starting with BWL level gear.
---
Yes, I also have anxiety and use games to escape that reality. I usually don't bring that anxiety with me. Everyone has problems, who cares? You think you are some special snowflake because of it?
---
&gt;Have some respect that everything in the world isnt perfect
---
It's not about respect. It's a fucking anonymous game. If people annoy you, tell them to get a life or something.
---
I understand your intentions but sometimes people just need to chill and play the game and not overthink everything. There are assholes everywhere and you just learn to deal with it
---
Zero chance of Classic failing.
---
It will be populated and guilds will always run :)
---
gaaaaaaaaaa

---
From what I watched, It doesnt look like she dislikes classic. She dislikes the level ?? rogue
---
It was not easy back in vanilla though, you needed immolation pots, mana pots etc - if you failed you had to wait a ridiculous amount of time before you could try again (hours).
---
Great to walk round IF with the staff though
---
Some people call it the Amish challenge. Only use what you can craft , only sell to vendors/ no AH, and no dying. Once you die game over and restart.
---
Not an incel, just dislike Twitch in general, even more so when it's these caked up gAmEr ChIcKs who sound retarded.

This reminds me to check if it's possible for an addon to blacklist people who use twitch chat emotes or otherwise colorful language in-game. :P
---
Of course, the ideal solution is finding/making the right guild and joining a community so you can avoid PUGs most of the time. :)
---
There is going to be so many hunters...
---
ME NOT THAT KIND OF ORC!
---
Nobody is talking shit about women. We're just talking about shitty players. 
---
Go back to your hole.
---
Ofc, but making them worthless by default was a make back then and they are about to do it again. The phases are made to simulate content releases so people have something to do.
---
Making tier 0.5 an AQ level items, means it won't be around for at least a year after launch, making people way less likely to actually get it.
---
Dude, I will play classic easy going. I'm going to be lucky to play 8 hours a week now that I'm 28 and have a kid. I feel no need to rush but I'm glad I will be able to play the game as It was when I started playing.
---
I mean, rhetorical question, but when you get paid to play why would you get upset if you get ganked?
---
I don't get pissy if a project at work get cancelled, my assets aren't used or we redesign some other work I've done. I've still got paid to do the original work and I'm gonna get paid to do the rework as well. Sure it isn't "fun" to get ganked, but maybe if you think that you'll get paid regardless it might be a bit easier to let go of the anger and just laugh it off instead..
---
Wont be to bad. Just make sure to grab all the quest at once and run. Most ganking will happen near quest hubs so just try and be careful when approaching one of those. Out in the world you arnt \*to\* likely to have alot of trouble.
---
Fortunately my wife is a former player and gets it so I should have low wife aggro.
---
Alliance warlocks have a problem against melee undead classes especially UD rogues. They also have no viable escape against higher level ganking. Don’t let that put you off through warlocks are really strong in general, every class has their weaknesses in classic, unlike in BFA.
---
its good for some players for sure, considering how much money they spend on it
---
Looking for a guild: NA server with EST raid times (7pm and later). I am looking to play casual to semi-hardcore. I would like to both PVE and PVP. My main is planned to be a dwarf priest.
---
Nelf druid my dude :)
---
TOC was shit, but I really enjoyed progressing through ICC, managed to kill lich king 10 man without buff and I'm pretty proud of that.
---
bukkake
---
I started in BC and played exclusively horde for years. I found myself liking human animations in culling of stratholme and the dwarf animations from the iron dwarf flask thing way more than I would want to admit. Came back years later and have embraced the better music, gear fitting properly, shoes, and straight backs. Alliance all the way. Main thing I’ll miss is playing a shaman.
---
&gt;Maybe I put my dwarf on an RP realm, play by myself?
---
I think it's a good plan. It seems you're mostly enjoying the solo aspect of being a dwarf, and the MMO aspect of being undead/Horde/together with your friends.
---
And you don't have to name one of them your Main. Let them both be mains.
---
&lt;Shut Up and Color&gt;[NA][Horde][PvP]
---
We are a semi-hardcore raiding and PvP guild planning on weekend raiding, world PvP, battleground premades, and twinking (29 bracket). Our guild is primarily 30+ adults who have played various games together going back to vanilla and TBC. 
---
Raids: Saturday and Sunday 3pm to 7pm EST / 12pm to 4 pm PST (very likely we won't need this much time once we get some gear until AQ). Optional weeknight raids for 3 day reset content may also be planned. 
---
Loot: Loot Council consisting of 2 officers and 3 rotating positions filled by raiders. 20 man content and PvP items will be /roll. 
---
Expectations: We want to complete raid content efficiently to not waste people's time. We expect raiders to be on time with appropriate consumables in a PvE raiding spec. We would like to start raiding 1.5-2 months after launch. 
---
Recruiting: We are looking for people interested in any or all of our guild activities, as well as more casual players just looking for some people to run dungeons and bgs with. 
---
Current raid needs (for casual or PvP members any class/spec works):
---
Prot warrior: closed
---
Fury warrior: medium
---
Druid: closed
---
Resto shaman: low
---
Other shaman specs: closed
---
Priest: closed
---
Hunter: closed
---
Rogue: closed
---
Warlock: closed
---
Mage: low
---
Here here!
---
Although, return occasionally just when you convince yourself it wasn’t all that bad. The tantrums are never not entertaining.
---
Then why did she post about it
---
Sounds like someone needs to Ascend to and ultrawide monitor ;)
---
I always grind the last 1-4 bars of every level, making it feel like when I turn in the quests I get a jumpstart on the next level.  But, if you can find a really good grindspot that is quiet, it can be worth it to stick to it for a bit.
---
Current wow demographics are meaningless. The modern game is a completely different game.
---
People also forget the fact that if you are subbed to retail, Classic is litterraly a free game for you. There will be a lot of retail players here to check out Classic during content draughts.
---
I disagree. Feels a lot more just like a difference of opinions than someone white knighting, but to each their own.
---
Thank you for this. I was planning on going shaman and wasn’t sure whether to prioritize cloth healing gear over mail if the stats were better.
---
It is an EU Horde PVP guild
---
What? No. Thats exactly why its good for the devs and not the players.
---
I’ve got three monitors was just giving op an easy out
---
&gt;That said, a decently geared feral cat could be middle of the pack competitive for sure in the right group.
---
not without bleeds, and there are not enough debuff slots on the boss to allow a feral cat to produce any meaningful dps. I can see raids bringing one for the 3% crit to the melee group, but I still see it as a liability
---
Yes but it’s our shithole
---
Plan was the same here. No way will I take off on launch day or the day after. But the third day... that's the day.
---
I had a lot of tanking anxiety when I played on certain servers in recent years (only ever DPSd in vanilla). Didn't like being the leader of the group much. What I found helped me was starting off as a druid tank. In my opinion it's way easier than warrior tanking when it comes to 5 man dungeons. In 5-mans you're often fighting multiple mobs, and as a warrior it can be hard to keep aggro on all of them (at least as a beginner). As a druid it's insanely easy though. You have so many options for AoE threat (pre-HoT with both rejuv and regrowth, swipe, thorns). It at least allowed me to get more comfortable in the role of tanking, without putting too much pressure on my actual ability to tank well.
---
Pick a class *you like and enjoy* and the get good at it by practicing. Level it slowly, read **all** the tooltips of all your abilities, keybind them and go outside the major cities and duel your friends and duel every class out there, watch pros who play your class to get inspired and you will figure out how you need to play it.
---
Find how you can roll in pussy with these 3 easy specialisations in Druid.
---
It's not gimmicky or a joke if you have renatakis and thistle Tea. It only works if you're a gnome, so you have escape artist to make up for the lack of imp sprint. 
---
I don't need to convince you, try it yourself sometime. It wrecks.
---
Do you know what time your raid times will be?
---
They're likely to remove it because it's a private server thing, but man it's gorgeous. Hurricane is a real talent.
---
I also heard rumors that he's working for Blizz now.
---
Not sure how both you came to those conclusions. Server populations are going to explode in Phase 2 since that's when they're removing layering. Also, players are a lot more confident and likely to engage in PvP nowadays than they were back in the day. People care a lot more about min/maxing their character, which includes honor gains.
---
its not current when its been nerfed 3 times so much so that the third phase is basically removed and a new raid is already out.  BoD is old content and was old content when he got carried through it.
---
Ikr, that distract was the most Rogue pro move i've ever seen
---
Players 18 levels above you have a near 100% resistance against spells. I'm not sure about grenades but iirc they use fire damage also for the stun. If they were on her own level she could probably get away but not when they are super high level.
---
Hey that's Tipcist!
---
Yeah you will until like naxx. Top geared hunter is still gonna beat out the worst mages, rogues, warriors, and warlocks until they all get properly geared too.
---
Are you the guy who ganked her over and over again? I mean you found the clip and even twitter post so it seems like someone is obsessed. Anyways, no sympathy for alliance scum
---
That Distract was so pro, damn
---
I would take a few min break aswell
---
No I killed just about everything and did the pvp grind too, so I did just about everything you could do in vanilla.
---
Nice, how easy it will be to no life the game might be a surprise for many couples.
---
I agree that TBC was the best point in WoW. (It had a few warts of course, but neither the base game or any other expansion was 100% perfect)
---
Don’t get it
---
So I’m guessing... another job with better pay, better benefits, and a start date that gives you a convenient 2 week grace period in between?
---
You can't expect everyone to know all that know all of that without watching her stream.
---
I wasn't trying to "dunk" on anyone. I just thought it was such an obviously bad example that I didn't want to waste my time writing out the reasons why. It should be clear to anyone with perception that sports and videogames are categorically different.
---
Normally I would say that you just get up and go somewhere else; gankers rarely follow people across zones. But since she is streaming it's highly likely she is being stream sniped and that is exactly what would happen.
---
The real answer is don't stream vanilla wow on a pvp server unless you wanna get shitstomped 24/7. We're talking about a game where you hide behind trees, underwater, in buildings to avoid enemies, and people play it broadcasting to thousands of people where they are.
---
I don't think she's a waste of a beta invite, that's extreme, but I'm also getting tired of this "there's nothing you can do" attitude about ganks. There's nothing you can do once they open on you, but there is a LOT you can do before then to make yourself a hard target. Not streaming your loc to thousands of people would be one of those things.
---
Casuals don't get to raid in Classic.
---
No because most of them don't have PCs. Whereas almost everyone with a gaming PC has a mobile phone.
---
&gt;who is really gonna spend 50g to tank a dungeon with friends. Or 50g to heal everytime its time for raid?
---
Don't do this. Play a **hybrid** specs that allows you to do **everything**. It **doesn't need to be** the 100% optimal spec!
---
4,000 pairs of eyes will catch a lot more  bugs than a couple of dozen.
---
Funny enough, flying, dailies and badge gear is what I loved most about TBC and is probably the only reason WoW maintained its place as the top MMO.
---
Flying allowed them to create maps focused on verticality. Nothing was better than flying over the endless abyss of the twisting nether to a new zone. I also have like 900000 screenshots of my character on floating rocks, high mountains, things that wouldn’t be possible without flying. 
---
Dailies were great. You get a set amount you could do each day and you pick the ones that benefited you. You want rep? Do some dailies. You want cloth or other mats? Do some dailies! Want a mount or pre raid item? You bet your sweet ass, do some dailies. Though released near the end of TBC, the Isle or Quel Danas was by far the best place created.
---
Badge gear was also a much needed improvement. It took me 65 runs to get a polearm I needed on my hunter. 65. With Badge gear, you could farm for items and if your RNG was shit, eventually you could just buy an equivalent item. It also was a good catch up mechanic to assist people who couldn’t raid consistently. Badge gear didn’t make people play less, it was more of a keeping the playerbase and gear closer to each other, this, creating more raiding potential.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I’m excited for Classic. That being said, TBC added much needed improvements and seriously made WoW 1000x better. If TBC was literally classic 2.0, the game wouldn’t have survived. 
---
Quick fact. The only game to get mounts right is Guild Wars 2.
---
I’m not very good at pvp either and I’m rolling on a PvP server because I like the feel of danger and the necessity of grouping/making friends/guild mates to survive in the wild. 
---
Even when going about solo and being extra attentive to my surroundings to spot the enemy and hide/fight when I’m ready is a lot of fun in itself. 
---
I will be maining a hunter and alting a mage. Both classes that I loved to play in vanilla. Both are able to escape situations easily or put up a good fight for me. Tracking for hunter is just amazing for avoiding trouble and polymorph/run lets you reset a possible tanking as mage.

We are a group of people looking to build a strong community of players. We will focus primarily on Raids, but we will also do Premades, and world pvp events. We will raid weeknights tuesday and thursday time TBD. Guild will follow a DKP system, with loot council override for special main tank and other purposed that advance the Guild.
---
Please have the following mindset
---
1. Willing to learn and adapt to new play styles'
---
1. Willing to put the Guild and Progression before yourself
---
1. Be respectful and cordial at all times
---
1. General love for the game and community
---
I am looking to do some really great things, we will find our stride in MC, Farm BWL and ZG, Just in time to reach our peak for AQ and Naxx. We will have 1 Officer for each of the classes, TBD upon release.
---
Please ask any questions you may have here, and send me a message if you are intersted!
---
It'll be classics version of raider.io score, only there's nothing the player can do about it. Any semi-hardcore or above guild won't just not allow meme specs, but there'll be really limited spots for multiple classes
---
The world has changed in the last 15 years and people only want to bring the best classes. 
---
Why does it matter if classes are balanced? Will it effect what made classic a great game in any way?
---
/u/zero_space have posted a spec of a raid healer...
---
Not even Major Healing Potions. Feels bad man
---
And I "literally" was responding to the OP and didn't read your comment, pleb.
---
Mage discorf
---
Honestly, if there was one thing that was just beaten into me, it was the buttonmashing combo that is needed when i get stunned by a rogue, as a hunter.
---
\*Distracting shot, freezing trap, aspect, aimed shot, concussion shot, pop all my item cd and rapid fire,\*And 1 out of 4 times i would manage to kill or chase off the rogue.
---
Hello friends!
---
I'm from NA, and will be playing on the Alliance as a holy paladin (preferably on pvp server). I've played WoW on and off since BC but I've never participated in raids before, so I'm looking for more of a casual guild for learning how to raid. (I do have experience raiding in other MMOs). Also, just mainly looking for a friendly bunch of people to level with, do dungeons, chill out and have a blast in classic.
---
I'm free to raid most weeknights and weekends, but probably can't commit to more than 1 or 2 nights a week. Feel free to send me a PM to discuss further.
---
Cheers.
---
Skill cap to master is high on both classes. 
---
Gonna go myself a WL for the utility’s and oneshots!
---
And yet its impossible to get in BGs on weekends if you arnt 60 :(
---
Do you realise that almost everyone that played classic when it first come out were 10yo babies?
---
Could you please provide a direct link? Thanks!
---
Me busy! Leave me alone!
---
you have no idea what you are spewing off about
---
awe booo i thought this was a tablet or something!
---
this
---
Cross faction collusion is bannable though and happened a lot in vanilla
---
Warrior. Rogues are bad warriors with less gear options in most every aspect of the game imo.
---
I could almost swear agility is for both bear and cat form, but I'm probably wrong, I started in BC not Vanilla
---
\&gt; Its just not worth spending The gold 100 gold to tank 1 dungeon and then back to healer.
---
Exactly, and that's a good thing.
---
probably the most useless thing ever.
---
now if only i can convince my opponents in pvp that this is the new trend in wow and all the hype kids are doing, it i'm all set to gm.
---
zug zug
---
Obviously Paladin. Whenever anyone engages you, just bubble hearth
---
I... Don't think I've ever seen a female dwarf hunter. 
---
Jesus, or even any female dwarf non-priests...
---
To add to the other comments, i wouldnt play private server, id wait for its official release.
---
It's pretty embarrassing honestly.
---
my main will be Human Warrior but I'm considering a male Night Elf Hunter alt just for the flips and the Michael Jackson 'Billie Jean' dance
---
believe it or not, a ton of people like gambling  
---
so, yes
---
Don’t play Hunter. Please.
---
That way I can be the only one. :)
---
I played hunter throughout Classic and all raid tiers and never had an issue.
---
Your unbridled hatred of "thots"
---
&gt;I don't want to tank in raids
---
&gt;1v1
---
&gt;dueling and solo BG's
---
Go rogue. After you open,
---
&gt;slower / stealthy play
---
turns to a swift relentless murder. 1 second GCD dude.
---
 The Ogga gang are mainly targeting Alliance Streamers and spamming them to go back to retail.
---
If you have a friend that can play a pocket healer, you will dominate with a warrior, if you are a lone wolf, rogue would be better.
---
All my memories...
---
By the time hunters become "bad" you'll have quit the game.
---
It’s the excitement of not knowing what’s under hehehehe
---
That’s not a spec of a raid healer.
---
This is exactly what Hunters can be worried about. The further the content progresses the fewer hunters you want/need in your raid. Starting with 3-5 in MC and BWL, going to 2-3 in AQ and dropping to 1-2 in Naxx. You have to stand out in order to secure your spot.
---
I agree..i literall cringe at the amount of posts saying they're going to be playing warrior and expecting to insta become main tank of top guilds.
---
Anyway as for rogues and leveling sub,it's got a goos burst if you can get a jump on enemy,however having leveled many of rogues through different expansions nothing simply comes close to combat steamrolling machine once you manage to get a decent weapon.
---
Which ever is more fun to you.
---
Paladin. You can always bubble+HS.
---
He's already 60 on live Classic servers
---
Visually Classic looks so good. Can't wait for it to come out.
---
MRGRGRGRGRGLGLGLGLGLGLGLGLL
---
That's what I meant when I said it was an extra mdps they don't really need. I do remember running on my rogue, the guild had a ton of melee dps, and the feral druid helped us a lot.
---
Tbc was trash. Change my mind.
---
I’m in the same boat as you; I suck at PVP. Given that you have limited play time, I’d go with what others have said and roll on a PVE server. That way, you can free yourself from having to worry about it and choose the class you want. This is what I did in 2005; I rolled rogue and only ever PVPed in battlegrounds. 
---
What I would say though is that when you PVP on your own terms, it is a lot of fun. Not only will you get better but you’ll learn to play your class better in PVE too. At least that’s what happened to me. 
---
If you feel you must roll on a PVP realm then the advice I was given when I asked a similar question last week was to roll Paladin.
---
She’s my type, trashy and hot. Nice kind of up hair and messy look. What’s her name?
---
You seem to be assuming facts not entered into evidence, friend.
---
You need to preface this with a trigger warning
---
Accurately assessing current state is pretty well set in the present.
---
By the way, PoS = “piece of shit”
---
at least she doesn't say I will blacklist you, and I will tell all on the other faction to blacklist you, like some other mimimi streamer ;-)
---
&gt; She's being a child for logging out and playing another game while she waits on a ganker to leave?
---
She's being a child because of how she reacts, not the fact of logging off per se. The "I don't have time for this" whine is just stupid. You're playing a game, a luxury entertainment, in a beta. You literally have the time for everything. You don't need to achieve anything in time for anything, because it's not going to last into the release anyway.
---
I think Onyxia should deep breath more 😄
---
And then she came back after doing some dungeons on retail. Does it really matter what someone does when they get off their main? The point remains the same. She got off her main for a bit and then came back, like many posters on this sub would’ve told her to do, but here we are calling people whiteknights lmao.
---
Rogues are good in 1v1 in vanilla, but idk it all comes down to your favoured playstyle i guess
---
there is no way to beat a brained rogue with skull of doom. Only way to beat him is to pop living action pot so you are immune to stun and you need to be SL. Otherwise the rogue will pop restorative pot when a lap is used and still fuck you hard. In my experience affli/destroy locks have no chance vs undead rogue, and SL orc warlock has about 40% chance to win vs a rogue at max lvl + all engi
---
Thank you so much

I have, And ret/enh is awful dps that have an awful time using nightfall. You'd be better off with a warrior in whatever spec since they use more skills to proc it reliably. Seriously, ret/enh is garbage for pve, and I don't say that lightly.
---
Have you seen his [ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKaIlT_lK1s)?
---
oh god yeah that puts me off mages as well.  At least with palas there's quite a few of you in the raid (i think?) so you can hopefully share out the buffing duties... but then the buffs are also shorter so i dunno.
---
when I was on my resto druid I was one of 2 or 3 and the other druids in my guild totally slacked on rebuffing duty so I spent so much time giving out individual MoTWs and drinking that it got frustrating
---
now i'm gonna be a dps and i just get to do big numbers and complain about the healers :D:D cant wait haha
---
I agree that PVP gear made raiding kind of pointless. I honestly didn't care about anything other than trinkets, amulets and rings from PVE content because I could deck myself out in full gladiator gear and hit as hard as (if not harder) than anything that came out of raids.  Why bother doing Black temple or sunwell when you can just pvp for 2 weeks and get a weapon equivalent to Apolyon/cat's edge/Torch of the damned?
---
Vanilla did it the right way. I loved the hell out of TBC's competitive arena PVP and I did like the smaller 25 man raid groups, but the points made about reducing player interaction and reducing playtime really did harm the game in the long run.
---
I dont understand people who take 20 minutes to poop. In usually out in 5 min tops.
---
Less base agi tho ;)
---
Only thing that matters is how much ganking you can do.  So since Hunter is the best World PvP class you are the best.
---
lmao so accurate
---
Would actually love a phone port of WoW. Would use it to check AH and whatever when I'm travelling or somwthing. Or like now I'm at my in-laws doing pretty much nothing, don't see how it can't be done as my phone is 4x more powerful than the PC I had in vanilla.
---
If she doesn’t care she shouldn’t talk so much crap. That’s where she shot herself in the foot.
---
Oh, you sweet summer child..
---
I’d say if you’re playing with friends, go warrior. You said you dislike the stealthy playstyle which I kinda see as a dealbreaker for rogue. You also have the added option of being a bro for your friends, throwing on a shield and tanking a dungeon.
---
If 1v1 play is the absolute most important thing to you though I’d roll rogue. You might come to like stealth. It’s a great tool to have.
---
they've definitely killed you before, i can sense your anger
---
STR for cats in vanilla.
---
I know, it doesn't make sense lol
---
Classic does have a friendly community. These people have no clue what they are talking about - they see one sperg trolling in the barrens chat and then instantly jumps to the worst conclusion saying the whole community is toxic.
---
It is. It has +20% intellect, mana reducing stuff and NS.
---
It's not the only possible spec for a raid healer, but it's very strong and probably the most popular one.
---
On Classic of course they will. If you think most players going back to Vanilla at this point are not going to destroy it's content, you are kind of delusional.
---
A lot of RuneScape grinding is pretty afk these days. Hard to AFK grind as anything but a Hunter while leveling in WoW.
---
Agreed. The sub version I used relied on fast garrote to rupture, and did surprisingly good. Though riposte and combat are just amazingly strong and easy.
---
Is this actually correct?
---
paladin. if you see a horde coming just bubble + hearthstone everytime, than log out until CD of hearthstone runs out and you good to bubble ' hearthstone again.
---
Hunters are easy to play, hard to master. In AV / WSG and AB (classic BGs) hunters are good, cos you're a support player...Normally guarding and attacking due to your burst DPS. Hunters are good a flag guarding as most attacking players head for the flag carrier and you can DPS down any healer.  Also in AV, or AB, there are normally more players between you and the opposing players, meaning they are focusing on them 1st, rather than you. 
---
For raiding, hunters are good early on, but you need to learn your rotations well and be well prepared to keep raiding into Naxx, as their DPS does fall of compared to mages. But a GOOD hunter is still very valuable so you can do both.
---
A lock is one of the only classes I've never leveled or played even a few levels.
---
The irony is strong.
---
Fucking trash
---
Changes to the druid abilities.
---
I’m sure she did after feeling so silly. It won’t last. I look forward to the next tantrum and alt F4.
---
This just isnt true for the US. RP-PvP realms started strong here too, they gradually lost players over time as RPers got tired of getting griefed and pvpers that cared moved to servers with better players for arenas:bgs/raids. Emerald dream is the biggest one and its at best medium pop. However, Emerald Dream is more pvp than RP at this point
---
Holy shit, another player from Deathwing :D
---
I don't understand how being ganked is part of the Vanilla experience. Personally I will always roll on PvP servers because PvE feels dull, but I wholeheartedly understand why people choose not to do so.
---
PvP server? Shoot me a PM - we have ~20 so far.
---
You should probably provide some details about what your intended play style/goals are. Pvp focused? Pve? Hardcore? Casual? Etc
---
probably because chuds keep attacking her trying to make her care.
---
Do you realize that 25-30 years old did exist back then also?
---
Hope this will not shock you, but no, your parents were not the first humans in earth
---
From a business point of view Classic beta is probably the best game to stream atm. 
---
Might not be fun to get ganked but BFA is doing really bad atm for viewers.
---
I would pay to see your reaction face to discovering the world was about 100x bigger than you thought. That's so precious.
---
I liked your story
---
Still want streamers to be locked into a few server with all their viewers/subs.
---
All streamers should have to compete with each other for the Gong.
---
I don't know how to rank them. But, they're bad and mostly entirely unrelated to Classic.
---
Exactly. There's more than one area to quest in at all levels.
---
I don't get it...She is being camped so she logged off. That's what most people did because continuously releasing to get killed again is worse than doing nothing.
---
will definitely add that in there! thanks
---
did u try pickpocket farming for gold?
---
I never played vanilla. I played a little during TBC and majority was WotLK and I loved playing warlock and healing with priest. So I’m not understanding what your post is? Does that mean that locks don’t DoT at all and just spam shadowbolt the whole time?
---
If that’s the case I’d prefer to heal with the priest since that’s something else I enjoy. I loved the aspect of keeping DoTs up with my lock so if I can’t do that I’d rather do something else.
---
the response is the same regardless of whether you are streaming or not. you cant do anything vs skulls 1dinking and camping you except stop playing, especially when theres a bunch of them locking the area down so you cant even 'escape'
---
inb4 this gets deleted
---
Play retail. Thank you
---
Just updated the link for you, some urls have changed and it's hard to remember to update all the old posts. Thanks for the warning, let me know if you have any others issues.
---
It's almost like she's not in it for the games at all... Could it be?
---
I disagree. I think stamina is more important than armour. Look at the stamina on that set compared to all the other PvP sets. It has the lowest values by far. Not a single piece has more than 19. 
---
Armour is fine but you need to back it up with other stats. That set throws str, agi, and even spirit all over the place. It's a mess.
---

&lt;Pride of The Alliance&gt; | US PvP | Alliance | NA |
---
**Introduction:**
---
Pride of The Alliance is a large guild formed originally in Legion. We live up to our name, we have that deep faction Pride, and love World PvP. We defend our cities, respond to calls for help and of course, take the fight to Horde cities on the regular. Large, but involving guild, many people have made great friendships here.
---
**Website:** Please Please check this out, our screenshots, etc as it will help you better understand our past and what we do)**
---
&lt;https://www.prideofthealliance.com/&gt;
---
We are the front line defense in our Capitals. We are the first strike against the Horde. Guilds want to be the first one in Molten Core? We want to be the first to take over Orgrimmar and slay the Warchief. We're a guild that loves World PvP/PvP. PVE? We raid/gear to kill horde. We play the game for the Warcraft. We're the Pride that lives in our Alliance.
---
**Gearing:**
---
We gear to kill Horde faster 😉 in all seriousness we do not plan to be a hardcore serious raiding guild, we plan to get Onyxia down weekly, and dip into Molten Core and other raids and "see what happens" and how difficult things are and adjust from there.
---
**What we look for:**
---
People who have a love for the game, a love for their faction, and want to join a guild that fights the good fight in Warcraft. We don't tolerate disrespect, we're here to enjoy the game and escape reality for a bit. We are looking for people to world pvp with us, and be that fighting force on our server. in short we want you involved in the guild!

Everyone is bitter because streamers get beta access and they do not. Its why we see a "Streamers will ruin x and y" threads twice a day.
---
just go play retail and teleport everywhere instant
---
No the "retards" here are worried that they would move wow to a mobile platform and ruin the game, not that it's running illegal or big 3rd party programs
---
Raids don’t usually get nerfed like that.
---
You don't counter them.
---
You use emotes, like /kneel, /pray, /wave / etc.
---
When you are 3 v 1, and you are the 1, you don't fight back. That is ganking, and if you want to survive ganking in Classic, which will be PREVALENT for the first 2 phases, you gotta know that you can't do shit in a 3 v 1.
---
There is an etiquette, and it works. 
---
Classic is NOT retail, and should never be attempted with retail mentality.
---
"I am just gonna quit and play BfA" is the definition of loser.
---
No matter how out of context this clip is, she is a loser, and retail is full of losers. They just don't see it, because when everyone is a loser, no one is a loser.
---
Retail players, if they wanna try Classic, they have to change their game mentality. Vanilla was casual friendly in 2004 compared to other MMOs before it ... it is a post apocalyptic world in 2019 compared to current MMOs.
---
It's about what makes games fun for new generation gamers.
---
&gt;There's NOTHING you can do about it.
---
1. Take rez sickness and go/do something else in the zone.
---
2. Hearth and go to a different contested zone.
---
3. Go to an uncontested zone.
---
4. Do an instance/instances.
---
5. If you're getting stream sniped, don't stream or play on a PvE server.
---
etc.
---
Wife got upset I bought a 27” monitor and I advised her  taking the week off from work when it comes out.  
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
true enough lul  
---
whenever i talk to people here and they complain how retail doesn't require teamwork or communication, it turns out they just play LFR
---
You won’t make it bro
---
I think he’s referring to the fact that you can’t change talent specs on the fly and are therefore a little more locked into a specific build. Not that you can’t utilize different abilities from different parts of the class. Context man.
---
Sadly I am not in the beta, I was sent the clip and thought it was hilarious.
---
hunter better at start, warlock better at end.
---
mm hunter or sm/ruin warlock, you wont have to respec for raiding in these specs.
---
I think the issue with them is that they end up doing RP or PvP well. Pvpers that are really trying will leave to find a more competitive server, roleplayers get tired of getting corpsecamped by xxnoscopesxx all day or having their events griefed so they moved to orher servers.
---
So....you want classic, but not classic? That makes no fucking sense. I'm a dad, now, too. I have real life responsibilities. Is that going to stop me from playing Classic? Hell no. I want the game the way it was then. Am I going to be way more casual about it, this time around. Yes. Does that bother me in any way? Fuck no. Do yourself a favor and stick to retail.
---
Yeah I think it was 2 hours respawn?
---
I’ve still got my Benediction. Xmogged it on my main. Can’t wait to get another!!
---
Yeah classic grind ain't shit compared to Ragnarok Online or Final Fantasy XI lol. The exp required for level 98 - 99 was more than 1 - 98 in classic RO. And you lost exp upon death, AND one the transcendent classes were released when you did transcend you started back at level 1, and every level required 3x more exp. 
---
And those games probably weren't even the worst about it, I heard Lineage 2 was worse.
---
Nah, just /ignore anyone who's an ashole. And have an alt ready to level if you get griefed. It will be fine. The vast majority will be decent people.
---
Classic is going to be fun watching people complain lol
---
I can't decide between
---
* Dwarf Priest
---
* Human Warrior
---
* Human Warlock
---
I know gnome is objectively better for warlock and mage than human, but I just can't deal with playing a gnome. Honestly it's one of the main reasons I want to go Priest, because I don't have to play a fucking gnome.
---
This is the type of person that gets a beta invite too. RIP
---
Wtf. Did not expect a pov from my twitch. I have so many questions. How? I get like negative 11 viewers.
---
The quality of trolling has really gone down hill.
---
Simultaneous lol and eye roll at the sexist comments. 
---
Go home, you’re boring.
---
You must be trolling. Kik
---
Priest and Paladin for sure. Whichever is on top is probably up to who you talk to, but I've always heard it was paladin.
---
War is hell.
---
Plus if your quick enough you can snag the name Grimli
---
Depending on your phone and tablet, you can set up a remote desktop to control your computer from your phone. This control scheme would work for that
---
A. You again. 
---
No. I - by no means feel responsible for what you are doing. Your children’s are your problem. You had the fun. Now pay the bill.
---
I can't believe you posted this again after getting it deleted yesterday.
---
Or you log off and play again later
---
No you’re definitely not wrong. It’s definitely for both but strength gives AP and agility for the most part gives crit. There isn’t a huge difference between the two but I remember seeing that str &gt; agi for bear. When leveling it really doesn’t matter bc you’ll be in cat the majority of the time. So it’s fluid.
---
Ah man, you brought back memories of me being mad about Shadow Oil not working for shaman either.
---
retail gonna be somewhat moderated tho
---
95% sure this is just a troll.
---
Do you imagine how funny it looks, that you basically hate someone, who doesnt even know about your existence? Power of internet I guess. If you cant stand him, I suggest you to stop reading posts about him. Its like buying a chocolate ice cream every day and complaining, you dont like chocolate lol
---
That goes for everything internet-related in this internet world we live in in the past 20 years, isn't it?
---
Even 18-25 year olds, which is the demographic I got into back when I played classic.
---
Jaina did, Ghuun did, Argus did, Archimonde got nerfed like 5 times. Almost every raid gets huge nerfs that make the encounter a free kill late into the tier to give welfare kills to bad guilds.
---
Maybe if you spent more time playing wow and less time having kids you'd have fewer kids and more time for wow.  Really you misplayed and now you want to blame us?
---
Warlock is more gear dependant. Before late BWL/AQ 40 you just don't have the burst needed to two shot people and your health isn't that high either so you're very squishy. You also have next to no mobility as a warlock, meaning if you get yourself in a bad situation you're stuck there while hunters have a few tricks they can use to escape. Hunter is better 1-60 and through tier 1 (MC and Onyxia). After that warlocks catch up and eventually become monster killing machines when AQ 40 comes out. Standard specs that you can use for both PVE/PVP without respeccing:
---

---
Yes there is something wrong with players who don’t have the time or patience for classic. They want to play an MMORPG but don’t want to play an MMORPG. They are the reason the game is completely going to shit. If I didn’t have the time or patience for classic WoW I’d play something else. No matter what your time constraints are expectations out of a video game are, a bad game is a bad game. Period. Only idiots enjoy playing bad games.
---
Nope. All decent guilds require you to carry sufficient consumes. Hunters scale horribly compared to the classes you mention.
---
Especially Warriors/Rogues with consumes will steamroll Hunters.
---
Why on earth would you roll on a pvp server if you react this badly to being ganked?
---
What Armabe said, there are plenty of streamers that would love to make content out of the ooga gang ganking them. She needs to learn to laugh it off.
---
Oh, I would definitely agree that a lot of the things that led to "downfall" of WoW (it still exists so it can't be that bad of a downfall) began in TBC. I would definitely agree a lot of them were in hindsight really bad design decisions. I would even agree that some of them didn't work that well in TBC, mostly badge gear near the end of TBC.
---
I still would think of TBC as the pinnacle of WoW. I adored the dungeon design and the raids. Class balance. I would call TBC the pinnacle of WoW, because quite a few of these design choices, when they were made and within the context of TBC, worked and made the game very enjoyable. Still, again, in the long term they weren't that great.
---
There is a difference in how certain design decisions work in the context of a single expac vs. how they effect the experience through I don't even know how many expacs anymore.
---
I know all about it, I played on Ravenholdt dor a while, the smallest realm in the game and rp-pvp. You could combine every ro-pvp server and it would have about the playerbase of just Moon Guard. Rpers on the server tire of getting griefed. You have a hard time doing any RP because you get out into the world, maybe youre rping a farmer and in the middle of the big scene you get corpse camped by &lt;FORTNITE&gt; guild who completely ruins your event and instakills you every time you try to RP
---
Don't tell how to live my live man. I'm not going to let my kids dictate what I can or cannot do, this is MY fucking life
---
Clicked purely to make sure this link was present. Well played.
---
It's hers obviously but she didn't really say anything about them, just logged off so what's the problem? What is she supposed to do?
---
“I’ve been breeding my own little ecological disaster so everyone else change everything”
---
Shut the fuck up
---
This was my in the Bene’thil Hollow with Furblogs. Died like 6 times because of respawns.
---
lol, well based on the downvotes I guess most people won't have that problem.  Or like I was when I started playing Vanilla they might be 12.
---
I saw 4 of them yesterday, no idea how many times it's been by now haha
---
Everything in asc__'s post is accurate, but it will depend on your raid composition for the most part. For example, a raid with more ranged/spellpower DPS won't care as much about getting an annihilator debuff on a mob which can free up a slot for something DoT related. Likewise a raid that is heavy on melee dps and only has a few warlocks won't care as much about curse of shadows as it will about annihilator. The trick will be for an effective raid leader to know their raid composition well, know who the golden-child players are, and have reserved debuff slots that maximize their potential. You won't likely see "perfect storm" debuff compositions in most raids unless you're in a hardcore prog guild.

**&lt;FREE HUGS&gt;** [H] (PvP) [NA] 🇺🇸 *(Tue, Wed, Thur: 7 - 10 PM CST)* (English)
---
🔺 **INTRO** We are known as **FREE HUGS!** We are a semi-hardcore guild for those who want to spend their time raiding and obtaining those epic and legendary items. We are a newly formed guild that is looking for anyone who has a passion for Classic.
---
🔺 **RECRUITS** We are looking for people who have the interest and dedication for raiding in Classic. We are currently recruiting any class, regardless of age or experience. (We are in a need of Rogues and DPS Warriors.)
---
🔺 **LOOT/ROLES** We use a well developed DKP system to handle loot in raids. We also have positions open for Class and Farming Officers to help assist other members of the guild.
---
🔺 **SCHEDULES** We will raid on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays 7 - 10 PM CST. We also allow members to form camps for open world PvP or BGs. We will begin raiding once we get our 40 man group ready to go. We don't expect players to speed level, just have fun with it!
---
🔺 **GOALS** We want to clear all raid content, even through Naxxramas, at our own pace. We aren’t as hardcore as some other guilds out there, so we won’t be making any world/server firsts. However, we will be making sure everyone achieves their PvE and PvP goals !
---
🔺 **EXTRA** If you are new to Classic, Welcome! And fear not, we have experienced *Vanilla Veterans* in the guild who can give plenty of advice. We are a welcoming group and are here to guide you on your glorious Classic adventure!
---
If you would like to join, please send me a message on discord @NeonInuGanetto#3614
---
Undead warrior. Instant dungeon groups.
---
Also PVP gear sets started the homogenization of everyone having similar gear. Arena was great but overall I would say it was part of the downfall of WOW as the OP was referring to. The fun part of vanilla is that you are not forced into a PVP set in order to be competitive in PVP you can put your set together from instances, raids and rep, which added a very fun and unique flavor to the game that TBC and on lacked.
---
Anyone know where Mankrik's wife is?
---
You dont need to be prot to tank pre-raid dungeons i always do it as my regular arms pvp spec, any warrior who insists on dpsing and then spende his time searching for a tank should be laughed at.
---
Whatever you want! If you are looking for the most optimal class to roll with them, it would probably be something melee since they are both casters.
---
Yes dungeons start out incredibly easy then ramp up as you level. You'll be better off tanking though  and tanks are usually in shorter supply.
---
Most people that play this game are casual players. I have no doubts more people will eventually get to more raiding content than did in vanilla, but the hardcore players min/maxing, researching everything right now months before release, etc. are the minority. Hand of Rag, thunder fury, etc. are not going to be trivialized for a long, long time, if at all.
---
Quest: kill 8 murlocs
---
 - Spend 20 minutes trying to find murlocs #1-7
---
 - Murloc #8 spawns
---
 - Murlocs #9-47 immediately descend upon you
---
True. Unless they are imunne to slow, which makes mage basically an easy pray
---
probably wanted to play with other streamers for exposure 👀
---
I would suggest Hunter. You will always have a place and can pug raids. You will always have a place in a 5 man dungeon with a hunter. Rogues are generally the most restricted class, in that many tanks will refuse to run with a rogue because of gear competition. If you have limited time but still want to ever see a 5/10 man, skip rogue.
---
Streamers deserve to be ganked endlessly and without mercy.
---
Lmao, so it’s just three rogues on the beta that go around ganking streamers?
---
Imagine being on a world of warcraft reddit and telling other people to do something more productive with their time.
---
And why would a tank ever carry that guy, only to have to roll against him, when he can tank his own group.
---
&gt; Every online community is toxic 
---
Some much more than others
---
Not a phone, just a regular touch screen laptop with click to move turned on.
---
“Is Brawl out yet?!”
---
I'm from Durotar, and I say - KILL 'EM ALL!
---
[starship troopers reference for anyone who doesn't recognise it]
---
I mean, my laptop is touch screen, I already do this sometimes with other games, what’s the difference?
---
I used to have a strong love/hate with the need for CC in TBC (didnt really play vanilla).  I loved the need for CC and particularly remember the 5 person fight in Magister's Terrace and having to wait till you got in there to see what set you got and what to CC and what order to kill.  It was exciting!  I hated it though because I played an enhancement shaman and didn't have CC so it made finding groups harder, lol.  Part of why I'm so heavily considering a mage this go round.  Shaman finally got hex at the end of TBC or Wrath, can't remember, but by then we had basically gotten to the point of skipping CC almost all the time and I switch to a druid tank.
---
warrior. race doesn't really matter. tauren make the best pve warriors, orc makes the best pvp. undead is a close second
---
Only at work. Boss makes a dollar I make a dime that's why I poop on the companies time.
---
That username and this comment don't add up.
---
I agree, I found leveling as just a priest/warrior combo was brilliant.
---
What is toxic?
---
People killing you on a beta PvP server, when you are streaming, just to hop into the bandwagon? THAT is toxic?
---
There are only a handful of streamers that supported Classic since like forever, and no matter what you think about them, they did it when EVERYONE else was against : Asmon, Tips, Esfand, Nixxion, Staysafe.
---
AND THEY ARE GANKED like crazy. Have you seen ANY of them "log out and play BfA?". 
---
Now, EVERYONE is loving Classic, everyone was wrong about Classic, and everyone is streaming Classic.
---
Stream snipping is a thing, no matter the game. But "log off and play BfA", because you "can't handle this shit" is clearly a person that have ZERO interest in Classic, and the ONLY reason of streaming Classic was to hop on the bandwagon.
---
She should have been mad...but keep playing and streaming. "Log of and play BfA because I can't handle this shit" is the definition of  retail player. Which is LOSER.
---
This is how a loser reacts to what it cannot handle : takes its toys and leaves.
---
Some of you are trying so hard to be “neutral good guys” she’s broadcasting her exact location while playing on a PvP server. People who do this deserve to be ganked until their spirits are broken and they hate the game
---
Pallys druids were sub par healers. Iirc , its been awhile 1-2 pallys 2-4 druids depended on how many battle rezs we might need. 5-6 priests maybe 1 Shadow.
---
Another man child on this subreddit. How amazing
---
So just like normal, then. As expected.
---
How can you be wrong about a preferential nickname to a dungeon? It’s honestly sad how much you people care about being “right” about a level 18 dungeon in a 15 year old video game.
---
We're home Chewie
---
Dont feed the troll
---
Why not wow classic mobile :(
---
I'm stuck between Tauren Feral Druid/ Troll Shadow priest. Leaning Druid at the moment because of stealth and the abiolity to fill any role needed. But Troll shadow priest just seems so weird that it sounds fun. Plus there priest racial Shadowguard combined with the priest Blackout ability sounds like to much fun not to play. A small chance to Stun any melee who attack you without having to do anything.
---
&gt;anyone who had an active sub during real vanilla wow time on their account should have been put into the beta instead of any streamer or "content creator" with any sort of audience
---
Lol you don't deserve shit for playing a game fifteen years ago
---
(Streamer gets 3v1d by people eighteen levels higher than her plus multiple mobs)
---
Redditor: LOL she got OUTPLAYED
---
You just devalued the pride of progression of thousands of raiders just because you're trying to find a way that Ion sucks.
---
I am not planning on argueing wether or not your statements are true or false as I havent been raiding this expansion, but I never felt this was the case in previous ones.
---
Regardless, gg to the people who still manage to get Ahead of the curve on whatever difficulty or timeframe. :)
---
I'll be rolling Shaman, but have no experience with the class. What takes up space in their bags?
---
Get ganked by 3 level 40 rogues as a 23 mage. 
---
"LUL MAD CUZ BAD"
---
Get the fuck out of here with that shit you fucking moron.
---
Lol no
---
Well theres a simple solution to that. Get a lock friend or log out infront of the dungeon.
---
I believe you are meant to do 2/3 points into improved blizzard, as 3/3 will overwrite your Cone of Cold slow.
---
Vire Caul?
---
Kill it with fire.
---
This is the content I come to this sub for. Would be awesome to hear from beta players about this stuff more frequently and possibly for each class to get a real taste of what we are in for. Thanks!
---
&gt; There's NOTHING you can do about it. 
---
Obviously.
---
But logging off and playing BfA is NOT the answer. Unless you are a retail player, and LOSING is something you never experienced.
---
I thought that and mage became a second job lol
---
If your main focus is PVE, then yeah
---
Welcome to vanilla wow on a PvP server. Don't like it? Play on PvE server which the beta has or go back to retail. It really is that simple. Once it's launched, level 20s will be camped by level 60s.. And in BIS gear. It's a massive part of vanilla PvP. Then the guildies, friends or mains join in the fight which just snowballs into TM vs SS. That's vanilla wow. Can't handle that? Leave.
---
Stadia is designed for 5g, wtf is the point of talking about a service using current latencies...
---
So nothing different then? Raided on a laptop since vanilla. I've cleared dungeons on toilets, in public trains, outside in a storm just barely enough cover to not soak the laptop etc. Good times.
---
Hey, After a long hiatus from WoW, I plan on returning for Classic and would like to get into the swing of things. I will be looking for a new guild to join. I played Prot/Fury warrior through Wrath and into Cata when I raided seriously. I was part of just about all realm firsts at the time. I have mostly lost interest in hardcore raiding, but I would love to find a guild that takes things seriously enough to get stuff done. Some interest in PvP is a plus!  
---
**Semi-Hardcore**
---
**Intended Region:** NA
---
**Intended Server:** PvP (PvE is my priority, but I love WPvP and miss it dearly)
---
**Intended Faction:** Horde
---
**Raid Times:** Varies, looking for EST friendly weeknights, but I will explore all options.
---
**Classes(in order from most to least likely):** Fury Warrior, Mage, Prot Warrior, Shadow Priest(would love to play this, but I feel like this will be almost impossible to find a raid spot as.)
---
**Preferred Contact:** PM and we can exchange further contact info
---
Ok so just enchanting?
---
Yes but it's in the lowest tier of debuffs together with things like deep wounds.
---
Boxing people in as "white knights"  to discredit their statements to protect your toxic ego just kinda makes you look like a sad individual who can't handle people disagreeing with you.
---
Wrrrongggggggggggg
---
what no
---
Extra dodge and parry (and hit chance) is just too good to pass. You get solid 10%+ avoidance ( maybe more if one of the later talents in combat tree gives you % agi increase,cant remember on top of my head if that was vanilla or later expansion),lower cd on evasion and ss with slow weap that is strongest spammable rogue abillity. While other specs might even kill single target fast theyre lackluster in multi target pulls,while combat just plows through anything including elites.
---
As long as they're not fear immune, they can be soloed by a warlock up to ~8-10 levels above yourself. I did it for laughs in vanilla with those Sea giants (I don't remember what zone, but I think the giants were lv50 or so).  Sure you need a healthstone and a pot ready just in case, but it's pretty easily doable otherwise.
---
No but you can expect people to use their brain and maybe realize that the clip doesn't give any context before going off on a rant about how she is weak and terrible bla bla bla
---
And when you try to pull 1/3 and kite the one of those orcs that net you and 1/2 are immune to fear on your priest.
---
*...someday...I will be....I'll even learn to stop people from dying!*
---
Wow part is that some people actually think like this and this guy might not be a troll.
---
HKs make up like 10% of your CP, most of your CP comes from winning bgs.
---
What in the hell are you talking about? I was 19 when WoW was first released?
---
Damn, you had to make a new account just to repost this from last night? 
---
OMEGALUL
---
4 hours a day you can get rank 10 if you keep at it
---
I wanted to give anecdotal evidence.
---
10 days ago Naxx opened on my pserver and on night 1 we did 6 bosses with 4 hunters in the raid.
---
We are not hardcore server first guys just clearers. ACTUALLY raiding naxx myself made me so much less concerned about class spots in raids.
---
Sometimes they cant help but everything. Not everything is black and white.
---
who hurt you
---
Lay in the life of the highway...
---
We weren't talking about layering, we were talking about the game. Obviously when layers get merged there will be more players in your game.
---
Five curses and spite live in each gnome.
---
Ah, figures.
---
Its gotta be possible to get more than 2 kills per minute. 
---
Even if not, that sounds like very reasonable numbers for someone who hates questing.
---
for real.  way easier to tell the tank which way to go and which mobs to pull than to search for a new tank.

took me 24 played days and 6 months to get him to 60
---
(yes, I'm an idiot)
---
Orc is the best pve warrior as well, can be beaten by troll if the troll has tf.
---
Working as a group in dungeons, using each and everyones class perks is what i miss. In BFA you dont even talk much to your group.
---
For me it was the 'Make love not Warcraft' episod of South Park.
---
That's the updated written guide ;)
---
Only the top guilds will try to max out the debuff limit and I have a feeling they specifically do this to fuck over the warlocks. Been playing with that type of guilds a lot and I definitely feel the lock hate there. For your average guild you can have a few corruptions going and usually there are more than one target so you can multidot.
---
Did you even check my account? It's not new you idiot
---
Love it, you see any videos of the Ooga booga boys running around? Shit is hillarious. Three Troll Rogues all with ooga in there names. Ganking streamers and then saying o o g a, o o g a and Rp walking away lol.
---
But they will be back soon, and in greater numbers
---
Something that can tank (druid/warrior).
---
Winter 2017
---
&gt; is ganking lowbies considered cool on this subreddit?
---
Yes, it is "part of the experience having a constant threat around".
---
Personally, I spend my MM points on Improved Hunter's Mark 2/5. I am really unsure about how to spend the 4 points in Survival though. It looks like a very personal choice, which I think is good. Currently, I'm thinking that I want to get Savage Strikes 2/2, and then some spread between Deflection and Improved Wing Clip with the final 2 points.
---
Bait
---
Who walks from Ironforge? Fly to the chapel in EPL that can't be named in this sub and ride your mount to Strat.
---
Also, if you want to teleport to the dungeon and clear it in under an hour, there a version of WoW that lets you do that.
---
I didnt say anything about people being superior. And spare me the pluralistic bullshit. That crap can be used to handwave away any "opinion". Its lazy thinking honestly. If everything is "only an opinion" then there can be no opinions that are more credible than others right? Therefore you posting in this sub begs the question. What is your point? I have my opinion and you have yours. Shocking right? Stop trying to convince me because it's like...just your opinion breeeeeeeh!
---
Controller support would be a great idea (like xbox360 controller or something)
---
If you get a constant raidspot as an oomkin, I'll buy a hat to eat.
---
Level distribution
---
No, the one you made to post yesterday was.
---
Good thing it’s for people with that internet then. If your internet can run it, buy it. It not, don’t. Google have more than enough research to support its release and I’m sure they understand how the internet and the speeds work around the world better than any of us. 
---
It is new too. It’s specifically built to be supported for these games and has even paid for direct ports to the stadia specifications. That’s why these games are now adding the stadia to their footers alongside Steam, PS and Xbox.
---
Because Streaming vanilla is a money maker right now. That’s why they’re all doing it and suddenly they all “love classic” 
---
Fuck the streamers.
---
Dude, TBC was way harder than vanilla. Vanilla is by far the most casual friendly version of wow. They added a lot of good balance changes to all classes and specs and didn't pigeonhole classes into one spec. I do agree with with flying, but for the time flying was the most requested addition to the game, it was us vanilla player who wanted that.
---
Or just dps like a normal shadowpriest instead of using gimped heals while fiddling with shadowweaving.
---
This has got to be a Shitpost, there’s no way anyone is this ignorant, lol... 
---
I almost thought I was reading a post from my 10 year old with all the me, me, me, I, I, I... 
---
You got everything you wanted when Blizzard started changing retail to cater to you and your kind, stick with that and you’ll be happier and so will the rest of us that have no desire to see or hear you in our game!
---
Report and move along - they have copied and pasted this for days and legitimately have no life/ enjoyment in their life.
---
You’re trying to control what we get based on your piss poor breeding habits.
---
If life’s so tough just run away from the family, we don’t care either way.
---
The WPvP objectives in every zone were pretty fun. Not only would it draw in the gankers from the rest of the zone but it was fun to have the break from the grinding/questing to do some wpvp for 20 mins. My favorite was the level 65 zone I think. I cant remember the name but it was the green/nature zone where there was a pvp town in the middle.
---
No offense to my rogue brothers out there....but I'm going to kill every one that I see because you're rogues. Stay in stealth because I think this is going to be a general policy from anyone who has PTSD from playing vanilla WoW.
---
They better not take this away from me, it's the only thing I was good at in vanilla.
---
I think that's the key bit that makes classic so much better. Those extra steps needed (drinking, Mana being finite, managing mobs pulled) added more to the simple task of the game, such as just killing a NPC. Makes the game have more depth. You have uses for things like Mana potions while leveling, and drink. In retail you're simply not challenged while leveling. You're just on auto pilot from quest to quest and everything is pretty much laid out for you. The last quest of one zone leads to the next. You don't have to figure anything out.
---
A.) I choose to pay money to support something I enjoy watching while I play with duel monitors
---
B.) I’ve never seen Asmongold in the game despite being on KT for 3 expansions nor have I participated in anything he’s ever done.
---
C.) I’ve sent my fair share of hate whispers, but never about a streamer.
---
Fuck you and fuck your stupid assumptions, morons who go off of a handful of fanboys are the actual problems.
---
Ohhhhh, I'm talking about PvP btw.
---
You don't have to go forward in time to play vanilla WoW. [You can also go backward in time... as long as you have time crystals.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/33/1b/08/331b081df52ce5c99c592aa5070116e7.jpg)
---
if your LAN latency streams &lt;1ms and you feel a 500ms response time, how much response time do you feel when you stream that same data over the internet at 10ms best case local datacenter? how about 50 or 100ms?
---
When you make enough it turns out you can spare $5 lmao
---
First time thru the dark portal was pretty neat, probably my favorite moment in the game.
---
So boring though!
---
Don't know what you're talking about. Can you provide proof?
---
And here's the video: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mdMfsjeVINE&amp;t=10s
---
Imagine being so delusional that you're still trying to shit on someone that only clears content that 1-2% of the playerbase clears (while still having a **real** job).
---
LUL
---
Why discuss the chokepoints and limitations of launching a new technology realistically in a comment thread where people are asking what it is?
---
You missed out then
---
Unpopular opinion but I think rogue is the hardest class to lvl. They have close to no ability to aggro more than one mob
---
Shaving 31 damage off a boss that hits the tank for 3000 won't do much difference.
---
so waste 10 mins, durability cost, disrupt the quest flow, etc. or log out and do something fun instead? hmm
---
I’ve seen comments that are *wary* of playong on streamer servers. 
---
Never really seen any meme posts about it though. The complaints about the so called “streamer-haters” however...
---
Deadzone was a bitch back in the day for hunters.
---
Yea, everything this guy is saying is clearly correct.
---
Of course if you are 2v1 caught out of stealth with no blind then casters are going to be tough. But if you initiate the fight then it should be a much easier encounter than vs melee mob(s).
---
Another mage. 2mage+priest is sick in all ways farming/pvp. and you'll be doing the same shit, cos you need the same shit (all the clothiers). So it won't be like one guy wants one shit other the other. you can fully play together all the time. Farming possibilties is op. and farming is a big part of vanilla.
---
LMAO
---
Differently.
---
So nothing special. Most people did that.
---
&gt;thinking people follow Alexsensual
---
I wasn't arguing the Legendary point. I think both MC legendaries actually are top of the line throughout ALL of Vanilla and even a good part of TBC. But many, many people are likely going to be getting into those raids.
---
Many of the players of WoW are casual, but most of the people who will start playing Classic are not going to be. Most of us will have played Vanilla when it was real. Not only do we already know everything about it, but we likely have experience now AND all the resources are so much more readily available.
---
Probably because they wanted their summer of classic, and they're not getting it.
---
Every guild had its Chinese gold farmer.
---
Just spec 17/17/17.
---
That's what I thought.
---
**GET.............OUT.............OF MY HEAD!!!!!!!**
---
Good for you! I'm glad to see people experience the non-rushing side of gaming through classic. That's where most of the enjoyment in the game comes from, imo. people who come in looking for cutting-edge raiding aren't going to find it.
---
Christ you don’t even know
---
No sunder was not the best for geared tanks and every guide that say so are wrong. Sunder is only good if you have no gear and your heroic strike does no damage, eg. when leveling and in dungeon blues. When you have raid gear heroic strike wins.
---
Maybe I will, this shit's too much effort
---
tauren can't be priests in vanilla I'm afraid
---
lol the goal is not to win, its just to escape, and you can escape players much higher level than you.  blinking in the wrong direction, standing instead of running, and aggroing mobs while escaping, is all part of getting outplayed.
---
I dont see how that has to be the case. I can certainly imagine the arguments. If most of the hardcore pvp crowd go to classic, they might start referring to retail as the "carebear" version. Would be hard to disagree. It's kind of like when Dota 2 came out. It was common for people to insult other players by saying "go back to league of legends". Implying one game had a higher learning curve and more complex mechanics and was therefore superior. They would be right if and only if you agree with their criteria for superior. It's certainly subjective.
---
Yeah I can see a decent amount of people dropping off between 30-40 when things start getting dicey with Wpvp and jumping between zones for questing.
---
Because some of us like drama, and not the person in question.
---
Don't think most people got far in naxx or got to rank 13 no.
---
Horde feels like an adventure. Alliance feels like you're cleaning up a mess.
---
Arn't you tired of constantly getting downvoted? If it's true that you got 5 children it's about time to change and become something that your children won't be ashamed of in the future.
---
Good because I love to see morons shouted down
---
It's something coming coming in the future, like driverless cars. I know let's complain they won't work because there no sensors installed yet on the road network DERP. Holy fuck the brain-dead masses
---
Mage or Druid so you can reliably escape if shit hits the fan.
---
Whatever you say you cranky bitch 😂
---
I was only answering to that "10yo babies" saying that classic is a game for strong ass men. You are not superior in any way possible for playing classic over retail, and seems like a lot of people here don't understand that.
---
&lt;Redux&gt; [A][NA][PvP] Raid Time: Tuesday/Thursday 8EST but still up for debate Loot System: EPGP / Zero sum DKP
---
Redux is looking for all like-minded Classic players with a primary focus on pre-made PvP and Raiding. We are an experienced group of Vanilla veterans who've been preparing for Classic and would love for you to consider joining our ranks. We have both raided and completed everything from MC to Naxx as well as getting Warlord and Conqueror before it was cool.
---
WHAT IS EXPECTED? - As a PvE raider: Be knowledgeable of your class and have the desire to improve yourself - whether that be through the acquisition of gear, perfecting your rotation or increasing your attention to mechanics. Try to put the raid before yourself. We aren't however min/maxers. If you have a race/class/spec you like and can perform with it, bring it along. - As a PvPer: Show up and do your best! - As a Social: Be kind and courteous in guild chat and make friends! Honestly we are just 2 friends trying to relive our vanilla PvP days. We are pretty laid back and hope to find some other people that want to achieve similar goals and enjoy the ride.
---
We plan on raiding to gear for PvP before BGs release. There wont be a loot council outside of giving our top DPS thunderfury (likely a mage but change my mind) going to try a modified DKP / EPGP loot system so that everyone has a fair chance so we can do well in premades when they release We have a discord and are currently working on a website, just message me for the discord link. We also have candy.
---
I'm rolling male dwarf because I can't handle the female dwarf waddle. Plus their beards are epic. I'd consider a female dwarf if they had proper dwarven beards.
---
What? I haven’t seen a single misogynistic comment or anyone even mention she’s female. This had nothing to do with gender until you brought it up.
---
That’s how all SJW shit starts. No one cares about race or gender or anything, and then some retard brings it up where it doesn’t exist. Congrats, you’re that retard
---
I played a warrior and priest thinking everyone needs tanks and heals!  .........spent a lot of time hanging out in big cities doing jack shit.  Solo class this time and if grouping works out, great. If not, ....ain't gonna give a fuck either!  /salute
---
You are not wrong, but I see the challenging aspect would be knowing when to pop your cool downs etc... a less experienced player may lose their cool and fluff it up.
---
Managing a fight so you only pull what you can take is also part of the challenge imo. 
---
Apologies if I came off as rude, which apparently I must have. I have the opinion that health is a resource and if you are coming out of a fight with a lot of health left you aren't challenging your character enough.
---
I plan on rolling an undead rogue this time around, I was a human rogue originally. 
---
Good move not resubbing, every time I come back it feels more different to the original game. 
---
The only reason I stuck around is because Legion was worth it so I assumed BFA would also be decent.
---
If they don’t the. The RP community will make a thread and pick a PVP server as “RPPVP”. Also my guild is recruiting. Send me a DM for info.
---
Thanks mate!
---
This sub is not for private servers 
---
Go to /wowservers for private servers.
---
What the hell you on about lmao?
---
You havn't got a good recollection of tbc s3 and s4 if that's what you think.
---
So many classes utilized the least amount of pvp gear possible and they were monsters when doing so.
---
Either people not interested or don't know they can queur remotely via chat command.
---
I imagine the butthurt will be strong from all the retail tourists who test the waters of Classic in Phase 1.
---
I doubt the GMs or Devs will be holding anyone's hand as they try to quest through Redridge, Stonetalon or STV. If people don't like the ganking, they can either try to come back later or find some 60's to save the day.
---
Very weak spec. You can't raid with that spec.
---
Aren't 0 servers using some kind of mix match of av patches?
---
Why would such 3 people exist in the first place?
---
Are you planning to become a popular streamer?
---
If yes, that is the risk you will take...for MONEY.
---
If you are JUST another player, there won't be any 3 other players "dedicated to ruining" the game for you.
---
I hope you understand THE DIFFERENCE between a streamer and a normal player.
---
And I'm pretty sure you wouldn't have cleared the rest of Naxx by kicking 3 of the hunters right?
---
&gt; PVE gear useless besides 1 or 2 pieces.
---
With the sunwell release and the 8piece tier set, the meta in season 4 was 4pieces t6 and 4pieces brutal gladiator, at least for my rogue, with both warglaives it was broken
---
Fools! You'll ruin everything!
---
rofl this never happened. losers who dont care about the level difference wasting lowbies certainly dont care about emoting, if anything it just gives them a bigger boner. even the least 'reactive' thing you can do (stand still, dont run, dont fight back, just die) wont dissuade skullcels
---
best thing to do is to log out and do something else, maybe come back 15 mins later. ruins their game instead of yours
---
OK so for 5s druid is great for doing all of that stuff, you must be thinking raids only...which druids can happily heal.
---
Also, for new druids out there...make friends with shaman/paladin and run instances together so you have a rezzer plus the extra utility is really sweet.
---
They learn skills through trial, error and research until they get on their shit? Or they find a game with a format that is more compatible with their play style?
---
Do you recommend Windfury for this build?
---
2 in savage strikes, 2 in imp clip. Hit both when someone closes the gap on you and hope for the best.
---
Then 2 in imp mark for flat DPS increase
---
:thinking:
---
I was just trying to be inspirational haha
---
I did not know you can Q remotely. But Its probably people not interested. They are just trying to make it to 60
---
People assume guilds will only run with the "optimal" raid comps. That won't be a thing for a majority of guilds
---
Kill me now
---
My old favorite flag hiding spot :)  
---
Maybe lots of people knew about it, but I discovered it for myself via lots of failed jump attempts, and I never encountered someone else taking the flag there.  
---

---
I could play at work during breaks...then take extra breaks...then maybe get yelled at.
---
Yeah this is the case. With great gear we'd farm Strat live for Orbs and finish the instance in under 25 minutes, a few times under 20 minutes. But during leveling and early at 60 normally still require CC.
---
Ooga gang is a good example of how you can troll very effictively without just straight up griefing.
---
They don't use bleeds in raid and are really good for shirt fights. Look up shedo on YouTube.
---
Live to win!
---
Bro I played the game to have fun not to try to be the fastest/best. It didn't make me feel stupid at all doing what I enjoyed.
---
Ehhh I'm not sure you're remembering it right.  The game changed not because of the addition of flying or badges.  It changed because the market changed.    
---
" However, even with daily quests, Blizzard understood that casual players, with flying mounts, will burn through those quests fairly fast " and " This idea of TBC dailies and badge gear, with flying mounts, did not worked as intended "  are both utter nonsense, because the first true daily hub was, unless my memory is rubbish, the Isle of Quel'Danas in the Sunwell patch, right at the end of TBC;  and you cannot fly on the isle.  At all.
---
How do you not see the contradiction in these two comments:
---
&gt; the amount of players will definitely be lower when phase 2 hits
---
and
---
&gt;Obviously when layers get merged there will be more players in your game.
---
&gt; There is definitely a sexist component to the extreme hate this clip is producing 
---
Could you point out what it is?
---
Or you are just throwing SJW mantras, without arguments?
---
 merely a "handful"
---
lmao
---
There will be plenty of human and troll mages too. Just a metric fuckton of mages....and as a consumer of water, I for one....welcome our new mage overlords.
---
I did too but I remember I never leveled up a profession during TBC so it was either grind out a profession (hated at the time) or go to the Isle of Queldanas and fuck around for 30 minutes to make like 30g lol.
---
no u
---
No you both
---
What's the point?  You have your opinion, I have mine.  I loved TBC a lot more than classic, but that's my prerogative.  I'm not about to waste time trying to convince you that my opinion is right or better than yours.
---
Sadly hobbies can def get suppressed to support a relationship. While I am sure for 99% of player there will be no issues there will still be those who no life it like they did in high school but have a lot more responsibilities now.
---
Yes they can do all of that stuff "happily" but they are not near to great compared with other classes.
---
Nobody said it won't work in the future...that was the point, it is the present now without the infrastructure in place. How is the distant future of November 2019 going to have the 100% 5g global coverage that would be assumed if others are "living in the past" of June 2019?
---
Alot of people got into naxx but didn't clear it and did the pvp grind man. I was casual in raiding and saw everything upto and a little bit into AQ 40 and was just shy of rank 11 with the groups i dabbled in pvp grinding with and that's just casually playing both sides of the coin. So yeah I'm gonna go out on a limb and say most people experienced that vast majority of what blizzard had to offer in vanilla except the extreme end of stuff. Naxx was more timing than difficulty and Rank 12+ was simply a time investment, people didn't have to get that to "experience" pvp, or get feeling of what the grind entailed.
---
On the server I'm in you can below 60. Either way people just pushing quests hard.
---
Holy shit it's back again
---
Thank god they can't too. Tauren in Transcendence gear is hideous
---
Shouldn't he be wearing a teal dress?
---
I say play Rogue. 
---
You are deadly and can choose when and where to fight. 
---
If in a bad spot just vanish to live another day.  
---
Been playing rogue since late vanilla and it was a blast all the way through Wotlk.  
---
Go for it... if you dont like it stay at 19,29,39,49,59 as a twink and lvl a warrior instead.
---
Thats really weird. If I dont like someone, I do all I can to avoid that person. My opinion
---
I just burned out, was looking at 400 hours to max between agility, RC, and mining with another 200 or so to finish the easy stuff.  
---
5 days to max isn’t remotely bad.
---
Fact is, in vanilla during MC/BWL era there was a duel/pvp hp minimal cap of 4k hp  for rogues and hunters. The point was that most classes had a burst to deal around 3,5K hp at most in few second, below 4k you were under the risk to being 2 shots by hunters, mages, locks, rogue, shaman.
---
Who the fuck cares about Alexautisual? My God. He proved he's a piece of shit long ago on the private server scene. Why people would watch him, let alone follow his opinions, is beyond me. Why you would assume everyone against streamers MOST be his fan, I don't understand, either. Fuck Alex, and fuck the major streamers in general, and fuck Blizzard for giving streamers priority.
---
Horde will be more populated while Alliance will win more bgs. As it goes.
---
Yeah it opened my eyes a bit to the huge difference between clearing naxx and "server first".
---
We raid twice a week and cleared instructor spider wing and plague wing so far. I expect to kill KT before classic, which is enough for me.
---
Ummm you could just play regular wow, and if you have 5 kids and you are having time issues with managing them maybe you shouldn’t be arguing on reddit about playing games.
---
hm... too soon?
---
It will be up to the community to police their own lowbie zones. If your faction doesn't care enough about Redridge, your option is to re-roll on PvE.
---
On the flip side, in Phase 2 people will be farming HKs in the open world for PvP ranks, so some people might consider defending Redridge, etc as an opportunity for some world PvP. And some people will view ganking lowbies as a way to stir up th pot in hopes that a few 60's will show up. The reality is that lowbies will be caught in the crossfire sometimes, and Blizzard won't be holding their hand.
---
Funny - a pointless button glued in text :-)
---
You sound like the toxic one with the tone of this post. Try rewording and maybe I’ll consider reading the rest of this.
---
Retail isn’t going anywhere, troll
---
My first character was a human warrior. I got the game for my 15th birthday and didn't know anyone who played. So naturally I didn't know what to do when I logged in. So I ran around and saw "&lt;location&gt; discovered: ## experience earned." Figured that was a sure way to level. Made it to level 4 corpse running all the way around the human starting zones before I got frustrated and deleted the character to restart.
---
Have you played original Vanilla? For real? No private server, be truthfull. Because I feel its to easy, but have not gotten to play.
---
You keep throwing out "loser" in this thread and its kind of ironic how pathetic you sound. You realize that this is a video game right? You realize how pathetic and worthless you sound when you shit talk a person who logged out after being ganked by 3 rogues 18 levels higher then her?
---
You're pathetic.
---
Mainly due to the fact that ally is much better than horde in pve
---
Great in every task doesn't mean the best in every task. They can do all roles well and guess what. You don't have to reroll a new toon just to tank couple of dungeons and then dps as a filler the next few or heal most of the time. Try dpsing as priest and come yell me how fun wanding is in the end. (I'll main priest healer but also roll hunter and druid because both of them are fun while I enjoy healing the most).
---
I mean....if net connectivity was stable it would work. Plug in headset and mic for raids and dungeons!
---
ok.  and what exactly did i say was wrong? do you think this girl did everything she could've done to escape?  i'm not saying she definitely 100% would've escaped by doing everything possible.  but the person i'm replying to is asking what she could've done, and i'm noting things she didn't do that *maybe* might've helped
---
You mean Judgement of Wisdom? Nah it's a very strong Judgements. Most guilds can afford the debuff slot for almost all content.
---
I appreciate your post as it does a nice job of laying out the path that the game has taken starting in TBC, but I take issue with your characterization of the “casual player”. 
---
I didn’t really raid in TBC, and I appreciated that I could do dailies and heroic dungeons and battlegrounds and still progressing my character. I understood that I wasn’t going to be able to get into the raiding content because I didn’t have the time, but I could still make my character better at my own pace. 
---
Maybe I was in the minority, but I never felt resentful of more hardcore players. Especially when I could go back at higher levels and run through the content after the fact (got Sulfuras at lvl 80 for example). 
---
I did find a cool group and friends and we managed to raid on the normal difficulty and have fun doing it, and I appreciate that there was content for our play style and time constraints. 
---
I am really excited for classic because I appreciate how friendly it is to casual players. I can spend time working on my professions, grinding rep, doing battlegrounds, or running 5 mans with friends. 
---
I wonder how the game would have been without the advent of the three main systems you described, and I wonder what the developers could have done differently to keep the game progressing without losing the core idea of a social game taking place in a living world. 🤷‍♂️
---
You still need to be exalted to use them. I was an orc with raptor PVP mount back in the day and had to get exalted with the troll faction
---
For me, it was dailies more than anything else ... It became a daily chore. And if you skipped a day or two, you lost out on stuff. While previously I was in control on when/how much I could farm, with dailies Blizz took control of when/how much for me. And I hated it. Dailies became a chore really fast ...
---
I'd much rather skip a few days here and there and pull an all-nighter or two instead to actually spend more time in game, but ...
---
&gt;.
---
Layering is intended to handle the initial urge of players on release and only for a few weeks, not to be a long term way of population management.
---
ICC was awesome. WotLK ones were beautiful and really leveraged flying mounts in a positive way, as was the questing experience IMO. 
---
On the other hand, the 5 mans were ridiculously easy, esp coming out of TBC. The rehash of Naxx was meh, and ToC and the 5 mans that came with it completely invalidated raid progression before it. Also class design, again IMO, was kinda meh. It didn’t help that Cata followed as well, also meh...
---
The video I linked? Shaman had enough spell power that if the gauntlets scaled, they should do more than 3 damage. They did 3 damage.
---
what
---
As a former priest...I kind of agree with this.  I'd say warlock though even tho warlock can get complex spell-wise, you don't spend time kiting and people will actually want you in raids. Yeah warlock takes skill to get good at I'm not talking shit about the class, I just think you'll get better over time as you play, it's a fun class, there's no dead zone, easy to level....seriously, warlock and just keep practicing to get better at. Long road to 60 so you can get there! and it will be fun, and if you're alliance you'll be one of the few and welcome.
---
Definitely will be sleeping less at release to keep up with leveling.  Once 60 and raiding it shouldn't be too bad to gather mats potions and show up a few nights a week to raid.  Pvp on the weekends :)
---
This is the second time you’ve posted this fucking garbage. If you don’t have time to play classic then don’t bitch about making the game worse for those that do. Sounds like your kids could use your attention more anyway
---
It's good for a warrior or really any melee class. Just because it isn't mail doesn't make it bad.
---
le meters
---
Sounds like you might be the issue, my man
---
And i like smoking.  Doesnt mean its good for me
---
That has nothing to do with the proc really. It's just because Alcor is 1.3 speed with relatively high white damage. Whenever you have excess rage and you can dump that rage into Heroic Strike, a fast weapon will serve you very well. (Heroic Strike does the same threat no matter weapon speed)
---
yes and most twitch users use a chrome/firefox extension called BTTV which stands for better twitch tv.
---
this chrome extension converts all the “unofficial” twitch emotes to actual emotes. like OMEGALUL or LULW or monkaW etc etc
---
you know you can't be a human hunter, right? ...right?
---
inb4 "I'm going to be Night Elf or Dwarf Hunter (the only options for Alliance hunters) and corpserun all the way to Elwynn to do the Human starting area instead of my own area" (why?)
---
Both are factually correct.
---
Sorry you can't comprehend, have a great day!
---
Priest Mage Rogue the holy trinity
---
I long for the day a GM tells me "Sucks to suck" when i whine in a ticket.
---
I saw a human tagging mobs for the guard going between stormwind and goldshire to kill as well. Good use of mechanics, I'd say.
---
Why even play the game if you just want a math problem? Go play with a calculator
---
One of us. Gooble Goble. Gooble Goble.
---
This is a nice post.
---
Who are you talking about?
---
mine/eng while leveling? Mining could be fine if I level fast but as far as I know engineering is a gold sink. Isn't saving up for mount more important?
---
I'm guessing a lot of streamer fans are working through some built-up aggression after hearing about how the rest of us want nothing to do with them.
---
Not sure what you're trying to do since everyone who played on all these servers in vanilla, TBC and WLK says completely different than you.
---
"ok" :)
---
tbc had some of the best end game content imo. professions, dungeons, raids, pvp... 
---
but yes the introduction of dailies and badges of justice were terrible. and honestly the beginning of the end.
---
You know it's authentic because they are talking about thottbot in the chat :P
---
So let me get this straight? You're SUCH a PRO wow player, you would constantly rez and keep letting yourself get ganked. You're a pathetic moron.
---
Objectives are more fun to me than tdm.
---
Yeah, that hype feeling when you finally set your personal best in terms of how far you made it into the cave.
---
boyfriend and i met playing wow during legion... gonna be a fun adventure in classic ヽ(♡‿♡)ノ
---
TBC was and is my favorite wow xpac.
---
Disgusting. I’m about to throw up
---
Don't waste your breath ... I gave up when I read about him having problems with mobs running away at low hp.
---
Yeah sad to see them go against this =/
---
Yes, but it's took on different meanings now, like someone being out of touch culture wise. Depends on the context of use.
---
Giving new meaning to clicking abilities...
---
This is fucking terrible but as long as they have PC version idc if they add mobile. Oldschoolrunescape did it and it’s good. You can kill some bosses and you can do skilling really well. If you wanna mobile it up and get herbs or whatever I think that’s fine. Why not? I don’t even use old school runescape on the phone that often but if I’m out I can still get xp on my phone now. I think a lot of people don’t use mobile either because it’s a little slower.
---
You should play what you enjoy and just keep practicing. Everyone starts out as you describe. Learn your keybinds, watch videos on Twitch of players of your class to pick up ideas on how to play well, and do the same thing that musicians ask:  How do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice, practice, practice.
---
But for the love of God, play what you enjoy! No class is going to be a free ticket at being good at PvP. Gotta put in your 1000 hours.
---
Well, it doesn't matter that she did it. It matter HOW she did, what she said BEFORE logging off and what she did AFTER logging off.
---
And that was on a stream, on a beta invite.
---
So, to sum up, before she logged off she said : "I'm not dealing with this, I'll just play retail". She logs off, and than she logs into BfA.
---
When the game will be live, logging off is a good way to avoid gankers, if this is all you can think you can do. 
---
But you got a beta invite because you are a streamer...and OBVIOUSLY a streamer that HATES Classic. This can be clearly seen. 
---
Yes, her beta invite should be revoked. 
---
When Asmongold, or Tips, or Esfand, or Staysafe or Nixxion will do THE SAME THING, their beta invites should also be revoked.
---
SOME RANDOM streamer gets a Classic beta just because it's a random streamer, while being a Classic hater, and logs off...yeah, that streamer should have its beta revoked.
---
Agility is crit and dodge for everyone. Strength gives just as much melee AP as agility for rogues. It also gives 2 melee AP to everyone else, and hunters usually get attacked by other melee up close and need to melee back. Everyone who can wear leather would want this.
---
&gt;enhancement shaman maybe? Thought they used agility ...
---
Not until maybe cataclysm? For vanilla and TBC their melee is identical to warriors. 2 ap per strength, agility is only crit.
---
hahahaha oh those simper old days.  I think I took several months to get there as well - but it was great, it felt like such an epic journey
---
Yes I do know. That’s why I asked if there would still be a hunter trainer despite that hunters can’t roll in the human starting area as a human. I’d rather start leveling in Goldshire as a hunter for personal preference.
---
Don't you dare make me roll a warrior with these high numbers.
---
You know damn well I will never get rank 14 weps.
---
Shame on you.

I already did this 6 months ago

Thanks again for proving that this is one of the dumbest gaming communities out there.

It doesn't matter. Most Warriors will be Arms and have Deep Wounds.

Have you not seen all "The Boys" Memes? you have to go with the boys. Just bring the undead mage back and play with the boys, you'll have way more fun playing with them then alone as a dwarf.
---
Shit memes, i can live with it, but upvote botted shit memes, that's what i dont like.
---
I had no idea why people hated murlocs until I leveled an alliance hunter on a private server.
---
Even for a hunter you need to think before you act, fucking chained mobs with ccs and heals
---
My dad
---
He just said being a jack of all trades is not part of class design, nothing of what you said. Where is the context of that mannn?
---
Wrath was when they changed disc priest to be based around their shield, which would have made them a terrible healer if you couldnt generate rage while shielded.
---
k...
---
you're gonna have to go all the way back to Stormwind every time you want to visit the trainer. have fun I guess?
---
Absolutely level engineering as a hunter, it is huge for a hunter. You'll be happy you did it. I know skin/lw sounds easy and attractive, but put the time and energy and tears into it and just chip away at it. As a hunter you can farm and buy mats if you have to in addition to mining nodes. It will be as bad as everyone is saying because everyone will be leveling it for pvp servers, but hunter it will be less hard IMO.
---
Both can raid and pvp in the same spec. I think a warlock is slightly more optimal for this.
---
This was a great advice I went and framed up about 50 Oily blackmouth and 30 raw sage fish plus hit like 10 of those floating wreckage and found a named mob to kill and got an upgrade.
---
Had a friend make me 1 underwater breathing pot and  a bunch of free actions which I sold on AH

Made about 30g so far maybe make 40g after all sells

Not a bad a haul. Still level 17 though :( gonna have to go level.

See what are you classing as casual? Because I'm pretty sure there will be raiding guilds out there that only do runs maybe once/twice a week with a sub optimal team and just manage to clear raids at a slower rate. Only the rarest cases would you see an oomkin in a hardcore guild, but I'm not looking for hardcore. Either way people have done it and been fine, the wow classic community is too hyperbolic when it comes to raid optimisation
---
Are you assuming this post is botted? I can assure you that it’s not - at least not from me.
---
yeh too many professions to lvl up..
---
You'll have Phase 1 &amp; Phase 2 to get your fill of Open World PvP before the BGs are added. That could be around 6 months of play time before BGs are added.
---
Resilience was good, as a die hard pvper l, I could log on and pvp for 18hrs and not have to raid and I am completely fine with that. Forcing me to raid just to be able to compete at 2200+ is just absolutely retarded... that being said PvE gear still had its place and was very good to have but didnt decide matches by any means.
---
They start out pretty rough in PvP but they become insane later. Stay in a crowd so you outnumber the enemy and you'll really enjoy it.
---
&gt;Deadzone was a bitch back in the day for hunters.
---
Personally, I never had an issue with it.  Just roll engineering and use nades when mages attempt it.
---
I don't find that priest healing is nearly as intimidating as some people make it out to be. You really have 2-3 bread and butter healing spells, depending on your role in the raid.
---
That's more complex than mage (frostbolt frostbolt frostbolt) but I wouldn't let it scare you off.
---
imo sometimes people quibble about optimizing downranking and make it sound like people are doing math in the middle of a fight. Like you're expected to calculate on the fly if you can save 15 mana by casting 4 greater heal vs. rank 5. The reality is more that you figure out what your most mana-efficient heal is before the raid (there are mods and websites for this, too). That stays your most efficient spell rank for months, until you get better gear. 
---
Then your mid-combat choice is largely between efficient-heal, big-slow-heal, and oh-shit-fast-heal.
---
For the big-slow-heal, you're usually precasting it on the tank before they even take damage, so it's not like you have to worry about which rank is optimal during the fight. You are just spamming your big heal and cancelling it if it's not needed.
---
&gt; It'll only take you a couple of hours to hit that. 
---
In retail, yes, 2 hours played. In Classic, more like 30 hours played.
---
Shift the goal posts, start caring about global coverage... Get a life
---
Ret Pallys being a meme spec is one reason more for many of us to roll one to prove Azeroth wrong
---
Thank you, I hate it.
---
Plus it's not just the experience but the loot and gold too. Running around you aren't making any profit
---
Warlocks are actually beasts in BWL gear already
---
Eventhough i’m not picking it as a main, but as my first alt. It’s my favorite class. As i recall from last playing shaman in vanilla (was on retail) i’ve tried both ele and enha, both capable for levelling. Im not sure on the endgame. I think there you’re resto or enha with nightfall(2h axe)
---
'Ello mon. Ya be wantin' some of da voodoo? We trolls be flippin', mon.
---
Same!
---
You'd have to be a massive retard to grind your way to 60. It's inefficient on every single metric.
---
This hits right at home with me.  I went from dwarf/ne priest --&gt; Gnome mage --&gt; night elf hunter :) 
---
I'm 95% confident I'm set on hunter.  I've played priest since vanilla so I was like damn i need a change --&gt; mage i decided there will just be wayyy too many of them.  I was mainly drawn to being a cute gnome and having food/ports --&gt; hunter. I played hunter in vanilla as well but really like the rpg elements involved with having a pet, staying a range, kiting things and having a high pvp skill ceiling.  I dont care much about pve and if I do it I dont care about dmg meters so I'm not worried about my damage falling off in aq/naxx
---
Your ignorance is actually blowing my mind. Do you actually not realize that’s the entire reason I made the post? Because I didn’t know if there was a trainer in goldshire? People like you are the reason this subreddit gets shit on from the outside. You don’t offer anything intelligent and continue to make this community even worse
---
Hunter items, all of them. I don't care if it's a shield, I took enchanting for a reason!
---
BLOOD AND THUNDER!
---
One hour was about how long it took to hit 5 on the stress test thanks to resource contention.
---
Go Warlock, probably the best solo class in the game for open world and incredible at PVPing.
---
There’s still tons of world pvp brosiff. Get a group of buddies together and go mess around an opposite factions lowbie zones for 15-20 minutes you’ll have more world pvp than you can handle.  Battlegrounds just give you an area to consistently grind towards your pvp sets. And the twinks also create an excellent market for people to make money off of and help boost the economy. People make multiple twinks and spend hundreds of gold to deck them out and then spend consistent money on consumables to keep them “maxed” for pvp. Battlegrounds were a great addition to the game. While I agree they take away from the world pvp a bit, it doesn’t kill it like you seem to think it will.
---
Pretty much this.
---
Oh, and streaming comes with additional risks. It's 2019. Stream snipping is a thing.Streamers should play on PvE servers. For their own sanity.
---
You look around and notice, they're respawning...
---
This again, nice
---
man people making fun of it is really monkaS dude
---
Since Cata I have held the (often unpopular) opinion that flying mounts are what ruined this game.  IMO, flying mounts should have been items that increased flight path speed (thus decreasing flight path time) while changing the flight path griffin/wyvern into another model for you.  They would still be status symbols, as people soared into Thunder Bluff or wherever on their giant dragons, and maybe you could still use them as ground mounts.  I would maybe be OK with flying mounts if flight models and mount stamina were a thing (so no more hovering forever in safety), or Ariel combat where you were dismounted mid-air if you took enough damage (falling to your death without a slow fall), but flying anywhere at any time with complete immunity?  Ruined the game. 
---
Vanilla had a different *feeling* than modern wow.  A feeling of being miles away from safety.  A feeling of being far away from "civilization".  Modern wow, even without flying mounts, have zones that are too small and compact to give you that feeling.  You are less than a minute away from a quest hub or flight master at all times, and that doesn't even include the whistle.
---
I think flying mounts are here to stay and will make come back in "Classic TBC" if/when it comes around, but I agree with your post, OP.
---
That's also what most people say to do when you get camped. I don't get it either.
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure that more people played it as 10-15yo than 20-30, but that's something we can't know. My point is the whole superiority thing
---
Tauren priest? Classic? Nope.
---
She's in my bed.
---
lol, k bud. have fun corpse running and making a ton of unnecessary trips.
---
Who needs notes for classic when you already know the correct choice in your heart. I know mine Female Orc Warrior, Main tank status!
---
This is really well put together, know of one for warrior?
---
I agree with you. My work schedule is similar to yours but that's not the point. Saying that everyone should be allowed to play the game on whatever platform they feel comfortable with is fine. If they released wow for xbox and ps4 would you be mad? Or are those reputable enough as a gaming console over a Samsung galaxy 10 that costs 3x as much money?
---
I got got

I have a similar list but with the additional info such as name, spec, gear progress.
---
Hi, /u/DuncanMcCokinner
---
i started on one. there was like 2 main rp guilds on the server. once questing with a friend we ran into some guy who grabbed a bunch of us and raider barrens. most people got pissed as it was "a wast of time" but it was fun though we never did anything like that again.
---
Now just imagine losing experience every time you died, possibly being delivered, and grouping for basic quests and grinding being pretty much mandatory at higher levels. 
---
Funny enough, vanilla was considered an "Easy Mode" MMO because it didn't have that at the time. Glad to hear you had a good time,  Vanilla really is a complete experience because you have to be resourceful and thoughtful at times but not to the point where it's outright frustrating.
---
It's a raid spec (and probably a dungeon spec), if you wanted a pvp or farming spec then you would do something completely different.  With that in mind, only hunters mark and parry make sense to me.
---
It doesn't really matter, as these point will have such a small impact.
---
Fwiw, if you really wanted to min/max it then you would drop scattershot for the 3rd hunters mark, but I don't expect anyone to do that.
---
I know this is a joke, but I would like to see someone try to use this at max level on a warrior stance dancing lol.
---
Yes please Venture Co for life!

---
Back VC pit demon! You shall not pass!
---
Yes but 6 months isn't really alot of time in game like WoW unless you intend to just race straight to 60, raid and then PvP to the point of exhaustion so that you get that sense of "fill" before it's all gone.
---
That's not what happened though. She was being ganked multiple times and rage quit.
---
It is very fun while leveling, at least enhancement, seeing your windfury proc is great.
---
I never got to 60 in Vanilla though as I started too late so I can't tell you anything about that.
---
I'm gonna roll it again as I got used to being a resto shaman main, probably leveling as elemental this time.
---
Two fairly experienced raiders looking for a new guild for classic. 
---
Musts: Horde, NA, EST raid times (preferably not ending later than 10 or 10:30 est), and have raiding spots for a Mage and a Priest/Shaman. Also would like to join a guild with mature and helpful guildies, we are both late 20s in age. 
---
Prefer a PVE server, willing to go PVP if everything else aligns. Are definitely interested in BGs and World PvP, just prefer to level in PVE.
---
Please dm if your guild fits this description or add on discord (Zertra#5571). 
---
Apparently, retail players don't understand this.
---
I am STRONGLY suggesting that retail players SHOULD NOT, I repeat, SHOULD NOT roll on a PvP server. It's going to be dog eat dog post apocalyptic world, and they can't handle it. Well, the VAST majority of them.
---
 I've only ever been able to do the full grind to max level on a shaman. Tried other classes and just couldn't keep the interest going. I can't speak for vanilla, but raiding prospects were good in BC. I hear they're good healing in vanilla raids, and good for PVP. As for leveling, I was never great at PVP but definitely had fun doing it, and your DPS/healing will be just fine in dungeons. 
---
Not an authority by any means, but that's my two cents. I'd definitely recommend shaman. If nothing else, ghost wolf is great and you'll get to run all over the place for your totem quests :]
---
Yeah but like, there is no time limit. Unlike Vanilla, Classic isn't going to end. You specifically said "never" and that was my argument. Some people might take a really, really long time. But not never.
---
Yeah, I'm a bit confused by this as well as I believe it was changed during vanilla. 
---
Some gear needs reputation, some needs a certain rank, some cost marks, some gold?
---
Dwarf it is then!
---
Hehe brings me back i remember paying people in guild to get their hks each week when i was playing pve. Got fed up and moved to pvp shortly after lol
---
If you like every fight ending after the first round of kills followed by intense corpse camping, sure.
---
I much prefer wsg/ab where there’s more tug n pull during the fighting
---
Play bfa, that sounds like a good game with your temper anyway, plus more familytime
---
Sounds like retail WoW is right up your alley.
---
Ton of HP, Hits like a wet noodle. Ah Vanilla
---
Lol, k neckbeard. Imagine being such a loser you take the time to type online that you’re mad about streamers playing a game and giving it coverage to thousands. I think you’d be best playing on private servers on classic release. Community doesn’t really need 30 year old men that cry online🤷‍♂️

That ?? rogue IS PART OF THE CLASSIC.

If you like Classic, you have to like it with ?? rogues in it. There is no cherry picking here.
---
It's not a funny copypasta if it gets spammed 20 times a day.
---
Nothing, just stating in the US they failed hard, so I can understand why when Blizzard says they are launching with limited servers and when they had to decide between a pvp/pve server or rp-pvp they chose not to add one yet

The class you want to get good at
---
oceanic discord https://discord.gg/3jX9s3H
---
I mainly played a shaman for all of Vanilla, including class lead for a decent raiding guild up to a few bosses in Naxx.
---
Most of my time was spent in a 30 Elemental, 21 Resto spec, which is decent for grind farming, decent for healing, decent for PvP. In addition to running with a guild for a good portion of PvE content, I also ran with a fairly decent premade PvP group, I never pushed higher than rank 10 (due to some farming/raiding responsibilities) but the group did put a few High Warlords on the map.
---
I focused mainly on healing in PvP and PvE, you're not likely to be denied a raid spot unless you're trying to play as Enhancement, chain heal is super powerful especially at later gear levels, and you'll be highly desired. Healing 5 man content is no problem at all. For PvP you can be very versatile, Flag runner, healer, anchor in AB. While you're not the best at any of these roles, being able to do all 3 in the same BG if needed is very handy, and gives you a lot of flexibility.
---
I mean, successful raiding wasn't really for casuals, tbh. And by casual I mean someone that doesn't or can't sink the time needed into the game. Guilds may do runs once/twice a week, but that doesn't mean that you don't need to farm gold for pots, flasks, reagants and gold for repairs. They aren't hyperbolic at all, some classic are just flat out shit at endgame in vanilla. I dunno if you were around during vanilla but genuinely it isn't the all inclusive "lets make every spec viable for everything" game it is nowadays. Balance druids were a bit shit back in the day.
---
&gt; Blizzard is absolutely opposing in REMOVING features that they add in the game. 
---
And that's why classic will give them an awesome opportunity. Because they can take a different direction and not add this things to the game.
---
Honestly, the only thing I'd like to have, from TBC+, is the arena.
---
dude has a reddit account dedicated to (poorly) trying to troll people, how he has so much free time to type up paragraphs is beyond me.
---
When will we finally ban dad gamers?
---
Not even a good troll 
---
Ppl need to step up their game
---
World PvP has objectives too.
---
People would call out in local chat when there was fighting going on and they needed help/protection.
---
You'd scout areas to warn people.
---
You'd have raid-vs-raid fights between horde and alliance when they both wanted to fight against Azuregos.
---
You'd have clashed on the way to MC through Blackrock Mountain.
---
You'd have the capital raids to kill the opposing leaders.
---
You'd look for particular players that were well known and attempt to assassinate them.
---
That had far more of a living breathing world component than capturing magical flags that won't mean jack when they reset in 15 minutes. Over, and over, and over again.

The utility hunters bring is tranq shot and kiting on bosses, in case anyone was wondering.

No not you m8, someone else did.

Didnt dig deep enough, but yeah obviously a troll 😁
---
See a therapist.
---
I like your 'BITCH' macro
---
True, instead of resilience, they could add some PvP utility to a small ammount of pieces (like the pvp medalion/trinket effect that every pvp player will love to have) but in terms of stats still let the pve gear be relevant
---
i've seen some rping in main cities but most do it in some far away cut most other players don't go to.

any mobs that run in fear are automatically horrible
---
any mobs that cast heals are horrible
---
any mobs that can use health pots are horrible
---
any mobs that can net you in place are horrible
---
any mobs that chain pull are horrible
---
any mobs with low drop rates for quest items are horrible
---
and murlocs tick every damn box ;D
---
I haven't had trouble picking a class at all. Its not like classic is going anywhere, ill have more than enough time to try them all.
---
&gt;That had far more of a living breathing world component than capturing magical flags that won't mean jack when they reset in 15 minutes. Over, and over, and over again.
---
It's good you don't have to do it.
---
you seem upset
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
This sub reddit man...
---
Warlocks beat hunters from BWL and onwards so do mages.
---
Theres nothing stopping you from world pvping when bgs are added. You just wont rank very far
---
Store lvl48+ BOP greens/blues in your bank and take a gathering profession instead. Send any BOEs to a lvl5 enchanter alt for disenchanting (especially cloth) and when you get to 60, drop your gathering profession and take enchanting. You can then disenchant your banked BOPs while still benefiting from the extra gold from the gathering profession.
---
Report and move on - this guy has a miserable life and keeps reposting.
---
0/10, apply yourself, see me after class
---
You haven't streamed Vanilla.
---
If you stream Classic, on a PvP server....better delay your damn stream by 10-15 minutes, of there will be 30 people stream snipping you, instead 3.
---
You see the difference between a STREAMER on a PvP server and a NORMAL player?
---
I hope you do.

&lt;Zz&gt; | Horde | NA - PVP |  6pm - 10 pm PST Sunday - Thursday (as needed) | Hardcore PVE and PVP Guild
---
**Who we are:** &lt;Zz&gt; is comprised of a core of 15 veteran World of Warcraft players, our leadership has cleared through Naxxramas on Private servers and has raided in top retail guilds such as &lt;Gentleman's Club&gt; and &lt;Midwinter&gt;. We are eager to find players that want to bring a hardcore mindset to Classic.
---
**Goals on launch:** Our first goal will be to achieve a **World Top 5 Ragnaros** and as such we are looking for people interested in leveling quickly and diving straight into the end-game content. We are confident that we can kill Ragnaros by day 9 if not faster.
---
**Goals beyond launch:**" Once we have killed Ragnaros we are going to be forming a second raid and doing split runs and once Phase 2 is released we will be pushing to have as many players reach Rank 14 as possible.
---
**Raid Times:** Scheduled raid times are Tuesday and Wednesday 6pm-10pm PST, Early on you can expect the weekly raid commitment to be only about 2 hours per week since it will just be Molten Core and Onyxia. Your schedule should be flexible and agreeable with raiding Sunday and Monday as extra raid days for new content releases and split raids.
---
**Requirements:** Raiders will be expected to show up to raids fully consumed and with an attitude that lends itself to working in a team environment. We're looking for players with competitive mindsets who will push each other to improve and overall better the guild. Members will also be required to have a level 20 Warlock/summoning alt for world bosses. 
---
**How to Apply:** It's as easy as sending in an application! &lt;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf48RsCpN17p0th0ZVUcx6V8QDDcbpnRgCpEBgFeQJTy5z_uw/viewform?usp=sf_link&gt;
---
Feel free to  DM me with any questions. We are always looking for exceptional and passionate players.
---
All you do is this subreddit is cry about streamers. And you call me upset
---
Howdy everyone,
---
I’m looking for a raid guild that does 2-4 times a week range in the US. Time zone isn’t a big deal as I make my own schedule. Raid led a guild called Equinox/Reawaken on Staghelm back in the day and got up to 4-horseman in Naxx before server transfers split the guild up. Super chill, active and no drama and will be 95-100% attendance and although would prefer to be a main tank if I could I do have experience playing a mage and healer (priest and shaman) into Naxx and the previous dungeons. Faction doesn’t matter. At the end I just want to join a solid community that strives to see content in the game. Please message me on here and I’ll post on the discord as well !
---
I, for one, agree with you. While I think BGs can be fun and feel rewarding, I think they detract from other important parts of the game.
---
This may not be what you'd like, OP, but personally I'd like there to be world PvP and Elo-rated 3v3 arenas, no BGs, and for many of the ideas that were put into BGs to instead have been used for world PvP.
---
It has nothing to do with deserving shit or entitlement. It's very simple logic that the people who actually played the game back then should be the ones who beta test it. Not some random ass person just because they have 100 people watching them. That's why there are bug reports of shit that was just normal in vanilla, but how would they know they never played it. It's not hard to comprehend why it makes sense to have actual vanilla players beta test the classic wow client.
---
never said anything against it, go for it if you have fun playing druid, but why would you chose a class that is just inferior to other classes in terms of utility and raw healing power? if u want to play a healer go for priest and you will never have shitty problems like "no regular rez" kek
---
I was hitting pretty decently still actually. Just wasnt built to appompyro people
---
okey dokey smokey ;)
---
Y'all ruined what should have been a funny moment for us to laugh at someone getting ganked with cesspool-level discussion. Thread locked, y'all catchin' some bans / warnings.
---
Ah, troll post. Second posting eh? 
---
Retail for you. Enjoy and good luck. Please take your toxicity elsewhere.
---
I wouldn't say misogynistic. I haven't seen any post using gender as a reason for anything. Only that she's a STREAMER who plays retail. 
---
Don't get me wrong, people are being toxic AF but gender has nothing to do with it.
---
Yes, but it's worth a revisit.
---
That's why the large-scale battles took place between cities. Tug and pull, if a force got flattened they'd retreat to the city guard line for protection and keep fighting.
---
In BGs you just sit and wait for it to end, with the opposing team often preferring to farm you than actually do the objectives.
---
On the respawn thing most of us are of the consensus that the raptors in the Wetlands excavation site and Worgen in the Duskwood rotting orchard are bugged. 
---
Gratz on getting your horse! I'm running around with a gutripper, but I can't afford my mount haha
---
What faction are you playing?
---
Night Elf with Brokentooth is BiS for this, btw.
---
Sounds like you would be better off in retail honestly
---
? was there a change that made it impossible to get up there?
---
I leveled an alt to 10 yesterday with a buddy... we tried to die several times, pulling way too much and it was near impossible to even get into danger, it requires like afking almost. 
---
Contrasted to stress test leveling I died 3 times before 8 and almost died like 10 times. Classic was more 'boring' with the slower pace and spells, but it makes up for it 10 fold with actually hard and engaging content... you cant just turn your brain off and pull .
---
Oh my dear Lord !
---
I am still laughing !
---
The spec I used for pretty much used for all of Vanilla was quite different from these.  Guess it was a hybrid PvP/PvE spec.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#cxZViohthtI0mmo
---
Yeah, and she just decided to not play at that given time? There is a third option, and that's that people don't just harass the shit out of people because they can.
---
Vanilla wasn't the bank fest people are making out and most people thought it was pretty shitty to corpse camp.
---
Either way, if you think it's right and wrong it's hard to see why the girl is getting so much hate. She was being ganked to fuck so she stopped playing to save an incredibly frustrating experience. Every one proceeds to jerk off over it
---
You are the one who answer me what are you talking about. Who said everything is an opinion
---
Lookout man, his rabid followers arrived to downvote us to oblivion!
---
I am well aware of what specs to use for what. That is not what I am asking about.
---
You have more options than ever to pick games that cater to your busy life. Retail WoW has everything you need. The whole point of classic is that it’s more old school.
---
Sorry talking about seeing flag carriers, find memories of protecting the flag carrier while playing keep away.
---
upset enough to creep my post history. sad!
---
and yes, fuck streamers. problem?
---
Trade the gold. And then use neutral AH to send it over cross faction, I would guess
---
I expect noticable drops on 3/20/2020 and again on 4/16/2020..
---
FF VII Remake Release / Cyber Punk 2077 Release..
---
So thats why my raid team is so bad and we cant clear AQ 40.
---
Even if you take your time 6 months is a lot of time imo. Either way BGs are coming in Phase 3 so decide if that works for you or not.
---
The streamer blacklist add-on apparently if you play on the neckbeard server.
---
I loved my shammy so much, I am am now thinking of making it my main when classic is launched. I played a hunter main from vanilla to Wrath, which I'm still thinking of playing....but the shammy is getting a lot of my attention. It was so fun in BGs, I liked healing in PVE (in tBC raids), and AV weekends as a resto shammy was great fun. 
---
I found it fun to level too, as enchancement, till about 50-ish, then I went Resto and Instanced my way to 60.
---
Sure there is world PvP, but it didn't just take away "a bit" of it. It took away a huge chunk. What's left is mere scraps of what it used to be.
---
I mean frost is the superior PVP spec untill you get like aq gear and roll full fire/elemental mage and just 1 or 2 shot everyone.
---
 Is that some kind of retard switch emote? Speak English.
---
It's not overlooked, it's not looked at because it's ass.
---
nope, cause grifing IS PVP. that's what toxic ass pvp's want so bliz lets alot of that shit slide. you want to get a party to do a dungeon. good luck using the summoning stone when there's 6 of the other faction camping it. don't roll pvp unless you want to be a toxic dickhead.
---
OOOOoooOOoOoOOOOooo
---
Cmon guys with the VC, can we not do this bullshit again please. 
---
**It's DM**
---
&gt; blinking in the wrong direction
---
Rogue distracted her. Even if the should get some distance they have mounts and you don't. There was no actual way out as a mage.
---
Not sure if post is meant to be sarcasm, but this is actually extremely helpful info. I like seeing a visual of how much it takes to level. I didn't know how much the needed exp was. 
---
Some people were able to optimize some grind spots up to 50-60k an hour. A 4 hour final level sounds pretty decent to me when the questing is scarce there anyway.
---
After leveling a warrior to 30 last week i started a warlock and felt lika god. So yeah they are good in leveling, pve and pvp
---
Your race is troll?
---
For a casual player or someone behind the power curve, dailies are a catch-up mechanism.
---
If you opt out of that catch-up mechanism, you're going to fall further behind.
---
So no, they aren't required, but they are the most optimal route. It can make other options less fun because you'd get better rewards if you just got on the bus and did dailies like everyone else.
---
You tried to join a song chain and you butchered it. Just own it bro. You’re embarrassing yourself.
---
Who?
---
copypasta!!!
---
They will.
---
About 6-7 million at launch. Worry not:D
---
I just don't know how many will be left in 3 months. Hopefully, 3+ million, just to have 3 times the BfA player base. heck, even 2 millions will do, for starters:D
---
 I'd love arenas. I know they didn't come til BC but that was the one place I could play my twink 100% worry free. I did BGs obviously, but normals naturally got caught in the crossfire, even though we tried (both sides) to leave them be.
---
I can’t deal with man child small brained people like you. Enjoy crying about streamers have fun worrying more about them than yourself
---
Fuck the beta wheres my streamers
---
Those trinkets likely wont be in game til the respective battlegrounds are released. Just like Insignia/Medallion of the Horde/Alliance shouldn't be in game til the honor system is released and the quartermasters are put into main cities.
---
You may be right, that is an interesting point!
---
I don't think they're necessarily as dichotomous as you make out - there is an intersection, and that is what people are asking for. It's not all RPers getting annoyed with PvP and PvPers messing up RP.
---
I don't think it matters so much if it's small. The fact that videos like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElBVaLYN6g4) (people do RP and PvP at the same time) exist make me think it'd be worthwhile, even if it's just the 1.5k respondents who join.
---
Did you actually play vanilla? because i did and ive played PVP servers exclusively since then, not once have i been corpse ganked for 3 hours straight by 3 rogues. Also what is people's problem, cant she fuckin log out for a while and then come back? do you have to play classic untill you die of starvation?
---
Please try r/wowservers for your question.
---
Yeah, I am aware that this is a PvE raid spec. I am not asking for general talent advice, but specifically about how other hunters make these specific choices. I just want to see whether they see this as a chance to get in some PvP points, or whether they want to max out their PvE dmg, or just want to get some more safety when out in the world.
---
Very wholesome, I agree!
---
Looks like the more Bow based build for PvE/Leveling as opposed to relying on a Pet. I like it better, but it's not quite as efficient, but possibly better for PvP when it occurs. They're both good either way. Hard to go wrong really.
---
Ive played since vanilla, seeing how you talk like a kid, i guess u didnt.
---
But that's... not how tooltips work
---
i dont think you include travel time, as unfortunately mobs your level arent always near by, take a human for example, you can grind your way towards goldshire, then towards westfall, enter westfall, then have no where to go at lvl 20, or more effectively grind towards lakeshire, get flightpath, grind towards westfall, grind in westfall, fly to lakeshire, grind redridge toward duskwood grind duskwood.
---
You see my poiint tho 2 mobs per minute is gonna be very hard to do, youd need to also forsake getting upgrades, which lowers kill speed .
---
Leveling, I remember them being fun, especially in dungeons.  While you often were forced to heal (even in enhance/elemental spec), you changed your totems based on your group comp and melee classes *loved* your Windfury totem.
---
At 60 I remember being told to go healing or go home, but that was pre-1.12 so it might be different now.
---
&gt;wasn't PvP so much better before battlegrounds were implemented?
---
No? Not even close? TM vs SS was a retarded zerg-fest. 
---
If I had to pick a point in time that WoW's world PvP was at its peak, I would probably say Isle of Quel'danas patch in Burning Crusade, and that was post-battlegrounds. The thing about wPvP is that it should matter. TM vs SS didn't matter. World PvP works best when it is a battle for natural resources or zone control - control of mineral nodes, control of dungeon/raid entrance, etc. The fights need to matter. 
---
I would say the only match for Isle of Quel'danas wPvP would be some of the wPvP in BRM through out early WoW's life before AQ was released. In fact, I would argue the release of BGs meant that people who wPvP'd were people who actually cared about control of the resources - prior to BGs you would have trolls gank in BRM for no other reason to disrupt other players, beating them meant nothing because they didn't care if they lost. Once they were gone, the only people fighting actually gave a shit and that increased the stakes of the fight.
---
TL;DR: Nah.
---
The only good furlbog is a *DEAD* furlbog
---
Tbh I've done that since smartphones were a thing.
---
And I would rather have a proper phone version of WoW where I could do simple stuff when I don't have access to my pc than have a Diablo phone game.
---
oh gotcha, yeah this spot was amazing because it's complete immunity against rogues. Only really useful in PUGs though because it's kind of a giveaway if you have healers/support nearby.

Play alliance
---
No its the pathetic toxic people who were talking crap. Is she not allowed to log out for a while and come back? Holy moly some of you are delusional.
---
Wow that's a depressing thought. I really feel sorry for the PVPers who will be forced into playing on PVE servers because of friends/partners.
---
I remember defending farm in AB.
---
Seeing a pally mount heading over I, being a dutiful mage, called out in "1 inc farm, may need a hand"
---
A second later I saw the weapon and realised it was a ret pally.
---
"Nvm, farms safe"
---
&gt;Test side by side troll female with alliance females to truly take in how hideous troll females are.
---
El oh fucking el mate. Well played.
---
On my server plenty of wpvp happened even in spite of BGs. When you have guilds trying to get people leveled up on both sides, trying to secure leveling areas is just natural. It's only once the server mostly hits max level and most people are concerned with endgame that this stagnates.
---
She did the best out of the situation, doing something else for a while. And its not the gankers who are toxic. They are just playing the game. It's people like yourself who takes a game way too seriously projecting and calling people losers. Grow the fuck up.
---
Hi all. I'll have an alt that I'll be leveling with my fiance. 
---
It's going to be her first experience with WoW, so just looking for a casual guild for the social aspect, PvE, and some dungeon running. I wouldn't mind progressing toward raiding semi-casually but can't say if she will. Both really sociable and want to show her what the WoW community can be like!

no, the answer is what she did. Log out for a while and come back later.
---
Yes. Back in vanill/TBC, my dad played a priest. He was a clicker and lacked mechanical mastery. He couldn't really play PvE on his own and would rely on me and my brother to help him get geared, but when it came to world PvP he was surprisingly good at killing Horde.
---
Sounds like a great new(ish?) player experience.  Thanks for writing it all up.
---
I’m with you, I want people to have the option for rp-pvp but I can also understand blizzards position. They are the lowest pop servers on US and all the english EU ones bad to be merged into one. We’ve already been told there will be limited servers in classic so I can understand blizzards hesitation to pay for a server slot that could very likely be the lowest pop server by a lot

---
Uh, I’m not a macro pro (so my syntax isn’t pretty or perfect, but functional), but you can see stuff like:
---
/cast [mod:shift, @focus][]Kick
---
This should kick your focus if you hold shift, otherwise it’ll kick your target.  The [] just means it’ll kick your target if no previous qualification is met.
---
You can also have something like this:
---
/cast [mod:shift,@mouseover] abolish disease
---
/cast [@mouseover][]Dispel magic
---
For a priest, this should enable you to have disease dispel, defensive dispel and offensive dispel on one button. You just have to make sure you are targeting an enemy and not mousing over a friendly to offensively dispel. (You can also mouseover the enemy target frame to ensure it dispels them).
---
Just remember though: Macros are mostly a convenience. You don’t *have* to make long, complex ones (like one with a string of modifiers and shit). You can make due with a few mouseovers for ease, and be fine.
---
It's not the smoothest class to level, though I made the masochistic choice to go Ele around level 35 while leveling mine as I got sick of the unreliability of WF procs. As a result my damage became way more consistend, I could use the same gear for questing and dungeons but I had to drink A LOT. It was still quite fun.
---
Raiding as a Resto Shaman was one of the greatest PvE experiences I've had in WoW. I've never played any healers before playing Vanilla on a pserver, since then healer is my go-to PvE role. 
---
Unfortunately I haven't managed to get that much PvP experience (I've switched to GW2 with a RL friend after my guild had BWL on farm), but I had a lot of fun during larger scale encouters.
---
How do you find it easier to make a reddit post when you could have just googled it and found your answer within seconds. This isn’t fucking google.
---
This guy gets it.
---
Because apparently people raged at her for taking a break, imagine that
---
I also started in TBC and I feel like I could never get into groups as an elemental shaman because we didn't have any CC.  Some guildies and I did discover how insane a group of pallies and shammies could be in heroics though.  We stomped through some of the dungeons with 3 pallies and 2 shammies.  Buffs for days. Lol
---
You're right, you play a game for entertainment. For the vast majority of people being ganked is not entertaining, and for some of those people it's even frustrating. None of that is childish.
---
This trailer is fine, the only issue is the private server name in the post title. I get that Twin-Star isn't a private server persay, more the organization overseeing them, but that's why the post was removed.
---
A lot of it stems from when the debuff limit was 8, so locks were forced to do just shadowbolt since the benefit to the lock was usually a net loss to total raid DPS. Since it's 16 slots, even with min maxing debuff slots to the extent of the top post there will still be a few slots for corruption.
---
Yes, Enchanting Enchants stack with Shaman weapon buffs but the others don't. You can't use a stone, or put WF up and use Flametongue totem on top of it.
---
I always grind a ton in the 40-60 range. If you target certain mobs you can easily have enough money for epic mount + boe pre raid bis pieces.

I'm really surprised at how many people don't understand how Stadia is going to work in this thread.  
---
The account is free.  If you have a free account you can only buy games to play.  You don't get any games free.  If you pay $10 a month you get access to all of the game that they offer for the monthly pass.  You can still buy games to own them if you'd like.  
---
Stadia doesn't stream games from your PC.  It uses google servers and acts just like netflix.  You don't download a movie with netflix just like you don't install a game with Stadia.  You can use stadia with just the chrome browser and a $10 a month subscription.  You can do it on older, shitty computers because it's just a factor of internet speed.  A chrombook is a good example of a $300 computer that can play every single game on Stadia.
---
The $130 package is just if you want the controller and a 4k chromecast.  If you want to play on chromecast you'll need the controller so they packaged it up.  The two are $70 each so the deal for $130 + 3 months of stadia ($30) + 3 buddy passes is actually pretty decent if you plan on getting the controller anyway.
---
There is no hardware requirement besides something that can use the chrome browser.  It doesn't work like downloading a game and only costs $10 a month.  Anyone with $10 can play graphic intensive games in 1080p or 4k.  If you DON'T pay the monthly sub, you can still buy games at around full price and play them, but they'll only be in 1080p.
---
Releases on my birthday, must be meant to play!
---
While I plan to play a lot, I totally agree. I know I’m not going to be doing the most efficient quest pathing, or try to join the most hardcore guilds. I just want to have fun and get through and do everything the world has to offer. My main goal is to have a social experience. It’s really exciting that I will have the end game raids waiting for me and I don’t need to stress about getting there fast enough or a patch will drop that makes it obsolete.
---
Dont do elemental, Trust me, almost no damage, sometimes you dont have enough mana for a single mob and unless you have a mage friend, well water is expensive. I did it until 30 once and its not fun, after 40 tho you may be able to start with elemental as you can get a Bit of nature and normal spell damage. You can Level as heal tho, you do less damage then elemental but kinda invincible, and people Love you in Dungeons.
---
You literally said "mad because bad", are you serious right now?
---
That's sounds like my experience on BC private shard years ago. The only difference I knew players IRL and people on official server will still be pixels.
---
Its guinness world records... unless u reffering to the zone gilneas.
---
how original
---
Probably because it was unauthorized. Credentials to your wow account doesn't have to be stored either. Granted you have to input it manually everytime. Also, only your email/account name is ever stored, password always empty.
---
Geolocking is still reliable. Any decent cloud gaming service will have to have their datacenters in the country you play in, or the latency would be too big for anyone to even feel comfortable playing anything except turn-based games.
---
Botting is arguably harder. As you can't inject anything to the client itself as it is hosted elsewhere. 
---
What you can do is emulate input, but that's nothing different than as if you did it locally, or on a virtual machine.
---
World PvP objectives would be great.
---
They did add some World PvP BG-esque objectives - I believe it came with TBC - but while they did help a bit the farming-focused PvP mode of BGs made it a question of what was most efficient, not what was the most fun, and few people cared about the meagre area buffs the world PvP objectives provided.
---
looks weird but worth for the holy cow jokes
---
Personally am stuck on mage with a consideration to priests and warlocks. Rogues too but I don't really wanna play melee, and hunters idk they just don't suit me
---
&gt; You use emotes, like /kneel, /pray, /wave / etc.
---
&gt; When you are 3 v 1, and you are the 1, you don't fight back. That is ganking, and if you want to survive ganking in Classic, which will be PREVALENT for the first 2 phases, you gotta know that you can't do shit in a 3 v 1. And you have to live with it.
---
Yeah no. Not going to give them an egoboost. Just going to spam my good old /spit /chicken /laugh macro and go play other character.
---
It's funny that you are talking about PvP "etiquette" and losers when you are defending some neckbeards ganking a lowbie with 0 chance of fighting back. When you got no balls and skills to fight people equal to you, that's the definition of a loser.
---
&gt; Take away the heirlooms, and it both slows down the pace and makes it a bit more difficult. 
---
A girl on Youtube, with a small channel, did this experiment. No heirlooms. She leveled a Hunter in BfA and Classic beta.
---
Lvl 1-20 BfA : 2 hours 40 something minutes. No deaths. Massive Aoe pulls (8-10 mobs). No ammo issues. No dead zone. Stupidly strong pet.
---
Lvl 1-20 Classic : 12 hours 50 something minutes. Dozens of deaths. Too many to even worth wasting time counting.
---
It doesn't matter for shit, if heirlooms or not. Retail is simply A FUCKING JOKE.
---
Fuck that moderation "you think you do but you don't" bullshit. I've been waiting 14 years for this shit. I was an idiot and got caught doing something bad so I'm not allowed to touch private servers. I'll be god-damned to show any form of moderation at this point.
---
Except she is beeing stream sniped? Did you ever play vanilla? Its actually pretty fuckin normal to log out after beeing corpse ganked for so long. I feel like a lot of you never played vanilla, a lot of you never ganked someone and have that dude come up with his main and literally fuck you up for an hour. It was NORMAL to log out untill the ganker leaves.
---
I believe there was a hunter that soloed Azuregos using a pet healing set. Took him 2 hours. But yes, it works.
---
Okay, then imagine if every single comment on a /r/funny post was just "😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂".

I used to top heal meters as a Tauren Shaman pretty often in early raids - I earned the name Cow-Priest before it was a thing ;)

That was also my plan until guildies decided it's time for alliance. Guess it's human then

Hello, zoomer.  Welcome to the Internet.

"mad because bad" is like "less qq more pew pew" in that it doesn't mean literally what the words are.

Mad because bad means that you're upset that you got killed by someone else.

So what is the alternative? Mindless grinding?
---
If you keep everyone alive as a healer, then you did great. Period. No but’s meow. The object of the game is to keep everyone up and kill bad guys. Druids can do that in instances.
---
Looks like you're the insufferable one here lmao.
---
I leveled a shaman to 60 a couple years ago and it was painful to level as enhance. Also, despite being a strong healing class it was super boring healing as a shaman in raids. So much so that I abandoned the character all together.
---
Make it stahp!
---
They will learn, once it happens to them. One day they will gank the wrong alt character and get ganked by the main for an hour and then they will learn "hmm, maybe i should log out and grab some food for example" :D
---
How about dropping skinning at lvl60 and taking LW/engineering? Skinning and farming give less gold per hour than other farming methods so you're better off farming something more profitable and spending the gold on more skins/bars than you could have gathered in that time. Time is money friend!
---
Advice on which mobs?
---
This isn’t a dungeon or Raid setup, but I’d absolutely use this to grind on my lunch, post to the AH or do some gathering professions!
---
It's Embriel, he's one of the most toxic, immature and unintelligent people I've seen on this sub, and coming from me, that's saying a lot since I'm all of those things too.
---
&gt;  are both utter nonsense, because the first true daily hub was, unless my memory is rubbish, the Isle of Quel'Danas
---
Ogri'la, Sha'tari Skyguard, Netherwing, Shattrath Lower City (Cooking/Fishing/Dungeons) were all in by 2.3.
---
Maybe your memory is rubbish?
---
Lok'tar friend, i hope you find a good guild to call home!
---
Single elites can be soloed as wl. But not elite areas like Stromgarde.
---
[Wowhead.com](https://Wowhead.com) did not come out until late Vanilla, as a result you probably won't see references to anything prior to 1.11. [itemization.info](https://itemization.info) is a good resource to see patch info for items in Vanilla. You won't see items added in patch 1.10 in Phase 1, but as far as I know everything in the game before that point will be available in its final 1.12 state with any updated stats.
---
I haven't played regularly since Wrath. I didn't play Cata, only a couple months in Panda, only the last two weeks in WoD because I pre-ordered Legion, and after pre-ordering BfA I played for less than 3 months then quit with no desire to come back til classic is released. 
---
I want to feel like I earned something when I play. Vanilla, BC, and Wrath gave me this feeling. Current WoW doesn't. It feels hollow... Let me play the game and figure it out on my own, stop with all the handholding! Stop dumping gear in my lap!
---
Few thoughts
---
Paladin healer could be good.  Paladin is a pretty simple class to learn and be effective (just heal, cleanse, and apply blessings!) and find a warrior, warlock, or other resilient class to follow around and boost. 
---
Generally I think range DPS classes are a little simpler than melee, as melee constantly have to deal with closing distance and becoming a target. 
---
Simplest range DPS class is probably beast master hunter.  A few defensive cooldowns like feign death / trap, two offensive cooldowns (big red kitty, pet stun), and limited variety of offensive abilities.
---
Running dungeons, PvP, crafting, gathering. The rest of the game, basically. Nothing wrong with grinding if that's your style, though.

Pretty sure the only
---
One that can aoe tank is the gorilla. He has thunderstomp on a cd. But it’s pretty good!
---
Vintage classic WoW music right there.
---
No, mad because bad means that you are mad because you are worst than who you fight.
---
Only time casters are an issue (mage) is if they catch you in the world and can set up a pom pyro. You just die and accept it
---
The difference in bitting is that it's much cheaper to spin up many instances in this manner rather than having to own many gaming machines. The logistics of botting are game dependent obviously.
---
Part of me wonders if streamers will even stick around. The problem might fix itself. Gotta farm viewers, and you don't do that unless you're on {x new game} bandwagon.
---
I'm in Newcastle myself.
---
2 days is what I'm after so that's good and whilst it can suck at times you need to have that world PvP too so good choice of server.
---
Looking to play tank war (either fury prot or deep prot). Possibly a dwarf priest(probably disc in early raids) depending on what they do with gold farms and when DME jump runs is out with phase 2 to supply gold for tanking costs.
---
Before I go for too deep a look do you have a tank spot open?
---
Basically an ex hardcore who has less time and is more chill nowadays!
---
Chuck me a DM when you have chance.
---
Im waiting until the following week to take off. After everyone's days are used and kids are in school
---
I did the same with my Lock. While leveling I took as much stam as possible to the point of drooling over any pure stam green piece. I remember getting something like a +39 stam helm that I held on to forever. 
---
This made me like a god in even level world PVP fights. I think I was pushing high 3k health around level 40 and chewing through that health pool with a pet shitting on your constantly was an insurmountable hill for most.
---
Once in a blue moon sure when they don't resist/miss half their spells, but a mage can't beat a hunter with the chrommagus xbow in frost spec. And warlock never, come on lol...
---
It's pretty common knowledge, i was in a hardcore guild in retail, warlock were bottom dps meter for months.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.judgehype.com/screenshots/rapports/hoa/03.jpg
---
4th french kill with decent hunters in the guild, which you couldn't find everywhere.
---
Warriors weren't a thing, because the revamp of their talent spec few weeks earlier was not well understood at the time.
---
Current private server meta is the same: https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?boss-kill=800613#bosskills_players:0+3+1
---
PTSD
---
Same here. Saw that episode randomly near the end of the year, then proceeded to beg my parents for the game for Christmas.
---
I heard rogue diaries drop less frequent and only sell for 2silver on the beta which makes pickpocket runs completely useless.
---
Make ~5k of those kills felwood furbolgs and you've got your exalted timbermaw rep done as well.
---
Nope.
---
You trying to DPS or tank? if tank i say fuck it go Nelf warrior as someone who just played Human warrior Nelf tank would be really good as well as world pvp. Shadowmeld as a warrior can be clutch as fuck. The main reason i say this is because i got stuck with Ironfoe, don't ever get that cursed weapon if you do it will be your weapon until naxx. I mean it go nelf get crul and a dagger or double daggers and win.
---
Eh a lot of the people playing frost mages in beta are very skilled, and you will not be getting to them easily at this lvl 40 meta. 
---
They are hitting around 600 crits on their max rank frost bolts which is 1/3 of a rogues health. 
---
For some perspective I currently have gutripper which is pretty much BIS, and I'm using a hybrid assassination/combat spec with 5 points in opportunity from subtlety. ([https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/A8zAoAI5yQGK](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/A8zAoAI5yQGK))
---
That means my backstabs hit hard, and my ambushes hit relatively hard. Ambush tops out at around 900 backstab tops out at around 700. Average ambush crit is maybe 700 average backstab crit is maybe 500.
---
So if I open up on a frost mage with ice barrier and mana shield up that eats all but 180 damage or so of an avg ambush crit. 
---
Then an immediate frost nova goes down, I escape artist, but I've been hit by rank 1 frost bolt. They poly unless I get a grenade off (not easy to do that fast) and bandage to reset the fight. If I pop trink+sprint I may or may not get to them again before they rank 1 frost bolt + poly. If I can do that and get off crippling I can usually win, as long as I kick/grenade their poly casts which is hard while I'm burning 60 energy on backstabs.
---
If that second poly goes down I'm toast because now trink, sprint, and escape artist are off CD, and they've reset the fight in their favor with bandages/food/water/evocate, so they're at full health and mana. 
---
Spriests are significantly worse if I don't have blind powder. A UD rogue would probably stomp them a lot easier.
---
Well bfa sucks but they managed to make that a smooth release blizz has learned how to do that well now it seems.
---
Short answer: you’re ignorant
---
Actually you can deduce that by looking to Who advertisments were targeting back in the day, by looking at old community forums and analyze the conversations, and by doing many more things. And no, sorry to say it, but the 10-15 years old were the minority.
---
Goteem!

Ahh, &lt;Death and Taxes&gt; on the Shattered Hand server...

I'm surprised that tanking makes people anxious. Bruh it's a game. Play it and learn as you go.

Absolutely. I vaguely remember a video of a shaman doing something like a 25k crit with frost shock and he had buffs out the ass.

being a huge fan of warcraft 2 &amp; 3 i wanted to play the next chapter in that universe even though i had never touched an mmo before. I asked for it for xmas in 2004 and that’s how it all began.
---
the person chose to be rude rather than explain things well
---
Blizz implemented a priority system for debuffs because things would fall off all the time by accident. you wont see 8 rends or corruptions or deep wounds because 13 (or atleast 11) are taken up already and they cant be removed by DOTs
---
Namecalling: the hallmark indicator of someone who is NOT an idiot... /s
---
&gt; If stuff like the raids is revealed before release it will undoubtedly kill some of the hype 
---
These raids were "revealed" over a decade ago. If people want to, they can pull up full walk-throughs of every bit of the content on YouTube. I doubt that having some streamers show the world the content via the beta is going to do much to deter people who are really hyped about Classic. It isn't about the mystery of what comes next, it's about the experience of playing through it with friends.
---
"Normal" IMO is when rankers are on BGs.
---
Patch 1.4 was 19 April 2005, patch 1.5 was 7 June 2005. I doubt these 1.5 months were as full of geared ranking premades "wPvPing" and dodging each other as Classic is going to be. Rank gear being in its 1.12 state also doesn't help.
---
Still believing information from 2005 I see.
---
&gt; but people who do are understandably frustrated by the barriers.
---
Except for this. It's not worth being frustrated over things that are out of your control. And anyone who feels *entitled* to a beta key is learning what their parents should have taught them. The world doesn't owe you *anything*. Also it's a closed beta. Who tf doesn't understand this concept?
---
Winter spring yetis and the satyrs or whatever they were called that dropped fel cloth in the adjacent zone. Great zones for herbs too.
---
DPS and Burst damage is too high in vanilla for 3v3 to feel fun IMO. The meta would absolutely be dominated by Warrior + Shaman/Paladin Healer + X (X may be a Rogue or a Mage I'm not 100% sure). I think 5v5 is in a better spot - with two healers you have a better healer/DPS ratio, more utility being brought to the table (roots etc to clamp down on Warrior dominated meta), and so on. It'd still feel like shit once Naxx gear released though, even AQ40 gear would probably break Arena. PvP was in the most balanced place when Tier 2 and honor gear existed. 
---
All this said... BC Arena is just going to be better. Classes just got so many interesting tools in BC that expanded class fantasy and gameplay options, gear was better balance with PvP in mind, specs were better balanced, there were a couple strong meta builds, etc. Hoping for Arenas in Classic just feels weird to me - Classic is a bad foundation to build more content on. As far as /r/classicwowplus style content, building on top of BC or WOTLK (a new post-WOTLK expansion?) makes way more sense than trying to improve the lovable disaster that was vanilla WoW.
---
Why does someone have to show up every post and remind us of this. Dude we know that game you played 20 years ago was harder
---
Nah, Arms is bad due to MS being a high prio debuff and knocking off important ones.
---
That's exactly what I wanted/needed to know.  Thank you!
---
These polls all need to be faction specific.  What if the horde holds 80% of the warlocks or something.
---
That’s not how I remember it but 10 years makes one remember what they liked/didn’t not the truth 😂last
---
I never said i wasnt ganked by a skull level player lol. She is LITERALLY handling it, holy shit you people with your elitist attitudes, thats literally what people did my self included in vanilla, if you were getting corpse ganked for an extended ammount of time you would log out so the ganker gets bored.
---
A few of my main buddies I play with are rolling same classes and faction so I will be accommodating that with my same old faction/race/class, which means I will be playing Horde.
---
If none of my buddies were coming back I would probably go Human Paladin or something completely different.
---
Whatever you wanna think bud.
---
Spells having base damage meant that no, you actually still hit really hard. 
---
It took a long time to get decent stats that actually increased your damage by a ton. There is a reason trinkets giving you near naxx gear levels of spellpower for 15 seconds were strong. Because ... they gave you near max gear stats. 
---
Especially for a mage who had TONS of control back then who could make that HP pool last. Classes didn't have much if any long term health recovery, so outlasting someone was a perfectly viable tactic. As was stated in another post, if you could survive a burst that was usually all they had, so you had pretty much killed their damage for 3+ minutes.
---
it matters after all the other debuffs

 &lt;Regicide&gt; | Alliance | NA | PvP | Semi-Hardcore  
---
Regicide is a semi hardcore guild born out of a love for the game as it was. A group of people in love with the world and community that was created by Blizzard back in ‘04. We seek to be among some of the higher guilds on the server through raiding and in our world pvp. We are seeking raiders as well as some officer positions available. Socials are welcome, whether it be to be part of a community or you just need some help every once and a while with quests. Come join us!  
---
Expectations: We expect that raiders keep up with the pack when it comes to early leveling and reach level 60 within a week or two of the first 60’s. You will get out of this guild and experience as much as you put in. If you want to be near the top then you are expected to help with prep as well as basic help around the guild.   
---
The ONLY set in stone rule: Don’t be a dick. Respect one another, and speak with officers if issues arise. The last thing we need is turmoil that is hidden from everyone just to explode at random.

Just to add to others. I've run into it a lot more during the Beta than I ever did in Vanilla. It doesn't make that much of a difference, even in 1v1 pvp. Several times they've thrown the stun nade and it really doesn't help them much. Especially since I have potions from Alchemy, it heals more than the nade damage + whatever they do during the short stun.
---
I’m right lmao you’re wrong. https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/genius.com/amp/John-denver-take-me-home-country-roads-lyrics, check up your facts before you spout them. The line “all my memories” comes after “country roads...”.

I'm currently working on an backend api in express.js and am close to finish the upload / parse / data storage (mongodb) part. Next I plan on doing some data endpoints for the various stats filtering needs, that then will be rendered with some basic d3.js. Dont have a great plan for the overall UI/UX yet, do you have some experience in this field by chance?

I'm curious as to what do you think about the graphics/game engine? Does it feel smooth and how does it compare to vanilla private servers? Also do you know if front stabbing is possible? (where you stand on top of a mob, strafing back and forth and are able to use backstab)

Interesting take. Both options bring a different dynamic, uncertain as to how I'll balance it though. Thanks!
---
no they weren't, majority were between 15 and 30 I would say. Old guys now xD
---
Even if it's the same class, it's still going to be a new experience. For most people they were young and fairly bad at the game.
---
I'm going smite spec priest, at least for the first 6 months or so.
---
Levelling speed is similar to shadow at 1-40. It's slower than shadow after that, but it's better at 5-man healing.
---
For raiding at 60, healing with smite spec is really not that different from traditional Holy/disc priest, but it's much, much better at farming.
---
At some point, I'll level a mage alt so that I can farm, but until then, smite spec it is.
---
No it was a damage shot. Created much smoother rotations for us huntards!
---
Hope it wasn't a membrane keyboard.
---
When the honor system changed at the end of vanilla i believe is when marks were used as currency. Until that point the only things that cost marks were the mounts. Or used to be turned in for rep/honor. I need a fact check but i am almost sure that you just use gold to buy everything pvp related.
---
Just watching  this I can feel the imprint of the toilet seat
---
The point is that Debuff-Slots don't matter much.
---
Did they have the root back in vanilla? I'm almost positive that was added in TBC
---
Questing is such a more interesting bag in Classic and I love that, I like me som BFA (dont hurt me) but levelling was terrible in zones I didnt care about the storyline in. Once you lost legendaries there was a stage around 116-118 when youa re genuinely garbage and elites are tough (maybe early 120 too) but otherwise its pretty easy peasy. Which is why I cannot wait for Classic to juts care about the world and getting that next level! Also being excited about green loot sounds amazing.  
---
Your class clearly matters for solo levelling as well, I have seen expert Rogues taking on group but for the most part Warlock, mages and hunters can farm like crazy where a warrior will be 100x times as slow
---
I really want this
---
You might not have as much time as back in the day, but I believe you will have a good experience despite what faction, class or race you decide to roll. Doesn't matter if you go with something fresh or stick to what you played then.
---
You might realize after a while that it isn't so much a return to the nostalgic good old days, but rather a return to a genuinely great game. It will be nostalgic for sure, but it will wear off, and underneath the nostalgic shine is something truly great.
---
Deep wounds is low prio it’s not going to overwrite most debuffs
---
This guy did the math.
---
I'm playing another druid.  When you already played the best class in vanilla there's no reason to switch.
---
Actually if you are only thinking racials, then Troll is the best way to go due to shadowguard and increased cast speed, the shadowguard can apperently proc Blackout aswell wich is a stun, makes it extremely good as shadow priest.
---
When thats said.. undead look way cooler in my opinion and racials is just a small margin, you can still do good things with will of the forsaken and devouring plague. :)
---
Playing with the boys is very fun but playing on own is also fun in a different way, as it can be much more immersive and the added element of an RP realm could also be interesting. Hmm
---
OH agree 100% but the fact being most people didnt run that much HP and in comparison to other mages that have SP their spells would truck when placed side by side with a INT/STAM mage.
---
I played Hunter in the day. I prefer healing now, so I’m probably going Priest this time.
---
Yikes
---
good bot.
---
I think Europe will have a better time using Stadia instead of the US in general. Latency is better there all across the board.
---
I agree that it's a little gate keepery but objectively he's not wrong to say it's less impressive to kill a raid boss post-nerf.
---
I'm thinking of rolling horde this time.   
---
It will still be vanilla, but with a lot of new content/quests/instances. Plus new racials to change things up. I am changing classes, but since I leveled all classes to 70 it isn't fully new.
---
&gt; which made PVE gear useless besides 1 or 2 pieces.
---
Bullshit. One of the best PvP templates was 4/5 4/8 Glaive Rogue. Stop talking out of your ass when you didn't actually play the content (or at least didn't play it was a gladiator level). Even before that point, Stormherald was very strong for Mace Warriors
---
STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM
---
Charge one second root with + ap is what they had. I'll probably use a wind serpent for raids and my trusty pig for player versus player. Possibly gorilla for grinding end game farm. Good tank with thunder clap
---
It won’t
---
But it's 77 days
---
&gt; The key component isnt "another game" its specifically "retail"
---
Let's go over this. I explicitly stated 'the problem isnt "another game" '. So you asking about "another game" means either you didnt read (so fuck on out of here) or you're willfully ignoring what I said (so also fuck on out of here).
---
YOU REALIZE, OF COURSE, THAT THAT DEFINITION IS LITERALLY WHAT I SAID.
---
Well when vanilla was created a large portion of the game was centered around leveling, so anyone could jump in level and experience a large portion of the game by just playing. Meanwhile leveling in the more recent expansions are means to an end. Raids in vanilla were easy and more about having enough people online rather than hard mechanics. 
---
The later expansions had dailies, honor caps, reputation, arena caps etc etc. Missing a week in vanilla was no biggie unless you're pushing a rank 10+ meanwhile missing a week in TBC or current wow feels really punishing.
---
Nothing compared to 15 years- maaan ;-)
---
&gt; but I take issue with your characterization of the “casual player”. 
---
The definition of a casual player is a person that likes video games, but cannot allocate too much time for.
---
Blizzard made a grave mistake in TBC, and instead of reversing it, they added more. If a game is catering to casual players, and that game is a subscription based MMO, to keep casuals in the game, playing and PAYING, you must offer in game rewards for that category, while also keeping the hardcores playing and PAYING.
---
WoW, with TBC, started a snowball effect. It wasn't that bad in TBC, casuals weren't the majority, and they had no issues with hardcore players having better gear.
---
But, IN TIME, casuals become the majority...and than the VAST majority, and asked for MORE, because they pay the same. The mantra was "Why should I can't get gear from raids? I have a job, but I want to raid. I don't have as much time as other players, but I am still paying the same".
---
I am not blaming casuals for what WoW is today. I am blaming Blizzard for starting a trend in TBC, implementing flying, dailies and badge gear, that led to a change in player base, that led to more QoLs, that led to an irreversible change in the players base...that led to what is BfA today.
---
Unfortunately I don't have a lot of experience in UX, I much prefer back end over front end. That's not to say that I can't stumble along, learn and help, but front end work doesn't come easy for me. Sorry!
---
Browsing for people and guilds who I may mesh well with:
---
I am NA, 23 y/o, very little vanilla experience (none at Max level, was young) , most likely rolling (in order) : mage, priest, lock, or rogue
---
I don't have much of a life outside of my obligations and play a lot of games, looking for someone I won't leave in the dust while lvling
---
I want to raid, but don't feel the need to be top 50 or server first or anything, just want the gear. I plan to PvP a lot as well, at least to rank ~12, I am a multi 2200 arena / rbg player in retail so PvP is what I truly love and it doesn't get better than in vanilla! I digress, I do want to raid as well both for the experience and the gear! I am very punctual about raid times, unless I'm out of town or something serious comes up irl. 
---
I know there are a trillion mages but I'd love if there were less than like 8 currently in the guild (assuming more will join by launch), I prefer to have a balanced raid group over 40 min maxers. Also prefer to have fun over min maxing. I enjoy toping dps but I'm not gonna lose any sleep or any hair over it . Fun first! 
---
I have been following leveling guides on PS's to practice for launch, would love to find someone to accompany me , maybe we can learn some shit from one another?
---
Shoot me a DM
---
Your argumentation is not exactly strong either :)
---
One can heal raids in this spec, and there will be people who do so. You can't directly compare HotW neither to NG nor to Swiftmend (like apple to oranges), and I don't think it's fair to mark either of these as "weak".
---
Lol, I actually barely played Everquest. My point was I think vanilla WoW was the perfect balance between the obnoxiously hard older games and the ultra convenient theme park style newer games and OP's story reflected that. That's all.
---
&gt; take a shower and grab lunch
---
I didnt know retail was a shower/lunch simulator. It all makes sense now.
---
I personally play this game to play with the boys. I think it adds to the social aspect of the game. Granted the boys i met and still play with now i met playing solo. So if you did RP servers have great communities and it wouldnt be a bad idea to do on off raid nights or nights that the boys have anything planned for.
---
You can always tell a Milford man.
---
This argument has been hashed out so many times on here.
---
I'm surprised nobody has brought up added races though. The Horde went from badass typically evil races to being mostly pretty elves, and the alliance gained space goats. You want to talk about immersion breaking? 
---
And the content took us to another planet. I get that it is all canonical, but for the average player their standard fantasy game just took a wtf turn in terms of their immersion and understanding of their character. I think that had a significant impact on people too.
---
No, pvp weapons are bis.
---
there used to be a third party software called X-blade or something like that which let you control your pc with an Xbox360 controller.  
---
I used it for WoW and it actually worked pretty well.
---
This is such hyperbole. I see a lot more people bitching about "entitled whiners" than actual entitled whiners. We all pay our $15, which pay for the developers making Classic. We aren't asking for handouts, and we understand the need for it to be somewhat exclusive. That said, we pay the same $15 a month the streamers pay, so why should they get any precedence? Seems like streamers may be the entitled ones in this case. I don't think many are upset out of entitlement as much as they are out of just good old fashioned FOMO.
---
It has absolutely nothing to do with elitist attitude... That's where most people get it confused. It is the reality of the subject. I do agree with you saying she just logged out and that is what you did. It still doesn't make it less funny. I personally won't be bothering with a PVP server, you see that fixes the entire issue of being ganked now doesn't it...
---
Don't call yourself a gamer if you don't use gaming diapers
---
wut?
---
Literally me. NE Hunter here I come! I don't care what anyone says either, I'm an adult now and I'll play whatever the hell is fun for me this time lol.
---
My buddy from college used to play shadowbane and he moved onto WoW. I only really played EQ back in the day, so I moved to WoW to play with my friend. Never looked back.
---
136 hours? Sounds like barely 90 Rc

Long read but explains all the pets. This person says owls are the best, but he goes through each pet type and the abilities.

It's killing me man! Actually on the edge. What's getting me through it is realizing how long we've waited already, it's just a little bit longer now!!!
---
Excuse me, what? I don't remember a single large-scale battle between cities. Can't have been as prevalent as you make it out to be.
---
They do fine if you know how to play Warrior, save your rage and aren't afraid to get some +spirit on your gear for the Regen out of combat
---
tell me why is it a bad idea? U will get basicly easy bounty on pvp realms.  The population will increase. The more money blizzard makes the better the game should become. 
---
The only limit should been Raids if the people on Phones didnt play all instances zo prove they are worthy. 
---
Me as a vanilla player would love this since i dont have time for playing on the pc much.  Much work and so on.
---
That specific reason is why all streamers need to be locked onto one or two servers.
---
Imagine thinking its ok to let a guild of like 50 people compete against Asmongolds horde of 3,000 smelly neck beards.
---
Sometimes you just need a good healthy dose of "shut up and play the game"
---
It's too bad that Hunters don't get Flare until the 30s... though Flare is pretty easy to play around as a Rogue.
---
Damn this was exactly me. If I wanted to be useful on pve I needed to go prot but if I wanted to play pvp I'd need to be arms are fury. And the repair costs were brutal. Screw all of that. I'm 100% rolling a hunter and just aim shotting everyone idc.
---
There will be old exploits but a lot more new ones. The Engine is not 1.12 so things like the Tauren size effecting melee distance won't apply anymore
---
Yeah do you have the Boys the play with if not what are you looking at playing vs the old nostalgia?
---
True, if you manage to see a rogue you tend not to risk him vanishing and clapping your ass as soon as you pull a mob.
---
if he wants to rank PvP, he will literally be forced to.
---
Ive been using quest rewards, but no BoAs, no help from my mains, etc.  Been leveling professions, reading every quest (have tracking turned off so i HAVE to read them to figure out where to go/what to do).
---
Its been a hell of a lot of fun.  2.5 days played or so and im lvl 73.
---
Maybe I'm crazy but I thought dungeon finder is what killed wow in WOTLK. It was a huge change in feel of the game to no longer care what your server was up to or who the big guilds/players were because you were partying up automatically across servers.
---
No, basically only mages, rogues, and hunters do. Priests and cats do as well, but they won't pull aggro.
---
Huh?
---
ROFLMFAO
---
4 Stam 4 strength leather belt.
---
if its not just buff everyone constantly then i dont think it right :)
---
I feel like feral druids, hunters and warlocks don't sacrifice much downtime travelling as they all can kill are range pull mobs pretty frequently. Ferals could almost avoid drinking completely by having some spirit and agility (regen and avoidance/crit) gear going for them.
---
But I agree, traveltime is obviously not taken into account and will have influence on the overall time spent.
---
You mean huh?
---
Farming 1/30000 tables for loot, let's go.
---
A shadow weaving healing priest is doing completely fine. Of course guilds can use a DPS shadow priest instead. But if they're interested in optimising their debuff slots they might also be less inclined to run one because shadow priests kinda want more debuffs than just shadow weaving + mind flay to increase their performance. Other than that it is probably just if they want some DPS or if they want some healing.
---
It will.
---
He obviously didn't based on his observations. The game is not "easy." You will die pulling an extra mob or two easily. In BfA you almost never die questing. I happily pull everything in sight and aoe them all down as any class. The ease of the game is the fact that the optimal damage rotations are super basic...Most specs have 1 or 2 abilities that are always much better than everything so you end up spamming it. You also don't get to use your DoTs as there's a debuff limit. You will die many more times going from 1-60 than 1-120 in BfA. If you die doing a 5-man in BfA you're in an awful group.
---
yeah but world chat on live server is generally not used by a lot of players like on privat servers. on privat servers its like the main channel.
---
&gt; Funny enough, flying, dailies and badge gear is what I loved most about TBC and is probably the only reason WoW maintained its place as the top MMO. 
---
Funny enough, what you loved is what led to BfA.
---
But I guess that being unable to understand cause and effect, you aren't able to understand WHY what you loved destroyed the game.
---
I hear that. From a top-down POV, I'd like arena, but I am deffo aware of the terrible class balance in vanilla, and that it would negatively impact the mode. Might be pointless to try to have them in Classic without also doing additional class and spec balancing.
---
&gt; Rogue distracted her.
---
right, and i mentioned there's a trick you can do while running from a rogue who might distract you.  you hold down right click while running and swivel your mouse slightly.  do it while jumping so youre not actually running tiny zigzags, but this locks your character with your camera, so if you get distracted backwards you'll instantly turn right back around.  if you dont do the swivel it doesn't work. the movement triggers the character to move in the forward direction of the camera.
---
&gt; Even if she could get some distance they have mounts and you don't. There was no actual way out as a mage.
---
true, she may still get caught anyways.  but you cross your fingers and try anyway :D.  sometimes you get lucky and find a good hiding spot and lose them
---
Expectation: “I’ve meticulously calculated and simulated the optimal raid setup”     
---
Reality: “Invite that lvl 58 Ret paladin, he’s attuned. We only have 36 people, and we need the cleanse.”
---
TOC was when I quit WoW. I didn't come back until SoO. Minor regret since people say ICC was very fun, but it just really crapped on my enjoyment of the game. My enjoyment of PvP was severely decreased with the imba Death Knight  (s5 was the first season I gave up on pushing for gladiator) and raiding went to total shit with TOC (after the glorious Ulduar). 
---
But yes, TBC was definitely the pinnacle of WoW. My favorite era of PvP, my favorite era of raid dungeons, it might not have the best story or leveling zones out of any expansion but the cumulative end-game experience hasn't been matched(Mythic+ is the only feature that has ever come close to sparking as much excitement about WoW since).
---
Some of our best healers in Vanilla and TBC were druids. That was actually the role they were pigeon-holed into for tier 1.
---
I'M TRIGGERED
---
Low quality meme. Your not jesus. 99% of these streamers lie about playing Vanilla. We just want to be sure the game is tested.. the experiance remains authentic. I support #nochanges, however the game may require nuance changes to keep this experiance the same. Like making it abit harder or other small changes to preserve an authentic challanging Vanilla like experiance. They we learned that the game is a translation, so maybe we need to find other synonynems
---
They did it in 1.12 (Silithus, Plaguelands), but they were shit.
---
One of the better spellings I've seen for that sound.
---
Alright that's not what he said though.
---
If hunters got a huge stat boost at T2 gear it would probably make PvP unplayable for every one else lol
---
I personally can't believe they recreated CTmod for classic. With the modern UI base there are far superior addons that have been developed over the years. Prat for chat, and Postal for mail for example.
---
I'm glad the attention to detail on the game mechanics the devs are giving, but it makes so much sense that they are barely trying to force many old UI elements. From the player perspective the game will look a bit different but it will play the same.
---
Pvp rankers definitely optimized honor gains for ranking back then. 
---
They'd premade wsg or ab based on the dodging premades of the other faction, horde had instant queue they would let any premade that was a challenge win as quick as possible to get into the next BG. 
---
People who were rank 13 knew exactly how much honor the other top rankers would get so they knew the number to beat (to be promoted). If you tried to jump your spot in the R14 line, you'd be black listed from all the honor grind groups and completely screwed.
---
If you ever killed an NPC that gave a DK while these guys were in your group they'd flip OUT. 
---
It was all a fucking blast and I'm so hype to do it again.
---
Feign Death for hunters. Feint for rogues.  Fade for priest.
---
"WARLOCK!? Let me just roll again real quick..."
---
The real question is what class are you going to level with? Because if it is a Warrior. The Shaman/Warrior is like the best power couple in vanilla world pvp. When a shaman slows a target so the warrior can gap close and then get that delicious Wind fury crit proc its like the Bro five scene in predator.
---
"Dillion you son of a bitch"
---
what one is priest? Wasn't the threat reduction in fade added in TBC?
---
What are the name of the spell reduction spells for the classes?
---
Yeah I was about to say, Troll has one of the best casting animations, for both channel and instant.
---
False, the game brings thousands to the streamers that's why they're all hitting peak numbers.  Your logic is flawed.
---
I wish i had a way to avoid PvP as a warrior. Im just a walking free kill. Im either getting insta killed by ?? Characters all the time or random mages/hunters/warlocks/druids are just kiting me and killing me without any trouble at all. Feelsbadman
---
If you are saying it is too easy, you did not play vanilla.   BWL and Nax vanilla were no joke.  Even MC had a steep learning curve.        Molten coretook 153 days before world first clear.   Naxx took 90 days.

I will be switching from Orc Warrior to dwarf priest this time around. Show me the way, brother.
---
Sorry but warlocks are certainly not considered bottom tier DPS in the late game. 
---
Here's &lt;Progress&gt; which is considered one of the top guilds on many private servers: 
---
This MC raid is from the 5th of May 2019 which is after Naxx release and 4 of top 5 dps'ers are warlocks: 
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Viewer/?id=33967&amp;exp=0&amp;upl=54011
---
Warlocks do struggle with hit until ZG patch when Bloodvine gear is available.
---
Vanilla servers had approximately 3000-4500 players, so, yeah.
---
How deep is the role play? How do you handle "meta" discussion in game or in voice comms? 
---
I had a fun idea that would probably works best in a RP server but I don't know if I can keep-up with being in-character all the time.
---
Something still feels wrong about Hearthstone being cannon.
---
How is Gouge ever free
---
You still have to own every game you want to play, which takes away a lot of the appeal of streaming.
---
If you had access to every game by paying a monthly subscription there would be WAY more people using it, myself included.
---
F R E S H
---
Yeah I fully appreciate what you're saying, and to participate in raids as a boomkin you probably have to have a more hardcore playstyle in terms of collecting mats and consumables to be in any way viable. But, not all raid groups will turn a boomkin away (many probably will due to the stigma) but a good boomkin player can still pull their weight enough that they aren't a net loss for the raid. And in terms of getting raid invs, you're probably more likely to be invited by a more casual raid team that isn't as strict on classes and specs. 
---
I only say they are hyperbolic as some people will claim if you play anything other than a meta build you will never raid and if you do your raid group will fail, which is just not true. But yes I was around in vanilla and am aware that some specs just aren't very good at all compared to their live counterparts, but that's part of what makes classic classic. :)
---
In AQ once mages get enough gear and crit and go fire they just shit stomp in world pvp. I cant tell you how many times on my warrior on ND i got polymorphed and would then get hit with a pyro crit for \~4.5k then fireblast for almost 2k and instantly be dead.
---
Back then i was blinded by the shiny alliance - as i learned to look behind the curtain i will now reinforce the ranks of the horde!
---
- And yes, again as druid... well shaman is not out so far. Probably as twink.
---
Good luck gearing that many people of the same class.  Good luck retaining those people when they aren't getting gear.
---
Streamers are like everyone. Some good, some ok, some bad. Some terrible takes, some good ones. Just treat them like they are, flawed people trying to stream content for attention and/or $$
---
There is zero point in taking a hard stance on these people one way or another, simply tune out if you dislike them. Curiosity got the better of me since people never shut the hell up about them and yeah frankly I find one or two of them a bit entertaining but they become stale like anything else.
---
wPvP in 2005 was epic because the game was fresh. If you just remove BGs in 2019+, it's won't lead to the same epicness. It will, however, lead to ranking premades ganking everything 48+ - and no one will stop them, because other nolife rankers won't waste time, and noble heroes won't have time.
---
I'm rolling a rogue and a to be confirmed healer on an EU PVP server when classic comes out. I've played since Vanilla and for the most part, have completely skipped WoD and BFA, played some Legion but not a lot. Played a ton of Vanilla, TBC and a lot of WotLK. I'm a self confessed altaholic. 
---
Intending on playing Horde at present, but not stuck on it. Community is king for me.
---
I'm a 31 year old dude from Scotland. SADLY I have a full time job and a girlfriend so can't pour as much hours in that I'd like to WoW but would appreciate anyone that'd like to play or a guild.
---
My [battle.net](https://battle.net) ID is Derpa#2566 and my Discord is Termeh#2932
---
It’s called fade I believe.
---
Were you on a PvP server pre-BGs?
---
One can only experience the game for the first time once. I wish I could play it for the first time again. Making dumb mistakes and feeling them but being able to work around them is part of the original experience. I hope new waves of wow players start with classic so we get some of that authentic community.
---
accurate, because streamer fanboys think their favorite streamer is a living god, and anyone claiming otherwise is a heretic to be purged for their unbelief
---
My man. Did you even watch the video? Let me quote to you what she said: “I’m not dealing with this”, “I don’t know how it’s entertaining for you”, “I’ll just play retail”, “I don’t have time to deal with this”.
---
Does that sound like she’s logging out for a while and coming back? You’re the delusional one. OP is still right to say that some retail players just don’t get vanilla and she is definitely one of those players.
---
I would add Feral Druid to that list as well.  Some elites you can pre-HoT yourself and just fight them in bear form, stun when you need to pop out for a heal, stack your Rage and burn Frenzied Regen, etc.  For really hard-hitting elites you can just put on your healing set and keep them rooted while whittling down their HP with Moonfire and Starfire.
---
Serenity Now
---
now imagine this at lv. 60 with all skills unlocked.
---
***shuddering intensifies***
---
Until you notice that you have 5 alts stacked with cloth, greens, rares, leather, and a dab of epics.
---
No-no-no... PC for the win - and i mean PC - not windows.
---
Warlocks are mushrooms
---
So many good choices!... sadly I will probably end up rolling night elf because my vanilla guild is getting back together and I miss the alliance.
---
Woosh
---
For twink (low level high gear) pvp it's a lot of fun. One of the few classes (when fire spec) that can punch thru the huge health pools of warrior and  bear druid flag carrier twinks. Paladins are another story though. They basically require an act of god to take down (at least in BC they did) :\
---
And yeah, twinks get a lot of hate. But the best ones didn't spend all that time and money gearing a toon to squash normals. There's just no fun in it, and what's worse is that it gives us all a bad name. The twink community on my group shunned those assholes. Twink v twink PVP is actually really fun.
---
As for why 39: it's an accessible bracket but there's a lot more options than lower levels. 49 starts to get really tough, and 59 is big dick energy I'll never possess.
---
While you bring up some valid points, there is some misinformation here.

Stadia doesn’t actually function off of a “Stadia App”, it’s been announced that it is going to work through Google Chrome. Hence the integration into “any device”, which is essentially any device that can run Chrome (sans most smart phones, only the Pixel 3/3a have been announced as compatible but that is subject to change). Controller support also shouldn’t be an issue, as Stadia has its own controller that will work with any device as it is WiFi enabled and connects directly to their servers as opposed to one of your devices you’re streaming from.
---
Bandwidth also shouldn’t be as large of an issue as people anticipate, as streaming game content at 720p 60fps is said to only require roughly 10mbps. 4k 60fps ups that number to 35mbps. I understand that not everyone in the world has access to devices and services that meet these speeds, but I’d argue that this is a very reasonable starting point given the quality of the content that will be streamed.
---
Additionally, I’ve only heard positive things about Googles earlier test run titled Project Stream. If I’m not mistaken that was roughly the same architecture and while I did not personally partake I’ve read some very positive reviews regarding its performance and stability.
---
You say the world is not there yet, but if you ask me waiting on the world to catch up to release technology like this is pointless. Make the awesome tech now, if it’s a hit and becomes mainstream, we can hope that places that aren’t equipped for this tech will progress toward it. This stuff is the future, and even if I can’t get hands on with it immediately it still blows my mind that we’re coming to a point where we can dream of something like this and make it a reality :)
---
Did you read my first line?
---
I mean I would be your mage friend, but im a boi in blue
---
Only really have experience of levelling dungeons in real vanilla, but even back then you didn't really need CC. I was a fucking awful tank, but if I actually tried I could still tank 3-4 mobs somewhat well. 
---
I'm pretty sure a lot of the cc used was because the tank was absolute dogshit and didn't even try keeping aggro on several mobs. I don't remember the damage ever being high enough even with quite a few mobs that a healer couldn't handle it if it was all directed at the tank.
---
The only people still here are the ones who have Classic WoW as the #1 thing they're looking forward to, and right now the only thing we have to discuss *are* streamers. There's no new news we can get since we're discussing a 15 year old game. I've been on a lot of subreddits for big games and this is how they all turn out before release. Once the game comes out, everything will level out and this **might** be a good subreddit.
---
Should have been a cloth belt with +4 spirit and +4 strength, imo
---
&gt; basically only mages
---
Mages don't have an use-able ability to lower threat (They actually have a high threat generator with Counter-Spell). They have talents that lowers threat for the spells but nothing they can actively do to lower threat. Ice Block doesn't lower threat it only forces the AI off the mage because they will not attack immune players if other targets are available. But if the mage comes out of Ice Block before tank gets higher threat it will attack the mage again.
---
Counter point: A well geared warrior who gets the drop on you is like a fucking juggernaut whom you need 3 people to take down.
---
Just play with a good warrior and you wont have to care
---
They're different on all pservers.  But yes, many customize them in various ways. 
---
N****Dale has an earlier version of AV, hordes of NPCs in mid, elite commanders everywhere, Korrak at snowfall.. It's a slow one but a "rush" strat can still win in 15-20 minutes.  Bypass mid, hold the relief hut and cap those 2 bunkers, and kill the other warmasters.
---
In my mind, we have nothing to lose if the beta level cap goes all the way to 60. The serious player base that is truly looking forward to playing through Classic is not going to be deterred just because they saw streamers clear undead Strat. 
---
People in this thread are saying that players might lose interest after only having seen someone else do the content. If your motivation for playing Classic WoW is the mystery of not knowing what comes next, this probably isn't the game for you. As others have said many times, it's not a new game. Also, it's not a game that depends on the instant gratification of new experience, but rather on the feeling of accomplishment after long periods of effort. 
---
So, if you see a streamer doing level 60 content and, as a result, decide that you don't want to play, that's one less tourist competing against me for my Westfall boars.
---
I was in Death Dealers on Shattered Hand for many years :)
---
Your analysis is absurd. Casuals were always the majority of WoW. WoW succeeded because it was less hardcore than other MMOs. WOTLK was Blizzard's most casual "classic" expansion and it was Blizzard's most successful expansion. Cata was too hardcore at launch and alienated a lot of folks, and then Blizzard course-corrected way too hard to bring back the casuals, alienating the hardcore folks. 
---
Vanilla WoW peaked at what, 6 mil, and WOTLK peaked at something like 11 or 12 mil? Your premise is a joke. Blizzard made mistakes, but daily content and meaningful 5-man progression are not among those problems (flying is a different story - flying was awesome in BC but it was a burden that Blizzard was not prepared to take on when designing all future content in perpetuity and eventually their only option was to thrown in the towel and ban it because it was too much of a headache).
---
I want people to play Classic,  I just wish they would stop worrying so much about all this new stuff all this meta stuff.  
---
Yeah people are assholes online, you might even end up one yourself one day.  
---
The game is still good though, should try it.
---
Used a gorilla for basically all of vanilla, from the level I could tame one, and their thunderstomp was pretty sweet.
---
Im not joking really, the smaller model is better for pvp
---
I mean I play oldschool runescape and these look like rookie numbers to me. Bring it on
---
You can spec HOTW healing spec, That way you can tank dungeons heal raids AND PVP all without having to respec!
---
Fade was Vanilla.
---
Ice Block, Feint/Vanish, Feign Death, Cower.
---
An epic in elwynn forest, wtf?
---
This is exactly what I'm doing. The interesting thing is it's good practice almost. I don't plan on speed leveling at all, but doing quests I'd recently done means the memory is still fresh and I can at least try to optimize and avoid getting lost.
---
We didnt even have a badge type system this expansion until the residuum was introduced. It's not a bad system anyways especially not the one in tbc. I got an offhand fist weapon when sun well was out that was comparable to serpentshrine caverns weapons. The introduction of these things is not to be blamed for the misuse of them later on. Flying in tbc and farming elementals to save up for epic flying was one of the most rewarding things I've done in the game. Yes people could fly but at this point they still had to go out in the world and do stuff. The resistance of flying by itself is not a negative.
---
I plan on playing a warlock as a main but still considering a mage just to be able to sell ports.
---
I have a rise to the challenge mentality
---
Why sorry? i just said in my first post they were shit dps from MC to AQ and do more than hunter at Naxx.
---
Honestly, the only place i could use Flare effectively, was in Alterac valley at the Horde entrance.
---
Otherwise it's a bit too situational and now i'd rather just go engineering so i can hail mary stun them instead.
---
&gt;mobile gaming will always suck though.
---
I would have agreed a few years ago, but with how many AAA games are being directly ported to mobile, I dont see this stigma lasting much longer. 
---
Mobile gaming has existed since the GBC, why does everyone hate it all of a sudden?
---
Err... in a tab targeting system? Where you can't miss skillshots because there are none?
---
You're delusional. Get this man to the infirmary.
---
You’re depressed? Just don’t be problem solved.
---
Cower for Druids.
---
Yup, nothing like getting ganked by the same shithead rogue you decided to leave alone a couple minutes ago because they were fighting a mob.  You'll learn, don't trust a rogue, ever.  That class will own you if they get to decide how the fight starts.
---
Your memory is rubbish.
---
And my post is about a TRIFECTA : Flying, dailies and badge gear. Not only dailies. Not only flying. And not only badge gear.
---
If you look at them separately, you can argue pro and against all day long. Looking at them in a package...these 3 features SEALED the WoW fate.
---
Flying made people spend LESS time doing their stuff, dailies inflated the economy, and badge gear paved the way to more casual players joining the game.
---
All this snowballed into offering players faster game play, easier gold and easier gearing option...which led to even faster game play, gold showering and epics showering...which led to Valor Points upgrades, and later Warforging and Titanforging...shared nodes, and mobs, World quests...etc. etc.
---
It all started with TBC, regardless if some TBC changes were GOOD.
---
If you are preparing a delicious mean, and than PISS on it, it's ruined. No matter how much good stuff you put in it.
---
It's still ruined.
---
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4294122.stm this article, specifically the paragraphs describing The Commons in Ironforge
---
&gt;The most common complaint for pvp in tbc ended up being that pve gear was to stupidly overpowered.
---
you can say this about every iteration of pvp between tbc and wod
---
I've actually changed my mind on this recently. Up until last week I was pretty sure that Classic would be popular but that Retail would retain it's audience. Now I'm not so sure. I've been leveling a Dark Iron for the past week. Watching chat and seeing what people who are subbed are doing I now believe that Classic may well have double the players that Retail has. People will only be playing Retail when content patches come out.
---
The most worthless of them all. LOL
---
As a new player, what are some good tank builds? What’s key knowledge points? What classes promote the most amount of threat?
---
You'll make far more money by having 2 gathering professions and just collecting herbs, nodes and skins on the go. It doesn't add much to the play time at all if you don't go out of your way to collect them.
---
You legit said funnel all the cloth to your tailor lol. No shit were talking about leveling that’s when you level first aid unless you feel like wasting all your money at max level on cloth.
---
I love u for being original
---
Make a macro for your Judgement so that when you cast it you yell "Begone! Spawn of darkness!"
---
Also macro your heal so when you cast it you yell "By the holy Light!!"
---
I’ve leveled 3 shamans in the past couple years to 60. I did 1h shield enhance, flame tongue weapon, searing totem, lightning shield rotation with first aid to keep mana per 5 going. It’s pretty boring, but consistent and hard to die since there’s no surprises. It’s also pretty easy to solo elite quests if you know how to earthbind kite and searing totem. You will get sick of the flame tongue and searing totem sound. Because of this, I enjoy respeccing elemental at 40 due to dreamweave gear being available, and elemental being viable with all the essential talents unlocked. It’s pretty much a lightning bolt spam for most efficient mana use except when ur getting clearcasting procs at point blank. Just always buy mage water when you log in, it’s also extremely effective in wpvp Bc ele mastery = op when you can insta crit people for a decent amount of their fresh gear health pool. It’s also good practice for how you will pvp at 60 as the 1h shield spec is trash in pvp. 
---
60 is really fun. You really enhance ur groups ability to do things. In pvp you can absolutely destroy people with crits quickly, and also boost dps via wf totem, cure viper sting/blinds/crippling poisons on any friendly targets (this is huge in pvp). Purge is also very powerful. I don’t pve much, but from what I hear raids love to bring up to 8 shamans because chain heal and their totem utility is so good but only party wide so they want as many as 8, 1for each party. If you raid a lot and grab the raid gear that’s tailored more for elemental pvp, then you could be a god if you master the class. 
---
All in all, I hate shaman leveling 1-40, but if you enjoy wind fury then you may enjoy it more after level 30, I personally can’t stand an RNG based system of leveling. 40-60 is nice and smooth, while also offering you the chance to delete people in pvp if you respec elemental. Gameplay at 60 feels much different from leveling as in pvp there’s a ton of tools at your disposal and you have to learn when and how to effectively use each one to push the class to its highest abilities (which is fun, because the class has a lot of depth due to filling multiple roles at high level pvp). I’m a big advocate of shaman and highly suggest the class if you are interested in healing raids, but also interesting in being a hybrid offensive healer/damage dealer in group pvp. And yes you can score some of the nicest crit combos in the game.
---
Twinks are just young gay boys. Easy roleplay.
---
My favourite time playing Warrior was in Wotlk, I wouldn't mind Arena + some of the class balance/depth TBC + Wotlk added.
---
😪
---
I don't think they Los in retail, but I'm not in the beta so I can't check.
---
Not even joking, delete and bury this.
---
Mounts did not cost marks before that either
---
Vanish and Feign Death are both true threat dumps, but Ice Block does not dump threat.  It's also a talent, so only Frost Mages will have access to it.
---
Epic answer
---
&gt;  Granted I have heirlooms, but I never even remotely feel in danger. 
---
I've been leveling a new Dark Iron Dwarf recently. I was level 25 (starting from 20) before I realized I'd forgotten to equip my heirlooms.
---
Mechanics on classic are at the same level as today raid finder.
---
Most specs are not unusable &gt;:( they just might not excel at all aspects of the game that's all.
---
Is server transfer still a thing? Perhaps we can lvl in here and transfer if you are correct...Ping to us east should be like what? 100-120?
---
Thinking more about it, I'm not sure we should consider the current bfa population as main core for classic, cost is low, if enough ppl try classic for nostalgia, sumd up with private servers and new ppl, who knows... I've seen several Brazilians top rank enormous amount of games over the years, we can be hardcore too. I hope so, at least.
---
Thank you for the genunine feedback
---
I never played bc, and I think I didn't make a Hunter until the deadzone was done away with.  I'm excited to see a different Hunter than today's.
---
Big time jerk circle mate
---
You wouldn't really be able to trade the silver across faction, so whats the point?
---
It sounds like mmorpg's make you salty AF.  The sad realization is that MMOs in general just suck.  1999-2001 Everquest is one of my favorite gaming experiences of all time (for the time it happened), and looking back on it, I realize that it really sucked too!  Trust me, I did a majority of the vanilla content back in 2004-2006, played with my friends, did the grinds, etc. It's a monotonous and extremely hamster-wheelie game.  It seems you are self realizing this too.  Everything you mentioned was playing the game as a chore, not as a game to enjoy.  
---
Do yourself a favor and skip this.  At this point next year you'll realize that all that grinding and small meaningless arbitrary upgrade stuff didn't mean anything and nobody cares that you played Classic WoW.
---
Also, WoW is a VERY linear game with a very rigid set progression.
---
I'm struggling mightily not to go with Mage or Rogue.  I love them both.  But i'm sort of committed to being our group's Warrior so hopefully that is as fun.
---
Nah you'd be fine. People aren't against streamers in general or the idea of it, we're against the giant celebrity streamers disrupting the entire server with their incredible influence and massive amount of in game followers.
---
You’re* dumbass
---
Yeah, I played beta and release, and I do remember plenty of Crossroads battles. I thought you meant Orgrimmar/Stormwind/Undercity etc. battles, which I never saw until a bit later.
---
not to mention all the firewater
---
That actually sounds hilariously fun.  Feral dps I'm assuming?  I just learned of this weapon recently
---
Thank you. My buddy who is a dad of 3 is rolling warlock for this exact reason. They fit the solo player style and allow you to find a guild pretty easily. Especially as alliance.
---
I did this for a project 60 guild. No heirlooms, no AH, no mounting till youre 40, no group finder (only dungeon with the guild). It was honestly refreshing, made me interact with my guildies quite a bit. Crafted gear for myself, had to farm leather at one point. It took easily over a day of played time to get to 60, and then we started raiding and doing guild dungeons. Never thought I would enjoy optimizing a level 60 char in retail, but I did! If I were you, I would look into doing some of this before classic as it is a great change to the typical BFA experience. Check out the project 60 subreddit.
---
That gear was locked behind rating at least, your average pleb definitely wasn't getting a top tier weapon from arena.
---
Long time night elf hunter here. May do it again. Feels so natural. Thinking about druud also, because I don't know the class.
---
I just hit my first 4 last week. I excitedly told everybody in my guild but nobody cared :(
---
haha good joke
---
Polearm melee hunter, because the concept just sounds neat. No illusions about raiding.
---
See i couldnt remember for sure if that was the fact or not. I have avoided ranked on private servers because i want to do it on classic.
---
Yeah I cannot decide between Human Warrior or Night Elf Hunter. 
---
My friend will be a Human Holy Paladin so I’m leaning towards Warrior.
---
Is frenzied regen in vanilla?
---
So since I'm wanted for pvp I'll get invited to everthing?
---
Doing the classic content over and over is the point of classic. The population that will drop off are the ones that need instant gratification and have short attention spans. When a level takes a day or two instead of earning 5 - 10 per night like now, that is going to shake off some chaff.
---
I leveled 7 characters to 60 before BC and loved it. I know what to expect 100% and I am definitely not alone.
---
Absolutely perfect thread. The amount of TBC-lovers I see here is pathetic when you consider how TBC fucking MURDERED everything we LOVED about CLASSIC. Fuck TBC. Fuck everything that isn't sacred vanilla.
---
Night elf priest. Screw min max usefulness. I want to be pretty and I like priests.
---
I'm not sure you're even replying to the right person 
---
As for rigid progression...it's only as rigid and as linear as you make it to be
---
You are retarded, but keep on trucking for verifiably false beliefs you idiot :)
---
I really still don’t see your point. Let’s say 2/3 is “most” or a “huge chunk”  that’s fair to say. When battleground get implemented there will not be a drop of 2/3 in world pvp. All the same factors are present in the world that lead to world pvp. None of those factors are taken away with the implementation of battlegrounds. Everyone still will be out in the world to grind materials or level or run to dungeons. Sure there might be a small % drop in the number of players out in the game world because some will be tied up in battlegrounds but that’s very minuscule, and it will not account for a 2/3 drop in world pvp, maybe a drop of 10-15% far from a huge chunk. Now I have no numbers to back this up just like you do not, but it doesn’t require intense number crunching to see there will not be a huge drop in world pvp when battlegrounds are out. It will actually make the game world more balanced between pve and pvp.
---
The sunwell isle pvp was amazing. I would spend all day out there long after I completed my quests.
---
Are these just thinly veiled condescending questions setting yourself up for self-aggrandizing back patting?
---
Or are you genuinely curious?
---
I think you've hit the nail on the head for me with another game: destiny 2
---
The new season just started, and with it came a really fun, new piece of content called the Menagerie. I ran it 3 times, and then I went back to doing all the same stuff I've been doing since Forsaken and in some cases vanilla D2 came out. I hate it. I hate being forced to go play gambit, crucible, strikes, daily heroic missions, etc to increase my light.
---
Sure, I could *not do that* but the problem is that it *feels necessary, or feels bad not to do it*.
---
This. It's a beta test, not an early access. Blizz should have prioritized players they thought would be a good tester. I wish they would have made us fill out applications like past mmorpg betas. Oh well, if it's a buggy mess at launch then we know who to blame (Blizzard).
---
Your job on weekends is to place freezing traps in random places inside Blackrock Mountain.
---
Now I’ve gotta avoid streamer realms AND mobile realms?
---
They break even at 4 locks and add dps to the raid with 5+
---
I was talking about Classic obviously... Its funny that now that its so popular to play Vanilla.. We dont know who did. However I in fact did. I was a main tank warrior. I cleared ZG and got halfway MC. I was a pretty young kid and the game was hard on me. But the reason it took me so long to 60 is that I kept rerolling be4 I finished my first pick lol. It was very doable if you stayed on focus, had some gaming experiance and was invested in learning about the game. 
---
I think aggro feels off in the beta.. the range, but also tanking. I feel it got better at high lvl. Also healing seems to generate to little aggro. The player damage felt to high in dungeons and I have not seen a tank use thunderclap at any time. Im not saying these things are not in line in how things could have been done. However they are not in line with things were done. Others are clearly off.
---
I think we might want to make it more difficult.  Classic should not be for everybody. Allot of people did not make it.. Retail is much better for Blizzard to keep as the main game due to monitization. So imo.. the few.. the better.
---
why worry about that now? you can always unsubscribe if it turns into something you don't like. it's not like you are swearing a blood oath to Blizzard to pay them 15 bucks a month for the rest of your life.
---
911, yeah, I'd like to report a bad pull
---
To be honest, I wonder if awarding PvP via the honor system might've been a mistake - in how it promoted that kind of ranking/farming/ganking playstyle that was much better served for PvE endeavours.
---
Not being rewarded didn't stop people from PvPing as it was great fun, the angst was that people felt forced to PvE for progression even if they preferred not to.
---
At least it wont be like that for the first couple of months.
---
He's talking about a pvp premade group I think.
---
Hi mate you sound perfect and exactly what we are looking for. We are only 20ish players at the moment having not recruited anyone though advertisements yet. This is the first recruitment post we have made, and maybe a bit premature since we still need to discuss some basics like raiding hours ect. And finish fleshing out the website. 
---
That said the situation with all classes is still up in the air. We do however have a definitive main tank, a good guy we have all know for years who has raid lead and done deaths demise, so we are happy for him to take that up.
---
Myself am likely going to play a warrior, furry tanking or furry, whatever we need. But like yourself might just end up clicking that priest on the selection screen (always a SP at heart). 
---
And that is it for warriors so far. We have some great people in discord that will play warrior but i am speaking with all of them directly to help me understand there level of commitment. Some wont be close to 60 when the other half the guild is raring to go so i need to recruit enough that there is definitely enough people at 60 to raid at roughly the same time. 
---
Let me know if you want to hop on discord, Im sure we can get a better sense of what we each want in voice
---
Guys, you think you want beta, you dont
---
Elemental wasnt oneshotting people. It was moreso about control.
---
People need to remember the biggest outcry in vanilla was in this exact order: easier to obtain gear so raiding players wouldn't have an obvious advantage over casual players, dual specialization and flying mounts.
---
I would agree, totally forgot to include that.
---
Haha I was so into Mindless Self Indulgence back then
---
There was reputation gear that may have costed marks - I could be misremembering.
---
I don't think it came from Hearthstone. The Darkness is a D&amp;D concept and it likely was why they were designed to be this way.
---
OP is wrong, since The Darkness was never stated to be related to the old gods. Most likely because of how it relates closely to D&amp;D.
---
Exactly one is.    
---
You want one for Shadow Weaving and VE. Plus the additional rez' bot is helpful after wipes. Although it depends how many Warlocks you're running with.
---
There are spergs at all age groups, and actually the older ones are the worse.
---
Young twitch viewers are watching other games.
---
It has nothing to do with the $15 a month you pay or any kind of exclusivity. And your $15 a month doesn't mean shit. You sound like one of those 'know everything' dweebs who tell civil servants "I pay your salary" because you have absolutely no idea how projects are actually funded. Streamers aren't the only ones playing the beta. They're just the ones you *see* playing. Nobody is getting precedence. That's just the only way you can rectify it in your unimaginative and unlearned teenaged brain.
---
*Sylvanas has entered the chat*
---
That sweet 4 digit aimed crits make my eyes sweat.
---
I only played actively in vanilla tbc and wrath and in every single expansion pve gear was a major issue yeah.
---
I feel the opposite. Horde’s are full of natural lore because the creatures are far from normal humanoids, therefore there’s so much to learn about them. Recently made a troll rogue and I dig the trolls way more than I ever thought I would.
---
Also the Alliance zones are pretty but in a way also boring. They’re «human-like» at the start, which wasn’t really what I was looking for. Especially not the «western Europe»-vibe, at least looking for some more exotic people (think Caribbean for example).
---
Yeah but with the rate you generate rage it's hardly worth it.
---
Twinks are very popular in goldshire
---
I never played Druid in classic, but apparently this was a common tactic to boost dps as feral. I also only recently learned about this hammer. This thing has 3 charges and each charge lasts 30secs. This buff seems to be lost when you switch weapons, so this is only really viable for feral druids since they rely on stats rather than weapon damage.
---
But yeah, with a lot farm and a bag full of those hammers, a perfected damage rotation, a feral druid is certainly tier 1 dps.
---
That's a spell, not a talent, but I'll allow it as an avid EOTB user.
---
Hello this is the police you have been arrested on August 27
---
No. Farming Gnomer for the wep to make you worth bringing to tank. (If u plan on tanking raids that is)
---
They are the best! So much fun to play both solo and in group.
---
"There are so many positive things too."
---
Everything I read above that line seemed positive to me.
---
Blizzard is a business. They will do what people want most so that the subscriptions stay active. All updates will happen as they did before because that is what the vast majority of people will want. The whole no changes wave is evidence of this. Regardless if you think it will be better or not dont expect any changes unless they were exploititative bugs.
---
Rank 11 is when it starts to slow down iirc so not even breaking that does not really give anyone a feel for how long it takes. But the point is that the people who gatekeep WoW classic, like in this thread, often haven't even done all of vanilla from my experience from this subreddit.
---
And the fact that you seem to think im telling people it was hard or something shows that you just don't know. The people who did most of vanilla does not gatekeep it like it's some hardcore Uber brutal game that "retail babies" can never manage. That was my point. The people who sit and gatekeep that "OMG you have to farm so many consumables for naxx retail people will never manage" often never got anywhere in naxx themselves. Like that YouTuber Hamster wheel.
---
So that was my point. The people in this thread gatekeeping people like this girl getting ganked more often than not did not do anything of note in vanilla themselves. I'm not saying you are doing it because I haven't read any of your responses, but you would fall into this category of how much you cleared and did in vanilla. Not getting r11 and not clearing AQ40 and naxx means you did about half of the endgame content.
---
60's can farm up to SM for greens/blues on any class. Some classes can do mara. Any greens 42+ are worth saving and disenchanting.
---
I loved playing my shaman from level 1 all the way through AQ.
---
Leveled as enhancement, raided as resto ,switched to enh whenever we had 4-5 clears of the current raid tier just to have fun.
---
Incredibly versatile class. Healing as resto is fun, supporting as enh is super fun (never look at a enh shammy as a dps, don't stack AP gear, you're there to totem-twist, keep nightfall up and off-heal), and PvPing as elemental is amazing.
---
Really hating that they're doing the 1.12 AVs. It's the one thing I don't like about the 1.12 patch.
---
I used to play on a PvP server for a game called Asherons Call that had this same mechanic.  You die? You drop your most valuable gear (currency wise).  To counter this, you had to carry around high value (but useless) items as insurance.  Some gear was bind on equip though. Also, you got hit with a -5% stat penalty that you had to work off.
---
Just FYI, Blizzard has expressed that they will not be using existing realm names or original vanilla server names to avoid confusion. Hope this helps with the Stormreaver situation!
---
US Open Beta, I was killing Wolves in Northshire. I picked Warrior because I liked Barb in D2.

So you think people will be rank 14 in just a few weeks then from WPvP?  That's a bit much. Honor has DR as well as decay. You can start the grind but by the time BGs hit you won't make a substantial dent or be geared to the hilt like you think some will be.
---
I think people make leveling on a PvP server sound like hell for the lulz. It's really nothing crazy like people who have never done it claim it will be.
---
It was fine back then and it will be fine now, even on PvP heavy servers.
---
This is easily AFK’d time though. You start the scan on AH and go rub one out and youre in business by the time you’re back.
---
Murlocs are like Pringles, nobody can have just one Murloc.
---
Most say enh till 40 then swap. My understanding is that it is really the talents that reduce the cast time on lighting bolt that makes the difference

A lot more accessible and cheap for the average user.  All you need is a generic xbox or any other controller and a lower range laptop.  If you want to game on the TV you can get the $130 package and play every game on offer in 4k.  If you want to have a hybrid, you can get the $130 package and a chromebook with a ~4k screen for $300 used.  That's $430 total and you get both a mobile option or play on the TV or in any chrome browser.
---
Yeah especially if you arent a feral dps druid.
---
What if I actually WANT to play Dwarf priest without being a minmaxer? :(
---
Much, good to know
---
Huge problem with this is gear.   So you take your toon to TBC, max him out and do some dungeons, get weapons, gear, trinkets, mounts, and then sell all your old Classic stuff.  Then portal back to Classic what happens?  Do you bring all that stuff over with all its higher level stats allowing you to 1 shot anyone in PvP or roll through dungeons?  Or do you drop their levels to 60 equivalent (a significant dev undertaking and will need massive balance checks)? Do you portal back naked, losing all that gear into the nether, meaning all your work is gone forever even if you portal back to TBC, and if you had bigger bags you got in TBC do those disappear too with all their contents?
---
There would be significant issues with this idea.
---
Yes the only thing about thunder clap was an ungodly long CD
---
TBC shit itself with IoQ and the badge rewards at that point in time. The only saving grace is people forget about that problem because WOTLK was &lt;6 months away and it didn't matter as much.
---
What does this have to do with wow? Is wow on Stadia?
---
I don’t plan on Alting till phase 4ish anyway so won’t affect me.
---
Elemental shaman for day to day life, resto for raiding. I will not be respeccing over and over for 50g a pop so I’ll stay spec’d as resto and try to group with people.  
---
For leveling I’ll be enhance.  
---
I like healing and don’t wanna be priest or Druid, simple as that really. Not many options for non dps (horde 2 tanks, 3 healers and alliance 3 tanks / 3 healers)
---
All i know is fire hurts, warrior dumb.
---
Its very strong raid spec. There are other such as moonglow, but the mana pool on this spec makes decursing more efficient
---
Im guessing you have no experience with vanilla?
---
Wasn't it 8 seconds?
---
And even as feral it's so mediocre.  I took it off my bars completely in BC raiding.
---
I also did the 10 day trials! Cheers fellow «parents didn’t sponsor my WoW career».
---
My earliest memory is first the damn epic trailer with the Dwarf Hunter, and then playing at my friends computer (who had a subscription) and making a Human Rogue called «Stealthsneak». I’m from Norway and as a 10 year old I was really proud of my name thinking it was super clever. Then I made it to the Deadmines and thought it was so damn epic, introduced to the loot system but never getting any further than level ~20.
---
Wasn't this bannable? Pretty sure I heard something about circumventing hearthstone cooldowns.
---
Death will rise, from the tides.
---
I am Murloc.
---
Even AV shit was just gold, so as far as my memory serves it's just for rep then.
---
If you're getting half second response time on your LAN something is wrong.
---
Sure, works going slow so I did go on already and fired the discord details through.
---
I might not have chance for a chat today but I can jump on tomorrow night sometime - after that I'm at a festival for 5 days so just drop me a line on discord and we can sort something out.
---
Great post. I love reading testimonials about classic! Keep it up!
---
Shadow is viable in average guilds, the best guilds have one of their disc priests spec down to shadow weaving and refresh the debuff betwen heals, rather have abit less healing than waste a dps slot.
---
basically the WoW version of Wrong Side of the Tracks from GTA: San Andreas. a seemingly simple task that's infuriatingly difficult.
---
ALL YOU HADDA DO, WAS PUT THE BANDAGES ON THE DAMN WOUNDS CJ!
---
The whole criticism in this post boils down to “some peoples’ internet isn’t good enough.”
---
I'll be Maintanking. And nah I'll stay with human because of sword mastery and extra reputation. But I was thinking about night elf.
---
But I can't play rn :( so ima just keep scratching the itch here . This place is like a methadone clinic, and I'm fixing to overdose when I get my hands back on the real thing.
---
I knew exactly the spot before i got to see the pic. I'm ready to exact revenge!
---
Classic not even out, worried about TBC when Blizzard hasn't even mentioned it.
---
Stay classy, Reddit
---
Totally.  Yesterday, I started leveling a priest because I haven't play a priest in years.  When I got Mind Flay, I became a god.  She's level 27 now, and all I've had to do is spam Mind Flay.  I don't even have to acknowledge my other spells.  Even rare elite mobs (which aren't very rare these days) sometime get burned down before they can even reach me to touch me.
---
And that is why playing undead is great
---
Mobile games are nowhere near as good as PC games (and also console games in some cases). They're filled with microtransactions and slutty costumes to attract gamers as a last resort because else no one would touch it. They lack the proper core gameplay that you would see in older titles, which makes it feel incredibly dull.
---
I agree that some games that can be played on your phone are pretty alright. Most of those, in my opinion, are arcade games though.
---
I used to do that way back in the day, it absolutely sucks to do, but it is possible.
---
Git gud nub!
---
Thought it was like 30-45 I could be remembering wrong
---
You didnt link anything
---
Are we naming spells or talents?    
---
If you want to talk spells Priest's "Mind Vision." Look through the target's eyes. It is useful for finding quest objectives/scouting, and you can jump from mob to mob, by re-targeting and re-casting with seemingly no maximum range.   
---
You could get from one end of AV to the other with it. Or simply find that tiny clickable scroll in a mob camp. Very useful spell that I've seen people list in their "don't learn" lists.
---
With how easy everyones saying the raids are until naxx how come you think people wont take multiple shadow priest? Would it really be that detrimental?

We are two friends looking for a semi-hardcore raiding guild interested in efficiently clearing relevant content as it is released. We are intending to play Rogue and Mage. We are dedicated, hardworking raiders with experience in the raiding scene since Burning Crusade and have cleared MC, BWL, AQ20, and ZG on private servers. We have knowledge of our classes and all proper consumables needed before raid night. Our schedule is flexible but weekday nights are preferred.  We are excited to be a part of something this big and we are looking forward to meeting new people and having new experiences.
---
I'm mostly reiterating that Enchanting and Alchemy are the main two, but Engineering is also viable long into Maxx for PvP. The difference is that it's a gold sink for min maxers rather than a money grab for those who like to play the market.
---
will do cheers
---
It's funny, I never would have considered myself a "new player". But in this context, I am! Started in 1.8. Never considered the fact that I was really missing that much... I really liked BGs. Then again, I played on a PvE server. Plan to play PvP this time around and I am looking forward to seeing what all the hubbub is about!
---
I'm really salty about that not gonna lie. "oh First Aid is useless so who cares if they remove it?" WELL MAYBE DON'T CHANGE THE GAME TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S BECOME USELESS IN THE FIRST PLACE
---
You also have to factor in the cost of developing new content vs just moving forward through the expansions
---
You really don't need to do anything more than drop the memes and metagame speak from outside private chat. You can just talk normally and that's perfectly acceptable.
---
https://youtu.be/Lz9MdKZOHLU

Check out my channel i have a bunch of videos on the topic
---
Absolutely. This fantasy that everyone got welfare weapons is absurd. Having a PvP weapon usually meant you knew your shit, if you had your shoulders you were a force to be reckoned with, and if you had a drake you were a PvP god and raid-only players would rightfully fear you when you swooped down to the entrance of a dungeon or raid. 
---
People talk about "revering players in cities" - I felt that was at its peak in Burning Crusade. The content was hard. PvE was hard, PvP was hard. It wasn't about how much time you spent (how fat you were IRL) and/or how many hand-jobs you gave the raid leader, it was about whether you had the skills to get the job done.
---
Just a heads up, it's "drought" when talking about a dry spell.
---
Draught is actually another (usually British) way to say draft. 
---
English is such an asshole...
---
There are literally dozens of us
---
Yeah, the download and upload requirements are pretty easy to meet (depending on where you live unfortunately)
---
It's all about latency.
---
I have the same dilemma. My main in TBC was horde and as a whole I think I prefer that faction, but I love the NE 1-30 zones so I kind of want to roll alliance just for that.
---
Rotation:
---
Flash of light 
---
Buffs: 
---
Kings
---
You really enjoy those 5+ hr AVs?
---
I'm so hype to level but I wanna wait until the real deal, partially because that shit's an investment. Also, I *have* been tooling around on an insta-60 just to fuck around with some pvp and to try out some other classes at max to see what/if I'll make a serious alt - but I am so ready for the Barrens and 1k needles.
---
Yes I have played original vanilla day one in Europe... Well we had problem with burning legion server but it was all good in the end. Never touched private servers.
---
How are bg's in the Beta? In Vanilla you needed to walk into the war room to que for bg's or at their location on the map.
---
Viable yes, optimal no.  You can have a healing priest spec for shadow weaving and have them use rank 1 mindflay to keep it up.
---
FWIW I'll be trying something new. I mained a Tauren shaman from TBC through Wrath. I'm planning on a rogue for Classic.
---
People are talking about it in the comments.
---
I dont get what all this fuss is about.
---
I for one would love being able to log in on my phone, even with the huge disadvantage it would put me in.
---
Playing AH or doing simple grinding/leveling proffs while not being chained to pc sounds amazing and would actually improve quality of the game by a lot.
---
No no, let them spread their propaganda.
---
Sure, the more popular the game the better. But these streamer fans will mostly be new to vanilla. New players Blizzard is trying to reach. Thousands are a drop in the bucket of millions of subscribers that were here before twitch was even a thing.
---
Me: oh HELL no..... dont give them any ideas!!
---
Also Me: ohhhh nice!
---
How did you manage to get the same key binding for multiple button, and how does it work?
---
Yeah private server players can potentially keep 1 server alive from the 35 that will launch.
---
Hunters and rogues have threat reset abilities in feign death and vanish. Divine Intervention and Flask of Petrification also act as hard resets, much like death. Rogues also have feint, which reduces threat by a flat amount, and priests have fade which reduces threat by a flat amount for a limited time.
---
Rogues, druids in cat form, and warriors in battle/berserker stance have a 0.7 threat modifier, meaning that if a paladin doing 100 damage does 100 threat, then a rogue doing 100 damages does 70 threat. Similarly, druids in bear form and warriors in protection stance have a 1.3 modifier, whereas everyone else has 1.0 modifier as a baselines. 
---
Certain specs have talents that introduce additional modifiers, like the frost and arcane tree for mages. Paladins and shamans have threat reducing buffs and totems, sitting at 0.7 and 0.8 modifiers, respectively. A few gear pieces also modify threat by a percentage amount. I think there might also be some trinket or similar which takes away a flat amount. 
---
Finally, abilities like Ice Block which grant immunities offer a special kind of stay of execution, where the they will be considered has having no threat. I don't recall whether or not this ends as soon as the ability ends, or if it ends as soon as the player makes some threat generating action.
---
Ah fair enough, those were rarer and mostly composed of high-end guilds and randoms trying to push through to kill the chieftain/king NPCs, so not city-vs-city fights per say. The fights outside the capitals used to be when people wanted to engage PvPers who were outside dueling.
---
See i thought the same thing, the extra dodge is nice, the only benefit that human has over the nelf is if/when you get thunderfury. But in my guild on ND both our tanks were using daggers because of the insane TPS that they can pull. Just food for thought. Plus Female nelf looks incredible in plate.
---
IIRC threat on classic will be a bigger problems for tanks than it currently is on private servers so the extra dodge from Nelf may be a very bad choice
---
Im not gonna play on one. But they said they will make one later, why not have 1 at release? Re-rolling isnt fun for most.
---
It’s been confirmed by blizzard.
---
Sure, checking the AH and doing tame things in cities etc. and even chatting with other players sounds fine.
---
But the problem arises when phone players try to do group content, being way slower than keyboard players and putting the rest of their team in a sticky situation.
---
I was just thinking about how classic doesnt feel the same and I doubt anyone will quit their jobs or drop out of school for it. Maybe I'm wrong but I still dont understand why anyone would no life this game when it really doesnt matter. No world first is an actual first. I'm not going to regrind winterspring rep. There just doesnt seem to be a point to not play this game super casually and have some fun but not take it too serious because it's the same game we played 15 years ago and sacrificed so much of our lives for already.

---
We are a late night progression raiding guild. Our leadership has extensive competitive raiding experience in Vanilla all they way to present. We are an adult based guild as well -- if you can't hang with a bunch of mid-20s to 30s folk who swear, joke, and have a blast... look elsewhere.    
---
While we may not raid a lot during the week, we plan on being efficient and ready to go when we do. You are expected to come prepared (this means food buffs, flasks, etc). Our goals are to push content and create a community.     
---
Outside of our raider ranks, we are very open to accepting casual players that want to be apart of the guild and help us build our community. We also expect there to be a good deal of organized PvP going on as several members have confessed their love of PvP. So if you want to join to hang out and play with us, do not hesitate to drop us a message.     
---
We intend to start raiding by the second or third month after release. There will be “pre-raid” raids where we look at our raiding core and split it into Dungeon groups to help with gearing and for raiders to build a relationship in-game with each other.    
---
We need commitment. 80%+ attendance for raiding is required. Many of us have busy lives and have to make time to play together on our two nights a week and without reliability it all falls apart. We get things done and have been playing this game forever -- we're looking for long term commitment.

---
I raided Naxx as a Rdruid in vanilla that’s why I know how awful this spec is.
---
Agreed.
---
However, I could see the numbers dwindling a bit if they put too much time between phases. By too much I mean like... 4 months. I think there will always be a base community constantly clearing things, though, the numbers that fluctuate will be the casuals.
---
Your life is about denying current situation and dreaming of tomorrow. Sorry that of all the things consumers think, is that they ask something to work with their current infrastructure. Because current infrastructure will still be there around 2022-5.
---
Literally by definition of it being a themepark MMO, that is not a valid assessment.
---
This... fresh. Is it truly on the way?
---
I understand your point, but betas have been chiefly marketing exercises for a long time now.  I'm certain that Blizzard *is* taking bug feedback seriously, but I don't believe for a moment that written feedback is the primary purpose of this beta.
---
Sup bonechewer homies!
---
&gt; you can’t always get what you want
---
But if you cry sometimes, you just might find, you get what you need ^which ^is ^to ^still ^be ^ignored ^but ^start ^fresh ^at ^release
---
Used it as soon as it was available at vanilla sure af gonna use it now
---
It's easy to notice if someones playing from ther phone and once you do swift kick is due.
---
I dont see any issue with it
---
Daily’s didn’t ruin the economy. Having an influx of more money is not necessarily a bad thing. Mixed with professions and an actual player economy it’s a good thing. TBC brought daily’s, yes, but it also brought with it much greater gold sinks. 
---
WoD inflated the economy with garrisons, in addition to near useless professions then and since. And what types of gold sinks were introduced to compensate?  A million gold dinosaur mount?!  LOL
---
If you're going holy paladin I hope you dont mind getting CCed to death by mages and locks.
---
Mage only has to counterspell to reduce a holy paladin to nothing, its basically an instant win button for them.
---
Locks nullify your heals by casting curse of tongues on you and then promptly counterspelling you, another instant win button for locks.
---
Any mage or warlock with one tenth of a brain can and will CC you to death, and since in pvp you face about 80% locks and mages its suicide fuel for you right there.
---
It came to a point where I deleted my paladin. No joke
---
I thought the exact same thing. I looked at the map of Teldrassil and was like "wow what a huge world :o".
---
My recommendation would be play PServers , but I know some people don't like that. 
---
They're just fun and good practice
---
Why is this such a huge topic of discussion for classes. Vanilla isn't like the rest of wow in terms of, "bring the big dps!" It's always about utility.  If people thought more that way I think we'd see a lot more utility classes played instead of everyone trying to be #1 on the dps charts. Which is the #1 reason everyone plays warrior.
---
You say savages because your pride won’t let you use the word WINNERS.
---
For me i loved the class changes in TBC but hated the raids, they had nothing on the great raids of Classic.
---
That's not too bad actually, the real time will obviously be longer due to traveling, drinking etc but dinging 60 with like 6ish days played is pretty damn good.
---
That means you win
---
no idea honestly. Maybe some of them were bound to shift/alt/control'd variants? Pretty sure I did a lot of clicking back in the day.
---
A second Shadow Priest brings mediocre damage and mediocre healing, but more importantly fills even more limited debuff slots with low DPS debuffs. The first is fine because Shadow Weaving is useful and VE healing offsets the low damage, the second cannot even boast that.    
---
In BC Shadow Priests were OP as shit. In vanilla they were barely viable and essentially existed to buff Warlock's damage.
---
Yeah, just go look.  After you kill Golemagg there's a crack in the wall behind him.  Just stick your head in his crack.
---
Screech makes them quite tanky. Also generates some aoe threat.
---
Yeah, most don't even know how difficult it is to be a #3 or #4 tank.  The amount of gear you have to acquire and enchant, the consumables you need for each clear.  Having to know every pull INTIMATELY.  My raid guilds have always expected the tanks to mark each pull and initiate the pulls.  Then if you're a 3 or 4, you're expected to know all that and know how to maximize your DPS for each pull or boss so you have learn two different roles for each raid. 
---
 You're expected to swap to a shield and grab stuff that gets away from a tank or if a tank gets gibbed.  Meanwhile, the DPS progressively does more threat so you have to balance wearing just enough gear for the healers to keep you up while creating as much TPS as possible.  Each raid tier ramps it up a bit more on your tanks.  Some DPS and heals though, nothing changes, just bigger numbers.  The burnout effect is real.  I've watched MTs fall off after just a month of getting Thunderfury.  Shit can set your guild back an entire raid tier, even lead to disbanding.  No way you're just going to recruit some asshat and risk it.  I'd probably be looking for another guild asap if I saw that shit going on in a guild I'm in.
---
Bit of both. Going hunter again but this time on the opposite faction for new experiences. Also I won't be completely fucking awful at the game this time and will actually finish the content.
---
i was 14, its early 2005 (possibly late 2004)
---
im playing my very first character, a tauren hunter, i think at the time i would have only been level 3 or 4. But i remember reading the quest text over and over in order to find something for a quest, with the only information to go on being something like "its south west of this camp".
---
&gt; Everyone who can wear leather would want this.
---
Unless they're a Rogue or a Hunter and have a belt that has agi on it instead of strength. I believe cat form druids get the same AP from agi as rogues, but agi is still usually inferior for druids because it does nothing for your bear form and cat DPS isn't really a thing in vanilla.
---

UPVOTING EVERYTHING IN THIS POST

LOVE YOU ALL
---
SEE YOU SOOOONNNN &lt;3
---
Yea it's about your ping to the server and how many packets get dropped.  So wifi would be pretty bad for this.
---
But stadia is Google and they have data centers all over the place.  If you can maintain 20 ping to the server that only adds 40ms delay to your actions.  I assume there is stuff being done at the software level to also make this delay less noticable.  But I think your experience will depend greatly on the type of game you are playing.
---
I don't know why this subreddit is constantly shitting on TBC. 
---
First of, your normal flying mount speed was only 60%, so until you grinded your way to the epic flying mount your ground mount was still faster (and 5000 gold was a shitload of gold for most people). I agree that it dumped open PvP for a degree but there was still a lot. Think about the Elemental Plateau or the Isle of Quel'Danas for a second.
---
Secondly, atleast you had a reason to do dungeons in TBC after you got the gear you needed because every content patch added a few new pieces of badge gear and you could buy Primal Nethers and later Sun Vortexes for badges. In Vanilla there was absolutely no reason to go into dungeons after you got everything you needed. 
---
Futhermore, why should it be better for casuals  to grind mobs for mats that you sell on the auction house than doing daily quests for gold? The Isle of Quel'Danas was one of the best open PvP experiences I ever had.
---
Classic is cool and has its favors but saying that the TBC features were the reason that this game us in its current state is totally wrong. Both were the highlights of the WoW history.
---
Streamers absolutely got precedence for beta access, and their friends did too. That is clearly evident by the fact that every single streamer and their friends have access. It's really odd how upset you are by all of this. I haven't even said anything controversial. Go outside and take a walk friend!
---
agreed.
---
in time the hype will die down, and tourists and people only there because X streamer is playing will get bored and leave.
---
only then will we see what kind of a "community" we have.
---
we won't see the big picture of what we are dealing with for a few months.
---
The badge gear is also the result of their very high stacked raid gear, which also caused seasonal PvP gear to be similarly stacked.  The difference between T4 and T5 was greater than the difference between dungeon set 2 and T3 in item level.  Item levels were just absurd.  The stats added to gear invalidated everything prior.  You could raid Naxx with a BRD trinket, or a level 29 druid staff.  That sort of thing did not fly in Outlands.  Badges were a necessary correction to that mistake or you'd never be able to take on new players or people switching mains.  I did not like the problem, nor the solution.
---
Tl;dr: The badges are the result of overstacking stats between raids, and making each new tier too much more powerful than the former.
---
I have no numbers obviously but the biggest issue would be Mana and hp recovery after each kill, that's the biggest thing slowing you down and keeping you from more kills per minute.
---
Talents or spells?
---
It hasn’t, keep being wrong :)
---
Until it's your healer or tank. Kicking somebody means finding a replacement, which isn't always easy, or possible.
---
It will be immensely popular on launch. My fear is that a lot of people have gotten used to the instant gratification games and they will quit after a month at level 30. But there is always hope that they will fall in love with it like so many of us did in vanilla.
---
People want to maximize their chances of getting a raid spot.
---
With hunters where they are, that generally means guilds will plan for 2-3 I think is assumed, or even as low as one.
---
The badge system was a fine catch up mechanic during TBC. You got the badges by running the relevant group content. It was there to supplement your gear AS YOU RAN THE CONTENT, not replace it with the welfare gimme epics you see today.
---
It was.
---
I've looked into that.  I guess I'm a bit of a techno-noob.  I have a Mac, and I haven't been able to figure out how to get it to work.  That's why I'm really excited about Classic coming out!  :)
---
Lol...the Russians making a movie about Chernobyl? That’d have so much propaganda it’d be awful!
---
I've had this thought for awhile. I think classic's popularity is going to surprise a lot of people, if for no other reason than the compounding effect of the game's social element. You have people who want to play classic right now. Then you have people who will just try it out of curiosity and because their friends are playing it. Then it just snowballs from there and eventually even people who were reluctant to play it will try it because it's the thing that everyone is doing.
---
Really makes you wonder how Blizzard will move forward in the future if retail performs significantly worse than classic.
---
Ah yes I couldn't help you on a Mac I'm a Window. :) May the time pass swiftly, friend.
---
Hunter was my least favorite classic class. Feeding pets and having to keep arrows in stock sucks.
---
I've been having a pretty decent time for the last few weeks after quitting back in October.
---
The key is setting goals for yourself.
---
&lt;Envy&gt; PvP Server, Alliance | PvE Raiding Guild | EU
---
Envy are a long-running guild from private servers and retail looking for additional players at launch and beyond.
---
But first, let me start by giving you some general information about us.
---
History:
---
Formerly known as Millenium, Inside Job and Cobra Kai across various vanilla servers; we as a guild have been able to achieve consistant progression through content from release, while earning a position among top guilds. We’ve also accumulated a massive amount of vanilla information over a span of several years, and it’s safe to say our resources are some of the best out there. We are a moderate raiding guild with an experienced core that has been together for over two years now, and we plan to continue our success come Classic.
---
Raid Times:
---
Wednesday, Sunday and Monday
---
18:30 GMT - 22:30 GMT
---
Our raids take place on Wednesday, Sunday and Monday night at 18:00 until 22:00, and we prefer our raiders be available for slighty longer on Monday nights for progression periods; currently looking to start MC progression within three-weeks of launch. We will also host optional ZG raids (once released) throughout the week at the same time. We are currently seeking exceptional players of all classes and roles at the moment, though healers are always highly sought after.
---
We have big plans when Classic comes, but we can’t do it without your help! If Envy interests you, you can find more detailed information on how to join by visiting [https://envyclassic.shivtr.com/](https://envyclassic.shivtr.com/)
---
Additionally you can contact myself (Ancilla#0140) or probability#1475 on Discord via DM for more information.
---
Yeah I have done that. When my priest dinged 60 I went power infuse/shadow weaving for maximum utility. Obviously my healing was crap without any gear. It works but it's not fun to play and you're relying on flash heal to get any healing done because your other heals have a 3 second cast time and no mana reduction. I wouldn't wish this spec on anyone.. just go shadow instead.
---
I already do while taking shits. Look up the GPD-WIN 2.
---
Painful from both sides, but as you said - you grew up
---
Less DPS! Take it down to 700! Okay more DPS! Sir, we can only get it to 200! MOAR DPS OR ITS A 50 DKP MINUS!
---
You're speaking about "mobile games".
---
Im talking about *real games* being brought to mobile, which is a trend that's getting bigger every month. (Fortnite, pubg, CoD, Apex, LoL, Stardew Valley, Diablo, Mario Kart) and the list goes on.
---
As specs have gotten *much* better recently, phones/tablets have proven to be a viable platform for *real games*, and we're only going to see more released.
---
What is this name reservation time? Can you join a realm and make your character but not play it before the actual launch? When does that start?
---
Looking for guild: \[NA\]\[Normal/PVP\]\[Horde\]\[Evenings\]\[Raiding\]
---
Looking a semi Casual Guild to raid nlvl with.  I intend on rolling a mage.
---
I have played since BC and have casually raided since then. Took a break for the past 3 years and just got back into retail until classic launches.  I am available most evenings until late and weekends.  
---
PM me!
---
It’s ok. I played a lot of AC oddeysey on Project Stream and it was playable. But was not like they said “basically undetectable”. I’ll stick with my pc and consoles for the foreseeable future. Stadia will only be good for people new to games that don’t have a console/good pc and don’t have a decent library.
---
Would you? Ok. You do you. Nothing at all wrong with leveling the way you want to. It’s not optimal but optimal only takes in to consideration the most efficient use of time from a xp/hour perspective and not how you prefer to spend that time.
---
8-10? That's like 20-30% hit chance with spells. Good luck having 3 fears miss in a row. Not saying that's it's impossible but unless you get super lucky, it's not THAT easy (giving the Giant will one hit you).
---
make it yourself.
---
"the encyclopedia anyone can edit"
---
"anyone" includes you.
---
plus it's not even out yet, so there really isn't much to say that deserves an entire article. just a section of the regular WoW article. it's a version of WoW.
---
Good ol' vanilla salt.  Love it!
---
Pizza time!
---
Very much this, additionally after getting travel form, you'll also be able to kite these considerably
---
Today raid are not 40 man?
---
Threat isnt an issue as alliance, Unless your DPS are fucking mongoloids. But eventually you will be going DW/Defiance. because it is a pure TPS spec and you will be able to crush content. Impale is a very shitty/lack luster spec until really at least 6/8 t3. It doesn't add any more survivability the only benefit you have with it is having tactical mastery.
---
They're like 5 minute runs. It really isn't that bad.
---
There is no shortage of debuffs to fill those 16 slots. Doesn't really change anything.
---
Pathetic. So I disagree with your point of view and you counteract with an insult? I guess it explains why your initial post was nothing more than a rant. It’s like this was a cause and effect event as well. But what do I know?
---
Let me shed some light on the current situation.
---
Both Wrath and MoP are praised as the best expansions of WoW, with TBC arguably being in 3rd place. You do understand that WoW had to adapt and grow, right? You seem to view each expansion as a blight instead of the accepting that the only reason WoW survived, is because of these expansions. 
---
BfA is complete and utter dogshit. I’ll be the first to admit it. However, blaming TBC and each expansion after it is fucking retarded. You seem to think Classic holds the answer to all our problems. If WoW stayed like Classic, it wouldn’t have lasted.  None of your arguments would be valid because it would be a dead-er game than it already is.
---
BfA’s issues lie with the developers and their lack of listening to the community. Their “You think you do, but you don’t” mindset is the main reason WoW is currently in the shitter. For example, Warforged/Titanforging (not BfA exclusive) is still around because they believe this system is enjoyable. Yet, this system has done nothing but invalidate hard work and raiding.  
---
Anyways, this has gotten off point. Dailies gave people something to do besides logging on to farm mats, raid or BG. Flying allowed people to spend less time farming and more time doing other tasks. Badges allowed people to have a guaranteed item after set amount of gameplay. These 3 things helped keep WoW alive and without them, the game would have died a LONG time ago. You can’t blame them for WoW’s decline.
---
Your examples are so bad it’s cringe. Eyes of the beast is utterly useless.
---
i was 14 when i started playing vanilla, and even during wrath when i was 19-22 i was often the youngest in my guild.
---
Cidolfas (gnome rogue) if you remember me :D
---
What did we start at? Like 105 days? We’ve already crushed 28 days!
---
You make me want to PvP on my aq40 geared carebear pserver firemage when i get home.
---
Yeah I can believe that. However reading again. Never to or past 40. Like you begged for gold to get instant gratitude as in Retail. No offense needs to be taken, this is not a problem. Maybe you changed and can enjoy it now. But imo it needed to be allot harder and present you with the same challange. Or its a different game, no matter the math.
---
Is this real? Where can I get this if so? Would be sweet to just grind some stuff while on the buss and check AH etc. Obviously you can't do anything demanding like pvp or dungeons but would still love to have this.
---
Yo man, Demo WAS good in Vanilla though. I played it then even before the talent update. Improving pets was killer for fast leveling. 
---
I mastered the art of bouncing mobs between my Succubus and me so they spent more time running to me than hitting either and my downtime was negligible. Yet I had the MUCH higher dps of a Succubus over a Voidwalker. This was integral to leveling well as a lock IMO.
---
Also the tools Demo had worked better for long term fights than some minor increased damage deep in the other trees. Sacrificing Felhunter for example was powerful as hell on Rag because I could spam more shadowbolts and waste less time life tapping, while also not endangering my life. 
---
Also pets could still get you solid damage if you get good at micromanaging them. If not, sacrifice was a HUGE buff and consistent to boot. 
---
Honestly I think Demo was heavily underrated and was a perfectly valid spec in Vanilla. There might have been better ones, but not by nearly enough to consider Demo bad.
---
Is this an American thing cus I dont get it
---
The season 3 weapons being better than almost all the raid weapons was kind of the beginning of the end for me.
---
That's not what you do.
---
Your HS is still on CD. You technically use it.
---
You just use it while its in your Bank and you're out in the world.
---
&gt; (gnomes are out of question tho,that just looks miserable).
---
how dare you
---
most releases have been pretty smooth for the last couple expansions.
---
In fair, 6 ;)
---
No. They are not viable.
---
Are they *passable*? Yes, guilds will be able to run a shadowpriest and still clear content. But people will be able to clear with 30 man raids... So that's not saying anything. If your guild starts hitting roadblocks, expect to get hit with the axe first. If you're trying to pug, you'll get a spot as long as they are trying to fill dps; if they can, you'll get cut.
---
SPriest adds pretty minimal dps, but they bring shadow weaving which is great for the warlocks. But, PI/SW is a viable healing spec, where you have a PI disc priest spam rank 1 mind flay to stack SW and then switch back to heals. Then, you're taking a pretty minimal hit to HPS, not losing a DPS slot, AND picking up PI which is a very strong CD. 
---
In every case, the PI/SW spec is better than the SPriest dps build. Going up to 16 debuff slots won't help, they still won't get access to anything except shadow vulnerability, if you have extra slots (which you probably don't) you give them to the SM warlocks for nighfall procs off corruption. It's just a fact, it isn't viable. I don't know why we see posts every day about spriest and not boomkins and ret paladins.
---
&gt; I’ve heard of some streamers bitching because someone is watching their stream and then killing them in game. This is apparently a bannable offense in some games and I think that’s stupid.
---
Honestly, this is one of the legitimate reasons to be frustrated by these guys. Like, they can do them until they expect not to deal with what comes from broadcasting your screen online. That kind of entitlement is annoying as hell. You wanna get paid to be an online celebrity? You deal with the shitty flack that comes with it.

#[NA] [A] [PVP] &lt;Hurricane&gt; is recruiting! Hardcore WPvP, Semi-casual raiding
---
Are you a seasoned player yearning for the old style world PVP experience, and you want a guild designed around that need? Or are you new to Classic, and want a supportive, organized guild to provide you with the friendship, advice and backup you’ll need to survive on a PVP server?
---
**Consider &lt;Hurricane&gt;! Here’s what we do:**
---
* Highly disciplined, scheduled weekly city raids; plus the drills and tiresome lectures necessary to bring newbies up to speed on the do’s-and-don’t’s of zerg vs zerg pvp
---
* Support leveling members and cultivate violence by prioritizing fast response to guildies under attack in the world
---
* PVE to PVP - Don’t want to rank? No problem. Once was enough for me, too.  3 scheduled raids a week, 2 PvE, 1 City, from 7-10pm CST. Days TBD, but will fall between sundays and thursdays. Modified DKP loot system with class-specific sanity checks. (Sorry, Hunters. You can’t roll on the bindings.) DKP is awarded for city raid attendance.
---
**Who is Hurricane?**
---
Seasoned vanilla players returning from the private server circuit. We know what we like, and what we like is a tightly controlled raid, ripping through horde towns. Our culture is strictly old-school - we don’t stand for pettiness, harassment, or the mindless regurgitation of tired memes.
---
Regardless of your experience, we can take you, and teach you: how to assist train Horde raids into the dirt, when to spread out and when to tighten up, what actually constitutes “flanking” in a game without collision detection, and how to fight through crowds of Civilian NPC landmines without detonating your weekly ranking on Dishonorable Kills.
---
**Interested? Here’s what we’re looking for in a member:**
---
* Friendly, non-toxic, patient
---
* Guild oriented: helps others get their pre-raid BiS, and reasonably expects the same in return; willing to sacrifice their personal time to help protect members as they level, when it is both necessary and reasonable to do so
---
* Loves world PvP
---
* Communicative Discord voice chat user
---
* Punctual to whatever scheduled events they commit to
---
&lt;Hurricane&gt; wants to have you - if you’re a grizzled veteran craving that classic feeling that hooked you so many years ago, you’ll be right at home with us. If you’re a curious retailer who is uncertain on how far they intend to go with vanilla - you’re welcome, and you’re wanted, regardless of where your journey takes you.
---
**If you are interested, join our Discord:**

Taking a screenshot on the throne is basically mandatory.
---
My group is playing a mix of classes. I’ve mained a paladin since 05. I am rolling warrior because I’ve been a Tank since BC. I plan on main tanking for my guild. Which means warrior. If paladins were viable main tanks it’s what I would play.
---
Nah fam, those are karma farmers
---
Hopefully use the classic formula and bake something of it in into the next expansion. Retail is an arcade solo game with instant gratification. Classic is an RPG.
---
**&lt;Kalsarikännit&gt; Horde \[EU-PVP\] Hardcore-Raiding \[English\]**

**What do we want?**
---
* Our main goal is being the very best we can be in PVE raiding, competing for server firsts, while still maintaining a healthy community of like minded people.
---
**What are we looking for?**
---
* We are looking for players who want their time well spent, have fun with a dedicated but also friendly guild and are team players first.
---
**Raid schedule and recruitment info:**
---
Raid days will be Wednesday, Thursday 19:00 - 23:00 and Sunday 17:00 - 22:00 GMT+0
---
We will distribute loot by loot council, the council will include officers and members switching every week, to be as transparent as possible.

That seems to be the reality no matter how high up the ladder you go haha
---
They weren't problems in TBC because they weren't overdone.  It only became problems later on down the road, because of what they were allowed to become.
---
* Flying in TBC was reserved for end-game content and only really applied to Outlands.  Leveling 1-58 was no joke, and there was still content on the old world where flying didn't happen.  It was also used to great effect in WotLK as part of the Storm Peaks and Icecrown zones.  However, starting with Cata where it was just available for everyone, and then later on when it was basically forgotten until patch X.2, is when it became an issue.
---
* Dailies were not a problem in TBC, because they were used for reputation gains (end date) or for small amounts of gold.  Other things were worth your time, such as farming materials, doing dungeons, or doing PvP.  If you didn't do all of the dailies, or if you didn't even log in, you didn't feel that far behind.  In WotLK they increased the amount of dailies you could do, but it wasn't too bad until the Argent Tournament required you to go through many of the dailies in order to see content.  This model was used in Cataclysm, but dailies really became an issue in MoP when you had to do dailies in order to boost your raid gear.  That model has evolved from giving you more rolls and giving you item upgrades, to the World Quest and artifact progression system we got in Legion.  By the end of WotLK, you had to do dailies or you were behind on the story, and by MOP you had to do dailies or you were behind on progression.
---
* Badge gear was very subdued in TBC.  It was also helpful that the heroics in TBC were significantly harder than any expansion since (except the first couple weeks of Cataclysm before they were nerfed).  But there wasn't a whole lot of badge gear, and it wasn't necessarily BIS.  You might only get a few pieces at each tier level, and you would need to raid in order to continue.  Compare that with something like Legion, where you can get Titanforged gear from a random mob in the open world, which is higher item level and has more tertiary stats than a raid drop.
---
The systems implemented in TBC were definitely a problem later on, but that's because they were used appropriately in TBC and only became problems down the road when they were used out of control.  Moderation is the key, here, and moderation is what we lost. 
---
There are a lot of systems in Vanilla that got turned into something bad by now:
---
* The boss fight in AQ that can be done in any order to give different loot, is a similar mechanic to what Obsidian Sanctum and Ulduar had, which evolved into difficulty settings and is why we have LFR, Normal, Heroic, and Mythic raids today.
---
* Mounts and non-combat pets existed, and those are the majority of items on the in-game store.
---
* There was an LFG tool, which was the predecessor for the LFG tool in WotLK and LFR in Cataclysm
---
You and /u/Friengineer are right, but it's still a threat-related ability worth mentioning. Even if it's a talent that mages don't usually spec into.
---
Decide for someone with no context, word.
---
A lot of people will be willing to take multiple shadow priests. Only the guilds looking to min-max and go for server firsts won't. A lot of other guilds will struggle to fill a 40 man raid group, and if you're a cool person and liked by your guild, they'll be happy to take you along
---
Ya with a 40% drop rate and you need 4-5 of them for a raid. So probably an extra hour or two a week which can get old after a while
---
As a rogue you have different specs PvE and PvP.
---
With combat swords you can still PvP, but it is only half of the fun.
---
In 5mans you can get away with PvP spec.
---
(no warrior xp)
---
Another useless member of society
---
oh look another YouTube video posted with no comment
---
Was it TBC where they took away the hunter pet when you were riding on the ground? FUCK THAT! I literally cried that day. I want them to never do that again.
---
repetetive "dailies" always bother me. I don't like that style of repeated content.
---
Turn in droppable items? Sure
---
Rep for killing mobs? Sure
---
Long, odd, stupid quests that take me all over the world? Yeah!
---
But not the same grind day in and out, I want to make that choice so to speak not have it be a daily expected goal limited by time rather than my own actions.
---
I think it's a bad idea to release an official World of Warcraft Classic (or Retail) on phone. But it's really cool to do it yourself with phone app and a computer which stream the game on your phone :p (For a leveling challenge for example)
---
can't see stealth
---
Welp, Undead it is then. My group didn't switch over to horde until post-WotLK so I've forgotten some of the Vanilla combos.
---
Most of my memories are on my Dwarf Huntard.
---
awwww yiss
---
It makes no sense to not have at least one.
---
Literally anything to say "retail bad"
---
Not constructive, just crass. Go eat a Snickers
---
Classic needs to be popular to prove to Blizzard that not only did we think we did...but we actually do want to play vanilla.
---
I'm actually really happy Classic's doing so well on Twitch, and I think more people here should be too. More attention means more players.
---
Seriously, by the time it's 2 weeks before the next raids come out like a whole 2% of WoW's population has already cleared Mythic so clearly this accomplishment is complete garbage and calling it still current is an insult.
---
It was Celestalon and he played on a high end pen tablet that's probably a lot better than the computers people play WoW on.
---
Wrong Dev dude.
---
You provided some valid points but youre missing a huge one.
---
With world pvp raging all around its extremely difficult to level new chars / catch up on leveling if you start a couple of weeks after the majority.
---
Sure its all fun and games when you and bunch of your lvl 40 ish friends run around in tanaris and seek brawls with other similar level players...but when you're level 40 running around tanaris and get bodied by level 60 and his 60 friends it becomes frustrating. Adding bgs was mechanic that wass supposed to relieve some stress off off new players (and it did) and it was very justified.
---
lol oh yeah the clusterfuck of 8 groups of 5 squares
---
Huh, a geared ret used to wreck in bgs
---
I've been levelling some on a free account (so no heirlooms, no mail between alts, etc).
---
I've had a couple of deaths through over-pulling, but for the most part that's been because I've been tagging more than I should and hoping to tank them. The worst/closest to vanilla experience I've had has been with a Rogue, who just can't tank damage at low levels, nor really put out a shitload of his own with only SS and Eviscerate and white weapons. That's still been "close to" death when accidentally pulling 3, though.
---
Also what the fuck is with making first aid part of tailoring? Why would they make it part of the profession taken by a healer, a class that can make its own food, and a class that can drain health from enemies and make health stones? Such weird logic.
---
This might be one of the few bad specs that legit is kind of unplayable.
---
I suspect you could survive in dungeons but in raids it would be really hard to maintain any form of dps without mana issues.
---
In TBC, what did you lose out on if you skipped a day or two?  You were a couple days later finishing a reputation grind or you missed out on some gold.
---
Unless I was specifically farming gold for an item or for a flight skill, I would just skip dailies.  I found it more worth my time to farm herbs for potions, and to heal dungeons.
---
In WotLK, you were behind on the patch story if you didn't do dailies, but even that wasn't too bad, because you could catch up.  It wasn't until Mists that you really started to get behind if you didn't log in every day.
---
shits and giggles aside, the only grind mobs method might be the fastest method out there then... considering you don't need to waste tiem grinding gold for epic mount afterwards
---
Have your upvote random Lord Shaxx
---
the first and last scene show it is episode 2, and i already rendered the vid b4 noticing it, i couldnt find a way to fix it without having to re-render it so apologies!
---
I feel kinda happy about that tbh
---
That makes more sense. It's just the way people express, at least the last week is in the way off "all streamers are kill on sight!". Which is slightly scary, although now that you point it out it makes more sense that they mean the big'uns. Thank you for the clearification!
---
Out of paranoia I redacted the names. Don't wanna get sniped.
---
Getting it from the AH will be downright impossible the first few weeks, the demand will be outrageous. This Priest leveling video goes into how to quickly make your own wand very early on, it's what I plan on doing at launch:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-6cCxuw2jI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-6cCxuw2jI)
---
&gt; So you think people will be rank 14 in just a few weeks then from WPvP?
---
No. You can't mathematically get R14 in less than 3 months. But people will obviously start it. And they will start it in an efficient way, so they always win.
---
Also, we don't know for sure how long Phase 2 is going to last. The longer it lasts, the more reasons there are to aim for Standing 1, the more 24/7 ganking there will be.
---
They put stuff *in* not shit it *out*
---
This is one of my strongest dislikes about classic. Giving Ally shaman and horde pally in tbc was so crucial IMHO. I'm rolling Ally and will definitely miss having a shaman in the raid.
---
Do it, i hated running across them on my DW/Defiance warrior. Because as soon as i got polymorphed it was I guess i die then.
---
It's not gonna happen. Imagine a mage that can do on average 800 dps. Fury Warrior doing 900-1000. Rogues that can do 900. But hey let's bring the spriest that can do 287 dps, MAYBE 350? See the issue? Plus you'll be OOM after about 25 seconds into any raid boss fight.
---
&gt;here’s how I made it work
---
Step 1: Find a group willing to take an Enhancement shaman to a raid
---
Step 2: there is no step 2
---
Ah,  maybe classic is a bit diff than vanilla.  Time will tell
---
Teamviewer eazy solution from work to farm at home &lt;3
---
Am I out of my mind or was badge gear really difficult to farm in TBC? I remember just running Mechanar once a day because that was the only dungeon that wasn’t super difficult to complete. Maybe my group just sucked back then.
---
Rule 2
---
I think TBC and WotLK are the most popular expansion packs the game has had, both in terms of population at the time, and in terms of the polls for "favorite expansion" I've seen are usually split something like 19% Classic, 29% TBC, 29% Wotlk, 19% whatever is current content, and the other 4% split between the others.
---
Also an insta blacklist as well for the pull
---
Just use the pace vanilla had back then. There is always a group who clears it the first day. Those groups are certainly aware of it that they have to wait longer.
---
i was gonna go for the nostalgia, (altho i couldnt play at launch)
---
I have always been paladin, but ive also always been main tank... I had to choose one over the other, so i will be warrior, a class i have never played, and im actually very excited for it. Rather than forcing fun to happen with niche paladin roles
---
Warcraft 3
---
Azeroth is a beautiful world soul and it's never wrong 
---
##istandwithAzeroth
---
And then dancing on the throne!
---
Well, reaching cap quicker allows you to farm more lucrative mobs sooner. I suspect 2 extra days skinning devilsaurs would put you ahead of anything you generated grinding lesser mobs.
---
Esports PvP has no place in an MMO***RPG***
---
Gota be good at something u know
---
I think he means waiting until right before an energy tick to use gouge. You'll immediately regain 20 energy, so you only spent 5 for the CC. I'm guessing 5 energy is "free".
---
Well it would help if they didn't design zones around needing the whistle.  Highmountain was hell to navigate.
---
Ya it's less impressive, but to call guilds that complete an objective that 95+% of players aren't capable of "bad guilds" is a bit of a stretch isn't it?
---
The vast majority of guilds will only bring a 2nd shadow priest if the other option is an empty raid spot.
---
Both are fun in their own way. Why not level both and find out which is more enjoyable?
---
Yeah, I was really surprised when I joined here and noticed that the majority of the sub thinks VC is wrong. 
---
On Norgannon it was almost always called VC early on because of the quest.
---
On god if hunters start needing on my +healing gear so they can boost mend pet I'll flip my shit.
---
Cmon lets be real now mate 😁
---
Emerald Dream in Legion was a full server...
---
Just be a prominent member of your guild and they will take you. Not every guild is trying to min/max
---
WotLK had the best and the worst of WoW.
---
Best raid ever?  Ulduar.
---
Best open-world PvP zone ever?  Lake Wintergrasp.
---
Worst raid tier ever?  ToC.
---
Worst BG ever?  IoC.
---
So much this.  I thoroughly miss those days. I loved being able to distinguish myself via PvP.
---
Arena was one of my favourite aspects of the game. When you came up against a gladiator level team, and pulled out a win (even if you only beat them 1/10) was just an awesome feeling of accomplishment.
---
Classic's feeling of community + TBC's everything else might actually be the perfect game.
---
Murlocs are like Dorritos. You can’t just have one.
---
I feel your pain
---
I find it a damn shame that Shamans can’t dual wield. I’m gonna (T)roll Rogue, but a dual, axe-wielding Shaman would be hard for me to turn down.
---
Dear god stop giving them ideas.
---
"I got last word"
---
Well, wrap it up folks. He won.
---
I'm not sure if blizzard already has a set schedule for the phases but I assume each phase won't. E longer than 3 months (4 phases 3 months each is a year, seems like a logical guess but could probably go a few months either way)
---
Hopefully they base the content releases on whether or not they are actually ready and tested yet , I'd rather wait an extra 2 weeks than deal with some game breaking bug that they missed due to rushing the content
---
I mean, the Dark Portal existed since WC.  Going to Draenor/Outland I don't think was much of a shock to anyone.
---
My bad.
---
No matter what, I would still prefer to play on a PC. But for games like Mario Kart that have this arcade feeling to them, they have the potential to be well received by the whole community if they don't implement any microtransactions nor any of the other typical bs we often see in phone games. If all they do is port it and optimize it for phones, I think a lot of people would enjoy it when they aren't at their stations.
---
For the rest of them, I personally don't think it's a good idea. I would much rather have them spend the energy to create better games for PC and console instead of making mobile games that will inevitable burn out months after release.
---
That's just my opinion :-)
---
if u want to level shaman as fast as possible then you do 1h+shield, 1-60lvl and w/e talents u choose
---
Yeah because I dont feel like wasting time, aint nothing like having to deal with someone bringing a ret paladin when you need a holy paladin.
---
I feel bad for you.
---
I wonder how much home network optimization matters. I don't know anything about networking but aren't there things you can do to improve your latency? You can use Ethernet and I think there's an option to prioritize bandwidth or something?
---
Is really Ret that bad in PvE? I heard it’s great in PvP? I’m a noob btw.
---
If it is it will survive unlike all the mechanical keyboards i have had.
---
&gt; In Vanilla you needed to walk into the war room
---
Uhh...
---
&gt; que for bg's or at their location on the map.
---
Would you consider a troll or undead priest? &lt;Lok'Tar Ogar&gt; - Semi-Hardcore 
---
I started playing world of warcraft from TBC, because wow vanilla seemed ugly to me compared to games like Lineage 2 and Mu Online.
---
So it's the only "expansion" that I didn't played and I want to play.

When you are ambushed while traveling with your buddy and things go south, you can use Divine Intervention to avoid giving out HKs and for a soft reset of the encounter, if assailants are still around.

Have a watch of this video

---
While for the most part I do agree with you it is possible to get moonkins in raids and for them to pull their weight. Calling it unplayable just isn't true, but yes you will have to work your but off.
---
There was a one button macro that did all the work for you. So you could literally use an auto clicker to do top 3 dps.
---
I'm considering Alchemy as my 2nd profession late-game. But I will be running engi for pvp. Do you think that Alch is still profitable without herbalism?
---
Yeah, but its totally okay to force PvP players into PvE content to compete with other players, right?
---
I don't undersrand why people think its wrong that you get the best pieces of gear for PvP through PvP. I would love to see the the reaction of PvE players when the best gear for PvE was suddenly only available through PvP.
---
Besides the fact that many PvE parts were better for PvP than PvP items.
---
Throw 4 str 4 stam leather belt into Google, enjoy the next 5 mins of your life

Eh that real job is mostly slinging emails while playing WoW all day. He literally has all day.
---
Oh my god I was playing WoW when this video came out
---
Eye of the beast from behind the farm in Orgrimmar so you can finish off the 1% duellers with prowling pet is ALWAYS worth the silver
---
You're the one who doesn't understand cause and effect.
---
The cause is not the introduction of badge gear.  The cause is the lack of moderation on badge gear in future expansions.
---
The skill cap for shaman in PvP is very high. You can easily delete people with a lucky crit, even with no idea what you are doing, but knowing which of your 16 totems to use, when to just spam Purge the entire enemy team, how to position, how to reserve Mana. Lots of stuff to learn and improve on.
---
If you want to be a true hybrid, healing DPS and utility, it's a great pick. Fairly easy to gear as well.
---
TBC was WoW perfection, wont change my mind. I'm honestly more excited for the chance of them possibly introducing TBC again at some point.
---
I can't tell if this is sarcastic hyperbole, or if you're actually serious.
---
That’s a great tool thank you!!
---
Don't forget to leave head room on your SSD, or it will slow down.
---
&gt;Want a thing... lock in daily.
---
Let me guess. You were able to log in daily and not a person who had two evenings a week for gaming then? Because people like me wanted a thing too, but it took forever to get it. I never got a dragon mount because I couldn't do more than two days of dailys/week and sometimes not even that. In Vanilla you could do a 6 hour grinding for the Winterspring saber, two times a week and get it in a reasonable time, because it was up to you to decide which days, which amount of hours etc. you could spent.
---
Daily quests are not for people with jobs, families and other hobbies besides Wow. The are an obstacle that hinders you to get anything.
---
Yepp..... tbc low key kinda sucked
---
I sold my soul to WoW before release, so there wasn't a video that pulled me in. *But* I rolled ally initially, but my in-game buddy talked me into re-rolling horde with him. I'd been really into [Stuck's rogue videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrdQAIfHSfw) at the time (the music choice alone was dope). He was UD rogue, so I went UD rogue.
---
I don't remember any of that.
---
Bahaha. I feel like the pussy/stupid paladin jokes have been lost over the years with no bubble hearth etc. Or maybe that's just because I haven't played since Cata. 
---
Either way I can't wait for classes to have some identity again.
---
.........................
---
Their original comment says that blizzard was very close to perfection.  Its pretty clear that the 23 is what they were referring to....
---
It's actually made canon in legion, there's a quest [Devouring Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/quest=40414/devouring-darkness#comments) where you turn off kobold candles and a void aberration spawns. There's this page there:
---
&gt;Kobolds live here long time. Make home in nooks.
---
&gt;Catch rats. Sometimes eat them.
---
&gt;Dig for treasure. Trade with harpies.
---
&gt;They like shinies, we like wax. Fresh from ears is best.
---
&gt;One day drogbar come in. Say cave is theirs.
---
&gt;They smash and scare. We take candles and hide.
---
&gt;Drogbar big and stupid. They have cave, but no have candle.
---
&gt;Darkness finds them. Darkness follows them.
---
&gt;Darkness swallows them whole!
---
&gt;We come back. We have candles.
---
&gt;Cave ours again. Candles keep us safe.
---
Are they keeping it at 16 then?

You raided naxx and were unaware addons existed?!  
---
I can buy not using addons, lots of people don’t and that’s fine. I mostly preferred addons to manipulate my interface and I had a threat meter (and I think one for my pet but can’t remember what it did). Buy you knew addons were a thing.
---
Call me old school, but I enjoyed reading this more than watching somebody else play the Beta on Twitch. 
---
Thanks for the good read!
---
Er.. It's 77 days 6 hours 34 minutes.
---
No i did not. First i was opening boxes at redrige mountains, later rogue tower quest box and after boxes of  people in cities.
---
Well, it certainly isn't. Combining Quests and grinding all together towards level 60, and then farm for your mount is way faster. As rewards are higher the higher lvl youre at. 
---
But it's a fairly quick way to do it, but brain dead af. Which ain't so tempting to most players.
---
Still cant see how running around blasted lands searing gorge tanaris feralas stv to quest in all those areas to gain a single level is more time efficient than killing 370 mobs (lvl 40-41,if rested thats merely 185 mobs) if you find non player saturated grinding spot.
---
Ofcourse leveling by doing no quests and only grinding is borderline mental but getting a few "filler" levels here and there by grinding seems much more viable than azeroth world tour extravaganza most guides promote,especially if you account for the fact tons of players will be following that same guide so the competition for quest mobs will be fierce.
---
It's accurate because they're looking for a healer *and* a tank. Also, hilarious.
---
Priest's "Mind Vision." Look through the target's eyes. It is useful for finding quest objectives/scouting, and you can jump from mob to mob, by re-targeting and re-casting with seemingly no maximum range.   
---
lol
---
Well, for one, the game really isn't going anywhere so you can really take your time and not stress about it. 
---
Personally, I will spend probably 4 hours a day MINIMUM leveling as efficiently as I can.
---
Lvling efficiently is part of the fun for me, to see how well I can tackle the challenges the game throws at me.
---
Also, I do want to experience the new phases with everyone else as it releases but I won't no-life the game either.
---
Yes , there is 
---
Mages have a few questlines in dustwallow Marsh, going to theramore, speaking with jaina etc. Get the portal at 48 I think? Definitely after the rest of the portals , which is at 42 iirc.
---
Does the wolf pet that does all Shadow dmg get any scaling from your AP. That could be the pet for this spec if so.
---
Isn't eagle eye outdoor only though
---
Which is why you responded to my comment
---
I just published an add-on for retail to track this called MobXP that I plan on porting over to classic.  When you mouse over a mob it adds how much XP the mob gives and how many of them you'd need to kill to level to the tooltip.  
---
I know people are going to go full South Park and only kill boars and classic like mages can efficiently aoe level so I figured it would be useful for launch.
---
[Global release map](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule)
---
MC and very likely BWL will be completable by anyone that can hit a button when told, which is much more players than back when this was live.
---
Also, there is absolutely zero time limit on this, unlike when it was live content. It could take a casual guild 2 years to finish MC and BWL and get any gear from them, and they could still merrily move on to AQ fine. And be successful.
---
The consumables were really just crutches to make up for poor performing raid members until Naxx. Even then, I think Naxx will get beaten much more this time than before. The mechanics people are asked to do in heroic dungeons on live are harder than most Naxx mechanics in Vanilla.
---
Yes leveling on PvP servers in phase 2 is a bad idea
---
Priests were the best tank healers and shammies the best raid healers, but druids could do both, so were deffo wanted in raids, especially horde side. Plus innervate and combat res offered awesome utility.
---
[I'm 22, I'm not old!](https://imgur.com/gallery/BDzpf)
---
I'll give this meme a 3.6 not great, not terrible
---
BM and MM Hunter...because I WILL NOT FORGET to dismiss my pet when jumping down ledges in instances and raids... 
---
That in itself already makes me better than 85% of hunters....
---
It will never be as short as 3 months. Classic lasted 2 years until TBC hit the market. And the TBC release was 2 months too early if you asked me. Many guilds/groups skipped Naxx altogether because TBC was already announced. That's when only 0.1% of the playerbase ever cleared Naxx before patch 2.0. The furthest we came was 4 horseman, which was quite the achievement for us. But then time ran out and also the motivation, since TBC rendered everything worthless, which still hurts my heart.
---
No but it also happens when people play from pc and not mobile so its not like mobile phone exclusive phenomena.
---
You always run into bad players here and there,but thats got nothing to do with the device theyre using to connect.
---
Yeah I'm already trying to find a 3-4 man group who is willing to farm flight paths lol 
---
*GIVE ME YOUR HONOR*
---
I would love classic to get VR support, but godz...please never mobile.
---
If you like the sagefish, the river between Tarren Mill and Southshore is full of them. You'll probably want to be at least lvl 20 to go there, though.
---
Yes lucky blue
---
I guess he means because you have time to regenerate the energy you used while the mob is disbaled.
---
Ah oké, later the war table was added and you could que for all of them in orc. This does affect world PvP. But I personally really like Bg's and look forward to AV
---
i've never played a hunter, but love this lol.
---
What's funny is TBC and Wrath is widely considered the golden age
---
Hey man would you consider horde if the times work for you?
---
It wasnt copyright. It was because it was a reference to drugs, that Blizzard decided not to include.
---
Also the quest is kill 4 tide-runners and 8 oracles, spend 20 minutes trying to find a single oracle while massacring 50 tide-runners.
---
I disagree, if blizzard was planning to follow their retail schedule they would've waited another entire year to release classic.
---
Doesn't seem that the classic dev team is following in retails footsteps, luckily, but only time will tell.
---
It wasn't actually onehitting, surprisingly.   
---
And you prioritize fearing over anything else, deathcoil was a thing too. So basically only cast fear until it works, then just dot and reapply fear. Lifetap as needed. Siphon life helped offset the life cost/loss while you're spamming fear, etc.   
---
It wasn't fast, but it was doable.
---
Apparently level 40+ elemental becomes a faster leveler then enhancement. If you can pick up +nature damage gear (Wildthorn Mail, some weapon and helm I can't remember name of) you'll be doing insane damage at 49-60.
---
TBC had the best end-game PvE progression the game has ever had.  It was perfectly balanced in how long it took to progress.  Progression lasted months, not hours; and there was only one version of each boss, which means when you killed it - you killed it.
---
TBC fixed the honor system that led to unhealthy playing habits.  It was significantly improved for low-level players as well.  I actually felt like I had a reason to go into BGs at level 19, as I could get quality items from them.
---
The things brought up in the OP of this thread, were not a problem in TBC.  There wasn't much badge gear.  It helped you catch up a little bit, but you weren't raiding on badge gear alone.  It filled the same role as reputation, crafting, BoEs, and PvP gear which already existed.  Flying mounts weren't overused in TBC, and for most people it wasn't much faster than a land mount.  Dailies were a small boost if you chose to do them, but were truly optional.

I don't see an issue with either. If streamers want to blacklist people who camp them then that's completely fine. If you want to make a guild to camp them then thats also fine. Classic is a social game, what you do has consequence. I don't see an issue with either end of this honestly.
---
Badge gear predated daily quests, so your timeline is a bit skewed.  And I compare badge gear to honor gear - you participate in the content (BGs or Heroics) and you earn a currency to then buy better gear.
---
Lol you are talking like a baby boomer with this new generation cant focus or invest attitude. First, its a fucking game so its highly logical for people to dont invest shit or go try hard, second its beta server, everything you do is even more pointless and its a great opportunity to do whatever you want as your reputation doesn't impact anything at all.
---
The AQ hammer is a nice alternative to the nef Axe with the human bonus. But it's mostly about the reduced faction grinding

In 90%+ of raid comps you’ll see only Resto Shamans

I was a college teacher at the time Leeroy Jenkins blew up. My students showed me and we laughed and laughed. Then I asked, "Wait, so in this game, you actually team up with a bunch of people, talk out a strategy, and then fight huge bosses???" 
---
I signed up that day.
---
&gt; I haven't even said anything controversial. 
---
You just tried to legitimize the 'frustrations' of a bunch of entitled crybabies bitching up a storm because they don't have access to A CLOSED BETA. Don't forget what the beta is for. There are good reasons besides the obvious why streamers have access. But they aren't the only ones.
---
For what it's worth, this sub actually isn't that bad. But the official forums are a cesspool of this behavior.
---
Can't remmber where I found it maybe in korgaz vid?
---
I disagree with most of your points. The addition of flying mounts did not cause players to spend less time in the game. As we all know, flying was not allowed on Azeroth until Cata, so you were only able to fly on Draenor. There were a grand total of like 3 or 4 places worth flying to and that were not accessible by other means. Second of all, the flight speed was 60% so the only places it was "faster" to mount and fly to were from Hellfire to Netherstorm. Epic flying was easily faster however it also took very dedicated farming to obtain. When I took my break at the end of Season 3, I would guess there were 500-800 players on my entire server that even had it. The problem wasn't/isn't flying. It is the abundance of areas that are accessible via Flying, and the removal of stop gap between slow flying and fast flying.
---
Badge Gear was introduced to help players bridge the gap from dungeons to raids. It was meant as a catchup mechanic and I can understand you pointing that as a benefit/addition meant for casuals. However this was not some simple "here you go, casuals, take this free gear. There were 16 heroic dungeons in TBC (raids also dropped badges, but we can skip that). These instances produced between 2-5 badges per run. In case you forgot, Heroic dungeons weren't the easiest runs in the world, especially if you were undergeared. So let's say that this "casual" players intends to gear up via Badges of Justice. If they casual players can play 4 hours a day (from from casual in my mind) that would mean they were probably completing between 4 and 5 heroics per day. If they were able to complete all of the highest yielding instances, and do 5 dungeons, they would yield 24 badges per day. This means that at the low low price of 25 days of 5 dungeon runs, a person could gear in full badge gear (and those numbers are on the low end, much higher if you needed non caster items)
---
Finally dailies. I don't know where this whole dailies = casual thing got started but it's some of the most backwards logic I've ever seen. These quests/rep grind that require you to log in daily, take up a good chunk of your time were created for casuals? Wut.
---
Lol, then why bother even trying to do feral tank?
---
MCP is the only thing that keeps them relatively in the same ballpark as warriors. They're behind on every other aspect, but with MCP they'll never lose threat. It's literally the only advantage they have, if you don't have MCP, you're just going to be the fill 4th seat tank at best.

dont even speak of that, that is how the player base on launch servers died
---
Ew
---
I think he means that IQD had enough dailies that you could just go there to do all of your dailies for the day.  All the other ones you mentioned you'd get a handful of dailies and have to go to the next one.
---
You are picking what you are going to level to 60 based on a chart?
---
I wonder what they’ll do about the Nicker and Slavemaker.
---
Haha, totally!  My priest just made bandages to level her tailoring and then just vendored them.
---
Youre a heal bot in any guild that isnt memeing
---
Solo against a mage, though, it's a rough time. Otherwise ret is pretty insane in pvp, especially with hand of rag.

First, i would play this, second, its about as good as most vanilla players were anyway.

**&lt;No Offense&gt; Alliance | NA-PVE | Late-Night Raiding Guild**
---
* No Offense is a group of old school raiders that just want an enjoyable gaming experience. We are currently running Heroic Raids and obtain AOTC on every content tier in retail, and we plan to do the equivalent in Classic WoW.
---
**Late-Night Pacific Time (PST PDT PT):**
---
* The guild tends to log on after the kids go to bed and log off around midnight.
---
**PvE:**
---
* Because we have kids and jobs and we enjoy raiding, not corpse camping streamers and being called terrible names by kids younger than our children.
---
**Alliance:**
---
* We currently raid as Horde.  So we're mixing it up!  Plus - Paladins!
---
**What we are looking for in members:**
---
* Mature players interested in raiding and playing to support end game content.
---
* Social members that want to hang out and have fun playing later into the evening with a friendly group.
---
* It would be great to get several farm groups going, so even if you just want to goof off and get carried by the main raid team through BWL while we're farming our 12th Ashkandi for a hunter... come on by!
---
* We will also be pushing AoTC and Mythic+10 content Horde side on retail WoW, so that option will also be available.
---
* Anyone that is also looking to participate in both retail and classic, this will be a great fit for you (though it's certainly not required).
---
**General Gaming Schedule:**
---
* 8:30 - 11:30 PT Weeknights and Weekends
---
**Raid Scheduled:**
---
* TBD, though our current Retail raid schedule is Wednesday/Thursday

Wow people really cant think for themselves anymore. Every day its a new thread about what class should I play. How about just play something and if you dont like it roll something else rather than asking thousands of people with different opinions.
---
Druid is the embodiment of classic.
---
Yeah I know it’s a pain in the ass, but raw grinding seems like a a lot more item collection, and chances for rare items. Not to mention you can probably focus on grinding spots that drop good vendor items right?
---
For me too.  Best raids (except ulduar is in the conversation), better class balance and spells, and there was nothing like the rush of popping heroism/bloodlust and burning the fuck out of the boss.  It maintained long attunements, rep grinds, etc.  Here’s hoping we get TBC servers as well one day.
---
I'll agree to disagree here.  Anything that helps you conserve mana and stay in form, regenning more mana while doing so, is worth it when trying to solo an elite.
---
Having to shift out to cast a Healing Touch, a Regrowth and/or Rejuvenation, and then shift back to bear drains a lot of mana.  Even more if you have to root and gain distance with travel before setting that up.  Being able to stay in bear with FR will extend the time you're waiting for that mana to be there if you need to pop out and heal again.
---
The mace is amazing in the off hand lol. Crul is just so fucking god tier. The rep bonus isnt really that big of a deal aside from maybe if you want to do winterspring. It also makes you do like 4-5 less AV's when that comes out. So i mean it is nice but not that big of a difference.
---
This is really what kind of ruined the game. Not flying mounts, but players "needing" them. Which then forced blizz to give players access to full speed flying mounts sooner.... which then kept us in the skies, rather than on the ground.
---
In the context of the time period, he's probably right. At release, vanilla wow was this total noob game that only plebs and casuals played

 Not the Face
---
NA-PVP (Hardcore Raiding / PVP Grind)
---
&lt;[https://www.nottheface.com](https://www.nottheface.com/)\&gt;
---
We have a new Charter with a TON of info.
---
Loot Council / DKP Combo
---
Recruiting: All Talented Classes
---
**Intro:**
---
Not the Face was initially created in 2007 as a semi-troll / PVP guild on Destromath-US. A server wide forum post was made claiming that NTF, as well as many other PVP Guilds, were incapable of progressing in high end raiding. As the servers top PVE Guilds were just closing in on Illidan NTF combined with many other pvp guilds and tore through ALL of the TBC content in a matter of weeks. NTF is now reforming for Classic WoW in 2019. A Horde Guild with an overall goal of PVE and PVP destruction; NTF plans to accomplish everything that Classic has to offer. Our goals include everything from acquiring all legendary weapons to running 24/7 High Warlord grind teams. Scarab Lord titles to camping STV to farm angry posts on the server forums. We plan to accomplish our goals by providing structure and guidance for what would regularly be a rag-tag group of washed up has been wannabes.
---
We require a 90% participation for raids, though we are flexible with RL schedules if something comes up. 18+ / We swear, drink, laugh and have a good time. Not a good place for children. Please have a plan for leveling. Requesting days off is not required. But is recommended.
---
**Schedule:**
---
We raid PST evenings generally starting at 5pm. Raids will be 3 times a week. Monday, Wednesday and Friday(Flex/Alts/Farm). These times are subject to change during progression.
---
When honor is released we will be running a 24/7 premade for HWL farming. We have a few no lifers whom want to accomplish this goal for some reason. Though this is not required by any means.
---
If you have any questions feel free to talk to us on our forums, in-game or on discord (oheyspun#1337)
---
Everyone was a retard back then and backpedald and click'd. Game was always easy and is even easier now.
---
Also found the warframe part a bit odd. I think a lot of folks still haven’t really played it.
---
I'll be playing a druid again in Classic, I'm just trying to figure out what faction I want to play on.
---
Care to elaborate on why you think this?
---
Meh its more like 5% most raids, and like 15 to 20% of guilds that actually attempt to down mythic bosses kill the final boss.
---
quick question, T2 is what exactly? I guess I'm trying to figure out what raids or pvp sets that would equate to?
---
Paladins can also solo elites, it just takes so long that after setting up your judgement and seal, you can go brew a pot of coffee while you wait for the fight to be over.
---
I'm also a rogue in the beta; I slightly disagree with the op (I think he's had a rougher time than me I gather). But it is fun.
---
Also, you can use EotB and set your pet on "stay" to drop them off ledges and not need to dismiss them, to keep them from running around like an idiot and pulling everything. Or run them tight corners to avoid pulling.
---
Huh you speller orc warrior wrong but that’s ok man
---
ABOUT US:
---
Atlas is currently recruiting high-level, team players. Our current core is tight-knit and made up of players who played retail Vanilla and on private servers. Many of us are proven to be the best at the games that we play. We have stuck together through multiple MMORPGs and other competitive, team games. We know what it takes to be the best and welcome others who share that vision.
---
WHAT IS OUR GOAL IN CLASSIC?
---
We are striving for an enjoyable launch experience by streamlining levelling and pre-raid gearing through cooperation and communication. It takes a team to clear raid smoothly. The same goes for levelling, questing, and gearing. We are looking for players who will put in the effort to ensure that our team is in the best possible shape, not individual characters. We will conduct our first raid at the end of the second raid reset. Subsequent raids will aim to be fast and efficient each week Wednesday/Thursdays at 9:00 EST.
---
WHAT IS EXPECTED?
---
Atlas is a hardcore guild. Understanding loot council and giving/receiving criticism is a necessity of our team environment. We need hardcore levelers and team players on launch in order to meet our goal of week 2 raid. After the launch, we expect 100% unexcused raid attendance.**
---
APPLY TO ATLAS:
---
If you have any questions please do not hesitate to reach out via a direct message through the WoW forums, or message one of our officers on Discord (AEric, B, Carlt0n) to chat more. We look forward to hearing from you!

For farming honour points they were much worse, but they were certainly fun to play in. It was like a massive game of tug of war where everyone felt like they could contribute in some way.
---
99 firemaking got me prepared to click in the same 60 button pattern for hours on end (I did it before bonfires got introduced)
---
I find that encouraging honestly
---
Thats only 272 (and some change) per level when you divid it by 60.
---
Clearly you wont have to kill 272 from level 1 to 2.
---
Imagine that for a moment.
---
More tank TPS = more DPS from DPS
---
&gt; You have people who want to play classic right now. Then you have people who will just try it out of curiosity and because their friends are playing it.
---
Which is interestingly how the game got so popular to begin with. I can't speak for everyone, but everyone that I know IRL all picked up WoW originally because someone else in their social circle introduced it to them and it spread like the plague. I'm sure WoW classic will be similar, and I think I'll be patient zero for my social circle as I already got two friends interested.
---
&gt;vocal minority
---
So when it was all of us clamouring for Classic and people said this about us you were probably right there with us pushing back on the notion... don’t be that guy and use it on someone else just because it’s not something YOU want.  They think they do, and they do.
---
Why not both? That's what i am doing Warrior main Rogue alt. Win Win
---
Seems perfect for me. Will discuss with friends
---
You are aware that this works both ways, right? Forcing players into raids when their only goal is to PvP isn't healthy for those players either. That's the whole reason they created that system.

I was actually playing Dark Age of Camelot. We had a very active guild of about 30 regular players. We were doing the current end-game pve raids at the time as well as RvRing. We had been discussing this upcoming "World of Warcraft" -  generally making fun of how "cartoony" it looked and how no one was gonna play it.
---
Week before WoW release- 30 active members in our DAOC guild.
---
Week of WoW release - 25 active members
---
1 week after - ~18 active members
---
2 weeks after -  6 or 7 active members
---
3 weeks after - Me and the only other guy left - "Fuck. I guess we really should give this WoW thing a try."
---
Hey, not sure if this has been reported or where to bug report in general, but there seems to be a sql error when trying to load the Strahad Farsan page. https://classicdb.ch/?npc=6251
---
99% of Shaman, Druids, and Pallies will be heal bots.
---
I approve of your dwarf hunter :)  sometimes I feel like I will be the only one not being a NE hunter on alliance side :P
---
Same, I was hoping it would be the old AV and not the one where they removed some mobs and dropped their health.
---
Yup. There's always a reason to have the ol' wandering eye when it comes to choosing a class. I think the fact its so hard is a sign classic was so fantastic. Just choose one and focus on all the things it can do instead of can't do.
---
Sorry, this got WAY longer than I intended.
---
I resubbed and came back after 8 years just to play classic. In the wait for August 27th, I have been leveling a couple of characters.
---
During the retail leveling process, I have felt disappointment in what the game has become. Classes used to have more utility and versatility until some bad idea generator at blizzard decided that what we wanted was oversimplification and a mobile game like experience.
---
The first thing I played when I came back was a demon hunter because, why not. The "tank" spec is the most powerful soloing class I have ever played. The entire experience, whether I pull a single trash mob (pull being a broad term, there is no pulling, you just derp into packs of mobs intentionally with no thought required) or several 120 elite mobs is basically down to 5 buttons. 
---
Then I found out that the "hard" mobs with 1.5 - 2.5 million hit points are generally just more time intensive. I can solo those while watching TV too. It just takes longer because they are more spongy. Group of 10 mobs? No problem. I am all that cleaves and explodes.
---
After playing the DH, I leveled my old DK main from wrath and he is currently 117. His entire play experience is 3 buttons.
---
Then, I made a Mag'Har hunter. Are you fucking kidding me, they removed hunter's mark?!?
---
Fired up one of my old warlocks (yes, one of). Are you fucking kidding me., they don't even get lifetap?!?
---
Both of these have the same gameplay as the others. Press first button. Proc makes other button glow. Press other button. Press first button again.
---
The game has (disappointingly) the complexity of a mobile game now. 
---
The best part of all of this: After starting the DH and leveling him to 120, grinding out exalted with Honorbound, getting 10k away from exalted with Argussian Reach, Army of Light, and Zandalari Empire for the new races, Leveling a hunter to 38, a Rogue from 76 - 111, and a DK from 87 to 117...
---
I have received a grand total of four tells from other players. Three were random guild invites because I only have a tag on the DK. The last one was someone telling me that they loved my collector's edition panda cub pet.
---
Between early 2005 and early 2011, I made friends that I still talk to today. I got picked for groups out of the 15 or so in Ironforge shouting for a group because one or two of the people in the group had grouped with me before.
---
I gut into a guild and got to experience raiding because several of the guild members grouped with me multiple times while we were leveling. We had a community. We knew each other.
---
If I needed a rare enchant, a flask, an arcanite transmute... I asked people that I knew and they game me the name of another player that they knew.
---
There is something magical about the classic experience where you know the people that you see in the capital cities every day. You know them by name. When a scumbag pops up, the social contract that has organically developed takes care of it. People with bad reputations don't get groups and guilds.
---
There is also something magical about hearing that level up sound after spending a few days where as in retail wow, it happens so often it is just background noise that triggers the Pavlovian response of looking down at the chat box to see what skill just got handed to you for free.
---
TL/DR: Came back to wow after 8 years while waiting for classic to launch. Found the game to be a hollow, easy Skinner box with no real sense of community or challenge, just motions to go through. Found the original game to be the opposite of these things and very rewarding. Can't wait.
---
Played from vanilla to end of WOtLK, cata pushed me away also fatigue. I just relived this again and feel refreshed :)
---
Lol wut.
---
Just make the character on release day and look for yourself .
---
So you would not play the game solely based on the fact that a completely optional mechanic is integrated into the game? You realize you can literally just not queue for battlegrounds, and for some reason you make it sound like world pvp doesn't exist, strange.
---
why think for yourself when Twitch, YouTube, and Reddit can do the thinking for you?
---
embodiment of out of mana more like it
---
Be careful of any green armor with viable stats or stat combos (str/agi + stam, element damage, healing, etc) at x8-x9 levels. There are certain greens that sell for a fuck load to twinks.
---
Yeah in the title he did write that, but if you read the explanation he writes "If you only focus on World PvP what rank can you realistically reach?"
---
This is what he "literally" typed. I'm pretty sure I understood the question. He wants to know what how high he can get realistically without doing battlegrounds, not what is theoretically possible.
---
Its 50/50 click and tab, usually ranged click more and melee tab target
---
But what i really mean is using terrain in pvp, having a smaller model lets you get through places a tauren male can't, also nameplates aren't LoS so hiding is actually a thing
---
Also mouseover cc is especially harder to use against smaller models
---
Thank you! This will help a lot in translating from 2000's leet speak.
---
Every single word in your post is making me mad...because it's only June 10th, and not August 27th.
---
People like you just come here, on this sub, on a daily basis, pushing my hype even higher, if that is possible.
---
Please stop, I can't handle this much hype :)
---
You must be doing it wrong.  Druid is a class for intellectuals.
---
I like him like you do too
---
I can't wait for people who didn't play during vanilla complaining about warriors needing on leather lol
---
You worry too much. If they have low pop servers, they will merge them as they did in vanilla
---
Yeah there are plenty of raiding guilds on PvP servers
---
What GCD changes?
---
we really need mobile support to play on the 3 hour train ride to work
---
Go Horde or go home.

 **&lt;Means to an End&gt; | Alliance | NA | PvE | EST | Casual progression**
---
&lt;Means to an End&gt; formed around distantly connected groups of real life friends and people known from original vanilla guilds. We generally have lives and responsibilities now, and will be progressing at a more relaxed pace. Raiding is only seen as one part of what our players would like to do - taking our time to enjoy leveling, PvP, etc are just as much a part of the experience.
---
Raids will be two nights a week, between Monday - Thursday. Exactly which two days are not yet decided. A reasonable time limit will be placed on raid times so people can spend time with their families and get to bed at a reasonable hour. Message me here on reddit if you have any questions, or as Cirdan on the guild discord:
---
[https://discord.gg/HzBgFZM](https://discord.gg/HzBgFZM)
---
Exactly, it is very rewarding. And honestly, grinding is alot more rewarding if you make yourself a few goals along the way, mini competitions. It's also quite nice to learn and get to know your limits to extreme levels.
---
Pretty sure they had both free transfers &amp; server merges in the past.
---
Yeah you are clearly distracting yourself from the truth i just spit on you. I did not mention age, nor do I think this was a reason for your failure. Nor do I think your failure was bad. Just shifting the crop. I dont want classic to be what Retail already is. Vanilla for fanboys. If everything is pointless, why you so happy about your mount? Your response is kinda nonsens. You know what I ment, clearly.. 
---
Im happy for you that there is retail. I just want something to enjoy myself.

**Raid times**: 9p-1a CST Wednesday/Thursday
---
**About**: RMoG's core is made up of friends, some of which have been playing WoW together for 14 years and others which have been met while raiding on private servers since Nostalrius. Many of us are tired of finding ourselves in guilds with corrupt or incompetent leadership. This time around, we're building something ourselves that will last throughout Classic and let us accomplish our goals. We have the experience to lead this guild through Naxx and the drive to create a strong, cohesive community along the way.
---
**Goals**:
---
\- clear all content quickly with solid raid performance
---
\- avoid and/or stamp out intraguild drama
---
\- fair, transparent loot distribution &amp; guild bank management
---
\- encourage activity and engagement within the guild as opposed to raidlogging
---
\- establish dominance in world pvp
---
\- tentative 1st raid \~4 weeks post-launch
---
**Recruitment**: At this stage before the launch of Classic, we're recruiting for \*\*all roles\*\* if you are an exceptional, dedicated player. 
---
**Apply**: You can apply to the guild via this link, which is also available on our Discord server: &lt;[https://forms.gle/DCNNXWeGYqFTofMdA](https://forms.gle/DCNNXWeGYqFTofMdA)\&gt;
---
**Contact**: Here's how to contact us if you have any questions or concerns before applying:

&lt;[https://discord.gg/pjZkBS4](https://discord.gg/pjZkBS4)\&gt;
---
Yes, but how many if boars only?
---
TBC Raids:
---
\- Kara: good
---
\- Gruul: quite good
---
\- Mag: terrible
---
\- SSC: bad
---
\- TK: bad (except for the final boss fight)
---
\- Hyjal: really bad
---
\- ZA: one of the best raids blizzard has done
---
\- BT: really good
---
\- Sunwell: bad
---
Basically you had kara which was a better UBRS, ZA which is as good as blizzard has ever done, BT which was great and then a bunch of total crap.
---
Fancy words. "Running." I think the word you mean to use is running.
---
Yes, many players make their choice based on character animations. I recommend finding classic gameplay of various class/race combinations and see for yourself :)
---
Wow...this post is just insane.  And I don't mean that in a good way.
---
First off, what makes your TRIFECTA so good?  It's just 3 changes that later turned the game sour.  There are other things people complain about, why are they NOT part of your Trifecta?  
---
Changes to the PvP system favoring smaller groups of PvPers and less open-world PvP; changes to prot paladins to make them viable tanks later leading to class homogenization; item rating system leading to homogenization of gear.  There's lots of things that people complain about, why leave those out of your list?
---
On top of that, a Trifecta is something that synergizes with each other.  For example, dungeon finder making groups easier to find, dungeons being easier to clear with a PUG, and higher drop chances on dungeon drops means you get geared out from dungeons faster.  That is a TRIFECTA.  Three random features that don't have a direct correlation with each other are not a TRIFECTA.  They are just three things.
---
This leads me to the main point - you're arguing about what happened in future expansions (the "snowball effect") as to why TBC ruined WoW.  But TBC didn't ruin it.  TBC is that delicious meal, before someone added too much salt.  It's still ruined, yes, but it wasn't ruined in TBC.  It's not because the recipe was bad.  It's because someone tried to alter the recipe from a perfect balance of ingredients (TBC) to something overloaded in seasoning (future expansions).
---
You can't call the recipe bad because it wasn't followed later.
---
Recreating the past released content is largely new work. The job would actually be easier to make changes in a lot of ways. Either way though it won't happen. Maybe the private servers if they continue to exist would do something else. Still a HUGE longshot.
---
You're a long way from home, boy
---
wrong sub
---
Just wanted to say thinks for stating this. I've been debating between mage and priest/hunter. Always leaning towards mage because of the easy money while being in town with portals. This is what I played back then and I may just roll something else to have fun.
---
I agree, I would love to be able to craft/fish while working as I also work in an industry with a lot of down time. I do think that it would be severely limiting in terms of quick accurate controls for pvp/raiding, sure. But that's not what most people would use a mobile platform for.
---
All of these comments seem to be part of the anti-mobile circle jerk that formed from the Diablo panel at blizzcon. "oo don't give them ideas hrrr hrrr". Come on guys...
---
All that being said, as much as I would personally play a mobile version of wow, I do concede that it would probably not be a smart business decision for them moving forward. I doubt that they would get enough support to make huge dev time needed for this worth it. Just not really viable.
---
lmfao this was incredible
---
Human
---
Why do you think it was trash, and what would it take to change your mind?
---
Cool and all, but it's pretty much an irrelevant post in this sub.
---
I was in US top 20 when we killed archimonde, which wasn’t until after it was nerfed (and a few classes were buffed). Does that mean it wasn’t current content even though I was one of the first 20 guilds in the US to kill it? Same question applies for many bosses we killed all while in US top 15-25 over the 5 consecutive years I raided there. 
---
Get off your high horse, kid. Your definition of CuRrEnT cOnTeNt doesn’t hold water.
---
oh no, i dont have enough bandages
---
BFA is that a way —-&gt;
---
I miss that, recognizing names. Knowing people I had run with before when I /who level brackets.
---
THE best thing was developing a nemesis, in TBC I was leveling a BE Mage and I kept running into this DR Sham. At completely different levels in completely different zones. We just went at each other on sight.
---
Simply put, the latency we are concerned with here is  the round trip time of the packet.  I'm not an expert in networking, but I did take it in college.  There are probably techniques you can use to improve your ping, but the biggest determining factor of ping (or round trip time), is your distance to the server, which obviously can't be fixed via software.
---
It's an interesting problem.  If anyone has the infrastructure to do it right though, it's Google.  I think it depends on the type of game you are.  I'm a PC gamer that plays on a 165hz monitor/FPS.  I'm the sort of guy who can feel the delay on a console that's hooked up to a hi-res TV with a bunch of post-processing delay.  I would probably be able to feel an extra 40ms while other console gamers might not really notice it.
---
Also, I think it depends on the type of game you are playing? A turn based RPG or card game like Hearthstone would probably be a fine experience overall.  A fast pace FPS or fighting game that requires split second reactions? I think you're gonna have a bad time.
---
what?
---
I get of work at the *exact* time classic drops, I'm beyond ready to piss that evening away start to finish
---
?

8.what now

Aah wotlk memories, I dont ever remember attacking anyone without being clearly advantaged.

Fighting an elite?

Trying to tame an elite with your pet off?
---
Trying to do pit quest? 
---
Die!
---
Are you prepared?
---
Nope, bye.
---
That’s why mages level in their start area.
---
They've said free transfers
---
yes
---
Never saw this used, personally.
---
You'll want an imp for the buffs or a succubus for extra CC.
---
If it isn't worth much, that usually means it's easy to farm or find, so why would I pay a really high marked up price for something commonly found and easy to optain?
---
Oh sorry. It was in vanilla. You learn it early on. Level 14 or something like that.
---
Same faction,different class.
---
I doubt you will see the same numbers of classes at lv 60. Play what will make u happy dude not what is needed or bis.

Warlocks cannot maintain threat. That's really the crux. As a tank you need to be able to go into a pack of 3-6 mobs and hold them all. A Warlock cannot. A voidwalker cannot.   
---
I've had a Warlock "tank" a few areas in Scholo/Live Strat while we waited for our tank and we didn't die, but it was really slow going because the threat ceiling was incredibly low.
---
The vast majority of servers will level out. And IMO, if you're playing on a streamer server, then you're asking for it...
---
They as a Warlock if you clear the area first... Haven't had any issues with elites my level. It's when you pull them with other mobs that it gets hairy. Unless it's immune to fear... Then I need someone to take the beating.
---
Anyone who actually cares will already have this figured out.
---
In words - yes, in practice - you protect only yourself as a ret.
---
I didn't play on private servers, graphics and game engine feels super smooth ( i wish enemies would stay closer to me when i am running and strafing and attacking them ). I decided to roll on ultra not on CLASSIC settings. FRONT STABBING is not possible to my knowlage.

The overt and intense reaction to a mundane clip of a girl gamer logging off frustrated while being camped. If you wish to ignore the fact that people on the internet react more more aggressively when women in video games don't act 'properly' that is your deal. Folks don't need to use literal slurs and directly state they're being sexist to be sexist. Its about the subtle differences in the way people perceive others. If you don't think gamer are less likely to give women in video some slack you haven't been paying attention. My argument is in the content of this thread. She is being cyber-bullied over this teeny tiny thing, which is the norm for women in videos, to receive extreme hate over small perceived infractions.
---
Maybe he just wanted to see some Beta ZF??
---
It would probably be fine for Classic WoW PvE content.
---
It would indeed be awesome,especially if the voice reading it would be the one from the game cinematics
---
I can't take any credit, I found on this subreddit last week. I do think it's fucking amazing though!
---
Hi, /u/YourS1ster
---
Also, you can trade bullets for arrows for free in the capital cities!
---
Alot of em are pretty good in PvP, too, but it's also not realistic to be respeccing after every raid.
---
What do you like about druids in pvp?
---
There will be plenty of guilds taking "meme" specs just play what makes u happy and be dedicated + do your research
---
Maybee doing this. Wont have much time to Play so I will Always be Rested. Doesnt Sound to bad
---
Yep, this is 100% true. I am not the type of player to start a fight, but as a Warrior in Vanilla, you had 2 choices : attack first or hope that the enemy you see won't open up first.
---
With Rogues, all changes. You see a Rogue, you attack him first. There is just not other way around.
---
wow reddit here why irrelevant?
---
the initial flood is only important at launch, this is when the population would be the most condensed in only a few spots, I see no issue with removing layering sooner, even if the player base hasnt gone down.
---
Remember this is an MMO not a single player game
---
Exactly why DW/Defiance is the spec to roll. Fuck impale.
---
First off, this is Classic and we are hoping for #nochanges.  So I don't know what you're worried about.
---
Second, dailies weren't an issue until Mists.  They weren't an obligation before then, but rather a minor boost.  There were other things you could do with your time that felt just as rewarding as doing the dailies, unless you specifically wanted the rewards from those dailies.  
---
I never felt obligated to run dailies in TBC, and for the most part didn't in WotLK either.  (The exception is specific reputations, which had an end date and I didn't feel like I needed to do them every day).  By Mists, they were required every day, and that's when I burned out on them.
---
Maybe, maybe not
---
Tbf, it's mostly just at the beginning when you set up your raid markers
---
A grindy, meaningful, adventurous, long haul style of gameplay is better for casuals because they can slow burn through the leveling process and be entertained for months.
---
I have to admit blade flurry helps with multiple enemies but 2 minut CD is a pain :P
---
wrong subreddit
---
Laying is there to help with low lvl leveling. Once the player base is spread out enough, laying will not be needed. And it will be the same as when there was highly populated servers in vanilla.
---
If I can't find an Alliance guild then I will consider it because those times are perfect for me. I'm trying to go Alliance since that is what I played back when WOW first released
---
Oh I actually remember something like that. My brothers friend gave us a copy that came on like 4 CDs and we could basically just fly around the world with not NPC or anything. I remember going to Booty Bay and there was weird stuff, like a statue of liberty in the water or something?
---
I get what you're saying, but honestly it wasn't nearly as bad as you make it out to be. I played during TBC, it was my favourite time in WoW, and yes that might be a heretical statement on this sub, don't get me wrong, I love Classic as well, started playing WoW during vanilla so it will always hold a special place in my heart, but hear me out:
---
Yes flying mounts diminished world PvP, but it *still happened* and happened **A LOT**, did you forget the PvP objectives Blizzard introduced into the world? Hellfire Peninsula, Zangarmarsh and Terokkar Forest, and of course the main attraction: Halaa in Nagrand.
---
You'd constantly see level 70's swoop down from their epic flying mounts just to gank a low level trying to quest, and even whole premades doing the PvP objectives, sometimes fighting other premades!
---
The "just leave me alone to quest" mentality that modern WoW players have towards WPvP hadn't set in yet, people just treating flying mounts as a convenience and not a crutch to escape from PvP. That wouldn't happen until much later.
---
Now, dailies: Yes they were a godsend for the casuals, not having to farm mats or play the auction house for gold was amazing, but there weren't that many people who used dailes as their *only* source of gold, people still farmed mats and people still played the AH. In fact all the most popular farming spots for elemental motes were constantly full of players competing with each other, such as the earth elementals in Nagrand. On some servers it got to the point that you'd still see 3-4 people at 5 am running around desperately tagging as many mobs as they could, or around 10 people huddled around the same pond trying to fish up motes of water.
---
Dailies were seen as a source of bonus gold, not the *only* source of gold.
---
And finally; Bages. Like dailes badges were seen as a bonus, or to help newer players gear up slightly faster. Nobody had the mindset of "I NEED badges because I'm a casual", that simply wasn't a thing back then. **Everyone** who wanted to get gear did what everyone else did, they started farming gear from dungeons, then heroics, then Karazhan, then Maggy and Gruul's and so on. You couldn't get decent gear any other way, if you wanted to gear up just from badges you'd be SOL and have terrible gear compared to the average Kara raider.
---
The entitled mindset with badges wouldn't start happening until Wrath, back in TBC everyone played the game *just* like they did back in vanilla.
---
Did all those things help the slow death of WoW? Maybe, but it was only a start, and nobody back then were talking about how casuals are ruining the game.
---
Just wanted to point that out.
---
**TL;DR:** World PvP was still a thing despite flying mounts, people still farmed and played the AH despite dailies and people still raided to get gear despite badges.
---
YOU DONT PAY MONEY FOR IT DO YOU?!?!
---
Hi all! 
---
I'm a completely new player to Wow (as in never played current or vanilla) but I'm super excited for classic's release. I'm hoping to find a guild that is okay with my lack of experience and won't mind a few nooby questions here and there if you allow me to tag along. I've done a lot of research but obviously I still have a lot to learn. I have played a few hours on pservers and have chosen a class based on the few levels of each I got to play.
---
Region: EU
---
Intended server: PvP
---
Intended Faction: Alliance
---
Intended Class: Hunter
---
Play times: 5pm-12am Weeknights, 1pm-?am Weekends.
---
Timezone: BST
---
I'd like to both raid and pvp, and will do my best to be a valuable member of a guild.
---
If I sound like a fit for your guild, please send me a message here on reddit.
---
It's insanely good at finding flag carriers in wsg. I absolutely hate that on my druid. Wish it wasnt usable on beasts. :/
---
Since when you can afford a bed?
---
Totems are group-wide, not raid-wide.  So having multiple shamans means you can buff multiple groups.
---
Use owls they are op. Nightelfs get one early but have to learn aoe spell from other tamed pet. Otherwise I think the next owl u can get is in felwood or so
---
I guess that’s really up to you as a person? I mean. I’m a father of two, work a 10hr a day job M-F. Kids go to bed at 9pm. I play from like 9-11:30pm each day.  On the weekends, I generally play from like 9pm-2am.
---
2.5hrs M-F and raid weekend nights was more than enough time. If you want to be more casual, then be more casual? I’m not understanding the argument here. Saying daily quests aren’t for people with jobs and families just means you weren’t making efficient use of your time in game. Nothing wrong with that, but the game is always as casual as you make it.
---
You're in the Classic WoW sub.
---
Everyone posting classic chernobyl memes is making this sub worth refreshing again.  They are such gold
---
It’s cute that people think we will be getting more than a permanent 1.12
---
Meeting stones aren't clickable if you are in a group at least (the cursor doesn't even change on a mouse over). The inn keepers Dialogue asks "Can you tell me about any dungeons I can explore?"  But to be honest, I haven't tested it...
---
That's fine but this is a subreddit for Classic, not BFA. You want /r/wow
---
Basically this, the more locks you have the more worthwhile a spriest is. But only one.
---
I feel like the best way is something similar. My thinking is this:
---
Say you have a quest that’s yellow, it ranges from level 12-17 before it turns green at 18. Theoretically, you’ll get the *most* exp out of it by turning it in at level 17. In order to maximize your return, get as close to leveling as possible (I’m talking kill a singular mob and ding close) and then turn in the quest.
---
I don’t know how the system works but assuming that it gives you the full quest reward at turn in and isn’t dynamically impacted by your current level, you’ll get the maximum reward for the quest and spend the majority of it on your following level. You only needed 100xp to get 18, at 17 the quest gives 12k but at 18 it drops to 9k, the turn in gave the 100xp so you hit 18 and now you have 11,900xp towards level 19 as opposed to if you killed that last mob and dinged before turning the quest in.
---
The biggest flaws in this thought are not researching and learning the quest levels, seeing if my information is as true as I **think** it is, and factoring in the series of quests you’d have in your log to turn in at once, as most hubs give multiple quests at a time so you’ll want to turn in the one that gives the biggest reward last OR the quest that turns green at level 18 first. It’s possible that some of the ones you picked up are still yellow at 18 and theoretically better to turn in after you dinged.
---
I know that, but to get talents to buff certain totems you have to give up raw healing output. Which is where the discussion comes up about class stacking groups with shamans specced to make the group stronger.
---
what program are u using
---
Yeah it's Real. I used "Remotr" app :p
---
And yes, I have an access to the official Classic beta :]
---
The concept of this thread kind of makes me feel like a Guild should be created entirely for second class specs to see how far into Vanilla they can get. Like, call it "The B Team" and ONLY bring specs considered to not work in Vanilla
---
it's not a matter of "if", but a matter of "when"
---
But also shorter due to rested.
---
Not sure if your being serious or trolling.
---
wow classic dont is world of warcraft?
---
no, however you can level gnomish, get your BoPs
---
drop engineering and level as goblin for your things that need to be refilled.
---
Succinct guide that provides 95% of relevant guide material. That other % being dispel on some fights.
---
You really shouldn't get nightfall on an enhancement shaman, they are by far the worst class for the job because they can only proc it from auto attacks (compared to warriors and hunters who can spam instant abilitys every global cooldown i.e every 1,5 sec). If you're gonna play a meme spec just go all out, no need in trying to sugarcoat it. Some guilds won't allow it, but a lot will, just go in and do your best and most people will be fine with having an enhancement shaman or two.
---
I am as much of a vanilla player and addict as any can be, but i have never been so hyped about anything game related as flying mounts in wow. Ill defend that decision through my entire existence. Still gives me tingles just remembering how i felt realising i will be able to fly dragons in the game...
---
Post On r/classicwow: What race to pick?
---
Literally everyone: OH BOY YOU BETTER PICK ORC BECAUSE THAT STUN RESIST BRUH YOU'RE GONNA GET SHIT ON BY ROGUES IF YOU DON'T ROLL ORC OMG WHY WOULD YOU EVEN PLAY ANYTHING ELSE WOW
---
OP: Oh but I want to play mage:  
---
Everyone: Who cares friend, just do what you think is cool, gl hf :)
---
It wasnt an add, it was the last boss, right? I remember doing that so many times i could do it in my sleep.
---
Yeah, but NElf generate less rage and therefore less TPS because of extra dodge
---
Yeah, if I wanted to pacify a bunch of RPers without actually having to do anything, I'd probably say something like that too.
---
She actually came back to beta after about an hour or so of retail. Basically did what anyone would do if they were being ganked over an over, she did something else for a while and came back when they were gone.
---
Tons of abilities that weren't tied to the GCD were put on it in BFA.  Like all those 1-3 minute DPS cooldowns that you'd activate to increase you damage for a period of time.  This affected every class to some extent.
---
[Start here.](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Undead+Holy+Lore)
---
It doesn't have to suck though. That's like saying console gaming will always suck because of the crash back in the 80s when people were making shit games as fast as they could put them out.
---
Mobile gaming isn't bad. The mobile market is what's awful. There are some legitimately really cool mobile games that aren't predetory or absolutely cancerous. It's just that the current state of the market is fucking trash.
---
Yeah you didn't need CC back in Vanilla, I remember it quite well still after all these years. You needed to burn down runners, you needed to interrupt some casts to make things easier, but there were never any pulls where you truly had to mark CC targets.
---
In raids though there were definitely trash packs where CC was necessary.
---
That style of very difficult 5 mans really only started in TBC, and holy fuck it was absolutely brutal at first in those Heroic level 70 dungeons...I loved it.
---
Even more though I loved the feeling of character progression that you got because of how hard they were. They were so difficult in fact that it was still enjoyable farming those Heroic 5s in Sunwell gear to get badges.
---
I will go so fucken hard. Half the reason I want Classic to do well is so they roll out a TBC server.
---
* Intended region: EU
---
* Intended raid/play times: GMT evenings for raids, I'm rather flexible, so any schedule except friday AND saturday in one week is fine. 
---
* Any priority you may have in a guild: Raiding guild, 2-3 nights a week. We can discuss loot and such other details after we establish contact. 
---
* Any pertinent rules: Only looking for tank/MT spots as a prot warrior. Have experience raiding, tanking, raid leading. Basically any raiding guild that doesn't already have 3+ confirmed, dedicated tanks. 
---
* A preferred form of contact: Reddit PM is fine to establish contact. Then we can take a conversation into discord.
---
Get on to me! I'm friendly.
---
I've tried to create pages in the past, I don't find it easy, even if there's a red link. Many games have pages even though they're not out yet, it's good publicity.
---
Retro has insanely bad LoS. Like 90% of what is LoSing on that server isn't LoSing in the beta. 
---
I think they shut down wsg and opened up ab so you will have to just use videos on the beta to test now.
---
"What when the tourists dont leave?"
---
Y'all getting trolled.
---
it's still standard on pservers at least, although it can be either mage or hunter
---
same here, I wont write down the names anywhere outta the same reason.
---
The stumps have los on some pservers and on some they don’t. I believe on beta they don’t count as los but it’s been a few days since wsg ended. Would probably be pretty easy to go back in the vods on a stream and check
---
&gt; Does PvE basically mean "I just don't want world PvP"?
---
More or less.
---
Nah I was planning on doing that anyway.
---
As much as I crap on 1.12 and the state of Classic, I still want it to do well - even if I don't play.  And i maintain that a large part of Classic's longevity is how it is accepted by Retail players.  The private server population will blow through content, sew their oats, then leave.  The retail players and casuals will take their time.  Even if this means Classic is played "on the side" while people play Retail, I think that's still a good thing.
---
*One single grain of sand falls from the hourglass.*
---
r/classicwow: THAT'S HOW IT STARTS, YOU ARE THE PROBLEM HOW DARE YOU WANT THINGS #nochanges #fuckstreamers
---
no god DAMN IT NO BURN IT
---
You've definitely heard wrong. Straight from the EULA:
---
&gt; C. Rules Related to Game Play. Game play is what World of Warcraft is all about, and Blizzard strictly enforces the rules that govern game play. Blizzard considers most conduct to be part of the Game, and not harassment, so player-killing the enemies of your race and/or alliance, including gravestone and/or corpse camping, is considered a part of the Game. Because the Game is a "player vs. player" game, you should always remember to protect yourself in areas where the members of hostile races can attack you, rather than contacting Blizzard's in-game customer service representatives for help when you have been killed by an enemy of your race.
---
if ur horde and a troll/orc leave the starting area once you hit lvl 3/4 ... boars outside at from lvl 4+ .... grind . get to zenjin and razor grab those quest that are just the go pick up stuff/ talk to so n so . if you have a group hit the keep with the bag quest ( rare spawn , a few chest and decent exp quest chain ) . grind and do the harpy quest chain asap . should be lvl 8 ish . the next 2 lvls are a grindy af but it will get out of the starting zone ahead of the curve ( pick up flight paths , trade skills in org )
---
It’s the uprising of people who can’t think for themselves and need asmongold to tell them what opinions to have.
---
Stam + healing = mobile unkillable flag carrier and point guard
---
Maybe what makes him happy is playing what's "needed or bis" 
---
Not everyone is a filthy casual that thinks winning means having fun.
---
Which BoPs exactly are we talking about? Considering if that's worth my time
---
both are solid choices go with the one u think is the most class, personally i'd choose rogue but thats up to you!
---
APES brings Hunters  into Naxx so you better don't worry.
---
That's actually a really cool addon
---
Because it has no cooldown, adds a combo point, and you recover its energy cost back during its duration.
---
It was a rhetorical question.
---
Aside from that - it will be fine. There won't be 24/7 ganking due to honor DR and decay.
---
These "the sky will fall" posts are are getting out of hand.
---
If you have no issue farming MCP on a weekly basis then sure go ahead and kitty deeps.  Otherwise, it is just not viable
---
I'm pretty sure most of that behavior emerged on vanilla private servers, and wasn't actually how it was when vanilla was live.
---
Hunter.
---
-easier and faster lvling
---
-less competition
---
-decently easy to gear
---
-good in pvp and pve
---
TBC got a lot right. People don’t like the flying mounts and raid size reduction though. SO many things were right tho, good story, class balance, steady content, worthwhile professions, talent trees were fantastic, etc.
---
My hope is that in time they maybe progress though additional content but with the classic mindset.
---
I plan on trying to avoid streamers. Not that I have a problem with them. If been lucky enough to play with quite a few in the beta and haven’t had any problems but not looking to play with them on launch. 
---
That’s not going to be as easy as most people think though. A lot of streamers are going to hide what server they are going to till launch day. Logistically with my group. After we pick a server and start leveling it would be hard to move us if we find out our server has all of Classic Cast on it as an example. I’ve got no issue with Esfand and those guys but at the same time our guild does not want to be on server with them. None of us want to compete with a devoted sperg army.
---
Yeah, no. Blizzard makes over half their revenue from microtransactions. Classic has none, Retail has thousands.
---
Exactly. The 1-10 zones will be terrible at launch, but once people get to a high enough level that some are running dungeons and some are focused on pvp it will get a lot better.
---
Even with a high pop, life can get a lot better after level 20.
---
And the alternative is that particular healer or tank not being online at all, so what's the difference?
---
So delusional lmao
---
Maybe I never saw a geared ret then, never had trouble with them. I wasn't a star mage either.
---
You coming back for classic?
---
[Have you heard of Waitmate?](https://youtu.be/Dbr7B1OVa0g)
---
I think there is a way to switch from one tree to the other without re-level. Also, I think there are some items that require you to currently have Gnomish.
---
Exactly. This is ideally how it should be too. There should be trade-off and pros/cons to each class. That's what makes a great fucking game!
---
Maybe we should make that a thing, only get dedicated players.
---
Tanks don't use Thunderclap. It doesn't do enough threat(battle shout does more threat), it costs too much rage (most people are tanking in arms), so you use it specificially for the AS slow, if needed. AoE tanking is a WotLK thing. You cycle mobs in Vanilla.
---
Regarding easiness, it's most likely just because people got better. Many private servers apparently buff some of their content, which also distorts perception, etc.
---
Youtube
---
do you pronounce that like cough,though,thought, or trough? 
---
in short: you're right
---
at that point, they are no longer tourists. they will assimilate, or they will die. resistance is futile.
---
What about seal of wisdom (if that’s what it was called)? 
---
I remember from a server a couple years back we would regen mana off bosses as a mage by wanding once we were through all of our sources.
---
1Str=2AP
---
1Agi=1AP + some crit
---
Both useful for either form, but I don't remember what was "optimal".
---
Give it some time...Once you are T2/PvP geared (and I am not talking R14 here), you are a monster.
---
By the end of Phase 2, a well geared Warrior will be AVOIDED by pretty much anyone, except good PVpers and ganking groups.
---
The first 3-4 months will be "How to avoid being a walking free honor?", while after that will be more like "Why is everyone avoiding me? I don't wanna kill them".
---
You're still going to get ganked, don't get me wrong...but FAR less.
---
Hunter is fastest leveling and easiest to solo content. Also great at farming gold. Sounds like a better choice for you.
---
I mean they have the assets from the other expansions (models, gear, textures, characters etc.) so they can reuse a lot of that
---
It depends entirely on your gear and the content you're fighting. Totem twisting is very mana intensive.
---
This is what ruined retail for me. In the last few expansions leveling feels like I'm just going through the motions, zooming through everything half blind usually watching netflix on a second screen. I couldn't even name 5 zones from the last 3 expansions, no clue what any of the towns or hubs are called etc..
---
In classic when you reached a new zone you knew you would be there for a little while so it was okay to get comfortable, set your hearth, scope out where the vendors or located etc.
---
So what is the optimal level mob to kill in terms of xp per hour? 1 level above, 1 level below, or same level? (I'm guessing it depends entirely on the mob due to a number of factors,  but seems worth asking)
---
6160 hp?
---
These aren't mage numbers.  In full PvP gear - including Rank 14 etc .. you had a little over 4k.    
---
Back in the day?  No way.
---
Hunter
---
So their servers will be able to handle 12k+ in one zone when the gates of AQ launch?
---
battle chicken, gnomish death ray, off the top of my head.
---
also the spell resist trinket
---
Herbalism vs Mining which will be more profitable at launch and thru the first few weeks?
---
Lmaooo exactly. 
---
If English wasn't my first language I never would've bothered it's actually a language designed to make people sound/look stupid like it's objectively so dumb
---
Thanks for learning me some math :) had a feeling this sub would contain some capable minds.
---
I know what stats page you're talking about. It includes every character ever made, even if they haven't logged on in years or never made it to 60. Not very useful.
---
its not that you hit like a noodle is that every other class ...just scales up like bonkers in naxx/aq40 gear . you will still be doing lots of dmg
---
auto repair weapon only :P
---
How's the lag if any? How much data does it use?
---
I actually dont, do you remember Kold?
---
Why did Thrall become Warchief?
---
Because Chuck Norris turned down the job first.
---
Honestly it’s not going to be fun, even on the beta leveling zones were getting fucked by 40s when ab ques weren’t popping. Phase 2 is gonna be bad to level in, I expect a lot of dungeon grinding because leveling out in the world is going to be incredibly hard.
---
Rogue was a lot better, hunter was easier and less common.
---
Corraling PvP into instanced arenas and battlegrounds is one of the many ways WoW turned into a hub-world for minigame activities. Furthermore, competitive PvP shifted the game's balance irreversibly, which manifested as, among other things, a reduction in the amount of fun items and effects.
---
MMORPG PvP needs to happen in the open world and doesn't need to strive for perfect balance. People who want competitive PvP or perfect balance are playing the wrong game: MOBAs exist to cater to them.
---
\#ThisIsntTwitter
---
I think a lot of retail players will play the game for some weeks and then stop, basically maybe 5 mil on release day and 1 mil on day 30 or something is what I expect, and then ppl will also fall off during content droughts ofc like you say
---
Bear LF EU Alliance guild. Ready to grind everything needed to make the spec work, provide competitive DPS when I'm not tanking, decurse on Chrom progression if needed, etc.
---
If your guild is short on dedicated and reliable tanks, message me and I'll be happy to discuss the details.
---
Maybe they just enjoy playing the game? :)
---
Is it a troll if we're all just a little confused, not annoyed?
---
It's a product designed for people with current technological capabilities, not people from villages
---
If you are going to be in a group, warrior.  If you are going solo, rogue.  With no other context, it's that simple.
---
No. WoW classic definitely don't is World of Warcraft.
---
There were plenty of ways to get gold in TBC without doing dailies. And there wasn't anything that happened if you missed a day
---
You think it will be that drastic? Just 20% of release numbers will stick around?
---
I played druid in vanilla, it’s a lot of fun. But what bothers me about them is their shit damage. I’ve been playing mage on a pvt server and I love blasting the shit out of everything. I think I’m gonna go mage in Classic first, with a druid alt down the line.
---
Bubble hearth still exists :)
---
She literally did log out for a while and came back, im factual.
---
If I were a product manager at Blizzard, I'd be thinking of ways to get WoW off a desktop computer at every opportunity, it's a 1990s model.  Nintendo Switch and **particularly iOS**/Android in particular - that's where the money and eyeballs are, and those devices have enough power to run it.
---
Holy shit dude ... wall of text crits for 10K damage! ;)
---
&gt; Then, I made a Mag'Har hunter. Are you fucking kidding me, they removed hunter's mark?!?
---
That's a Marksmanship only ability now and it only affects your damage, not the party's.
---
He’s prob get reported enough to get auto punished
---
Came here to say this. Still love that episode so much
---
Yeah no. IoQ badges + MGT were as good as BT.
---
like a gang, once you're in, you can't leave unless you're dead
---
Seeing the Orgrimmar gates for the first time.
---
It's pronounced so it rhymes with 'out'
---
I don't understand why though. Vanilla already happened. Why compete over the same race a second time instead of just doing something different since we have all been there before?
---
We min maxed to be the legit first ones when it WAS first. We did it to keep up with content. Now? There will be no end. Unless Blizzard kills wow servers you have as long as you want to finish Vanilla. Might as well enjoy it.

The servers are vastly superior to what they had 14-15years ago, so I’d say Yes. 
---
The biggest thing phasing will assist with, is the early leveling process, and avoiding issues with every hunting the same NPCs
---
Ah yes, thank you. As the hunter you kited the boss while the rest of the group kills the adds.
---
Yes, they are keeping everything even bugs and exploits.
---
I played every expansion BC to pandaria and I can’t wait to try classic
---
Game's 15 years old, everything is already theorycrafted to death and people have tried the spec countless times. It's hot garbage. You're not going to "prove" anyone "wrong".
---
4 strength 4 stam leather belt!
---
That's actually pretty accurate.
---
Faster leveling will be a massive help!

Its the definition i gave, not yours. You are trying to claim that it doesnt imply the other person is bad, wich it does. Just stop, this is embarrassing.
---
It's a running theme about everything in the whole fkn world dude :D
---
what the hell?  why did you close my thread.  it wasnt spam.  go do something productive
---
I guess we don't need the term "poopsock" anymore. What a time to be alive. Truly.
---
Nah it should be a bit faster, at least for mc and bwl phases, I do think a lot of semi-hardcore and casual raiding guilds struggling in AQ40 and NAXX though, even this time around as good as ppl have become. 
---
But the major thing with classic, is that there's no TBC on the immediate horizon, so if given enough time even the most casual of guilds will get a chance to farm naxx. Where as even some hardcore guilds fell apart in vanilla retail because ppl couldn't be arsed to grind naxx with tbc coming out in 3 months..
---
Thats what alts are for. I need that main up there for gold
---
Dont tell me what to do, pleb!
---
ok, wow classic is league of legends
---
Was enrage timers something you found in classic? Didn't join until tbc so don't know
---
I don't think any of that is true.
---
Players needed them in TBC to get to Tempest Keep, do Netherwing Dailies, get to Skettis and get to the elemental plateau.  Players needed them in WotLK to get to Ulduar and it's 5-mans, and to navigate Icecrown.
---
Easier access to 280% flying was more a fault of the economy exploding than anything else.  But they did that a lot in WotLK - had things explode far higher than they should.  Gear was another example - because there were 4 tiers of raids instead of 3, and because you had multiple difficulties leading to gear scaling higher per tier, gear got way out of hand, to the point you had people ignoring haste because they were past the GCD, and some people would crit more often than not.
---
If you go by levels, sure. But not if you go by how long it takes. 1-20 on classic is faster than 55-60.
---
Sounds good man good luck.
---
Before this goes off the rails, my intention wasn't for deciding a class based off population. The current Classic Beta meta is just wild and I want to know if this is an alliance/horde thing or something else. There's always a high demand for dps vs tanks/heals. Tanking with a 2h weapon is the norm, and aoe runs are pretty common that will only bring mages/warlocks for dps.
---
Because you can be successful with the 700, and winning is binary. 
---
Maybe you don't want to play the 1k dps class? If you can still win with 700dps, then who cares? You win SLOWER but so what.
---
Every class has upsides and downsides. Locks have some fun spells, but enjoy farming soul shards everywhere always. Also their raid dmg is bottom tier until AQ / Naxx
---
I never hit rank 14 but played with a lot of folks who did in vanilla (made it to rank 10). This was definitely happening some number of months (maybe years, can't recall exactly) in vanilla itself. I ended up ranking up a paladin and saw the same types of things.
---
I distinctly remember a guy who didn't want to "wait in the queue" for his rank 14. He made it to rank 12 before the rankers realized he was not following the "rules" and CRUSHED him with honor week after week. I think he had to move servers to actually get to 14.
---
Why did you have your mount bound to 1? Lol
---
Classic will be very similar or near exact to vanilla. The game isnt really changing only the gamer culture of the players.
---
Thanks for identifying yourself. Now I will never waste a moment of my life reading the crap you post. Block incoming...
---
LOL @ Innervate on the warlock just before he dies.  Great clip though - brings back memories of my own like this.
---
&gt;In TBC, what did you lose out on if you skipped a day or two?  You were a couple days later finishing a reputation grind or you missed out on some gold.
---
A couple of days per week can make quite a difference if you consider the amount of time it took to farm full Exalted rep. The issue really is that Blizz took control on how fast I could achieve something. Thus I was 'working' on their terms, on their schedule ... Now I understand why they gated it this way - so the progress would be evened out for the dedicated vs. casual players. Otherwise the first could have rushed it in a couple of days, while the latter would be left behind. However it is this loss of control over how I would need to spend my game time that would turn out to be unacceptable for me.
---
Gold was never an issue for me - this could always be made in various ways. Although the dailies were VERY generous, so it made sense to do them for that as well, as they were very cost effective.
---
Yep. This is why I encourage people to try tanking in Classic...even if I will do the same. The more of us, the better, because I know how my chat will look the second I log in game...
---
More tanks, less "Hey man ! Please come and tank "insert dugeon name" for us !"
---
Can you make it to late stage AQ40 or Naxx? Probably not, but you’ll have crafting, PvP, wPvP, Trading on AH, leveling alts, MC, Ony, BWL, AQ20, UBRS, etc. to keep you busy.
---
There’s plenty of do in the game if you can’t reach the final two instances. Also, the content won’t be rushed this time. Hopefully we’ll have 3 years before they implement TBC or new raiding instances.
---
Is there a way to do this from mac to iPhone?
---
Your post only proofs my point. 
---
Dailys force you to do what you did, to log in daily. If I do not want to do that or can't do that, I will not have any other way to get what I want in a reasonable time or at all, like the dragon mount. 
---
I could get what I wanted in Vanilla, without having to log in daily. That was taken away by Blizzard. And no I don't think it is healthy or a thing I want to do, spending all my evenings with gaming and even only with one game. I do have friends, play music, go out with my partner and friends etc. and all of that was just fine with Vanilla. Being casual only meant that I could not see Naxxramas or be in a high level raid guild. 
---
In BC I could also not raid, but I also was left out with a lot of other things that I could not or only very late get, like mounts, pets, a nice fishing rod or just the best ammunition for my hunter.
---
Yes if I want I can spend all my evenings with Wow, but there is no reason to make it this way when they could just allow me to do what you did on every day, in one day when I have the time for it and like to do it.
---
I am not going to let a game developer decide when I have to play the game, I rather quit, which I did and many with me. Now I am much older and even more will not log in daily, but have my two evenings a week online with friends and I will get that Winterspring saber again, like I did last time and I will quit again if TBC comes along and does the same change and tries to take over all my evenings. 
---
To make it clear: I did not mind putting in hours of grinding for something, I mind the game forcing me to do it daily for no reason, when it would work just fine on my terms.
---
Ya think ? :D
---
I'm pretty sure my role in my first MC clear as shaman way back in the day was... OOC res. I had to keep my character out of combat the entire boss so I could cast resurrection. It wasn't glorious but young me had a fine time.
---
I played a human Paladin in vanilla... I shall do the same in classic so nobody bothers me and I can be utterly useless by myself.
---
It can be an exact copy and it is not.. And it still wound't be the same. 
---
I think the game should be made harder. It needs to be bittersweet not just a time sink.
---
Maybe Retail is technically more difficult. Relative it is obviously a whole lot easyer 
---
I never said hardcore equals skill
---
I think you’re right in the practical sense. I just also think you don’t have to be a complete asshole about it. 
---
“This subreddit man” -  toxic little fucks like you are part of this sub’s problem.
---
Lineage scuffs at runescape
---
Bears generate far more rage per swing of their own attacks than warriors do.  You still don’t want 100% uptime of shields on them by any stretch but it’s not as detrimental to them overall.
---
I think so, but sometimes I'm not sure which memories are from vanilla and which are from pservers. It's been like 13 years since I played vanilla so my memories may be clouded
---
I plan on forming a raiding guild with about a dozen of my long-time WoW friends. We have debated the merits of DKP, loot council and other systems like Suicide Kings for weeks now, but we've decided to go with loot council. Your concerns line up pretty closely with ours.
---
Speed - Loot council can take a lot longer than other systems, but it also has the potential to move faster than DKP bidding. The key to keeping it moving quickly is having all of the information that you need to make a decision available in an easy-to-review format that the council can review together. We are using a shared Google Sheet to track attendance, loot history, and other factors like guild bank contributions. While it can be slow to pass out loot, it can also be faster than you might expect. Sometimes you will know who will be awarded an item before it ever drops.
---
Fairness - I'd say that this is the most common problem with loot councils, or at least the one that most people will complain about. Fighting corruption and maintaining your guild's trust in the system is going to be your job as the GM. I'm not sure what your "metric for fairness" is, but we are using many. Time in guild, sign up rate, total attendance, no shows, loot received, average loot per raid, and loot received recently are metrics we track. We also consider relative upgrade (who needs it most?) and less tangible things like player attitude and social contributions. With all of that information to review, having a nice dashboard to pull it all together and let you filter down to just the raiders who want a particular piece is really helpful. The purpose of all of this is to be able to explain to anyone, in very clear terms, why a particular person was chosen over another for a piece of loot. The spreadsheet is public to view so that any member can check his or her attendance record or loot history and compare it to anyone else. Also, having a rotation of raiders participating on the council, as you said, makes the process more transparent and helps to build trust.
---
Ease of Use - I think that this is the real trade-off when you choose loot council over another system. Loot council is the most work of any system to set up and execute, and it requires the right group of people to make it work. You will need to track a lot of information if you don't want your guild pulling at the threads of your decision-making logic. You need officers that can help you manage this, and you need a guild that trusts you. In our guild, you aren't an officer unless you have a meaningful job in the guild, and all officers are expected to be able to speak to their respective areas.
---
Raid Leader 1 - Responsible for strategic planning, recruiting and attendance
---
Raid Leader 2 - Responsible for raid tactics and player performance
---
Banker - Tracks guild bank deposits and withdrawals
---
Loot Master - Runs the council and tracks loot distribution
---
Here's our process:										
---
1. Whenever BoP loot drops, the council members all move into a private voice channel.									
---
2. In a raid warning, the Loot Master posts the item and tells all interested players to link the item that they would be replacing in raid chat.									
---
3. The council quickly reviews each player's attendance and loot history on the guild information dashboard (spreadsheet).									
---
4. The Loot Master indicates the relative upgrade that the item represents to each player.									
---
5. The Banker details each player's relative contributions to the guild bank.									
---
6. The council then briefly discusses raid team needs and contributions that each player has made to the guild.									
---
7. All council members, except for the Loot Master, vote by entering a name in the loot council text channel.									
---
8. In the event of a tie, the Loot Master casts the deciding vote.									
---
9. The winner is noted and the process is repeated for each piece of loot.									
---
10. Winners are announced together and congratulated once all loot council members are back in the main voice channel.									
---
tl;dr: Loot council is a great system if you put in the work, and a pretty terrible one if you don't. If your priority is ease of use, another system is probably better. If you want the fairest possible system, that's subjective and depends on how you run it and the mentality of players in your guild.
---
To add to this, horde aren’t the bad guys, it’s all a matter of perspective!
---
Not what I'm saying at all. Regardless of any mental block that people have, whether it be drug addiction, social anxiety, depression, etc. the only thing that truly "solves" the problem is willpower and self actualization. Other people won't be able to make the person not-anxious/depressed/whatever. If you don't know how to do something and are nervous about trying it, just try it. Otherwise you'll spend all your time thinking about how you'll mess it up without even trying.
---
It is pretty low, but if u gots the time you could just yeet the satyrs in Felwood, ez but kinda slow farm
---
Sweet summer child.  I was once in an AV that last 3 days.
---
Wich of the melee classes isnt insane with hand of rag :D
---
Or a couple, and then they can merge some of the low pop servers, problem solved.
---
or EQ - oh you died??? let me take a big chunk of XP from you. Oh wait, you just dinged? well guess what, you got deleveled.
---
I think I just had a brain aneurysm trying to read that
---
There were like 8million people subscribed during Vanilla.
---
What are you talking about?
---
WoW has always been pay to win, it was just risky because gold selling was against the EULA. In April 2015, Blizzard released the WoW Token to combat illegal gold sellers. It's essentially a $15 Battle.NET gift card that costs $20 but can be traded in-game and on the auction house. Currently a WoW token is worth about 125,000 gold in the US.
---
But Blizzard also has countless numbers of cosmetic exclusives behind microtransactions. These began in the pre-TBC Vanilla patch with the Trading Card Game exclusives.
---
What are you even going on about. Your thought process is so jumbled.
---
Hey man give us a consideration.
---
&lt;Lok'Tar Ogar&gt; - Semi-Hardcore
---
This is the purpose of layering and why once your in a layer you stay there for the most part even when relogging. Say a server ends up having 3 capped layers when layering goes away they become they're own servers.
---
Have they published how keys are given out? Is it just completely random? How often are they sent? 
---
Anyone shed some light on this?
---
lol are u rolling a warrior ?
---
unless you're a priest w/ spirit tap and a good wand :D
---
Raids took 20 hours if you played with a bunch of baddies.  I was pretty sad when I hit 60 on my druid and there was only one good spec.  Went feral for MC farm though.
---
Beautiful.
---
no guild bank in classic
---
It affects druids but because they generate a smoother flow from their own attacks than warriors do they don’t see as bad a decline as warriors will.  It’s still not good to pre-pull shield but you can use them more liberally throughout the fight, especially if the Druid is using MCP.
---
You need to be out of combat to use shadowmeld so it’s not really viable to meld things like coil or pyro.
---
"Classic isn't vanilla if it's the same we should change it so that way it's really vanilla!"  -this guy
---
I was hoping for this version:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oJ09dboUTk
---
&gt; by re-targeting and re-casting with seemingly no maximum range. 
---
I believe the Shaman's Far Sight ability works the same way.
---
Healing gear isn’t gonna do anything for your dps tho
---
Unless you have a raid force behind you this is fake
---
Carrion bird, it's a tankier owl with screech and actually have some choices around which ones you get.
---
other than lock/hunter - druid will require to still melee to keep mob from de-aggroing.
---
Priest has to do the same - dot and occasionally melee to prevent from de-aggro
---
You can't use it in combat. 
---
Racial skills in vanilla were extremely negligible except for:
---
* Dwarf Priests Fear Ward  
---
* Undead Will of the Forsaken  
---
Gnome's Escape Artist was pretty good in PvP, too.
---
&gt;MAIN . . . Druid (Resto)
---
Decide whether you think Tauren or Night Elf is cooler and then you'll have your answer.
---
Playing on a phone is probably the closest thing to the original classic experience.  We were all playing on potato pcs back then, clicking abilities, keyboard turning, terrible fps and ping.  Hell a phone is probably a better experience.
---
No warlock in the group, he's got to run from Orgrimmar.
---
And all gear is hunter gear, easiest class to gear up
---
The clothier hunters are pretty dangerous is I remember correctly
---
true, but you still like it and want it
---
No, you’ll get invited to WSG to run flags. Nobody wants druids for AB, dunno about AV.
---
1% isnt that big but you have the highest Agility gain of all the races, More agility = more crit so i would rather have the more agility than the 5 weapon skill because you get locked early to certain weapons. VS a Nelf can use any weapon and the axe is amazing TPS until you get TF. Honestly the only couple items outdo it and its trash dagger from naxx and pugio off hand.
---
Well, I'm not soo keen to let your friend be a ganker.
---
With that said: he should choose whatever he wants, but from my personal experience rogue is more fun to level up. So I voted for rogues - even if it means I'll have to regret it...
---
I remember 4-6hrs for a single run of Shadowfang Keep, wiping several times in the process, dropping half the party to disconnects, waiting at the summoning stone for an eternity. Haven't played in years but I could get back on board for a bit if they bring officially bring it back.
---
Interesting. I just assumed I'd want voidwalker for the damage reduction
---
I think we should keep her essence and experiance. And in order to keep it, changes might needed to be made. If this concept to complicated for you. I would recommend to read my words more carefully
---
Unless your guild will go for a very specific comp (which won't happen esp when people inevitably start min maxing) you'll be a heal bot with mana spring/tide totem in healer group or windfury totem in melee group.
---
Yeah I'm in the same boat as you. As everyone said, hunter is easier for leveling but rogue tends to be better dps at max level. Whatever you find most enjoyable out of that is what I'd lean towards. I vary each week but right now I'm leaning more towards rogue
---
Raid damage doesn't matter nearly as much as the entire roster showing up to raid and knowing the simple mechanics.
---
I worded it wrong.   Was the guy saying I'll get invited to raids and handed loot just so I can pvp flag carry for them.  I didn't really understand what he meant.
---
I don't get it, I agree with you, then you disagree with me? The economy had nothing to do with ease of access to flying mounts. 280% cost 6K in TBC. it cost 1K in WoTLK. That's not an economy thing... Blizzard opted to make access easier to full speed flying because they felt players would either revolt at another gold grind for 280% or they felt that players needed flying mounts with max speed. I think it was because they felt players "needed" them because of how they designed WoTLK (and subsequent content after). In BC, you didn't need a flying mount, let alone a 280%. I mentioned in another post in this thread that there were only 4 or 5 places that you needed a flying mount to access and they were inconsequential if you couldn't access them. You've pointed out 4 of them, the only other place I could think of was the area where the cobrascale farm was.
---
How about the ones wearing grey mail items until lvl 20+ because they think that is better than a green leather with actual stats.
---
You do realize that raid tanks are rage capped and heroic strike is on next swing right? You do both. That being said, sunder is still better TPS, which is relevant when you aren't rage capped.
---
God this looks awfulllllll
---
Doing this is so tempting lol
---
Isnt he high?
---
All that "need to get to X" stuff could have been solved with flight paths, or pseudo-flight paths (like Paku's totems in BFA) instead of flying mounts.
---
Here you go:

 [HOW TO CHANGE](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Book_%22Soothsaying_for_Dummies%22)
---
clicker smh
---
So it isn't worth it to get the Elements set?
---
"The only way to make something the same is to make it different" -still this guy
---
yea that's all interesting and would be even more interesting if they went with original idea of only 500 people per server  
---
but the less people the more issues in other areas arise, such as finding people to group up
---
&gt;I think aggro feels off in the beta
---
Didn't you just up above say you were not even in beta?
---
So would I only be able to maintain threat on about 1-2 mobs or not at all? Even if I just spammed searing pain? I understand what you mean though. It could be done but would be slow and inefficient
---
Aah they drop felcloth and runecloth too so you can make some change while at it I guess.
---
You aren't alone in the hype. I've planned my main and my first two alts already. I have a leveling path decided and I know how I'll spend each talent point at each level. I noted all major gear upgrades to grab on my way up to 60 and I have my pre-raid BiS lists drawn up. 
---
On top of that, I'm planning to start a raiding guild with about a dozen friends that are returning to the game for Classic. I've dumped hours and hours into guild planning spreadsheets, figuring out which officer roles we need, setting up loot council rules, and brainstorming recruiting strategies.
---
Why couldn't Blizzard just have waited to tell us until 30 days out?!
---
The playerbase is mostly at fault for what WoW is today. Blizzard gave people what they wanted. Didn't help that Blizzard also tried to reinvent the wheel every expansion after a certain point.
---
I don't understand why these posts are popping up on this subreddit recently, but if this is something against QoL again maybe everyone needs to look up what QoL actually means in a video game. Quality of life additions aren't anything like adding flying or dailies, they're like being able to mail more than one thing at a time or better auction house functionality. Add-ons are another example of QoL, albeit community made QoL, like bagnon or bartender for example.
---
I don't really understand the hate towards badge gear in this post either, that gear was still lesser than raid gear all throughout the expansion and you still had to put in time and work to get it since TBC heroics were tough. Pretty sure it was designed to just be bad luck protection/to help people gear for their first foray into raids where they can get actual good gear.
---
I'm surprised people don't complain about PvP gear since it was essentially easier to get than badge gear and had decent stats for pve apart from resilience.
---
Is this the fourth time you've posted this? Lmao. It's not going to change anyone's mind, and it's really just sad. Please stop.
---
Just grind dungeons and stay in the less populated zones. But yea, itll be a mess trying to not get ganked.
---
&gt; I reaally hope they don't make the mistake of resetting servers or releasing TBC again too soon again this time.
---
Indeed.
---
BGs are a great way to experience PvP without getting constantly ganked and corpse camped by a max level dick who has nothing better to do than kill low levels.  I'm just hoping they reimplement the dishonor system as well to discourage killing low people
---
What's the motivation to discourage locks? I think it's just because they feel it's more optimal
---
Rogue
---
right there with you.  i love being a priest, but mainly because i don't trust others to heal correctly.
---
Like the other guy said, they only have one shitty taunt which just isn't enough to hold aggro. 
---
The Imp passive will give everyone in your group a decent bit of extra health, though.
---
The succubus can chain seduce extra mobs to keep them CC'd, also, although Polymorph &amp; Sap are better.
---
Thats not true
---
God damn... so brave
---
There was a time at the start of Cataclysm when 5 mans were the hardest they had been since vanilla. CC once again was near mandatory on a number of pulls- and then people complained until Blizzard nerfed a lot of that content. Boo.
---
Then you’ve played with terrible ferals. I’ve seen ferals top the damage charts on Kel’Thuzad.
---
I'm way more interested in the future that Classic might provide than Classic itself, tbh. Because while I am hyped for Classic, I personally, am not really that interested in just redoing content I've already done.
---
So I hope this is a wakeup call to Retail WoW, or that Classic, instead of just releasing TBC next, they start developing new content for Classic.
---
That's why he said on a hunter my dude, you can fd out of combat.
---
Man...you are living in la-la land.
---
Pretty much everything you said is wrong.
---
Simply because all your "tips" come from private servers, which aren't overtunned...but undertunned. I am so sad that many people will roll Druids for tanking, basing their choice on private server stupidity.
---
The bosses in private servers had only ONE thing overtunned : armor. But, SS, FF and Annihilator debuffs were enough to make that armor , overtunned as it was, drop close to ZERO.
---
However, 5.6% parry vs 14% parry is a 250% discrepancy. I wonder how much they fucked up on resistances.
---
Anyway, only the 14% parry makes Druids absolutely undesirable in raids. A lot of people don't understand why...but they will.
---
I already explained, at large, what 14% parry means for tanks. 
---
There will be only a SINGLE raid tank : Protection Warrior. No Fury Warriors, no Druids. Just like it was in Vanilla.
---
Classic will be on WoW Progress, and we will all see what tanks will be used for raids.
---
Sometimes, I think the only main reason I wait for Classic WoW is no longer for the game, but to see if I was stupid, or if the others were.
---
I guess we won't have to wait for long.
---
You're among those 5 kids I guess
---
Add shadow priests to the list. The constrast between my warrior and priest on the beta is painful.
---
That doesn’t account for mega servers though. Let’s say a massive streamer/youtuber like Markiplier decides to play and keep playing. The server with someone like that could have a very large player base. 
---
Also Vanilla created consistent growth all the way through Wrath with no real drop off.
---
Unless I just suck ass, I took on one of the lvl 19 elite ogres in LM with my 20 Pally and even using l my cooldowns and pots I got him to just below 50% health. Those things kill you in like 4-5 hits
---
**Looking for:**
---
* off-hours raiding guild
---
* 10am-4pm EST ^(7am-1pm PST)

* 2am-6am EST ^(11pm-3am PST)
---
* 2-3 day/week
---
* NA Horde PvP
---
* High-Population Realm
---
**About me:**
---
* Raider since vanilla
---
* HotW Druid for first 2 tiers, deep resto or feral OT for 2.5-3
---
* Reliable, reasonably skilled, relatively mature
---
* Nothing better to do than play WoW all winter

K
---
Considering every servers devilsaur will be camprd by some kind of shitty mafia.
---
Yeah
---
Classic was only hard because nobody knew what they were doing.. i welcome the return so we can do it all again
---
Yeah, fight cancer with cancer. I'm sure it wont turn into a massive tumor that'll need to be excised.
---
You're forgetting that Orc +25% passive stun resist, the most overpowered PVP racial in the game.
---
I listed that.
---
When/if they release TBC, I’m out of classic. Dual spec and class balance, better raids, guild banks, arena PvP, I’m there for it. World PvP wasn’t the same since battlegrounds launched anyways, and that’s in classic. The things I don’t like about TBC, flying and Azeroth being relatively insignificant , were small prices to pay for the improvements in TBC. 
---
Until then, I’ll be happy enough playing classic.
---
Oh boy... i like this game :-)
---
I expect huge initial numbers and then those numbers to dip A LOT. There will be tons of retail folks who will not like classic at all.
---
In actual Vanilla it was the same power difference.  Mess with the wrong person on either faction could easily result in being camped for weeks or blacklisted for same faction activities.  Obviously not any random guild has this type of pull but there are always 10 or so each server with the most influence/gold/gear to do whatever they wanted.  You gotta keep in mind that even if you upset one person they may literally have alliances/raid partnerships with the next 3 big guilds, or even opposite faction friends and guilds that specifically will grief the big guild’s competition.  
---
If servers had unlimited space I might agree with you but it really is a very comparable situation.
---
So?
---
WoW on Switch would be great but it would kill your battery so quickly.
---
Any thoughts on the rogue class in particular?
---
Ah right I see. Thanks for the information. Is the 10% damage reduction through master demonlogist talent a possibility through voidwalker? In my head it would be the warlock maintaing the threat not the pet if that makes sense?
---
Looking for guild/friends to play with - NA PVP server/CST/Horde
---
I'm a pretty casual player who hasn't played in years. I grew up playing Vanilla and played TBC, but quit after that and haven't really been back since. I did some light raiding when I played, but honestly don't have a lot of experience raiding, and I'll probably be playing new classes than I did when I first played. Goal is to find some people to level up with and do some raiding with at a casual pace.
---
Probably going to roll mage/warrior/priest in that order. PM or reply if you're looking for someone to level with or you're a guild that's going to be open to having more casual members!
---
Releasing TBC “too soon” is what gives vanilla Naxx it’s enigmatic status. If Naxx was out for over a year and every guild had it on farm, it wouldn’t be nearly as exciting. Especially this time around, since we know what to expect, so being able to clear Naxx should only o to people who prepare for it. If anyone could clear it, it wouldn’t be special.
---
guess someone should have told you about condoms
---
Stop! Please...
---
Tauren do have bigger melee distance on beta
---
Yes, the book was in Vanilla and it will be in Classic. /u/pastagains is incorrect.
---
If you have flask recipes then yes, you can take orders. If you have a friend with herbalism (or an alt, druid best) and you can make a company then yes. If you like to fish then for PvP and money you can make Free Action Potions as well as other fishing products if demand is there (greater firepower potion later on). Also it cut costs when you make your own pots where one ingredient you farmed from mobs (and can't be gathered) like greater fire and nature protection potions.
---
I think it will be super hyped at launch that already will inflate its numbers. Keep in mind people that already pay for retail get it for free to try out.
---
Then a ton of people will realize the game just isn't for them, too slow paced leveling and such. I think most ppl who makes it to 40 will probably stick around to some degree, but tons of people wont make it that high. 
---
The first 20-30 levels are rough even for a pserver vet like myself, who has leveled like 7 lvl 60s and multiple 30+. I like the journey a lot still, else I wouldn't do it, but those first 20 levels man :P
---
Knowing how to use cleanse in vanilla got me promoted to member after one raid with the top Guild on my server. Secondary was being low on overheating with a decent hps.
---
He's using a new account every time. So you would assume the other accounts he used are banned?
---
Someone exactly said it's wrong to use sunder to generate more threat. Did you even read the comments?
---
Being able to play Diablo 3 on my Switch while taking a dump is a godsend. If I could do the same with WoW? I'd never leave the toilet.
---
Honestly you don't even need T2 gear. I was beating (barely lol, my favorite was executing the R14 warrior who's deep wound got me at the end) full T2 and R9 gear on my blue/t1 geared warrior. This game (classic) really shows how important skill is. Warriors have some of the best catalogues of defensive abilities to take on everyone.
---
You are toxic yourself, saying the pserver players are nerds.
---
messaged!
---
Might be the embodiment of classic but definitely not the best class. Really not.
---
I mean this calculation assumes you’re constantly around mobs at your level. It doesn’t account for travel time between zones as you level, mob respawn time if other players are around, dying, etc. 
---
If you were leveling ONLY through this method I imagine it would take double the time, or 10ish days. Still not as bad as other games like you mentioned, but a commitment nonetheless
---
I am unsympathetic to your crying is all. Back in vanilla if you couldn't handle it you rolled on a PVE server
---
The community is what vanilla/classic is all about. Not the raids or difficulty. Wow is difficult because it's a long long grind.
---
After a couple weeks when kids discover that ret pally is not viable. When they don't get the instant gratification they get with daily quests and free epics.  The community will be older and less toxic.
---
The best method is killing every mob you come across while traveling to and from quest objectives.
---
Huh. It's been a long ass time, but I honestly don't remember ever having remember having problems with this and/or anyone complaining about it.
---
I subbed for the beta (I’m a sucker) and I decided to make a character. I was 2 shotting everything and everyone else was in this epic gear or getting rides around in a fuckin butler bike. I couldn’t believe it got so bad
---
You dont understand how a market works
---
&gt; Fuck you and fuck your stupid assumptions
---
lol we get it, you like asmongold. calm the fuk down
---
Hahaha, yes lets slap Activision Blizzard in the face by paying them money to play a game they created!
---
You may not have realized this yet, but different people like different things, and that's okay. Blizzard realized this and decided to shift some resources to Classic so they can regain some users that like the older style game for minimal effort. You aren't slapping anybody in the face. You are giving Blizzard more money because they chose to do something as an acknowledgement that not everyone likes the direction retail is going. In fact, by giving them your money for classic you are supporting them further embracing the changes you hate so much.
---
Drops the F bomb 8 times and calls you toxic..
---
&gt; So would I only be able to maintain threat on about 1-2 mobs or not at all?   
---
You could maintain threat on an entire group, but it takes time to build threat and your DPSers have to sit afk while you do so. The more mobs you hold the longer it takes.    
---
The Voidwalker has no AoE threat, so they have to keep switching but doing so will leave their main target low on threat allowing DPS to pull it.     
---
But yeah, basically it is something that CAN be done, but you'll rarely WANT to do due to the inherent lack of threat generation. Searing Pain helps but only on one target at a time.
---
Just had it confirmed by tribe that they’re not los
---
See me in durotar kid.
---
Outside of Corruption if you’re SM/Ruin and Curse of Agony/Doom if you’re the 4th warlock, locks don’t use dots. 
---
Siphon Life is a waste of a GCD and a waste of a debuff slot. Ditto for Immolate.
---
No he isn't, it's the same account, he just keeps deleting the old threads when they receive enough downvotes.
---
backs slowly out of thread...
---
Yeah thats right. And I agree on this. I however am of the opinion that In order to preserve the authentic experiance we can make it a little harder
---
Ok snowflake
---
No one cares about your situation, that's all on you. Kindly fuck off now
---
Love to but it's not the best for leveling and it's not the best for pve. So it can't be the best class in classic. By definition it's not
---
Why you think I care. You only hear your own echo anyway
---
It’s sad I know exactly where this is and I know exactly what you’re talking about 😱

bait

I mean, it doesn’t really prove your point. Again, the game is as casual as you make it. You aren’t forced to do dailies. It’s a choice of whether or not you want to do them. If you don’t want to put in the time to raid, farm reputation or mats, then don’t. It’s that simple. Blizzard gave you the option, you aren’t forced to do any of it.
---
The dragon mount wasn’t better than the other mounts. You weren’t forced to farm for a skin, so to speak.
---
Classic will be just as time consuming. Slower leveling, material farming. Also, raiding in Classic wasn’t quick either. I think my guild did like 5-6 raids a week. It’s not like live/retail where only the one is relevant. T2 dropped from last boss MC, Ony and BWL. ZG was good for enchants and some BiS weapons early on. Then AQ’s and Naxx. 
---
If you want a super casual game, try Guild Wars 2. Not an insult, but when I take a break from WoW, Guild Wars is a nice casual play.
---
It sounds like you view clearing content like the moon landing. There was a race, someone won, and that race can never be won again. There will never be another first time.
---
I think that the people who are really excited to race through the content see it more like a normal, earth-bound, competitive event that can be repeated. Just because someone won the 100 meter dash in the Olympics the last time, doesn't mean competitors won't be lined up for the next time. 
---
There are people who like to win, there are people who just like to finish, and there are people who enjoy the experience of competing, regardless of the outcomes.
---
I chose not to vote because both are very good at both PvP and pve, warriors are better at pve imo and struggle against the likes of mages and such in PvP , while rogue do better in PvP and are still top 3 in pve , a BiS rogue is slightly below a BiS warr

Night elf warrior, I remember dying in the furbolg dens in teldrassil for hours with another warrior named Ninjabob. Never forgot ninjabob
---
yes and no, its still just a passive %. so no reliable way to base a playstyle around it since its random
---
Druids are still great for healing or tanking dungeons, making it much easier to get pre-raid BiS for your guild.  Druids are also the least represented class at 60, and every raid will bring 2-3 druids for decursing and innervates.  So playing a druid means you can get an easy raid slot, and there is little to no competition for tier gear.
---
See me in durotar at 60 before you with me at the top of the heal meters kid.
---
I've been personally banning these clowns. This guy is getting banned now, too.
---
Cross realm BGs will be used. So not much wait time.
---
probably this, lol

&lt;No Plan Required&gt; is an EU Alliance guild that intends to roll on a PvP server. If you're looking for a relaxed raiding environment with a pinch of competition involved, or a social enclave to hide from your severe depression, then you've hit the jackpot.
---
What to expect
---
The main idea of the guild is to create a community where casual players and hardcore players can co-exist and succeed - but the utmost importance is that we all have fun doing it. We hope to establish an atmosphere where the raiders will not miss out on the end-game experience and have the opportunity to show their capabilities. This means that all members who wish to raid are expected to arrive fully prepared and according to the schedule. We will be progression raiding 2 nights a week, and additional nights may come into play after launch. Unorthodox specs such are allowed, but are expected to work as hard as they can to retain the respective balance of participation in our raiding core.
---
We often hang out and socialise while we wait for classic launch. Additionally, we host our own vanilla server for us to jump on, test some things and have some fun every now and then.
---
We are currently accepting raid leader applications!
---
Raid dates: Thursday &amp; Tuesday
---
Raid times: 7:50 PM GMT

No. This is not at all how layering works. When servers hit cap it creates a fresh linked server layer. If you log off you will be put into one of the layers. But it might be a different layer then you were just on.  
---
Layers try to keep guild mates on the same layers.  If you join a group with someone on your server but not on their layer it will move you to their layer. 
---
So when they remove layering in phase 2 all of those players on that server will be on 1 server.
---
WoTF is just an extra trinket. It's good, but it's not overpowered.
---
Hardiness is the bane of every Alliance class that has a stun or uses grenades.
---
Do you have a source of that? It's specifically not allowed in the rules:
---
&gt; For World of Warcraft specifically, allowing players who are playing characters aligned with the “Alliance” faction to chat or otherwise communicate directly with players who are playing characters aligned with the “Horde” faction, or vice versa.

---
The expansions have their own articles, so there's a case to be made for WoW Classic having its own article. The main article is an odd mish-mash of current and Classic information, but *mostly* focuses on an expansion-agnostic overview of the current game.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
/u/Gefarate, if it's just wiki formatting and other technical matters you have trouble with and you think you have what it takes to write a worthwhile, high-quality article with proper sources, write it in a Google Doc or something and PM me the link and I'll handle the wiki formatting for you (on the condition that it's presentable), and then you can post the page under your own username so you get the credit (and the responsibility). 
---
It doesn't have to be long: a couple of introductory paragraphs, some amount of gameplay information (eg. describe key differences between Classic and modern WoW, explain the content release plans, etc.), and a short bit on the development (eg. that it's a port of the old data to the modern infrastructure and some short explanations of what that means, sourcing from eg. their Blizzcon panel).
---
That said, learning wiki formatting is like less than 20% of the trouble when writing an article from scratch. The biggest hurdle is actually writing the article itself, so if you're going through all the trouble then you might as well format it yourself too. You can draft it freely without worrying about the main article by using your sandbox page (or any sub-page under your user page).
---
You're going to TRY* to kill us.
---
IDk, considering your own calculations say 5 d 16 hrs /played to 60. Lets be on safe side and say 6 days /played.
---
6 days played is a good time, even with questing. And then 50g/hour farming, so 20 hours of farming (lets say you got 500g from questing, so 10 hours). 
---
It should come close either way :o
---
in TBC female Draenei had a quote to the effect of using gnomes as a dildo and that got removed as well
---
Google it if you don't believe me
---
Care bear
---
You were misinformed about the shaman raiding specs. The only worthwhile raiding spec is restoration. The other specs are really bad. They do abysmal dps and don't bring anything to the raid a resto sham cannot.
---
**Benevolent Elephants**. US, Alliance, PvP Server, PST based Semi-Hardcore Casual Guild.
---
Our Plan:
---
* To raid in a Semi-Hardcore Casual way. What does that mean? Casual number of raid nights and length of raids. But hardcore when inside the raid. Progression is the number one goal.
---
* To build a quality team of like-minded gamers interested in everything Classic WoW.
---
* Progression Raiding, 5 mans, and some optional PvP.
---
* We plan to clear every raid in Classic, including Naxx long term. Given the mixed style of casual and hardcore, we don’t plan on being world/server first, and that is ok!
---
About Us:
---
* Goal-driven mature gamers. 
---
* We love gaming and enjoy accomplishing our goals with friends.
---
* Many of us play nightly while others play casually.
---
* We understand real life/gaming balance and work with all our members to ensure everyone has a place.
---
* We are parents, workers, family members, and of course, gamers.
---
* Experienced leadership with successful raid experience from vanilla, to current high end Mythic raiding.​
---
Who we want:
---
* Mature gamers driven by a passion to succeed.
---
* Gamers who want to clear content in a timely manner in a non-toxic environment alongside other laid-back adult gamers.
---
* Members willing to put real effort into their class/role and work to be the best they can be.
---
* Members who understand real life constraints, yet still desire to clear content.
---
* Members who respect and appreciate other people’s time by being Punctual, Prepared, and Motivated.
---
* Casual Members/PvPers/Non-A team raiders are always welcome. Likely to form a “B Team” more casual raid group.
---
Goals:
---
* Kill all the bosses, with a core group of “A Team” Raiders.
---
* Make new friends.
---
* Make LOTS of new memories and relive some past ones.
---
Secondary Goals:
---
* Build a successful pvp team during non-raid nights. (Optional)
---
* Build a “B team” raid group that is more casual once inside the raid(think little to no consumes required)
---
The Important Info:
---
* Raid Nights: Tuesdays and Wednesdays (With a possible 3rd night being added once AQ drops, to be discussed with guild when the time comes.)
---
* Times: 8pm to 11pm
---
* Faction: Alliance
---
* Server: PvP
---
* Voice: Discord

LOL.  The butler bike!  Yeah, it's pretty ridiculous.
---
When the tourists don't leave* Considering not a single person who is in the beta who was skeptical. Still thinks that retail has something to offer. It's, when the tourists don't leave not if.
---
Yes roll on a PvP server, there will be plenty of raiding and PvE content.
---
Someone needs to make a boars only leveling guide.
---
Yeah, back in vanilla I was on a pvp server and it was fine, had the time for it, now I have two small children and have to leave multiple times during the evening (most thirsty creature in the world? A tired toddler). I just can't handle getting ganked every time I go afk.
---
As an Orc, you have a 30% chance to resist all stuns. Warriors can get this up to 45% with just 10 points in Prot.
---
It almost guarantees that you'll be able to break an Alliance rogue's stunlock.
---
It literally says why right in the comment you replied to.
---
&gt; I would recommend to read my words more carefully   
---
Honestly your grasp of the English language is so questionable someone has to read your words carefully just to get the basic meaning, let alone understanding supposed subtext.
---
it works in the beta, i don't think devs have made a stance on this yet when it goes live
---
As someone that played in vanilla retail, I disagree with the sentiment but I respect that opinion.
---
It still however does not justify anyone, streamer or no, in manipulating thier audience. That disgusting, and I'm very thankful for the people putting the effort into tracking what servers people like that will be on
---
Delete this!
---
Hey you sit on the bench for this one!
---
Don't think bosses hav str and agi.

---
You're a delusional grognard that seems to want WoW to be changed into something it never was: a hardcore, play 24 hrs a day to get anywhere, slow deathmarch MMORPG.
---
**Epoch of Thought \[H\]** | NA-PvP | Wed, Thur, Sun 1800—2200 PST | Hardcore
---
**TL;DR**:  Hardcore experienced, established guild seeks non-toxic, dedicated, competent raiders for Classic dominance starting with test realm preparation now. 
---
**About**: EoT started on Bloodscalp shortly after vanilla wow’s release &amp; became a top guild on the server. We’ve persisted as a gaming family ever since. Our goal has always been to clear content as a team while providing a second family for our members.  
---
Our leadership is experienced, skilled, and caring.  We've been around since the beginning and we're not quitting until we've farmed Naxx enough to gear everyone :).  We look forward to developing a winning team of people you'd not only want to raid with, but would also like to meet in real life if the chance arose.
---
**Raiding plans**: For classic we will be a top guild &amp; clear Naxxramas. We have a solid core experienced through Naxx. Most of us have raided for years &amp; are ready to devour classic content. We are running two competitive raid teams both lead by experienced leadership and tanked by experienced main tanks.  
---
**Loot System**:  We run a unique/proprietary point-guided loot council (attendance and contributions are measured and accounted for but there is no bidding and the system is designed to be transparent and efficient).  The loot council is focused on awarding gear where it best serves raid progression &amp; best recognizes attendance, &amp; contribution to raid performance.
---
**What we expect**: We expect dedicated, skilled raiders who show up with consumes, proper gear, &amp; knowledge. We expect competence and literacy with computers, google spread sheets, balancing individual schedules, and team communication.  We expect effort during, before, and after raids.  We expect serious practice on a guild hosted test server.  
---
We are team-focused so great performers are appreciated &amp; recognized, but divas who are unconcerned with the health of the entire raid team or overly self-interested are not tolerated. We are a diverse group of raiders worthy of individual respect &amp; the respect of everyone’s time.  Toxicity and drama stirring have no place in our guild.
---
**In short, be prepared, be knowledgeable, be on time, &amp; don’t be an A-hole.**
---
**Why We Will Survive and Thrive**:  We are experienced, dedicated, and prepared.  Our leadership team consists of mature, experienced, and professional leaders.  Our raid core consists of experienced, skilled, and most importantly, dedicated raiders.  
---
We are busy doing all the prep work we need to run a highly organized, reasonably competitive guild.  We are inclusive, non-toxic, and value team building and a rewarding social environment over pyrrhic victories.  We were successful in actual vanilla and have only gotten smarter, wiser, and more organized with age.
---
Most importantly we desire complete decimation of classic content and will not stop until we get there.
---
**Raid Schedule**: Wed, Thur, Sun, 6 PM to 10 PM PST (GMT-8) (9pm – 1 AM EST) hard stops and early nights where possible. Our guild has always been extremely active &amp; 20-mans, Onyxia, etc. will continue to be ran on non-core days. On most days, if you log in, you will find a good group of people to smash content with.
---
**Looking for**: Great people of all classes are strongly encouraged to apply.  Core raid spots are earned through demonstrated competence &amp; dedication. This means that no core spots will be predetermined and certainly not before anyone's hit 60.
---
If you are interested in leadership roles within the guild please send me a whisper &amp; let’s chat.
---
**Current Activity**:  The guild is practicing on our own test server to get the group reoriented to the old content and shaking the rust off.  We use the test raids for providing feedback, polishing raid skills, and determining and bolstering roster weakness.  
---
Currently, a sizeable portion of the guild is practicing leveling runs on pservers while a few are raiding hardcore.  We also have guild jackbox party nights for fun while we wait for classic.
---
**Apply**: The best way to join is to shoot me a private discord message **(Discord: Lne#2710 | Battlenet: Lne#1326)**.  You can also hit up either of my assistant GMs on **discord:  XvK#7740  &amp; AYD#5916**

YES TO THIS!

"Furthermore, competitive PvP shifted the game's balance irreversibly "
---
"MMORPG PvP needs to happen in the open world and doesn't need to strive for perfect balance"
---
Keeping things imabalanced is very toxic. I never said open world pvp was toxic. I asked you if you though toxic pvp, happening in the open world, was good for the game.
---
Kiting is a common term used in WoW.
---
Triggered retail baby PepeLaugh
---
I see what you’re saying, and I agree with how you portray the steady progression to the state we’re in now. 
---
I guess my main curiosity is what could have been the alternative. What would have needed to be different to keep wow as a prosperous endeavor while maintaining the classic design? 
---
Instead of flying, dailies, and tokens what would be the alternative design? 
---
Maybe more reputation based content and grinds for items to progress characters. 
---
Dungeons and raid content that had higher difficulty levels would have probably been in place still, as well as smaller raid sizes or even flexible raid sizes. 
---
Perhaps more world bosses and world events. I’m thinking about the pre patch world events but more regularly. Like the holiday events on steroids maybe. 
---
It’s interesting to think about the what if’s, and I suspect this is what people who advocate for patch 1.13 content have in mind.
---
Prediction, youll be wrong.
---
A reliable streamer quoted Ion after talking with him face to face at Blizzard HQ.

Thanks for letting us know
---
the clicking of spells is driving me insane. like shadowbolt is one of two things warlocks might need to hit in a raid why is that not at least on keybind 1-3
---
I watched a video of someone leveling a hunter from 1-6 on early alpha/beta from start to finish. Was so into it even though I'm sure it would be quite boring now as there was no talking or anything.
---
First character I made was a shaman and I joined a raid headed to Red Ridge at like, level 12.
---
This has to be bait
---
&gt; Spoken like someone who didn't experience a fresh realm launch during vanilla.
---
Actually I rolled on several fresh servers during vanilla. And I don't remember being unable to quest because there were too many people. 
---
Also, we're not talking about vanilla. We're talking about classic. And classic has layering. Which vanilla didn't  have.
---
Boar is 25s
---
I want this. I am in a conference all week. I just want to fish lol

No changes

Also a worse way to get rep

And hit again :-)

Only 1 furbolg in felwood drops firewater and that is the winterfall dude that hangs out in the northern camp
---
I know what you were saying though I'm just being a butthole
---
what if i have fun shitting on unviable specs?
---
Waah fucking waah.
---
I'm going feral and this guy is right. If you are doing harder content you can use survivability weapons like Warden Staff, but Manual Crowd Pummeler is a must have in your arsenal.
---
Youre 100% right but autism is rampant in this sub.
---
Accept vanilla was average ans got better into wotlk
---
I think that's more up to the Shaman or raid.  You can have multiple enhancement shamans because there will be multiple melee groups, for example.
---
My friends and I always played Horde and loved it.  I have no experience with the Alliance cities and only played a couple of lowbie alts.  All of my memories are from Horde side, but this time we are going to roll Alliance just to try out something new.
---
You are better off with anthema
---
&gt;  It's good, but it's not overpowered.   
---
Depends who you're fighting. Alliance Priests were essentially PvP non-viable outside of groups/pocket defender because of WotF breaking their only defensive spell and undead being by far the most popular race.   
---
Imagine is humans received a stun breaking version of WotF? The tears would be like a waterfall.
---
Without even clicking I know this is going to be about the cheating chick who sent nudes for loot.
---
Yeah I can see the hooks and everything

Vanilla blizzard gives 0 fucks about optimizing stars for a class. There's a lot of str/sta and str/spi dropping

bandage spec healing warrior
---
Just trying to figure out their position on this
---
As far as I know it's very common for shaman's to spec 30/0/21. You can play Ele everywhere else and resto in raids! No respec needed
---
Wish I could join a server with people whom never played before. I would love to start completely over with a community that knows absolutely nothing. 
---
I want the keyboard turners back. I want the people who don't use keybinds or macros. I want the people that after every level  feel lost since they don't have the next xx levels and routes mapped out. 
---
Basically I want a time machine. Maybe if I win the lottery I could organize my own private server where in order to join you must sign a contract confirming your lack of wow career
---
Late to the party but just as a side note blizzard has stated that adding flying mounts to the game was their biggest regret and if they could go back they would have never added them. The reason why at the start of new expansions flying is not allowed is because blizzard does not want flying in the game but since players now expect it they feel like they have to eventually give it back (after farming enough world quests/dailies/etc.)
---
...K.
---
But I'm so lazy... fml
---
Same guy's been posting this and other troll threads since yesterday, I have no idea what he's hoping to gain from it.
---
I think the reason it didn't feel as bad in TBC is because it was a gate.  Whereas in Mists it became an obligation.
---
Gates don't generally lead to burnout, but obligations do.
---
The nice thing is that once you were gated off from one piece of content, there was other content you could do to replace it.  Done with your dailies for the day, and can't get any more reputation?  Okay, go do dungeons, farm materials, or continue questing in Shadowmoon Valley or Netherstorm.
---
I play on a Mac, what’s the issue?
---
Why? This shows shaman being one of the most played classes.
---
This is why blizzard needs to not to TBC and make new original classic content
---
*Soothsaying for Dummies*. It was added in patch 1.10.
---
Think the problem with his kids can not be so big as he is able to do this all day long.
---
&gt; The question becomes about competition. How many hunters is the on the server wanting and capable of raiding naxx compared to the amount of raidspots. 
---
Yeah, this is what I was thinking. I played hunter through vanilla and, at the time, hunters were everywhere. They were extremely popular despite most raiding guilds only needing two to four hunters, so openings with good guilds filled almost immediately. The flip side is that hunters have nuance that other DPS lack, and it's possible to outperform other hunters who have better gear. You can make a name for yourself on a server by being able to pull, kite, CC, and still lay down respectable damage, while hundreds of other huntards are routinely pulling half the instance with their pets.
---
True.  But getting your flying mount was like that feeling when you're 16 and finally get your driver's license.
---
Wait retail doesn't use ammo?
---
I think at first, you might be right. And then once the player base levels out to those that are actually going to stick around for the journey, there will be more on PVP servers. Seems weird to me someone would choose to roll PVP "in case" they liked it.
---
I liked that most speccs were viable for pve in TBC.
---
Ugh sure billy
---
&gt;Daily quests are not for people with jobs, families and other hobbies besides Wow. They are an obstacle that hinders you to get anything.
---
They most certainly are for people with jobs and families... They were designed to be done fairly quick and give people extra gold. I hardly did dailies and was still able to get flying and a flying mount. Idk where you're getting this idea that WoW wasn't casual friendly since it always was and is to this day.
---
I thought the str cloth stuff was the ironman/woman game mode. Level a warrior with a staff and cloth gear to lvl 60
---
dude he wants to play both pvp and pve. what more do you need
---
yknow people talk a lot about how rough alliance rogues have it dealing with orcs, but perception is pretty damn annoying too
---
Quests yo...quests
---
If you can’t hold threat without sunder you shouldn’t be MT
---
Did you get the memo that we are putting cover sheets on the TPS reports now?
---
General reposti. You are an old one.
---
"Oh I'm almost revered"
---
Yep. It has come down to using ability 1 until a proc happens and ability 2 and 3 get stronger. Push the glowing button, then push button 1 again. Same gameplay for every class.
---
Imagine my shock after coming back after 8 years and seeing that not even do warlocks not need to life tap, the ability is totally gone. Hunters don't need to mark, convenient because the ability is totally gone. Also, their pet type doesn't matter. They all tank the same. Mages are locked out of spell types now. No more being a fire mage but having the utility of being able to arcane explosion trash or keep a low rank frost bolt on your bar for slows. Just click the buttons we give you and win.
---
Say it with me now...
---
Looks like they're having fun to me
---
Right! and I’m saying the 23 is incorrect and should be a 24!
---
Yep, looks good again. Thanks for all the work. Easily my favorite vanilla/classic resource.
---
&gt; Imagine is humans received a stun breaking version of WotF?
---
That's exactly what Retail has. It's called *Every Man for Himself*.
---
That's 2.0
---
Ds/ruin is a great raiding spec. Sac succubus for 15% shadow damage, leave corruption to the sm/ruin locks, and have a blast
---
If bandages scaled with +Healing, maybe? The plate exists. The biggest limiter is the bandage debuff that makes re-healing impossible.     
---
There are some pretty fun cloth melee warlock setups in vanilla. It was low DPS but pretty amusing, particularly with windfury.
---
too late ...blizzard announcing wow classic Mobile...and now you can play a warrior and buy a priest to level with you !
---
&gt;  rogue tends to be better dps at max level.
---
It's not really close
---
Lol all the casuals on pve servers are gonna quit before they hit 60.
---
280% cost 5K in TBC (not 6K).  It was not reduced in WotLK, to my knowledge.  I still remember farming 5K per toon in Cataclysm for it.  It was 1K for CWF so you could fly in Northrend.
---
not as reliable as an active talent, so my point still stands.
---
i didnt dismiss the usefulness of it just the reliability
---
I don't disagree with you, but go look at Pserver raid videos like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3oZEBR8yLc) and you'll see it's what they're actually doing.
---
I'm a rogue in beta too...a gnome..I'm not expecting mercy. Even other rogues are KIS period.
---
Dude you're being very condescending in this thread.
---
You're not out of your mind, OP is a delusional grognard who apparently forgot that you still had to put in time and effort for badge gear (which was still worse than raid gear in almost every way) because heroic dungeons were hard as fuck.
---
So you're saying you can get a 4 str 4 stam leather belt in an hour in classic? But level 18 in an hour might be a challenge. Not understanding the meme
---
F
---
&gt; I plan on trying to avoid streamers. Not that I have a problem with them. If been lucky enough to play with quite a few in the beta and haven’t had any problems but not looking to play with them on launch.
---
Completely missing the point.
---
"Should"? It is coming back. It's already there. It's not a bug. It's staying.
---
Self confidence is key. Don’t worry if people talk shit about your tanking while leveling; it’s the learning process for the most difficult and complex role in the game.
---
Haters should try to tank themselves. 
---
Also, take your time. Sheep Moon, Trap Square, Sap Circle and Pull the patrol &gt; “LOL YOLO, let’s AOE this shit.”
---
reading is good for you.
---
if you can read posts on Reddit, you can read quest text in the game.
---
Herp derp durrr nO cHaNgEs durrr
---
Lol there ya go, there will be no easing up until p3 :)
---
I can’t help but think that this is yet another “list of things I personally dislike linked together with a tenuous conspiracy theory to explain the downfall of WoW.”
---
Flying didn’t “take you out of the world;” it took you above it. And since many people don’t want to spend a lot of time climbing and diving, it was generally pretty low-level flying. What flying killed was World PVP, because shock of shocks, people generally don’t like getting killed while doing their grocery shopping. PvP servers were always in a minority for a reason. That’s why there’s so many guides and tips to “trick” people into accidentally flagging.
---
Dailies were also a natural progression. People don’t want to grind ogres endlessly tor warbeads, so if you’re going to include auxiliary factions, you need a way to get that rep without making it terminally boring. You also want to timegate it so the poopsockers can’t tear through it in a couple days and go back to whining about how bored they are.
---
And Badges are a natural evolution as well. When your primary means of gearing up is dungeon drops, you are completely at the whims of RNGsus. Badges are for filling out the gear you just can’t get, no matter how hard you try.
---
As with most things, the dose makes the medicine. When you have to complete the content on foot first, then flying is a bonus. Plus, you can make content explicitly geared around flying, such as Skettis and Ogri’la. When you have one or two factions offering a handful of dailies apiece, then you can make reasonable progress in a decent amount of time. And as long as badge gear isn’t significantly better than the dungeon drops, then it fills its purpose of moderating RNG.
---
But when you can buy flying immediately, it trivializes the content. When you have half a dozen factions with a dozen daily quests apiece (each one taking ten minutes or more), you spend all your available playtime grinding them out. And when badges give gear significantly better than the dungeons, then dungeonrunning becomes a means to an end rather than a meaningful activity in itself.

What killed the overworld in WoW was LFD. Full stop. When dungeons become the fastest way to level, heirlooms make gear irrelevant, and LRD means you can get to those dungeons without setting foot outside a capital city, that’s what players will do. The majority of players will choose the most efficient leveling method over the most enjoyable leveling method every time. And since they don’t enjoy it, they’ll make everyone else they encounter miserable along the way.
---
Nope. EMfH shares a cooldown with the PvP trinket, whereas WotF gives you an additional cooldown which also breaks Priest's fear. Meaning 50% of a Priest's fear can be broken via trinket + WotF (ignoring class abilities, and the fact that combat isn't continuous).      
---
If WotF simply saved you a trinket slot like EMfH it would be much better balanced.
---
Dailies in tbc were fine since they were for gold and cosmetic stuff and the netherwing drake dailies could gone around with egg farming.
---
Flying would also have been fine if more content current content has been placed in vanilla.
---
As for badge that is a balancing game of giving the casual a way to get some awesome gear and a catch up mechanic for people who join in later.
---
The features added weren't wrong the places they were used in and to what extent was.
---
What the hell does that mean
---
I'll make sure to dot you if we cross paths on live.  Assuming, of course, I see you before you see me.
---
Your understanding is wrong, there is only deep Resto for serious raiding.
---
You might be able to slack around as Ele/Resto in healing gear for lower tier content, but it’s not optimal and does the same as deep Resto just worse.
---
Enhancement is a meme.

Killing mobs is fun tho
---
Not only that. Some pieces are ok, but you'll really want +healing and mp5
---
Is it even feasible with good internet? Unless you’re under 50ms the latency seems so annoying. At least with online PC/Cosole games you see everything you do instantly without latency and then it’s up to the server to register it
---
It's incredible how different we all are here. Now, I don't know what Warrior you talk about, Arms/Fury Warriors were probably fun, I don't know, but I absolutely loathe what they did to Protection Warriors in WotLK. They decimated everything that was ever interesting about tanking and turned it into something cheap and empty. WotLK was a trashcan of an expansion for many reasons, but what they did to my beautiful protboy is unforgivable and the main reason for me to quit the game completely.
---
&gt; (while still having a real job).
---
I'm not sure what this has to do with anything, especially since his real job is WoW related.
---
Yea seems like any meme I post gets taken down as well. 
---
Example from two days ago: https://i.imgur.com/LyuPDFCh.jpg
---
oh my bad then, gorilla thunder clap has 1 minute at least though, i checked
---
I mean, tourist doesn’t just mean retail players coming to classic. I have friends who have never played WoW before that plan to try classic because they will be able to start fresh with everyone and play with their friends, however, I expect most of them to quit before phase 2.
---
It's possible, Im leveling a mage on a PS right now and having a ton of fun, I think most people who like RPGs are going to enjoy it. It was very captivating on release, maybe that isn't there for newcomers anymore but I have a feeling it is. It's truly an enthralling experience and you have pride in your toon. I'm trying to convince some.of my friends who weren't into wow to play it because I know if they gave it a real shot they would love it, and I feel that's the case for most gamers than enjoy the genre , because WoW was such a top tier rpg. I do agree about the first 20 levels though, on launch it'll be rough. Getting ahead and staying ahead will be important unless you wanna get bogged down until 40s
---
Only time will tell
---
I rolled PvE back in original Vanilla, and had a lot of fun, and wasn't really aware of the difference in experience between the two server types at the time.  Over the years I've been mostly still on PvE servers, but have spent most of the last 6 months with War Mode on, and now I'm definitely leaning towards a PvP server for Classic.
---
With no bgs at launch, I feel like I'd be missing out on an entire aspect of the game if I rolled PvE only.  So this time, I'm doing everything different, going PvP and Horde.  It's all very exciting.
---
Yes, you will get ganked, but on the other side, you'll get to gank others, and participate in WPvP battles that frankly rarely exist on PvE servers.  Also, the raiding scene is usually very good on PvP servers, as people need that gear to be even more effective in PvP.
---
First character was an enhance Shaman before I switched to maining a Warlock. Even though they're not the best this time around, I'll be rolling it because it's fun.
---
Thata boy!
---
Even with the Tired Old Lady face?
---
It's funny that you missed your own point in your own post. The features were the effect of, not the cause of the decline of the game. You said that Blizzard wanted to maintain their subscription numbers, and Blizzard determined that in order to do so they had to sell the game to as many players as possible. And to sell to as many players as possible you provide conveniences.
---
To quote a popular quote from Steve Jobs which I feel is relevant to this:
---
&gt; "...The company does a great job, innovates, and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field. And then the quality of the product becomes less important. The company starts valuing the great salesman, because they’re the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. So the sales people end up running the company.”
---
We can see from history that Blizzard moved from developing a great game towards developing a strong revenue. The game suffered for it, but it will always be "successful" from a revenue standpoint.
---
That's fine because rogues roll rogues for a reason, and it's not for our demand in raiding.
---
for the last time, classic is NOT a remaster, they're not trying to create a perfect game. They're just creating it as it was.
---
thanks, but it was more of a [joke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nuhw_O8BHM)
---
I mean, it will be pretty beneficial on warrior.  That range is a big deal.  It affects white hits, hamstring, sweeping strikes, whirlwind.  All a pretty big deal.  It may or may not affect piercing howl.
---
Good bot.

NA, PVP, EST time zone, Alliance
---
Looking for a casual/semi-hardcore raiding guild with a little bit of pvp. Available for sure Tuesday and Saturday nights to raid, other times can fluctuate due to work. Fairly experienced, been playing since vanilla on and off, have cleared all classic raids besides Naxx in some capacity.
---
Planning to main rogue.
---
Other classes I’m willing to play and have experience playing if the need is higher:
---
Prot Warrior
---
Holy Pally
---
Will also be playing with a IRL friend who is planning on maining dwarf holy priest. We would like to join a guild together.
---
Faerie Fire is great and most healers can't keep it up like a cat can.
---
Yeah good for any outdoor content, both PvP and PvE
---
true, though a holy paladin would be even worse in that 1v1
---
Blood Elf DK.
---
Troll is obvious
---
I saw references to it being a level 60 marks ability but it isn't in the book at that level, then I saw forum posts saying it was completely removed. People were complaining about needing it to tame certain stealthed beasts and other hunters were suggesting workarounds.
---
My hunter is only 38 but I haven't seen a sign of it. What I have seen is the ability to regularly 1 shot mobs above my level with aimed shot and the ability to play while doing other things because of the lack of effort needed.
---
SM/ruin casts maybe two spells, DS/ruin cast a curse then one spell. Raiding in vanilla as a caster is boring. No dps class has more than a 3 button rotation
---
Have you not tanked before? Is there anything in WoW Classic more difficult to do than tanking? Maybe winning the Fishing Extravaganza. Not much else.
---
Druids are very capable off tanks
---
Once you're geared you'll be nasty. Sadly even woth pendulum at 40 cap we're all just beating them down. As a rogue even I'm beating them baad.
---
I hope so. I want to do all quests in all zones this time and Questy can help me find those quests easily.
---
Likewise - don't be "that guy" and compare Vanilla to tbc or wotlk - by your logic they will probably release MoP since it was generally liked, right?
---
Or is the scale if likeability maybe a little different when it comes to wotlk and mop?
---
Way to assume before thinking!
---
They will not put resources into something that takes away from 2 products already... but then again we've already established you can't think past face value so enjoy waiting on expansions, blind consumer.
---
Yeah. I'd rather choose when to PVP than deal with some e-thugs who think their enjoyment is more important than someone else being able to actually play the game.
---
But why make it any different at all? If you want a harder server, that’s Mythic Vanilla. Not Vanilla. Not Classic.
---
Warrior is just painful to level and play til you get crazy raiding gear.
---
This is not how it works... imagine rolling on a server with friends and being put in a different layer because you start late and then when phase 2 drops and layers are removed being put on a different server and no longer being able to play with your friends. This is not how the system is going to function.
---
Was this on a pserver? Cuz I saw em a few days ago wrecking everyone (including me) on a pserver it was really funny.
---
With a slow internet connection I can still download a game and then play it. But, I will never be able to use Stadia.
---
A lot of people get confused when it comes to pvp servers. The question you need to ask yourself isn't whether or not you like pvp. The question is whether or not you enjoy pvp without consent and, the emergent game play that flows forth from that. Consent not PvP is the key consideration here. WPvP happens whether you would have it happen or not. It happens whether or not it's fair or not. You do not get to choose even odds. You do not get to opt out. You live or die at the edge of a sword. To me it's an indispensable part of wow. If they only offered pve servers to me this would be a bad game. Other people though hate pvp without consent. Because it is often unfair.
---
No, you change my mind. TBC was awesome.
---
My total curiosity, but I'd love to see what vanilla would be like with no debuff limit. How does the meta change? It was a technical limitation at the time, not a game development decision. Perhaps best left to a WoW 2.0 type of game, but I'd like to play a version of Classic where some of the BC class improvements are implemented. Not for the life version, of course, out at least not for years, but it's a fun dream for me.
---
Keep it at 50/50
---
I played Vanilla. I was level ~55 when BC came out, and had been marking targets since VC. Classic should have marks.
---
To be fair, there hasn't ever been an MMO with an actual competitive PvP scene. Most matchups in the absolute top of WoW arena have almost always been decided by compositional counters and rarely individual outplay potential.
---
WoW PvP is fun, I love it. But taking it seriously is just a fucking chore, because you will just lose against certain comps and there is absolutely nothing you can do to change that. 
---
Compared to a lot of other PvP games, it really isn't hard to 'pilot' a WoW character flawlessly. By making the most of your cool downs you will best worse players, but outside of that nobody really looks any different. The best frost mage in the world's PoV and play style will look almost identical to any top 1% player.
---
tbh I’d love to be able to play Classic on the new iPad Pro, if that fucking thing ever gets proper mouse support
---
Then dailies help you out, even if you don't play every day which should be fine. Don't play casually or in a way which goes against how you should play then complain when they change the formula to include that 80 percent. It's simple
---
Eh tbh everyone knows what to do so we're still fast-rolling through instances in beta
---
I'm doing the 0/30/21 spec from the "Hybrid Section" often called Heart of the Wild (HotW) spec.  
---
Also, if you really want to be tryhard about it during single target fights, you can rage dump and weave in a rejuvenation between boss swings to pop back into bear and get the free rage from furor.  Free threat and increased DPS for your party.
---
That's about right. Conform or GTFO in here every day bros
---
No, that would be Disengage for hunters, which is a copy/paste of Feint that hunters get for no reason.
---
Right here my man.  Was in the Alliance progression guild at server launch.
---
Why would you block everything out but leave your password question and answer visible?
---
The threat of PVP was part of the journey IMO.  I'd have to disagree with your prediction as the PVP servers I feel are a more traditional experience.  Time will tell.  We'll all get to enjoy it regardless of preference.
---
Hear me out. Disc priest mt
---
VW has an AOE taunt actually. Although I lleoubt it's good enough to hold threat unless your dps are disciplined enough to never touch the wrong mob
---
There was an addon in development like this called Voice Acted Quests. Blizzard shut it down to protect their copyright. They had no choice. At least they asked nicely first.
---
It's the equivalent of saying "Lol" or "ROFL" basically. Only conveying emotions other than laughter
---
If it works in BfA it should work in classic
---
Oh well hi it's carebearz
---
This made me lol
---
I knew a guy who had top warrior healing on quite a few fights in MC. He would even spam healthstones and stand in stuff to make sure he got it as high as possible.
---
I always think of that when I hear about "unconventional specs"
---
I think you are correct. I think people on this sub forget that classic wow is going to pull in a lot of people that either have never played an mmo before or do not usually play them, just to try it out. Likely some people will enjoy it, but many people will move onto the next big thing in a month, they aren't like committed to wow the way a lot of people on here are. I doubt it will disappoint people that know what to expect, but at the same time it just simply is not for everyone.
---
They can be alright in Alliance thanks to pally buffs. Not great, but surely not unplayable.
---
This made me laugh out loud
---
Sorry, I was unclear. I was taking into account the price for the initial training as well. And yes, the CWF costing 1K is my point. We went from having to farm a great deal of gold the previous expansion, to basically having the gold ready to go once we hit max level during the next expansion. And yes, buying the mount was still XXXX amount of gold for alts, but for players who played a singular toon, this wasn't the same kind of time/gold sink as they progressed through the game, which is really kind of my point. In TBC we were required to farm a great deal of gold to ignore the land/flight paths. In WoTLK (assuming you had already purchased the flying through the previous expansion) you were ready to ignore the land/FPs as soon as you hit 80.
---
\#what?
---
Questie will be classic.
---
These are rookie numbers! lol

---
The reason they're good for short fights is because of the need to powershift to min-max their energy generation rates.
---
Thunderfury has 2 debuffs it puts up. 
---
BRE
---
Insect swarm 
---
People really over value lock dps and think every guild needs to put up shadow weaving

Hunters mark

I guess, but everyone would still rather have a warrior tanking and that druid running a heal spec.
---
Even just single player games. For you to press a button and see it on your TV, the signal needs to go from your controller through wifi to the router, to the server, back to your router, through wifi to the TV.
---
I'm kinda picky about this but I play on a PC connected by cable to the router and a &lt;5ms response time monitor. I'll often have 50ms ping, so it'll be under 100ms response time. If I have &gt;100ms ping I can notice that it's not snappy anymore, and that's still under 150ms total.
---
With a regular TV and operating over wifi you'll be lucky to get 200ms, and many people will be getting &gt;500ms. This isn't a big issue for some games, but for many it is.
---
Na people still use the terms to convey emotions/intent just like "lol" or "noob" does
---
Ok so a person on reddit cliams that a streamer have confirmed that Ion have confirmed that the written rules will not apply.
---
I will need a  tinsy winsy  more evidence before I take that as a fact.
---
Im 25... So 25+..?
---
Yeah, since druids can shift and remove some annoying cc. It’s easy to run away from people lmao
---
Classic and TBC and any other old server will require no resources once their running behind maintenance.  Don’t be that guy.  Ion himself said they’d consider it.
---
Hey there - I've begun putting together a guild with some RL &amp;  WoW friends. Horde, EST focus, semi-hardcore. We're all mid 20s+, so we are going to be progressive without some insane schedule. Will definitely be doing a fair share of PvP as well! 
---
Stop by and check out the discord, if any questions just ask! [https://discord.gg/Yfexwze](https://discord.gg/Yfexwze)
---
And his calculation takes perfect conditions as grsnted when it comes to maxing RC in osrs. Classic wow cant even compare
---
There might only be like 2 pvp 2 pve realms or something we don't know. Another server could be quite a high price pop wise
---
Isn’t it obvious, for the women
---
Ha yes I played exclusively as DPS, I am probably a little rose tinted. I  played so much wow during that expansion and had shadowmourne first in my guild.
---

This sub does seem to have a weird duality of both "Play whatever you like, have fun, there's lots on non-hardcore guilds that will bring a balance druid!" and "If you aren't playing PRECISELY this spec, PRECISELY this way, you'll be useless in raids/PvP and no one will play with you"
---
Initially I think pvp will have higher queues, as the phases go on I believe pve will take the population lead (as the cool kids that aren't "normie casuals" stop playing on their pvp server)
---
I think phase 2 will turn a lot of people off of PvP realms as well. Anyone trying to level to 60 once phase 2 hits is going to farmed into oblivion.
---
at least post a comment damn
---
I get you but, my point was just. Classic wow steals souls in a way that no other version except maybe TBC ever did. If you get your friends into classic wow. Don't expect to get them back IRL lol.
---
Indeed, but what about outside of raiding? You can farm, PvP, do whatever as SM/Ruin. DS is a pure raid spec that makes you completely useless for anything but raiding. That's why it's boring imo.
---
Being able to do crafting or similar stuff while away from computer (for various reasons)
---
It's been a long time but I recall the initial blessings being 5 minute until later patches. The majority of their efficiency came from the talent (I forget the name) that made flash of light return full mana on a crit.
---
This was good but the healing amount per point of mana wasn't up to the level of a priest. Due to itemization, priest cloth had more spirit for mana regen than plate designed for paladins. We had a couple of healadins while running MC, and ZG that could get the job done, sure, but they couldn't measure up to non hybrids in longer fights.
---
As I said, it has been a long time and I have had too many birthdays, but I do remember never having a paladin come close in healing in long fights due to mana efficiency. Some of it may have been gear or our paladins might have been bad (never suggest this to a paladin, they combust).
---
If only that were the case... but I think OP is  referring to the excessive greifing by killing flight masters and NPC questgivers. 
---
It would be a different conversation if it were strictly about PvP.
---
&gt; apologizing for calling someone a retard 13 years ago
---
You happen to be Swedish, right?
---
I said it lacked AoE **threat**, I didn't say AoE **taunt**. So *actually* nothing.   
---
Plus 2 min cooldown, 10 second duration. Even healers will pull off mobs with only an AoE taunt after it elapses. It isn't viable. Particularly as you aren't going to wait 2 minutes between pulls.
---
You talkin' ' bout Celestalon?
---
Why? Because we can enjoy questing, crafting, hell, even fishing without a skull level ganking us? Oh the horror! I'm going to get so bored playing the game, I just might quit!
---
How does the threat of ganking/corpse camping make me stick around LONGER? &lt;shakes head&gt;
---
No they're not.
---
I wish.
---
99.99% sure this did not work in vanilla. Nobody really uses Pyro in PvP unless it's PoM'd or the guy is already CC'd, too. Never remember anyone use it to avoid spells a single time.
---
As per OP thought we were talking raids
---
When MoP got released I had a mental breakdown because of the mandatory dailies as high end hardcore player and did not enjoyed the expansion at all despite having the best results I ever had raid-wise, I hated the fact that blue exclamation point ruined it for me
---
It's so situational. I'm certain you can run around shadowbolting in BGs, but you take more risk getting shadow locked, wasting more time if you do get interrupted, travel and cast time of shadowbolt means you could get the kill sniped from under you and waste it.
---
That being said - the interruption risk is a lot less relevant if the enemy is unorganized
---
Your prediction will fail.
---
Yeah I wanted a real oldschool experiance. I see im outnumbered. Vanilla is over and im oké with that. I just hope Classic is going to be worthwhile. Els I'll go play Castlevania or something els.
---
Pretty interesting for those trying to in minmax, mostly relevant to Warriors and Rogues :)
---
www.vanillafriends.com
---
So bored of these ppleho keep saying "I dont have time to play the game anymore QQ" if you have a family and children now and dont have time then dont play.
---
Just give them a second to take aggro.  Any tank that’s complaining about bubble mid fight is a weirdo.
---
"A man who is desperate for acceptance, approval, and affection from women. This desperation has led to the compromise of his beliefs and values, the desecration of his dignity and self-worth, and his inability to stand up for himself and what he deserves as a human being, eg. loyalty, fidelity, and honesty in a romantic relationship."
---
All alliance players, amirite
---
I mean, it's classic, it's wow, it's gonna be a riot on launch day. Personally I'm not even worried about leveling too much at the start. Just find the huge groups of people and enjoy the community. Troll some people as a level 1 running around, what's the rush?
---
Good bot
---
Cancer
---
^ shadow priest player lol
---
I'm not sure if this a troll? You don't write intended server type or even what faction you're gonna play yet you claim to be high-level players who have proven to be the best at the games you play yet you fail on the very basics already. Also unless your guild was a hardcore raiding guild on a pserver before classic forget week 2 raiding it's not happening.
---
I disagree. Guys like Esfand and Drakova have shown that Rets can be viable in PvP. And not everything is theorycrafted to death just because the game is 15 years old. I literally read a post today suggesting spellpower melee Hunter (just to give an example). Of course Rets won't ever be a Tier 1 spec in terms of damage, but that doesn't mean Rets *have to be* "hot garbage".
---
This guy is a melt
---
Probably because the mage can outclass any warlock at the top end. They want one warlock there to cast curse of the elements and then afk for the remainder of the fight. I usually only saw one or two other warlocks in those guilds. I'm very happy I won't be raiding with that kind of mentality again.
---
screw you mobile gamers :)
---
There is a macro that casts pick pocket before ambush/kidney etc and with autoloot you get free money for nothing.
---
Please refrain from making up bullshit and then spreading your misinformation using poor grammar. That is not how layering works.
---
You misunderstood it isn't that these players playing on a pve server would play for longer on a pvp server, it's that the feeble mind that would roll on a pve server can't handle claasic on any server.
---
Feign death is enough to interrupt a cast as it drops their target. If you shadowmeld after it would be a waste
---
Eh...  Seeing the game from above was briefly cool but once you've seen it, you've seen it.  If flying mounts had flight models (as in, you needed to maintain momentum and couldn't climb too fast), I agree that swooping low through jungles and stuff would feel cool.  But as it stands, flying mounts are just like swimming through the sky.
---
Unpopular Opinion: I would play the shit out of this. I don't get much time to play due to work and family. I could utilize this on the down low at work, in between meetings and projects.
---
But CWF =/= 280% flying.  That cost is already there.  If you're going to lump 225 and 300 riding together, then CWF costs 7K gold.
---
You're jumping through a lot of hoops - some of them that conflict with each other - just to make your point.  That says something about your point.
---
I don't have beta access so I can't test it. I'm not arguing that it does work. I'm saying that it would be useful if it did work like that.  
---
Does stealth cancel casts before they finish in the beta? If it does, so should shadowmeld.
---
So you're going to watch someone play vanilla wow.
---
But you can't spend 10 minutes looking for a good streamer.
---
This is a little snippet from the latest episode in my Classic WoW Beta series. You can watch the full series here! https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiGcT3dOk5iBoEo-wwHWzctWdx3KmMRj4
---
Calling your shitty memespecs “unconventional” won’t make them less of a deadweight for the other 39 people in your raid.
---
People used to think stoneform and escape artist were useless, but imo they are two of the most underrated racials in all of vanilla. Stoneform removes bleeds, poisons and diseases and increases your armor all things that are good for both PvP and PvE. Escape artist removes all roots and movement impairing effects and is only a 1 min cooldown which again is super good in both PvP and PvE.
---
all drop rates are as they were in 1.12 since they're basing classic off of the actual 1.12 source code. the drop rates have been low from my experience.
---
You have to be on a PVP server to kill flight masters and quest givers?
---
with no debuff limit all raid bosses become trivialized.
---
Hunters, Warlocks, and Arms warriors wouldnt be totally gimped.
---
But youd now have to make changes to all fights. Perhaps you could just up the health, but this would require a fair bit more of development for Classic.
---
It is unfortunate when you realize thats the main thing holding back a few classes
---
It’s absolutely insane you’re being downvoted. How is it not common sense that most rp’ers aren’t into PvP. Have you people played video games before?
---
You must be fun at parties
---
Trolls Health Regen.
---
&gt; I think OP is referring to the excessive greifing by killing flight masters and NPC questgivers.
---
Never remember this being a problem whatsoever.
---
People ganked outside the towns, not in the towns. OP guards would start chain spawning like crazy until you eventually died or ran away.
---
I'm starting to think some don't actually want to play Classic.
---
jk I'm not thinking, I'm KNOWing
---
It's with pwf, bok and motw. I geared kinda odd back then. Not sure if you can acces this: https://youtu.be/eox64XVEkH4 , check 10m15 onwards.
---
3 tick barb fishing makes the vanilla grind look weak. That was the bane of my existence
---
Fuck dude I miss DAoC. 
---
That was my shit.
---
I feel you!
---
Life-long druid player here. I really want to play druid because I've played resto druid since tbc. Unfortunately I'm hearing a lot of people hating on druids, especially when it comes to raiding. Seems like blasphemy. 
---
I keep telling myself I want to play warrior but idk if its worth the hassle of learning the class, all the macros, the repairs, and competing with the other 10,000 warriors on the server for bis gear.
---
You are talking about 40 think pvp essentially at this point. My comment is specifically toward caster mobs, not players. There is alot of overlap though. Mages, in vanilla, have the advantage against rogues.   
---
If you want to have a shot at them you need to cheap shot and gouge immediately to eat the blink, and use thistle tea. Frost reflection from the engine trinket is a must. Then again, I'm talking at level 60.  
---
Honestly, if the mage is equally geared and uses engineer items the same, they will win most of the time. There are tricks and niche items to get around polymorph, ways to avoid Frost Nova, but skilled frostmages are more likely to win every second the battle takes, their CDs recharge faster. If you use a free action potion, you can trash them, but if they are good( and a bit angry after that)they will hunt you down. Personally, if I force people to blow expensive consumes to best me, it's a win regardless if I die or not.
---
Druids rise up
---
Well, if you want a Paladin alt...you should probably go Alliance! Haha
---
It sounds like you're drastically overestimating the effects of a PvP server.
---
People have a hard time believing their opinions aren't shared by everyone.
---
You are wrong, Chain Heal is the spell you will mostly cast when you are not recasting your totems.
---
Wow. This is awesome. OFC Blizz would shut it down.
---
Why is that stupid? You have an infinimate amount of tries to get the first jump. That will always happen.
---
So if you decide "okay, I will try to get a streak of 7", then you are going to be jumping around untill you get a flip, and THEN your chances start jumping.
---
Another way to say it: if you are jumping around and want to calculate the odds of your next flip being repeated, then the odds are one in five, not one in 25. However, if you stand still want want to calculate the odds of your next two jumps both being flips, THEN it becomes one in 25.
---
What UI/addon are you using? I really like it!
---
Oh and if you tank MC just accept that you'll fuck up sometimes it's fine. 
---
Things like the flubbing spider handoff in ZG, running through the giants in MC, forgetting to turn an ancient core hound, etc are all gonna happen. 
---
Hell the entire panther boss fight in ZG is gonna put you on edge. It'll look and feel awful even when done well. 
---
You'll be too slow on shazzrah, or get out of position on rag and get thrown clear past the wall into the lava. This shit happens, and we all know this. Most people will understand. 
---
Learn to love the stress and tension. That shit means you're immersed. It means that victory is going to be that much sweeter.
---
I really do mean this is the least disrespectful way possible, but.... I really don't think most people read that, and I really believe that having it sticky'd will reach at least 5x the number of players
---
Fd drops target it doesn't stop incoming projectiles.  Why do you think the op is asking about coil and (pom) pyros?  They're instant cast my dude we're not stopping the cast we're making it not land.
---
It streams games from Google's cloud servers to whatever screen you have access to. Because it's servers in Google's infrastructure, if you live in USA or Europe, those servers are extremely close to you where ever you are. The latency from the Project Stream beta I was in was amazingly low. I'd tried other streaming services, including a Steam Link within my own home, and this is the only time it seemed payable, and beyond payable, felt good and snappy.
---
There was latency, but it was more than playable. Good enough to enjoy if all you have is a tablet or phone or Chromecast.
---
Is this another I have 5 kids posts?
---
It allows you to weight stats which is the base element of the tool you are proposing, right? The sorting and comparison stuff is addons after that... sorry for not linking you a full web tool already catered to your very specific needs... thought this would be relevant enough as it is. Clearly not lol.
---
Hard troll.
---
Yeah. It was around in vanilla and will be now.
---
nice job posting one after I called you out :)
---
&gt;viable in PvP
---
I'm not talking about PvP.
---
&gt;And not everything is theorycrafted to death just because the game is 15 years old.
---
...uh, yes, everything IS theorycrafted to death because the game is 15 years old.
---
Just because you can come up with some ridiculous meme like "haha spell damage melle huntr XDDD" doesn't mean the rest of the game hasn't been theorycrafted already.
---
&gt;Of course Rets won't ever be a Tier 1 spec in terms of damage, but that doesn't mean Rets have to be "hot garbage".
---
But they literally are hot garbage. Even with BIS gear stacking tons of consumes and world buffs, you struggle to do half the DPS of a similar warrior/rogue/mage/warlock. On top of this, you bring nothing to the raid that a Holy paladin can't.
---
Ret is hot garbage in PvE. Stop trying to convince people otherwise.
---
Not too dissimilar to 2004.  Idiot 12 year olds spamming chat with stupid shite.
---
I assume that you mean outside of WoW there hasn't een an MMO with an actual competitive scene. I'm not sure that's a sign of MMOs not being PvP friendly, or the fact that other MMOs don't really have the audience/player base to support comp PvP.
---
As for the rest of your post, I vehemently disagree with mostly everything you said. Hard counters do exist, but those hard counters are not "usually" viable past a certain rating. Once the meta establishes itself,  the top comps have play against eachother. If they didn't they would rotate out for more favorable matchups. 
---
Your last point seems shallow to me as well. "Hard" is very subjective. It's much harder to memorize and apply 30-40 keybinds compared to other games, but that's a matter of opinion at the end of the day. Your second point is just "good players beat bad players." Then you say that an elite player looks mostly identical to top 1% players which again, is kind of true everywhere in competitive games.
---
*arsehole
---
weren't female taurens unable to enter MC or something because they couldn't fit through the doorway? am I remembering that correctly?
---
It is posted here every few days as well.
---
Yes, but you're not gonna enjoy the STV part.
---
Thanks, a lot, another question, if lets say I start with gnomish and learn gnomish only recepies, will they get removed when I switch to goblin?
---
It's a level 60 talent.
---
Blizzard took a game that rewarded dedicated players and turned it into a ge where everyone is equal. Theres no opportunity to stand out because even casuals can achieve anything now. Everything is time gated to hell to artificially keep people subbed longed.
---
Most definitely, hunter is one of if not the highest skillcap roles in PvE, and most hunters.. well huntard is a meme for a reason.
---
Pvp will be bigger
---
Yes, of course they would. Even if they loved the addon, which they did, they would have no choice. Your copyrights and trademarks are only valid if you protect them with impunity.
---
Having played Project Stream beta and tried other cloud gaming services, Google's was the only one that actually felt playable. It's miles ahead of the other services.
---
I kill two dwarf before I kill two dwarf. 
---
And then I kill two more!
---
I enjoyed it more, but i'm just one dude.
---
sure. Not sure im going to play a shaman this time but if i did, i would go ele at 40 just so I could always choose the best item from quest rewards and such so id have an easier time going caster. Otherwise you have to do the semi-awkward switch from enh to resto. (not saying it isnt totally doable to switch though)
---
Taunts generate flat threat as well as forcing target to attack. So, **actually**, yes, they do have AOE threat. You don't have to be a smartass, you end up looking the fool - I was just giving you some information.
---
A lot of people who planned to be hardcore went to pservers the minute Classic was announced at Blizzcon or earlier and are already baked into a cohesive guild.
---
Interesting, when I click on the results it shows it as the 2nd to least class played, right above Druid...
---
Tired old lady face and beehive hair ftw.
---
You mean his *real* job being... ACTUALLY DESIGNING THE SAID CONTENT.
---
*facepalm*
---
Go get all your work done. I’m putting all other games on the side and going balls out for the next three months before wow. Once launch rolls around I’m gonna be a useless zombie - it seems like the move to make.
---
Gotta have one of each trade mat
---
I doubt people on this subreddit think it's useless but you wouldn't believe the amount of warriors on private servers who skip this ability because they have taunt... Mocking Blow. Just learn it!
---
Yes, there will be cross-realm BGs. Please check the facts before trying to call someone else out, otherwise it makes you look like an oompa loompa.
---
I mean if youve played runescape this is like childs play.

From ClassicDB (comments section)
---
By [**Vukodlak**](https://classicdb.ch/user=Vukodlak) [on 10/16/2006](https://classicdb.ch/?item=5366#comments:id=1960) (Patch 1.12.2)
---
The drop rate is horrible on these.
---
Sent you a request on bnet (Velenos#1912). Recently returned to retail to mess around until classic hits. Played a rogue in vanilla but looking to main shaman in classic.
---
Viable Spec = ok
---
Unconventional spec = 40 dps less
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Do you believe that an essentially naked rogue should be able to beat max level character wearing pvp/raiding gear?
---
Because a no would by lying... theybcould consider relaunching BFA, it won't matter forbath least 2 years.
---
You're right - no resources moderating 3 versions of the game... they won't be getting rid of classic - so we'll just have 3 versions of our game under "WoW" for $15/month.
---
Hey I'll eat my words like dogshit if we ever see TBC getting pushed anywhere near Vanilla.
---
You nerds need to stop being so sensitive and understand you are going on a hope that a percentage of a percentage of players want TBC and that it's worth blizzard paying it any mind in 2021-2023.
---
Ironically they can ride the deathcharger which seems strange to me
---
I don't have beta, either, just basing this off my playing vanilla up through Naxx and never once having anyone dodge a spell with feign death/shadowmeld.
---
Rp pvpers should just do what ffxiv did. If theres no official server the community should pick a pvp server and all roll there
---
That brief period in cata was probably the last time I truly enjoyed retail.
---
I've played WoW and other games for months using GeForce Now on a 15 mbit/s connection, and that being a bad one (high latency, etc.) and never had problems. Single player games run amazing anyways, and in WoW I did everything but raiding (never tried the latter either, though).
---
It also got popular because 1. Blizzard reputation at the time and the Warcraft RTS series popularity and 2. It took like half of eveeeery existing MMO's population, instantly. And then it only got worse, because in the MMO's we were playing at the time, like daoc, ao, uo, eq, ac etc, our guilds were missing so many key members. Health of the games just plummeted and most people jumped on board to WoW. I wish I was one of those, but I was loyal to DAoC and didn't come to WoW til TBC. Now, I get to live that vanilla experience. Can't wait!
---
&lt;Those Who Remain&gt; Alliance, PVP, PVE, hardcore and casual welcome. 
---
&lt;Those Who Remain&gt; is a guild coming to WoW classic that wants to enjoy the game the way it was originally intended. We are a community looking to have fun and help other players. Wether you’ve been around since launch, just started today or anywhere in between, we have a place for you. Our guild will be progressing raids and doing occasional PvP/world PvP
---
Accepting of hardcore and casual.
---
For the Alliance!
---
Raids specific schedule yet to be determined(most likely weekday evenings and weekends)
---
PvP and World PvP scheduled event yet to be determined. (We have some hardcore always willing to PvP)
---
GMT-8
---
Msg me for additional details or for the discord so you can meet the team and see if we are your style
---
That is not something that happens in 1.12, my friend.
---
a little more effort next time pls
---
at least pretend you aren't just posting your video here to get views
---
You cannot shadowmeld in combat in Vanilla.
---
Ok dude acting hard about a video game.
---
I raifed seriously all the way till WoD. Fights like heroic Rag or paragon of klaxxi or black hand were 100x more complex than anything in classic.
---
I loved classic but you can't pretend the number of days it  takes to clear a raid means anything. Today's hardcore guilds are a totally different animal and so are the bosses.
---
Of course it has real world applications. If you have unlimited chances to get your first attempt right, your odds of 6 more repeated successes are much larger than if you need 7 successes with only 1 chance to get it right.
---
It's actually a vital part of statistical comprehension.
---
You’re unnecessarily antagonistic.
---
Marks were in vanilla very early on.
---
Pve means "I don't want to die to anything but mobs since they can't camp / grief"
---
&gt; You don't have to be a smartass   
---
And you don't need to be a jackass. But actually you were.   
---
Taunt generates enough threat to match whoever is currently at the top of the aggro table. If you use it on a pull the amount of threat it generates is minimum and it won't keep aggro off of the healers.    
---
But you go ahead and try Voidwalker tanking using a 2 minute cooldown and let me know how it goes.
---
We'll be testing all proc weapons as the become available on the beta, but don't get your hopes up.

thank you very much
---
Totally viable if you dont plan on joining a min/max hardcore guild. Play what you want man!
---
Well, that sounds a lot like optimizing your raid comp, not "hating locks". I mean, that's exactly what hardcore guilds are about - optimization. That's why I'm not in a hardcore guild myself
---
Priest main with druid alt. Just because you like a class doesn't mean you should bury your head in the sand... Be realistic about the upsides and downsides or you'll be sorely disappointed, especially with specs in classic. Temper your expectations.
---
Tanking as a druid isn't easy, by any stretch of the imagination. It's way more viable in 1.12 than in previous patches, but *you need to put in a lot of work to make it viable*. You need to show up with all your consumables, including MCP, and several gear sets to pull your weight. You need to know what you're bringing to the table, and where you won't be able to compete.
---
Feral tanks bring high aggro, better tankiness vs. non physical bosses, brez, the ability to switch between healing/dps and off tank, easier loot distribution (since you have one less tank competing for plate gear, and a dump for all the tanking leather), but that's it. They can be useful, and it can be competitive to bring them, but if you don't have MCP you're losing out on the threat and now they take a huge back seat behind warr tanks. There's zero chance you can be MT/OT and will instead be relegated to tanking adds.
---
You *can* do it without MCP, but if that's an issue for you, you should probably just stick to healing/feral DPS. You'll just give feral tanks an even worse reputation.
---
Man this brings back memories from leveling a rogue earrrrly tbc. Especially the "saving cooldowns in case I get pvp jumped". Slowed down leveling so much haha.
---
some people are optimizing and planning, some are not.
---
People don't really make reddit posts about how unprepared they are?
---
Thanks mate! I thought the intro was a tad too long but i wanted to do a short introduction bout myself and the rules. The following vids wont take any longer than 30s to get into it! :)
---
Compared to how I remember them it's difficult to say since I can't remember details like that from 14 years ago unless it stood out. Compared to private servers most things are different but that's to be expected, the prime example being the cats eye emerald and the samophlange pages. I've done it two times now and both times the quests was complete by the time I got to the boss, on private servers I could spend an hour in that cave.
---
I started the game in January 2005. I've seen it all. Different people have different opinions. The classic crowd seems like a huge cult.
---
I didn't say that it did. I asked if you believe it should be possible.
---
Time is money friend.

&lt;Nemesis&gt;
---
Server: PvP
---
Method : Semi-Hardcore w/ Loot Council
---
Raid Times: Monday, Wednesday at 8pm CST. 
---
&lt;Nemesis&gt; is a brand new guild created by long term players who raided into Naxx when Vanilla was live. More recently we have been playing on private servers. We are older now and realize that life sometimes gets in the way of this game we love so much. We can’t play at all times like we used to so we need to make the most of it. What makes Vanilla WoW so special is the journey and the community you enjoy it with. We are building a family and we hope you consider joining us if you’d like to be a part of that.
---
&lt;Nemesis&gt; will be focused on competing with three day guilds while maintaining a two day weekly raid schedule. However we are taking a few days off for the initial push to 60. We are currently planning to do Ony/MC exactly one month after launch. We will make the most of our raid times and expect all of our members to be prepared and consistent. We may not exactly be a server first competitive guild for phase 1, but we plan to clear all other phases within the first lockout they are released. As we evolve we will rival most hardcore guilds through later phases while keeping our raid days to a minimum.
---
We are recruiting both extremely experienced and newer players who are willing to grow and develop with our team. All members are expected to handle coaching well, and be patient with loot. It comes so slowly in vanilla but it will come. Every person in the raid team will be expected to come with consumables and flasks for progression. We do anticipate having some newer players in the guild so we need patient members who are willing to help guide and assist our newbies.
---
On our off nights we plan to do 20 man raids or PvP. We love both organized battleground teams and world PvP. 
---
If you’re interested in joining our team please contact us on discord for more information.
---
Kasualty#3759, Spartda#7299, Mistake#2003
---
Well if you are looking for a tank AND a healer then you might aswell spam pepehands...
---
Best thing we can do is just sip our monster ultra zero, and mow our lawns while waiting for classic to launch.
---
I think the video speaks for itself, and I am not the creator of this video, but I take your critique into consideration.
---
I can update my original post to reflect it isn’t mine if you want. Do you want me to do that ?
---
I don't think it'll make a difference. There will be a guild out there for every kind of player and their spec.
---
Nice attempt at a high road papa, enjoy 8.2!
---
I'm sticking with #nochanges
---
Wow already has a click based movment system. So you could even play on a touch based windows tablet
---
Upvoting because damn.
---
Different specs were made a lot more viable sometime around Karazhan, IIRC. The particular ones that come to mind were feral tank druids, enhancement shaman, and boomkin druids.
---
What's not to like?
---
I’m gonna maybe bring a consumable if I can afford it on my retribution paladin
---
Lol this wouldn't get you a single combat 99 level in OSRS.  This is a manageable grind :)
---
You can't even talk to other MMO players about this either.  They just don't understand if they haven't been in it.  What's funny is when they die inside the spawn area and your standing outside of it, debating if you should try to go get the quest loot of the corpse or wait for another border spawn to pull away.  Rawrgueglgurglgurgle
---
Seriously. A lot of people don’t even realize how hard the grind is, especially for these alt specs. Like feral Druid. You know their BiS helm is a blue drop from UBRS until Phase 4. Ohh wait, they can grind to Rank 13 - something that less than 0.1% of players will ever achieve (by design) that takes 16 hours a day for several months and get something marginally better in Phase 3.
---
Meanwhile, all the Resto Druids are going to be rolling in the loot because that’s what the PvE gear is itemized for, and then they’re gonna outbid you on DKP when the rare, fun off-spec loot drops off that one specific boss. 
---
There is a reason no one ran these classes in Vanilla. Or if they did, it was an off-spec for one specific fight or one random officer in that one guild who paid their dues as a part of the rank and files as a healer or whatever. 
---
My server saw 1 Horde side Thunderfury in the first year. Your Fury Warrior probably isn’t getting it, it’s gonna go to the MT who has never missed a raid and realizes it’s the best tanking weapon in the game.
---
Your whole guild isn’t making rank 12 at a minimum. 
---
People just don’t realize how hard the grind in Classic is. They’ve been spoiled by PServers.
---
Have source on this? In my knowledge it resets and doesnt only "drops 5 gold" and was not a month was weekly at the same day that pvp ranks updated
---
I started playing WC2 in like 1996 when I was 11, I think.  I called in sick to work and almost got fired the day WC3 came out.  I was into EQ in high school, but joined that craze after the 2nd or 3rd expansion I think, so wasn't ever on the cusp of new content.  When I heard about WoW I knew it was going to be great.  Got super lucky and got a closed beta invite in June 2004.
---
The funniest part about these min / max threads is that min maxers is how little they seem to give a fuck. 
---
Every thread is started by someone wanting to play a meme spec and all the responses are the same. 
---
At the end of the day, min maxers are not going to care what spec you play. You won’t even be on their radar. 
---
Stop worrying about it. Y’all hate min maxers so much as if you’d be playing with them anyway lol
---
I expect them to be like Vanilla.
---
Anyone that never played Vanilla will stick to killing alligators in stv for 3 hours :)
---
Low effort bait, move along.
---
You could still get a raid spot as a suboptimal spec just because they want 40 people.
---
It took 71 kills for IDDQD to get the Glowing Soul Gem for The Tower of Althalaxx [on stream](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/433772097?t=02h19m31s)
---
Quest helpers was a thing in 2005 so it's more than fine
---
isn't it crazy how a lowbie quest could have one of the most powerful items in the game, and you'd only be able to use it once.
---
Made an Undead Mage on a PvP server as my first character because I thought it looked cool. At Level 8 or so my friend told me that PvP servers are stupid and the Alliance was so much cooler. So I rolled a Dwarf Paladin. Leveled it to Level 60, sucked at it, didn't enjoy it and went back to my Undead Mage. Played it ever since. Best decision of my WoW career. FOR THE HORDE!
---
im hoping people start to realize with proper planning most specs can be more viable.
---
if someone really wants to ret dps for example, then they should be able to prove themselves, but if they expect to gear like a warrior and not use consumes and be able to raid, then they are gonna be disappointing.
---
However on the flip side other people pick a class like warrior, rogue, or mage cuz they wanna be top dps, but they use w.e bis chart they find, never learn how to gear properly and dont use consumes. You can easily plan a bit better than your average person and outshine these "top dps" classes.
---
Oh so every tank before getting fully geared from bwl basically...
---
The snowflake weirdboy got butt hurt. Who would have seen that coming LOL thanks for proving my point bud. 🤣
---
This is a serious question.
---
Theres also other issues that dont fall into the realm of the disorders youre talking about, but still have a pretty big impact.
---
I dont mind tanking, but my memory is absolute garbage.  Remembering every little trick, where to go, etc is absolutely impossible for me because of it.  I'd rather not let a group down, so i just flat out dont do M+ and whatever on retail. (even on my DPS/healers, but i just dont even bother playing my tanks all all...because whats the point when you dont want to do group content?)
---
It sucks, i used to really enjoy tanking, but theres just too many dungeons to remember, and way too many little niche things about the various dungeons now (every damn pull has something special now, it seems like).
---
Combine that with having to worry about active mitigation and i just havent had fun in retail with tanking since at least Legion, and really probably since the end of MoP.
---
Ill be going heals on Classic, but i do look forward to having an alt tank to mess around on.  Things are just much simpler, which is easier for me to deal with.
---
There is progression and farming.
---
You joined when pugs were able to farm it -
---
If you plan on killing Ragnaros in 2019, join a guild and participate - don't expect to get carried through  :)
---
As others have already said, a healing Priest can fulfill the only role of Shadow Priests, however that spec is pretty much useless outside of raiding, so if you join a less hardcore guild you should be fine as most guilds would rather have a happy and dedicated Shadow Priest than forcing somebody to play an extremely niche spec imo. 
---
Regarding dedication, prepare to farm a shitton of consumables. And accept the fact that on most pieces of gear which you need for PvP your priority will be below Mages and Warlocks because they scale better.
---
You will get prio on Lok’Amir though.
---
Huh. For some reason I remember it being wildly mana inefficient. It has been a long ass time, though.
---
You sound like such a twat. Fat, cringelord RP-loser. Get a grip.
---
Spec optimization for all but 15 or so raiders wasn't really necessary until AQ40. Not to say the roles weren't cookie cutter, but you don't need 12 resto/holy specced healers to clear MC/BWL.
---
No it isn't.
---
Agreed, nice to here some unbiased feedback
---
He’s in my feed. I don’t watch his content. ;) I tried watching is content but it is very poor.
---
Next great expansion! Mobile! Don’t you have a phone?
---
This was my understanding, if someone can provide any sauce to the contrary I would happily be corrected.
---
I thought wrong. Didn't know they announced that.
---
That's the kind of nerd I was back then. Like the world of warcraft waterboy
---
I'd be fine with it. There are certain classes that need it for sure. It wouldn't be hard to figure out the power threshold on it either, when you have perfectly good items/classes to compare it to.
---
How does mob tagging with exp work? Let's say my brother who's level 20 tags a mob and them my level 60 kills it. How much exp do they Get? Is there a difference if they are in th3 party or not? Etc
---
No changes for 2.5 - 3 years. If people start getting bored and have kel'thuzad on farm status, then explore adding new content. Not all specs were viable for end game raiding, but they were fun in the world for the people that knew what they were doing with them. Raiding is not the whole game.
---
Looking for a US West coast raiding guild that also pvps. Raid times would be after 7pm pst and ideally during he week.
---
I intend to main a warlock with enchanting and tailoring. I played in vanilla when I was 9, but sucked too much to even get to 60.
---
Yes it is. Just because someone asks something you don't like doesn't make them a troll.
---
As politely as possible how the hell could you possibly known then?
---
no, this is a Wendy's
---
both have terrible drop rates on beta
---
Esfand xD
---
not op, just guessing. Over all population will probably be down after the launch. We see it will all expansions they boom at the start and then decline until content patches revitalize, then decay again but generally not as high as the initial release. However the experienced population can increase because you will see the players because there may have been multiple layers being used even days before the new phase is released.
---
Thanks. Yes this is exactly my thinking behind it.
---
i remember there was a way to power level via instance grinding but i can't recall the exact details
---
V against it until we’re through naxx for a bit
---
I figured it would take a lot of numbers tuning. Some day - not with Classic release, but someday - I would like to see Vanilla the way the original developers *dreamed* of but never got the chance to create.
---
Toxic people were not welcomed on my groups, guild and server. I remember messaging guild leaders to kick ninjas from the guild. Immature people we would not get invites in groups. It was easy to remember those names on a classic server. I heard stories where people had to change servers.
---
Believe in what you will, but from my village, and from your city, we can both play on a console. I doubt you'll use stadia once in a flight which the switch is totally capable of, on a cruise, in cave or just in the small village you go on trip. I'm sorry to say that this technology, the one you see as : the future™ has flaw directly inherited from their distribution model.
---
Because yes, stadia is just for playing anywhere, the any device has already free implementations, I already play FFXIV on my phone with a controller with just a nvidia card, and it's 1080p60fps, flawless, even with my bad internet. 200 euros for all my game library (and more, emulators..) on all my local network.
---
But hey, in the end, we'll see once it's out if it's out.
---
In that case the answer is: in the context of WoW, probably not unless the other player fucks up really bad. In (MMO)RPG PvP equipment/character progression and rock-paper-scissors type class matchups are typically highly important, and Classic WoW is no exception.
---
From a game design perspective though there is nothing fundamentally wrong about that. To continue on the Counter-Strike parallel, a player with a cheap pistol or a shotgun in that game can still beat out another player with a much more expensive weapon if the conditions are favourable for them (or they grossly outplay them), and that's perfectly fine.
---
This is the sauce, thank you sir!
---
True
---
&gt; Really makes you wonder how Blizzard will move forward in the future if retail performs significantly worse than classic.
---
A lot of awkward Bill Lumbar internal meetings, would be my guess.
---
"Soooo yeah... uhhhh.... we're gonna need you guys to just stop everything you're doing... apparently players enjoy re-playing old content more than your new content you just made.... yeah....... so.... that's not good...... "
---
Pretty sure I can mark on pservers at least, so should be fine on classic too.
---
I dont. I think this
---
Well, two of them are brought in for the tranq shot gimmick at least.
---
&gt;Taunt generates enough threat
---
Ah, so I was right, and you were wrong. Taunt generates threat, thus VW has an AOE threat ability. It doesn't go further than that.
---
I also never claimed VW tanking was viable - it's just useful to know that taunts do generate threat.
---
You should read before you try and correct people by making ignorant claims. I wasn't being a jackass - if you're offended by someone correcting you, you'll never improve as a person, and that's just sad.
---
Glhf in classic :)
---
ok
---
Stop it.
---
What's funny is by killing every rogue, you will also be opening yourself up to get camped by rogues who normally would leave you alone lol, but I can see why you would want to kill all rogues on sight just based on principle.
---
While leveling up I personally only really attack the opposite faction if they attack first. That way I don't feel remorse when I wait til they pull some mobs to stunlock them haha
---
This exact post is why I think Blizz should just add onto vanilla, and do what they originally wanted to do with the game; like hyjal and azshara, maybe even throw us a 60 kara
---
Have you played on private servers? Kel'Thuzad will be on farm status for the elite guilds after the first clear which will happen on day 1. On the less elite guilds he will be on farm status within 2 months of release. TBC itself came out less than 2.5 years after the release, and you want to wait that long for some extra items?
---
It's a lazy argument from the classic cult to try and convince people everything was better back in 2004. There were lots of lucrative things you could do like fish for fish feast mats or gather Lichbloom for alchemists or mats for tailoring cloth or saronite for JC's.
---
#\#NoMeansNo
---
#\#NoChanges
---
weird flex
---
Stop acting like you're the only person who played vanilla.
---
it doesn't weight stats, it shows you what bonuses each stat gives, that's something completely different
---
Pretty sure I grinded harpies in Azshara from 42~50 or something like that, lol.
---
&gt;Google it if you don't believe me
---
Well fuck my search history.
---
And an even shorter time with all of the travel and training accounted for takes 4 days 20 hours...  This theory crafted method without travel and straight up killing same level mobs at 2 per minute is longer than the world record.  Not worth it to even think about.
---
At one point a week or so ago I saw someone saying a class/spec doing 299 dps on a fight that required 300 dps (per person) wasn't viable...  As if every single other class on said hypothetical fight will do exactly 300 dps and the 299 person will be to blame for the .01% wipe.
---
As long as you aren't waiting until it has been grey for a while, then you'll get the same xp out of it at level 15 or 17 or 19. So just turn in your quests when you're done.
---
My friends forced me to switch from CS because apperantly it was "shitballs epic" and here I am 15 years later with an active subscription since cause I hope for a beta invite
---
All they have to do is simply NOT make cross server PVE a thing.
---
I don't know the exact math, but based on what I remember - XP gain was based on the highest level person in the group. Meaning if I am level 50 and I kill a level 51 mob, I get a little extra xp since the mob is higher level than me and if I kill a level 49 mob I get a little less xp since it's lower than me. 
---
If a lower level player groups with a higher level player, for instance a level 20 with a level 50, the xp gain per mob would be based on the level 50 players "con" rating to the mobs being killed. That quantity of xp would be used in the calculation for group XP, so it prevented things like level 60 mages getting a group of level 5's together and mass farming level 55-60 mobs for turbo-xp gain like what you could do in other MMO's of the time.
---
There are ways to get around this, but they're complicated and involve dropping group in certain ways. They're also not really all that time efficient. Your best bet is to level normally, and if you want a buddy to rush you just get a bunch of dungeon quests and have them rush you once to get all the quest xp. It'll be faster than trying to game the system.
---
You’ll get invited to raids if you’re -the- druid. True druids have little competition for tier gear, but most raids also won’t bring many druids. And the gear you get from raids will be healing gear, so no, you’re probably gonna need a PvP set to PvP.
---
It does very little PvE damage. It is absolutely fantastic in PvP. When that Seal of Command procs it feels great!
---
Resilience was a good addition. Arena was the problem.
---
If you need more survivability, you have resilience gear, if you want to be more powerful you go for PvE gear. Then you mix both gear to have enough survivability and all the PvE gear possible.
---
Things like BGs and open world PvP allows you to rely on things like terrain, other players and being able to revive. For example, you are in AV, in a ~10vs10 fight, there good positioning and spatial awareness goes a really long way, while in arena you have almost no terrain, almost no other players, and dying is never a good option. So you start experiment with PvP/PvE gear. Maybe you are in a premade, so you bring more PvE gear, or you go solo, so you equip full PvP. In arena you needed X amount of resilience, then you go for PvE gear, 0 choice.
---
there are going to be a ton of new player posts about their experiences with a 15 year old game... like,a lot
---
That sub is dead. I'd rather not wait 2 days just to get 1 reply from 1 person. Also, that sub is geared towards people who already want post-Naxx content, so I'm guessing 99% of them will be for this idea.
---
Calm down Annie.
---
It's more about the freedom, than the feeling of swooping.
---
The first rule of English. There are no rules.
---
Do it without the whiny attitude then.
---
just sick of people posting videos here with no comment over and over again.
---
Yeah exactly. I remember using it back then. Just was suprised wondering if they will do it through the Twitch app also with other addons and have a "classic" section
---
Yeah oké true. But these people crossed moral lines. I have always been controversial myself. And I used to feel part of the community. I still do in wc3. Not very much in wow anymore. I always get flamed.. I feel the community has lost it open mindedness and fell to gentrification
---
I guess there is a difference between 'current' and 'relevant'
---
&gt;Orc Shaman - Fuck it I just want to be able to hit things hard occasionally with a big axe and heal the rest of the time
---
ftfy
---
High level leaves the group right before aoeing the whole dungeon.  That way low level gets all the xp.  There’s a 1 min window where the high level can remain inside the dungeon before being teleported to the nearest graveyard.
---
Most people could be carried in 3v3 by a Druid/Warrior/X comp to a reasonable rating. I don’t remember the requirement for weapons off the top of my head though.
---
**&lt;Rewind&gt; \[A\] \[EU-PVP\]** Hardcore 2-Day Raiding Guild \[English Speaking\]
---
**About us**
---
Rewind is primarily comprised of a large core of ex-ScrubBusters and ex-Immersion players (approx. 20 of us), between us we have multiple top 10 - 15 world kills and many top 100 world kills. Most of us have been playing since release and have known each other for many years.
---
We are looking for similarly minded players who want to clear content in a timely manner and be competitive in doing so. We will begin raiding as soon as possible after release. It is not at all required but may interest you to know that a considerable number of us have booked off the first two weeks from launch for levelling.
---
Loot will be distributed via a transparent Loot Council, [see details here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g3ihoYIoIPKHbw1tpodrUiQxmjwRUJl_SxazQP1BvAg/edit?usp=sharing).

How does that compare to a low drop rate quest?
---
It will be fine the first month or so because there will not be any 60's, and anyone that wastes their time doing world pvp will just be making the time until they get to 60 longer and putting them at a disadvantage.
---
Three months in, however... Yeah good luck with that
---
Oh really? I always figured if it was green it was less, TIL
---
So can you offer any advice to someone wanting to play shadow priest in vanilla wanting to get gear for pvp?
---
Did you heal during that time?
---
If you have enough Warlocks, SW is enough of a DPS increase to make it worthvile. Boomkins 5% Crit won’t be an increase in raid DPs due to their abysmal damage and Ret contributes nothing to a raid which a Holy couldn’t. 
---
I think most Priest players would rather play the conventional healing builds or go Shadow over a PI/SW build which is useless outside of raids and respecs are quite expensive as a healer. I think having a Shadow Priest if they have enough Warlocks is a compromise which most guilds (except the most hardcore ones) are going to make.
---
Guess I’m rolling hunter now
---
You must be new here.
---
So you can agree that some imbalance is a bad or toxic thing to have? 
---
I would also insist that you stop trying to use a shooter as a comparison. By nature, those games are meant to have skill as the all time determining factor for the winner. Gear/loadouts/guns are variables, sure, but it's not like an MMO where your gear generally indicates how well you "should" do in PvP.
---
I disagree with some semantics, but I primarily agree. Controversial tho
---
I've been playing since open beta back in '04, the #NoChanges crowd doesn't speak for me. 
---
I'm part of the #VirtuallyNoChanges crowd.
---
We once had an AV that started Friday evening and the big part of the groups from both sides were still playing sometime on Saturday Evening.  
---
Some went to sleep and came back into the very same AV Match still going on at that point.  
---
It was insane but one of the unmatched times when it came to fun.  
---
I don't even remember anymore who won but it didn't matter at all probably at that point lol
---
N O
---
O
---
Okay, so you're mainly focusing on PvE and I'm on PvP. Nevertheless you *absolutely can* clear raids with Rets, only slower than with the perfect meta raid comp.
---
&gt; stick to killing alligators in stv for 3 hours :) 
---
Ahh, sorry, thought this was a grinding related comment.
---
It’s the accepted belief based on people’s memory and private sever data. I myself only remember respeccing once, maybe twice in vanilla thru the end of BC because it was so cost prohibitive (plus no other specs were really viable for pallys at max level). I don’t believe blizzard has officially confirmed the reset rate for classic, but assume it’s going to cap out at max value and stay there if you respec even just once per week.
---
You forgot stonard. Sending people to that zone was so fucking funny.
---
Literally anything is "viable".  The word is so pointless.  Is raiding as a boomkin viable?  Sure I guess you can make it "work".
---
I check this sub from time to time. Don't post much.
---
Azshara Satyrs are a huge grind spot for felcloth and assorted grays, whites, greens, and runecloth.
---
&gt; I'm not talking about PvP.
---
Well everyone else is, so...
---
I refuse to acknowledge it, because you're cherry-picking your numbers.
---
Now you're adding the stipulation that only the cost within the expansion matters.
---
If someone didn't get 280% riding in TBC, it was still 5K to buy it in WotLK.  This also applies to new players and alts.
---
If you already have 280% riding in TBC, then it didn't cost 1K to get 280% in Northrend.  It cost 1K to unlock a skill you already had.
---
You just want to say it was cheaper, and it wasn't.  It's just that you already had the skill.
---
Idk why you're worried about meters when hunters bring a lot of utility to anything they do. Nobody should be worried about raid spots in a game with 40 man raids unless you're planning on joining a guild that literally min-maxes down to the race/class combo. Play what you find fun and learn how to play your class to the best of your ability and you'll be fine.
---
I plan on going mining/skinning to level for the extra gold, and at 60 drop one for engi.
---
Engi is a lot of fun from my memories of vanilla, but dont fall in to the trap of doing something you dont want to, because it's most optimal from a min/max standpoint. If LW/skinning sounds more enjoyable, then do that.
---
Aside from a feral druid. Can't use gadjets or nades in forms 😢
---
First casualty of War man
---
What you are saying makes sense, but the point of classic wow is to keeping it classic wow. People like the game as it is, in its entirety. People have been playing strictly vanilla pservers for years.
---
And flame sacs used for fire resistance potion in MC and BWL not to mention skins.  Alliance are lucky for the low level whelps in wetlands.
---
Yes, kinda. Kazzak of course will go supreme after three minutes and start spamming the shadowbolt volley and murdering your raid, or city if he happens to be pulled into Stormwind. 
---
In MC/BWL/ZG I don't think there are any enrages apart from the "enrage" ability where your hunter has to use tranquilizing shot. 
---
In AQ40 there start to appear soft enrage fights where the boss will permanently enrage and you have to kill it quickly or wipe. Huhuran will start doing volley every two seconds or so and Ouro will sweep and spawn popcorn. I can't remember if Sartura does anything, I think he has a hard enrage instead.
---
In Naxxramas you get a mix of both. Patchwerk will enrage at 5% so you have to kill him quickly and then berserk after 7 minutes and completely murder your raid.   
---
Loatheb has a unique enrage where you simply run into cooldown restrictions on your potions and with 1 minute cooldowns on heals you just can't prevent the damage and you'll die.   
---
Faerlina and Razuvius have similarly odd enrages where if you run out of adds to sacrifice or tank with you will die.
---
I vaguely remember doing this in SM Cath - run through to pull the final boss, which agros the whole cathedral, kite back to the entrance, low guy drops some sort of aoe ability to tag everything, then I leave group and burn them down. I don't remember if this was in Vanilla tho... lol
---
Nice questions
---
Warrior cannot PvP and PvE at top tier with the same spec.
---
PvE is Protection or Fury.
---
PvP is always Arms.
---
I'm not saying mana tide is bad. The reason why you go ele is mostly because the value of other things you can get is pretty low. As I said though. I'm not saying that mana tide is bad. I'm saying that if you are pulling the shaman out of the melee group just to mana tide your healers. You are taking a massive dps loss for that time that extends the fight. Which of course will cost you more mana. Most good guilds don't do that. As dark runes and mana pots should keep the healers topped off fine. Unless you have god awful dps.
---
Well I can tell you right now that people started getting burnt out waaaay before 2.5 years lol. If you want this game to be sustainable, something will eventually have to be done. People will not run the same raids over and over again for 2.5 years.
---
So while i see a lot of guilds planning on running an enhancement shaman in a melee group i say fuck that. Run it in the tank group, so for my guild me being the MT and my good buddy being OT in group 1 we are taking the Feral druid as well as the Enhancement shaman for totem twisting and maximizing TPS. We will both be running DW/Defiance builds as soon as possible so maximizing crit/ rage is going to be our top priority so all the dps groups can go full mongoloid. In a melee group we will be running a Twister shaman, aka a healer that will cast both wf followed by tranq air then heal twice.
---
&gt;Nevertheless you absolutely can clear raids with Rets, only slower than with the perfect meta raid comp.
---
You can clear raids. In cloth as holy. No ret carries.
---
First of all, it simply sounds like you're not the demographic this product is made for right now. Second of all, I do not consider this as "The Future". It's a neat way to play games in a manner that isn't really available right now?Example;
---
I see a streamer playing a game that I've not seen and want to try the game out myself. Click a button and start streaming the game to see how fun it is. Maybe I don't want to have a large physical collection of games or invest a gaming PC. Stadia is an option. 
---
You're trying to make this some sort of competition between your situation and what Stadia is offering. It's not.
---
Is Mayonnaise a valid vanilla WoW raiding spec?
---
Maybe if every streamer went to pve then I could see it. But Im pretty sure (with actual data to support this) that PvP has always been bigger than PvE.
---
Also ?? camping lowbies dosnt happen as much as you might think. Not unless you (the lowbie) camped the ??'s alt or something to that affect. Really the only time the ?? players get out of hand is when they chill in a quest hub for hours. Even then all you have to do is wait until they are chasing someone who hasnt been paying attention, rez get your quest and run out or die near something that will provide cover when you rez again. Really not that difficult.
---
That's consistent with around a 2% rate.
---
Okay. Maybe I can help you understand with this. Was it hard to get 6k in TBC, or was it harder to get 7K in WoTLK?
---
Yet here you are, saying dumb shit like "gamergater"
---
As someone who plays on P99 (Classic EQ server) for the last 10 years I can say this is going to be a big hit.  The amount of shit games nowadays makes us all long for when developers actually cared about their game, not just how many DLCs they can get out before its dead.
---
#**LIVE TO WIN**
---
Great post, I fully agree.
---
The start of my guild recruiting message will be: — is recruiting vanilla vets, wrath babies and newbies alike! 
---
The more players, the more it feels like the good ole’ days
---
You are so wrong it's hilarious. Any decent feral druid produces more threat than any warrior tank that doesn't have thunderfury, without mcp.
---
Yes I thought I read somewhere that Twitch was working on a Classic section. New addons for Classic are also popping up every day.
---
What you're not getting is that the prices of things are dependent on how quickly players can accumulate gold. Players will make much less gold per hour in Classic than in Retail.
---
Fair enough. 
---
&gt; Or that they need to actually outdo most rogues and warriors.
---
This won't be possible, though.
---
To pass the time I installed WOW for the first time in years. Made a rogue and I wanted to ninja loot all the dungeons to take my revenge 15 years ago. You can't even ninja loot anymore!  
---
Your right the community does need those toxic people to get rid of even more toxic people. Without ninjas there's no point to have trust in your teammates.
---
That is not true. You will see when Classic releases.
---
They will release content in phases and Naxx is phase 6. It's very possible at least a year will pass before Naxx is even released. Even more if they try to replicate the original release schedule.
---
As a warlock, i intend to unleash doomguards.
---
Mages are always in demand. Shammies, are much less so. You can probably make a case with your 40 man, to take 1 Enh or Ele sham
---
Male taurens were able to fit but females wasn’t?
---
GL at the imp cave at lvl4
---
Na they were definitely in vanilla. I remember because it was the Palys excuse for when someone would ask us why were meleeing the boss that we were just refreshing our judgment!

Shamans and bear druids use strength, as they didn't get AP from agility until later expansions.  Cats generally prefer strength while leveling because it benefits their bleeds more.  That being said, strength is good for any melee class while leveling, since relevant stats are hard enough to come by naturally.
---
I agree totally with this.  Especially at lower levels where quests are abundant in zones you should do nearly all of the quests as well as killing every single alive mob you come across that grants XP.
---
Nice Try Horde. :)
---
Tier pieces suck for druids. Except t3 and thats a token.
---
with everything on it :D
---
Are dishonorable kills a thing in the Beta or was that gone by 1.12?  I've forgotten at this point.
---
watching my brother's friend running around arathi highalnds as a gnome rogue (pretty sure it was arathi, definitely sure it was gnome rogue)
---
Nice back peddling. In your original post you quite obviously thought Voidwalker's suffering had the same 10 second cooldown/mechanics it has in retail. After discovering that it has a 2 minute cooldown, and that my point about AoE threat was completely on-point, rather than apologizing and moving on you're just doubling down on your arrogance.   
---
Your pedantic *correction* above was irrelevant. You forgot how Voidwalker's suffering works in classic. An AoE taunt wasn't mentioned at all in the thread before your post and your post adds nothing valuable to the discussion at all. Voidwalkers continue to have no AoE threat generating abilities in classic. Suffering in classic isn't one.    
---
But keep on doubling down, I'm sure it will work out fine.
---
It's easy now because now you are more skilled and more knowledge about the game.
---
Specifcially in mind enhancement shaman, oomkin, feralcat (but not as much as thebither 2), shadowpriest
---
Please read again. Im not saying I don't have time anymore, I just value my time more and thus want to minimize corpse runs.
---
We say draught (draft)  in Australia too!
---
Hi, /u/real_EMinc
---
that's all I'm asking man, just explain why I should spend time to watch this video among the thousands of others. low effort posts are the norm on this sub and it's really tiring.
---
Detect Magic (Mages). Low mana, instant cast, on demand trash debuff/dispel bait in PvP. So good.
---
The War Campaign was week-gated so that you had to wait for the next week to access the next part of the story.
---
There was also a quest in Stormsong Valley (i was horde, dont know if it was the same for ally) that advanced by one stage each week. It was some kind of quest line leading up to the reveal of old gods playing a larger role in the BfA expansion.
---
Pendulum is drum and bass
---
The best part was engaging with someone fighting a mob or two, getting them low as they're fighting, and letting the mobs kill them to increase their repair bill.
---
I just threw up
---
If you just want to screw around in World PvP and duels go for it, farm as a madman for consumables and try to find a casual/semi-hardcore guild, or grind out Rank 10 PvP gear. Due to scaling issues you will be a terror in the early phases, but your power level drops significantly as other classes get better gear.
---
If you want to actually get good gear and be useful in premades/large scale fights, play a Warlock.
---
More viable than with 8 debuff slots for sure. If you want to do well with a shadowpriest though you have to be very dedicated and farm a ton of mana pots and dark/demonic runes. Most guilds have a meh attitude to shadowpriests, rets, boomkins etc. They are there as supports to buff other classes and if they can do some dps/healing then that's just a bonus. On short fights you can actually do very well as a shadowpriest. Not top dps, but well into top 10.
---
Pretty sure it existed, but I also don't remember DK's being a huge deal to the point where people really avoided them. 
---
When the game launched there was no PvP tracking whatsoever, but that whole "Honorable Kill and Dishonorable Kill" system got added shortly after. 
---
People originally had massive wars in Southshore just for the fun of it.
---
Wait what?! I played a shaman throughout the entirety of Vanilla, and I couldn’t imagine anything in Elemental worth getting over Mana Tide totem. Even if you’re in the melee group, you’re still using Mana Tide regularly to keep your mana pool as full as possible.
---
It's not supposed to be retail.  It is supposed to be non-changing.  You are supposed to be able to take a break and come back to the same game, not an entirely new one.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I love Pally, I still have my Pally from back then, it’s my main. That said though, Paladins were kinda useless in raid progression in classic unless you were okay with being holy, which I wasn’t lol.
---
TOC was the first patch blizzard really pushed the catch up as well a bumping up the ilvl you can see how bad that was for people trying to get the healing mace.
---
It was the first patch blizzard pushed dailies too far as well.
---
If we ever got a wotlk server it would need changes to make toc a catch up raid like zg and za and not something that replaces ulduar.
---
ive been leveling a rogue on a TBC server (41 atm) so talents are slightly different. i’ve always gone combat for leveling but once I got to 29 i decided to change my spec to Sub/Ambush as i’d be in zones where there are more horde. Best decision i’ve made in WoW. Ambush 14/20 times (just tested) will crit and do 40-60%(20-30% non crit) the mobs HP (if you struggle with getting behind mobs, just use distract you can force them to face away from you), then i can just apply hemo, rupture, then pull another mob while that one dies from bleeds. Having prep to refresh CDs is especially great in PvP and gives a huge edge, or if you wanna pull 3+ mobs and have evasion up nearly the whole time.
---
I understand that. I'm not saying they should add a whole new set of items to start making the game super balanced, that's how the slippery slope starts.
---
I'm just saying that adding items here and there to actually make Druid or Paladin main tanks not a meme, or Paladin DPS not a meme, etc.
---
A lot of us really did. That's how you get the true AV experience. The 10-15 min AVs today are a joke.
---
On day one in phase 6, which is probably 2 years away.
---
I agree.  I think the "safe" side to err on is the time it takes for a 30 man raid to fully gear from one instance, doing the math this way:
---
MC clear = 10 bosses = 2.5 loot per boss (iirc) + trash mob loot (x5) = 30 items per clear.  Let's say being "fully geared" from MC means you have 8 items of loot from MC.   Using that math, it would only take 2 months (9 clears) to gear out a 30 man raid with 8 pieces of loot each.  Now, obviously there is some additional margin for error as drops can be repetitive, and items get DE'd, but it should be close to that.
---
If we expand that to the 40 man raid group size (unncessary for vanilla wow imo) then it would take slightly longer, more like 10-12 weeks instead.    But it shouldn't be over 3 months or it's going to be a problem.
---
Maybe. If you’re lucky.
---
All 40 with 4 min left - not bad!
---
Wish to see more of this on this subreddit. Sick of the private server elitism, gatekeeping, and stream man bad bs. Quit working against the success of the game.
---
The trick is having other deadlines!   
---
This warhammer wont paint itself you know. August is coming pretty fast to me tbh 😰🎨
---
Hunter too. They fall super far behind in later raids, unfortunately.
---
I find this interesting too. Way more than all the memes on the sub.
---
This is also roughly the same number of silithids you need to kill to reach neutral with brood of nozdormu before the aq gates open. Neat
---
Pwned pwned pwned
---
I think the benefit of not having daily playtime requirements like dailies or weeklies outside of just completing the raids is a benefit over Retail in regards to PvP servers.  Yes, you'll spend more time fighting the opposing faction, corpse running, or doing random world pvp, but the plus side is that with nothing required to be completed, then that time is not wasted, it's fun activity in a game that doesn't care if you spent all week in wpvp, or all week farming consumables.
---
With limited play time in modern retail wow, then yeah, I could see unwanted pvp being a hindrance.
---
You first said void had no AOE threat abilities. Then you admitted their AOE taunt generates threat. Now you're saying again that they have no AOE threat abilities.
---
Just think about that for a second.
---
PS correct information is never pedantic. Ignorant people like you make the world a worse place.
---
Not wasting any more time with you. Fuck out of here with your ignorance, you don't deserve classic if you're gonna be like that
---
Yes. Zygor is also working on a classic addon.
---
Probably similar to Diablo 3, better experience docked certainly.
---
A few new items is not an entirely new game. And I would actually argue that Classic isn't supposed to be a shot-for-shot remake of Vanilla, but it's a game that is supposed to recapture the magic of what made Vanilla so great in the first place: community and adventure. 
---
If they added ONE new item, would that ruin your Classic experience?
---
You do know that private servers for vanilla WoW have been running strong for over a decade right? People have been running the same raids for much longer than 2.5 years.
---
War campaign was rep gated
---
As someone who's going to level a rogue, this title already has me sick of bandages.
---
2,1k dps? Never.
---
MUH METERS!
---
Yeah the dev team have been 100% clear on no unauthentic additions https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo
---
I'm pretty sure STR was optimal for every melee dps, because that "some crit" was at best 0.05% depending on your class. It was just hard to get leather/mail with STR on it. 
---
The only class that preferred Agi over Strength was Hunters because you get 2 Ranged Attack Power for each point of Agi along with the dodge and crit, while STR didn't effect RAP at all.
---
My prediction, I could be completely wrong, they are releasing classic while working on WOW2.
---
My guess is 90% of day 1 people will not make it to 60.
---
it will be possible
---
i can see a few guilds allowing ret dps
---
especially if you lose your raid spot if you let the ret beat you XD
---
I want people to log in because they want to get something done, unlike many in retail who log in because the have to get something done. Way more enjoyable.
---
I made sure to end mine.  They won't last long with me around.
---
The only use for a tryhard Ret is to shame slacking Rogues and Warriors before kicking them out of the guild.
---
Merge servers then. I find this merged but not really status very odd. Just merge servers fully and be done with it. Half the players will get a new server assigned then. Or rename both servers completely.
---
The dungeon tool didn't instantly kill the server community as in the community didn't really understand the change at the time. It rather just fixed the issue of being able to do piss easy content that needed doing.
---
If you’re a hunter you need goblin jumper cables. You fuckers always feign death wipes, everyone will appreciate you.
---
&gt; i can see a few guilds allowing ret dps
---
They're usually just bad ones that never make any progress.
---
Ret pallies were seriously a meme in vanilla, dude.
---
Just out of curiosity why do you want a class like ret pally to be more viable? I couldn't imagine wanting to afk autoing during a boss encounter.
---
Sounds like you know nothing
---
Do you have specific classes you need. I plan on rolling a mage and would possibly like to join your guild.
---
Thank God, I thought I was the only one!
---
How to end this debate:
---
Agree to disagree. This sub will never be of "one" opinion.
---
But here are some facts: 
---
*Some players will not allow any sort of non optimal gear/spec.
---
*Some players will be ok with some wiggle room in optimized gear/specs.
---
*Some players couldnt care less about your spec.
---
*Some players will hunt unconventional specced ppl just for the sake of loling through MC with weird specs.
---
*And last: It will be harder to join guilds/groups/raids with some speccs. That is always what it comes down to. 
---
Now your job as a player is to decide: "Wadda you wanna do with your life!"..  I mean character... 
---
My tip to you would always be to go for the optimal spec when it comes to raiding, you can always gather offspecc gear along the ride and have fun with in 5mans or when raids are on farm. 
---
But don't let me or anyone tell you how to play this game, just know what your getting yourself into. 👍
---
Now copy paste this on every discussion and we can just all agree.. to disagree... 
---
/H
---
I don’t see them blocking Questie.  It’s like asking people not to alt-tab to check a guide.  
---
What’s interesting is Joana has an in-game addon in the works for his guide.  Wonder how that will turn out.
---
Yeah I guess the only folks who would care about the DKs would be those chasing rank 14, though those people and the groups they form to farm wpvp will be the majority of the ones that will make life spicy in Phase 2.
---
It definitely did happen in Vanilla. It just wasn't a widespread thing. There were small groups on each server that did it, and you basically had to be in a group like this in order to get to rank 14.
---
This is exactly what I was thinking. I still believe Warriors would be the best tanks, Rogues/Fury Wars best single-target DPS. Mage best overall DPS, but it would make it so that if you want to be a Paladin DPS in raids for example, you wouldn't get laughed at.
---
Downranking is a healer’s best friend.
---
Yeah, as far as I know Ion has never commented on how he plays. 
---
Only that Celestalon played on a high end pen tablet, with a keyboard.
---
You're correct on this, however if the cast completes it will land regardless of whether you are shadowmelded or f/d'd before the spell lands.
---
Already played Reign of Chaos and Frozen Throne.
---
Haha nice! My bad, I was just saying it is of British origin. 
---
It's uncommon here in the states, though. We turn English into mince meat.
---
People have been doing private servers much further in the past than 2.5 years and still play vanilla. People have asked for vanilla servers even in BC. Dudes have been playing vanilla for a decade I don’t think burnout is a thing for the people who have been fighting for years to get classic. Classic wow is like FF7 it will never die, because it’s an amazing game.
---
I think you forgot that Cataclysm had some difficult dungeons early on. There was huge complaints about it because people thought it was too hard. 
---
If anything, WotLK was super casual in difficulty, and they tried to fix that with Cata, but faced backlash. LFR was easy mode, but it didn’t come till the tail end of the expansion.
---
I wouldn't want to mess with you in case you sent those exilers after me!
---
Yeah sure, the problem is that the context of this entire thread is about World PvP and how bad it will be in Phase 2. If by his comment:
---
&gt;True, the amount of players will definitely be lower when phase 2 hits
---
he was trying to say that the game's total population will decrease, then that's both obvious and completely irrelevant to the discussion. So, it's unlikely that that's what he meant.
---
What's more likely is that he forgot about layering and the impact it will have on world PvP. Which is fine, and why I brought it up in my response. 
---
The problem is that instead of just saying something like "oh yeah I wasn't considering layering, that's true" he decided to go with a strategy of pretending to be stupid by claiming that his original comment really was about the game's total population. Which again, is completely irrelevant to the discussion.
---
If your an hybrid and don't heal you won't get an invite in my group. We always had troubles getting enough healers.
---
I mean we are British essentially ;) hahaha
---
Whats wrong with buffs? You rarely see tauren lone wolfs like you do with orc warriors. Back in the day all the op tauren warriors had healers following them 24/7 with or without bgs.
---
That is fixed by turning off max foreground and background fps. It's an issue in BFA too
---
I believe it's on a lower tier but I'm unsure.
---
I read somewhere that 90% of Vanilla players didn’t make it to 60 either
---
Early patches casters definately want to stack stam and int. Spell power isn't that great early on and more casts&gt; small damage increase especially for a control class like mage.
---
Looking for guild! - US, any day, UTC−03:00 time zone (preferred)
---
I'm a experienced PvPer who's been playing since the golden age of WotLK and returning from MoP into Classic! I'm really interested in raiding, though I'm fairly unexperienced at that.
---
Main tank but I'll always level up a hunter and mage for fun!
---
I'm also interested in RP if that's a thing. If it's not, whatever!
---
Eager to play! :)
---
This is kind of what I'm thinking. Or if by some miracle I'm still around I'll at least have had time to grind up an alt or two.
---
idk if that would work like it does with Vanish. You have to FD+Meld before the spell hits. Yes they're off the GCD but it still takes longer to register compared to Vanish.
---
Miss the mobile AH 😞
---
Yup, I definitely remember downranking and using that quite a bit... not chain heal, though. Maybe I was just on tank duty more often than not.
---
They still ran with multiple hunters and druids. Team lock eventually walked out and they had no warlocks at all in the raid. 10+ mages without their beloved curse suddenly did half damage and they didn't even get past Maexxna.
---
Let's hope Classic does well enough to make TBC happen again
---
Even then, its definitely not meme talk.  
---
I agree fully.
---
Lmao nah you guys have way more land and are more macho (than everyone tbh) since everything on your land mass is trying to kill you.
---
I will say, I'm one of those people who has trouble discerning the accents though ! Silly American.
---
if you stand outside you can keep chain casting it inside caves, as long as your character itself is considered "outside"
---
Thats exactly what i am saying. 
---
People have guides on where to go to the exact Point seeing as they have coordinates to the point. lol
---
I mean, it was definitely a thing back in the day for more casual guilds to not police specs too much. Especially because it wasn't easy for every guild to fill a 40-man raid.
---
And it became time gated after 8.1 or something.
---
Yes, but 1-3 Hunters are brought into endgame raids. Compare that to bringing several groups of warriors or rogues. No one wants to be some one button mechanic bitch who has extremely low chances to raid and poor performance.
---
The only benefit of being a hunter in a raid is that you have very little loot competition as a result of the fact that no one likes hunters enough to bring more than the literal minimum required.
---
Add in all the memes about trying to find 40 people tor your raid who aren’t brain-damaged troglodytes.
---
So it’s impossible for raid leaders to actually fill the raids without bringing someone who is sub-par.
---
It’s also impossible for someone playing a sub-par spec to find a raid slot, even if they’re intelligent, dedicated, and good at the class.
---
Something not adding up here...
---
Sounds like you have a great plan in place! I'm jealous..
---
That's one reason I thought about picking Warrior simply because of the challenge. We shall see!
---
Temple Trekking\*
---
Just because you CAN do something, does not mean you SHOULD do that thing.
---
You *absolutely can* kill Ony with 40 shadow priests. Doesn't mean you should do that.
---
I'm 24. No fucking clue what any of it means. Just noise. Twitch is fine but wtf is wrong with the chat?
---
That's a good point you're making about the game time. Getting the most out of game time when I was younger was pretty much the goal since it was a limited resource for me. Now I don't have to stress so much about logging in and getting X amount of work done. I can just do whatever I want at my own pace.
---
OH NO AHHHH MY INTERNET POINTS ARE GOING AWAY AHHHHH
---
shut up nerd
---
Forum PvP it is? hahaha!
---
Haters will say it's photoshopped
---
&gt; “you don’t compete against the boss you compete against other players...”
---
Uh that is if you choose to be in a sweaty guild.
---
I think I am communicating this poorly. There is nothing in the elemental tree you need to heal. The reason why people frequently go that spec in the modern meta is not because it helps with raids but, simply because things like mana tide are not generally needed. Maybe at launch there might be a month or two where the shaman rocks a mana tide but, in the long run. It won't be a thing.
---
The reason is simply that in early raids if your pre bis and, your dps isn't awful. Mana on your shaman should not be an issue and, Moving the shaman into the healing group to drop mana tide. Will lower the dps and extend the fight. Which will result in a net mana loss. 
---
So it's not that elemental tree is good for raiding. It's more like just that the resto tree is superfluous. So most people just take what they want. However all that being said. Maybe very early classic might have a phase where people use mana tide but, I don't think so.
---
Yeah I think if they aim for 12-16 weeks to release each phase everyone will be happy. The question is what do they do when they release naxx? We can't clear naxx for a year until tbc is ready
---
Where? I see no mention of PvP in this comment chain other than your 2nd comment.
---
Priest/Warrior leveling duo has always sounded so fun to me! I definitely wanna try that sometime with a buddy
---
People on this subreddit have been stewing in their own juices for far too long. 
---
Personally I think it's a really good idea, but after Naxx is done. Let people have their classic experience, and then when people are "done" with content per sey, make changes to the game like Runescape did, with the community supporting each update. I'd love to see currently un-viable specs made viable, maybe some new content, a reworking on the honour system so its not just about grinding for a month with no sleep. Quality of life stuff that doesn't ruin the ethos of Classic wow.
---
Fighting hogger. And the feeling of achievement I got from entering westfall.
---
Really want to play Retri Paladin, and dont wanna go Hpal tho ppl cry its useless. Then Its between, Mage or hunter which seems easy to lvl, then its rogue which is awesome endgame… but i usually love to heal so priest? but then pvp is gonna be booring…sigh nvm throwing dice.
---
We can’t decide for you whether you prefer being a DPS or a healer.
---
Someone was going to do it.
---
Can you do it across EK/Kalimdor?
---
My main draw to the alliance are those zones you mentioned, that's where I leveled my first characters. I'm spending the time before launch leveling a night elf or two on a private server so my choice of faction won't be determined by the leveling zones.
---
I legit regret not playing cataclysm just for missing out on difficoult dungeons.
---
Yeah, game is not hard. Sap and poly is not needed at all. Not even tanks are needed for most dungeons. We were doing smgy and SM lib without one easy. And the few times we brought a warrior he was 2h tanking.
---
Yeah rouges are the camping dicks I remember from vanilla they stick around for your alt and leave when you drop in with a main.
---
Didn't they nerf mob tagging on the beta? If I remember correctly, they made it so you lose xp if players you aren't grouped with damage the mob.
---
But yeah, the previous meta with powerleveling was mob-tagging in instances: Level 60 or multiples 60s group up the mobs and build threat on them without doing any damage doing things like healing, demo shout, etc... then using macros, the low level leaves or is kicked from the group, uses low level engineering bombs  to tag all the mobs, and the 60 or 60s kill everything and then re invite the low level after the pull.
---
Priest and hunter are pretty dissimilar classes. If you don't mind healing I would imagine priest will be more engaging in raids but hunter is more fun in world PvP. 
---
I don't feel like priest and paladin are great for leveling together. They both do pretty bad or inefficient dps. Hunter levels very quickly but you will be much faster than your buddy. It will feel like he's slowing you down.
---
You’re a pussy
---
These are absurdly inflated numbers. No one can *easily* hold 2.1k dps except some BIS, raid stacked fire mage camping ignite with 39 other people supporting him. And it's really not even his own damage.
---
Thank you for being the voice of all semi-decent rogues. I don’t understand how OP has struggled so much with killing mobs. I’m assuming lacking experience as a rogue (shown in the back and forth) or maybe lacking gear for the level they were? 
---
Still good on OP for posting this for everyone not in the Beta to get a new perspective.
---
Casual guilds will exist, sure, just as they do on retail. The DPS requirements on these will be more lax and I'm sure some lesser specs will be given spots.
---
But that doesn't mean the more serious guilds denying spots to weaker specs are wrong/bad. Any guild that calls itself a Raiding guild will most likely limit Hybrid DPS classes quite a bit. The hassle of getting 40 people isn't something you just casually do here and there. 
---
The funniest part is that PuGs for the raids are going to be 10x more strict than guild groups.
---
I can't remember what the technique is called, but it had to have been so effective
---
Do you whine about me beeing whiny?
---
And it’s *exactly* how I remember the Vanilla forums being!
---
I think the problem is that "casual" has no real definition when it comes to gaming.  It's so vague and changes based on the context.  Like yeah, WoW was more "casual" than EQ but EQ was more "casual" than other games.  And all MMO's might look "casual" to a D&amp;D or Tabletop Warhammer player...
---
Wottle-K was the most popular expansion because of the hype.  That cinematic had everybody jizzing over themselves, plus the lore behind Arthas that players had known since the Warcraft games, and the buildup of storming his fortress and taking him on (which was also helped by how good Ulduar was) kept people playing.  Cataclysm did not have that hype, and angering the players the way you described didn't help anything either.  All the new zones were spread out and needed portals to get to effectively and not enough had changed compared to TBC to WRATH, so players started leaving.
---
**&lt;The Tail** **End&gt; \[A\] \[US\] \[PvE\]**
---
A guild for fun leveling, and then raiding when we hit 60. We'll work to get each other pre-raid BiS those final few levels and in the weeks before starting MC. Raids are the last two days before rest, thus the name. :) Discord is already up and waiting for Classic release. I raided through AQ40 in vanilla, and plan to clear Naxx at some point. Not a super-hardcore guild, but not totally casual either. Effort is expected, but without dedicating your life to WoW.
---
**Raid: Sun/Mon 9-12 EST**
---
pls PM me, or join Discord at [https://discord.gg/KC9Au5a](https://discord.gg/KC9Au5a)
---
Rating sales were a great way to build community. Easy to sell 1800 rating going 7-3 each week :)
---
Oh no instead of clearing bwl in 32 minutes and 27 seconds since we have 2 boomkins it will be 32 minutes and 35 seconds d e a d w e i g h t
---
The game started going downhill upon release in Vanilla. If it weren’t for Vanilla, we wouldn’t have race/class combinations, raids, or pvp. It all started with the release of Vanilla
---
The true test of a clicker
---
It's not any amount of a dps increase, because you have to compare it to a PI/SW priest; not taking no SW at all. It's easier to lose 10-20% healing on one healer, vs. losing 50%+ dps on one dps slot. If there was no other way to get shadow weaving, sure; you could count the added damage as class damage, but that's not the case.
---
It's the same argument as saying a hunter with nightfall does more dps than a warrior because of all the extra dps on nightfall procs... It's just not accurate. You could replace that hunter with a fury warr, and even though it's a dps decrease over what the warr could do with an optimized weapons, it's still going to be way more damage over the hunter.
---
I agree that it's not an *ideal* spec, but many healers are going to be pretty locked into their specs as well. Priests are kinda lucky to get access to holy nova for AoE farming and solo content, I mean a resto sham, prot warr, or holy pally is going to be in the same boat as the PI/SW priest in terms of solo viability. PI/SW is not going to have any problems in 5-mans, so it's really just solo/pvp they are missing out on.
---
I hate that mobile gaming has developed such a terrible stigma.  There are actually some gems out there in what is otherwise a massive cesspool of F2P/P2W dumpster fires.... ANYWAY, if it weren't for that stigma, and if we could be ABSOLUTELY 100% GUARANTEED the mobile version would remain exactly the same as it's PC counterpart and not fall victim to mobile tropes, I wouldn't hate it.  Being able to log on to do some random rep farming or dailys would definitely come in handy from time to time.  However, even if it started out like I mentioned above, there is absolutely 0% chance that eventually some dickface at Activision would find a way to corrupt it.  It's pretty cool I must admit, but do what needs to be done, and throw this in a volcano before someone gets hurt.
---
Hundreds of thousands play private servers every day.
---
I’m curious about where your friend lives and his ISP though to put that restriction on him 🤔
---
I'm going to use websites if I need to for quests otherwise I'm going to try to just read them. But let's be honest I'll spend maybe 10 minutes wandering before I cheat, my time is more valuable than it was when I was young
---
4 strength 4 stam leather belt 😩
---
I'm just saying it's a stretch to call people delusional for thinking that they might be able to raid with feral. Now, if they think they'll be hitting Naxx? Sure.
---
Ya those two classes are so different it's not like we can even compare them.
---
You can do that on a laptop though?
---
Those are all awesome ideas, but are not in the spirit of classic. Classic has huge class imbalance, but that's just one of the quirks that make it what it is.
---
Tukui Classic + titan bar at top
---
I've seen this video a lot of times but not in a long time. Nice find.
---
I can releate, was doing RFD and the pally healer rolled need on a cloth chest.
---
What elemental ability buffs casters? Tranquil air totem and... Mana spring?
---
This may be a joke, but I actually do have Moonlight Streamer setup on my PC and Phone and can easily play retail with the Console Port Add-on.
---
What kind of fucking police state does your friend live in?
---
Brings a totally new meaning to the phrase "getting laid" eh? Lol.
---
Yes very true. Missiles will still hit!
---
I agree man.  Some people call this sub toxic, which I don't think is accurate.  I've been on toxic subs - this isn't that.
---
But this sub could be a fucking posterboy for /r/gatekeeping.
---
I always used to use Dampen and Amplify as a mage (dependant on scenario)
---
You know that those were different servers, right? If it was the same private server running the same content for 3+ years you would have a point. But in reality what happens is that a new server comes out, and all of the players flock over to that one to start from the beginning and turn the old server into a ghost town. They new server slowly releases content every few months until they release Naxx and the whole cycle repeats itself.
---
That's my point that I made earlier.  The cost didn't change.  The ease of obtaining the cost did.
---
But you're making it sound like it was all centered around flying, and it wasn't.  You're getting your cause and effect mixed up.
---
Blizzard didn't sit around and say "we need to make 280% flying easier to get, so we'll make more money available to players."  They sat around and said "we need to make people actually do the WotLK dailies instead of the TBC dailies, so we need to make them give 3x the gold."
---
You are correct it was easier to get 280% flying in WotLK.  But you make it sound like that is what sparked the failure in the economy, when it was just a byproduct of that failure.
---
Wasn’t thick changed in a tbc patch or later? I distinctly remember getting mortal striked through pillars by Tauren warriors In arena.
---
49" seems way too big, I think 34" is about the max which is what I use.
---
&gt;  correct information is never pedantic   
---
I agree. Irrelevant info is however. Thus my point, and thus why your posts here don't add value.    
---
It is fine that you thought Suffering had a 10 second cooldown and acted as an AoE threat generator, it has been like that a long time. It is less fine that you won't just admit that and we can move on however.
---
Wut
---
I would love for them to add stuff AFTER vanilla. But i do not want them to MODIFY the vanilla.
---
Keep old the same, but feel free to add new after.
---
I was actually wondering the same thing and found a few Addons like https://www.curbitssoftware.com/wow-quest-text-reader/
---
Idk if they will work in classic though.

Like the role of Ret dps in a raid is to reveal who sucks, so you better beat the ret dps or you lose your spot
---
4 STRENGTH 4 STAM LEATHER BELT AHHHH UGGGGHHHHHH
---
I played a dwarf priest on a pserver up to level 40 and it was pretty fun, getting groups was so easy and healing isn't that hard. Levelling is pretty boring but consistent. Shadow is a fun playstyle as well.
---
But man,  I  feel the pull of the Mage. They just have so much utility. I doubt they'd struggle to get in to a group either just because of Polymoprh and conjuring food and drinks. I love that they have portals which is so good for Classic with no mounts before 40 and much less ways of travelling around. Blink is great for speed too, plus free food and drink. 
---
I like being useful, and you can't get much more useful than a healer, but I think on the day I'm going to close my eyes and click "mage" on the character create screen.
---
Its dumb when people are like "WoW was always a casual MMO, therefore Classic is exactly the same as BFA because they are both casual"
---
There is a great range of difficulty an MMO can have.  Vanilla found the right balance of it.  Easier than EQ, harder than the garbage we have now.
---
Go priest and paladin baby!
---
What even is this rambling mess of a post?
---
Priest is a surprisingly efficient leveler, but grouping up with a Paladin would definitely slow it down as well.
---
I just want all specs to be somewhat viable. Currently, the only way to even be competitive with meme specs is to be fucking elite at whatever it is you're doing and geared like a god.
---
On OSRS this quest would be:
---
One Small Favour - Kill a single Murloc
---
I better understand what you’re saying now, and I appreciate you taking the time to elaborate, thank you.
---
Ultimately I disagree, but that’s just based on gut feeling. I don’t think the resto tree is completely superfluous, but I guess we’ll find out when we get there. I remember dropping Mana Tide whenever I could back in the day, but I also remember not properly downranking my spells throughout the earlier content (MC, Ony, BWL and ZG).
---
Aktually: My phone has more processing power than the computer I started playing WoW on.
---
Look at Mr. Quick Hands over here! That's not even enough time for me to set the candles.
---
actually i think all taurens couldn't. there were some places that female tauren's specifically couldn't but I don't think MC was it. can't remember exactly.
---
The one thing all of my crew can agree on is a PVP server.
---
Lmao female Taurens are not THAT big.
---
I don't think I'm making it sound like that, because I don't believe that at all. My point is that inflation did not match the training cost. But you've fought me over that point for an hour now.
---
&gt; I disagree with most of your points. The addition of flying mounts did not cause players to spend less time in the game.  
---
You disagree because you are dumb. Here is an example, numbnutt : please log NOW in WoW, go in Outland and start mining or herbing. Do it first with LAND mount, and see how long it takes to gather 100 of whatever. Than do it with FLYING mount.
---
Come back and tell me the difference.
---
DO the SAME with quests. Or moving from a dungeon to the other.
---
In the end, sum up all the timers, and you will see a 30-40% LESS time spent with flying mounts.
---
This speeding up, combined with dailies and badge gear was THE START, not the FUCKING END of WoW.
---
TBC was the WORST expansion, because it was THE START of the downhill.
---
Powerful Antivenom for poison, Jungle Remedy for poison and disease, and the Free action potion for stuns to name a few.
---
Female Troll Warrior would like a word with you.
---
First one that comes to mind is Dark Legacy, but I don't think there was a main character per se.
---
Level to 20 in the retail demo, it's free. Class and abilities are very similar. You will know what playstyle you like more.
---
There's really nothing they can do about that now other than massive server merges. Population drift among servers is insane, and the majority of active players are on the same 10-15 servers now. If they removed cross-server PvE then there would be a bunch of servers that can't field raid teams consistently.
---
And honestly, the big servers are so big, and the community has changed so much, even if they weren't cross-realm, it wouldn't be like it used to be.
---
They aren't going through class changes etc. Item progression will be cometely different. It's probably closer to a remaster at this point in time than just a 100% re-release. They are even updating the raid frames and doing minor adjustments to the UI.
---
That seems reasonable, i know lots of people who just used the pre wow mentality of, hitting 60 WAS the game, and just took their time enjoying the leveling as lovingly as possible. I know several of my friends had 30+ days played before they hit 60. I wouldn't think that will be the case now adays...
---
Hey there! Do you have a raid schedule planned yet? Even if tentatively. 
---
Also, pvp or pve server?
---
Hunter gets kinda boring after raid wise after BWL but it’s always a solid pvp class.
---
The best mix of dps and pvp fun is rogue/warrior/warlock, though I don’t know how fun warlock PvE i know that pvp wise  it’s awesome to get progressively more viable. Once you get naxx gear you become the best
---
If they are going Paladin, I'd try a class that is more DPS like others have said. Let them tank the damage and you attack hard.
---
Plenty of world PVP happened on PVE servers back in Vanilla. It's just optional.
---
I mean yes and no. Like i stated i did it without questie i read the quests and went to the locations. Yeah felt great to find the camps but also i did this way back when so 90% of it is memory. 
---
Not to mention there are guides with coordinates to take. where to set hearthstones to get your "fastest" experiance to get to 60 IMO questie makes it much better since :A you won't be tabbing in and out (or looking onto the other screen) and B: you will feel like you want to stay in one area until you do all the quests seeing as you know exactly where to go and what to do now.
---
Lots of + healing on the set bonuses
---
... this changes everything
---
they're physically smaller but they had a weird thing about their hitbox
---
I know this isn’t exactly your question, but I’m in a similar boat so thought I’d share what I’m doing. I’ll have my main that I’ll end up out levelling my friends. Separate to this I’ll have an alt that I’ll level with them. By the time you’re 60 on your alt you could play on either char with them. Just my thoughts, hope it works out!
---
I don't know if i'd call it a stretch. I don't say that to be mean, just stating a fact. I'd love to be proven wrong, but 9 times out of 10, a group is going to try and maximize efficiency. You can say, "Oh look, a Feral druid was given a spot in a 40m group!" But, that's more of a novelty/bone being thrown when you're looking at 5-6 Rogues, Warriors, and Mages and 1 Feral.
---
Off-spec players will most likely be able to raid and clear MC/BWL/ZG/AQ20. But any group that can take AQ40/Naxx down will be a serious one that will only end up allowing off-specs once the content is pretty much on farm.
---
By a player base that was and still is totally clueless.
---
Vanilla players were much more insightful. 
---
To bad we are just 7 million in a sea of 130 million players that played WoW AFTER Vanilla.
---
I'm a little confused. Is Classic WoW out now, like can I play?
---
I haven't played since 2009.
---
yawn
---
Two times a week will be common for guilds that are toward the top-tier to upper middle of the pack. We plan on attempting 1 night a week at the beginning and then moving to 2 nights a week once we get enough steady players.
---
Yeah haha I get it - you're just not going to find rogues or fury warriors so bad at their class that they get out damaged by a ret pally in any guild that can kill a MC boss most likely... ret pally damage is *that* bad.
---
But yeah - if it somehow does happen, that rogue/warrior should be dropped - just for a better rogue/warrior.
---
Yeh fuck those elitist private server wizards who don’t allow me to role play a linen bandage provider! That is NOT how I remember vanilla!!!
---
The streamers tried to run, but Chuck Norris' glare froze them in their tracks... now they can only twitch
---
Diablo, Starcraft, and Warcraft made me play WoW. Blizzard had a track record of excellence and when I saw they were developing an MMO I was all in. Been playing since day one.
---
Interestingly though, retail is in fact very well setup to be a game that you raid log for. Vanilla could be people's primary gaming time sink freeing retail to focus on being what it's best at, a lobby for mechanically intense 5man and raid content.
---
You still don't get the difference between "putting a lot of time into the game" and being forced to do it EVERY DAY. It is a huge problem, a huge difference and something that will turn a lot of people away and did in the past too.
---
I did put a lot of time into the game (how else do you get every mount, every pet, every profession with every recipe etc., which I did), when I wanted to. I was not punished for putting that time in only on Tuesdays and Fridays in Vanilla, but with daily quests you get punished for not wanting or not being able to log into daily FOR NO REAL REASON. It is the same amount of hours, the same work done, the same items.
---
Tell me ONE reason why it has to be done in form of daily quests.
---
Sorry, but a 60% flying mount was nowhere near as fast as a flight path. You seem like you're really level headed and measured in your responses, so I look forward to your rebuttal
---
No, he's a rogue.
---
TBH hard min/max wasn't really till AQ40/Nax, everything else was pretty much "we need 40 people for raid, who's in?"
---
So long as you know how to listen, know how to play your class/spec and position, then you most likely have a raid spot.
---
It's easy for you to call someone deadweight when you play a meta build with a 1 button rotation, get over yourself NERD
---
Why can’t humans and nelfs ride mechanostriders?
---
You're still being carried you're just not playing badly.
---
If you looks at OP's post history you'll see he's like 90% the source of all TBC hate. They repost it so frequently.
---
&gt; I think you forgot that Cataclysm had some difficult dungeons early on. There was huge complaints about it because people thought it was too hard. 
---
And that is because in TBC, the player base changed, from people understanding the game, to people that were happy for flying, dailies and easy gear.
---
&gt; During Vanilla we raided 3-4 nights a week @ 3-4 hours each raid. We were a semi-hardcore guild that cleared all but Cthun and about half of Naxx.
---
No. You were a hardcore raiding guild. If you’re raiding 3 or more a week you are a hardcore pve guild.
---
Warlock: N/A
---
I just hope people enjoy it. But must of all don’t give up.
---
They were in vanilla so we'll see how it shakes out in classic.
---
Paladin is lack of dps.  You never die bit everything  takes time to kill.  No ability to cc multiple jobs means more than 2 enemies is probably ending poorly for you.
---
FROSTFIRE
---
There were many aids in vanilla available to help you through questing; as addons, 3rd party software (I believe there were some paid programs that were sort of an overlay on wow but not an actual add on) and external websites (Thottbot was my favorite).  It was just a case of a lot of people not being savvy enough to find them and/or use them. I don’t see why blizzard would disallow this addon.
---
Because all the warlock leveling fails are mostly due to player mistakes or pvp
---
lack of bag space, limited mobility
---
What we considered ourselves is far more important than whatever you consider us.
---
Right, I'm the fanatical one here.
---
I think, sadly, that the thing stopping Classic from becoming massively popular and have population growth after the 1st few months, is classic itself. We're on a subreddit where everyone here likes and wants to play Classic, so it seems obvious other people would like it. The reality is though, that most retail players won't even make it to 60, and people now really don't want to deal with the grind and lack of QoL improvements(a lot of which absolutely made wow a better game btw).
---
I think Classic will be a niche game that has success for what it is, and from the business side it will help Blizz look better with the extra subs, but I think the twitch hype from beta and the echo-chamber that is this subreddit are making Classic seem bigger than it is. I hope I'm wrong, because I want Classic and Retail to both be popular so we get a better product down the line, but we'll see.
---
Are you aware that people played on PvE servers in Vanilla?
---
Paladin: your peepee is going to get hurt and swollen from all the alt-tab porn.
---
I remember being orc and undead and everything feeling on sight against me. As a tauren a lot of night elves /wave me even outside of a rp server. Must be the druid connection?
---
[Better dps than feral, shadow, ret, worse than other pure dps classes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBSnGwxmOSU)
---
The thing is though when people ask this question is they exclude pvp. PVP isn't templated like it is on retail. Some of these "meme" specs are actually surprisingly good in pvp. Many people consider Spriest to be the best 1v1 class in vanilla. Balace/Resto hybrid is one of the best world pvp specs. Ele shaman puts out some of the highest burst damage in pvp, so whats the solution to that?
---
Not at all my dude. I live with an American and I g8ve him shit daily. Its like therapy. Though he's getting remarkably good at returning it.
---
Why don't you try something new? How do you feel about shaman?
---
Warrior is harder to lvl/gear than rogue. If he rolls warrior tell him that he will likely be expected to tank 5 mans.
---
Supply and demand my friend
---
Fair point I am very open to either and both have their pro cons, basically what’s drawing me back from both classes are
---
Hunter: doesn’t seem very important in Raids, the dead zone between being able to shoot and avoid melee
---
Priest: rotation seems very basic, fighting for gear with other cloth making it hard to gear up
---
That is indeed bad for gold making and pvp but I never found those to be leveling problems.
---
Mage: OoM
---
Paladin: Low damage output
---
Warrior: No self heals
---
Good to see someone lay out the flying mount point like you did. I always see it boiled down to just "flying mounts ruined everything" but in my opinion I think it wasnt just flying mounts in general but rather flying mounts in all of Azeroth. Flying in zones like Outlands and Northrend that were specifically catered to flying and were a small continent separate from Azeroth was fine and a cool feature that didnt trivialize and ruin the world of Azeroth.
---
Also what your discussing is something else I think people dont grasp: becasue these systems became an issue in later expansions does not necessarily mean they were instant issues upon their introduction. Its totally possible (and in my opinion as well as many others) that alot of these "wow killing" mechanics and additions to the game were actually great and apart of what made TBC and WoTLK awesome expansions. It wasnt until these mechanics were expanded upon and devolved into something worse that I believe they became detrimental. Because TBC and WoTLK has some of these features doesnt make them bad expansions for what these features might become in later expansions.
---
Less than 10% of the guilds are going to be top dogs, clearing the entire raids on release.
---
Everyone else will be stuck in MC, Ony, BWL, ZG and AQ20, with some attempts at AQ40 (which will fail).
---
Worry not, 90% of the guilds will get in raids whatever they can.
---
i'll be rolling a dwarf priest as well (because dwarves are the best), but I was in fact hoping it wouldn't be the optimal race for min/maxers. I like the exclusivity and uniqueness of an uncommon race/class combo.
---
Poop sword.
---
Would you have by any chance a video of how to get up there?
---
5hp per second and there is NOTHING you can do about it.
---
you think this spelladin build thats been floating around is a pipe dream?
---
its staking spell damage on fast attacking weapons for seal of righteouss
---
The set bonus is trash compared to certain healing items like the blue dress from strat UD... sad but true.
---
MS is a medoum priority debuff that WILL knock off many important debuffs including ignite and nightfall and is thus not used in PvE.
---
BC was not at all casual, as other commenters have pointed out already.
---
Honestly, where I think one of the bigger mistakes was the purge of abilities, and the blending of all the classes into one.  Nothing is unique anymore.  Every class has AoE, every class has CC, every class has a heal, every class has a big 5/10 min steroid...etc.
---
slowing down the 40 man raid of 15 year old content with NEW and DEVASTATING mechanics like "aoe the adds!" and "move away from the purple junk."
---
What a fuckin tragedy, how ever will players cope.
---
^warrior ^main, ^inb4 ^waaaaah ^ret ^mains
---
warriors can't heal themselves and must rely on consumables. which makes cooking, fishing, and first aid mandatory. I choose to take this as benefit though, cooking, fishing, and first aid will finally be useful again!
---
Shit that's exactly my choices right now. Dont know who to main and who to alt. Shaman seems fun but my be over populated. Druid is always under populated but that's because they under perform. Priest sounds fun right now
---
&gt; And I would actually argue that Classic isn't supposed to be a shot-for-shot remake of Vanilla
---
You must be joking? It has been pretty well established that Classic is intended to  be as faithful a recreation of vanilla wow as possible. Not the "spirit" of vanilla wow. Just vanilla wow.
---
Karazhan =TBC
---
Where's the huge shop button at the top right?
---
Rogue: Gear dependence I guess, but it's minimal.
---
A min/maxed raid is taking zero enh shamans.  You will only see them in pugs or guilds that or more relaxed on their comp and what specs they allow/want.
---
Frostwolf Howler is best mount. Get ready to farm that AV rep.
---
Lmao tread lightly, that's a slippery slope 
---
Everyone knows Americans have an innate ability to verbally abuse people, ok ? Don't get him started
---
I can’t wait to go hang around crossroads or go chill by the boat
---
Very nice!
---
I like to force my boar into cannibalism by feeding it boar meat.
---
It's because they are only available to one faction. You need to double the percentage for shamans to see how they are relative to the others
---
I assume he/she's implying that Beta isn't really representative of what the breakdowns will be on launch, or at 60, specifically because Beta is level cap limited, which allows people a lot more time to make new characters for testing or practice.  You won't see that same degree of character creation by account once it's live.
---
Having said that, the numbers, from what I've seen, don't look THAT far off of what it will look like at 60 4-6 months after launch.  I expect to see more hunters than most of the polls show, however.
---
My buddy was trying hard to get me to play and I kept refusing, k owing I'd get hooked. He knew I'd play a hunter first and right after ZG came out he showed me Mandokirs Sting.  I lost my shit and started the next day.
---
Everyone is talking abut getting ganked and camped like you'll spend 3 hours straight having that happen to you. Literally just rez behind a tree and go run somewhere and you're back to questing as usual. Or log for 10 minutes and come back and go on like usual.
---
I mean we do need some alliance to kill at least. They are good for that.
---
&gt; I would actually argue that Classic isn't supposed to be a shot-for-shot remake of Vanilla
---
It is though. It's supposed to be like finding a dusty old tome from a forgotten age and restoring it to its mostly original condition so that people can experience the first step / starting point of the franchise. Their dev team has literally called WoW Classic a "museum piece" at times. 
---
No matter the class and spec, in raids, most players only press one button. A single ability or a simple macro. At least healers dont only target the boss.
---
First 10 levels without dual wielding.  The next 10 levels before you can get poisons or vanish (at 20).  20+...leveling lockpicking?
---
No, I mean a **real** job. Not just a job. I’d imagine you couldn’t find a **single** mythic raider with more responsibilities than him.
---
Expect to got first kill in first month everyone knows all the tactics etc. Speedruns will be thing in classic.
---
This might just be me misunderstanding the problem, but isn't the swing timer at its max value when Windfury procs anyway?
---
It's 100g total to spec back though, and that's quite a bit for the average player if they just want to do some PvP on non-raid nights. I've always thought respec costs were about double what they should be.
---
I used eyes of the beast to pull geddon and shaz back to garr's room too
---
Theres tons of people like you. We are extremely excited for Classic and cant wait to play Vanilla but also excited that this might lead towards the expansions (TBC/WotLK) that we love most. When Classic wow has run its course and people look to the next step it will become very apparent how many people supported Classic WoW to enjoy it but also to play through it and move towards TBC---&gt; WoTLK.
---
No. It has a medium priority. It can and will knock off many much more powerful debuffs. It is also a worse dps spec than 2h fury. No reason to be arms other than skimping on respec gold.
---
English is not nice to people with different dialects
---
Found the ret paladin.
---
I'm rolling one of the other two. We should meet ig
---
Still better than the abomination that it is now. We will at least get a chance to summon the bosses and play it like a pvp raid like it's meant to be instead of a resource race.
---
I'm afraid not. IIRC, on the ramp up to the roof there's a rock that sticks up a bit, which you have to jump from with speed + slowfall.
---
Literally every single person  that will play this game has small ideas which would make it better for them personally. But that is not what we are getting.
---
11 YO me in 2006 making a trial account and playing a gnome mage. I remember not having enough space on my shitty computer for WoW so my mom bought me an external HD.
---
It's funny to me that I played WoW for years up until MoP and my most memorable experiences are from vanilla leveling up in Dun Morogh.
---
The two ways Blizzard ruined these mechanics is by overdoing them or oversimplifying them (or both).
---
Heroic dungeons were fine.  Overdone to the point where you have 18+ levels of difficulty for a single dungeon, and then you have 4 tiers of difficulty for the same raid was a killer.
---
Heroic dungeons simplified to the point where they were trivial content was also a killer.
---
No I don’t. Shaman shows it’s the 2nd least chosen class for horse. Paladin shows it’s the 2nd least chosen class for alliance.
---
Let me know if you could use a hand
---
Yeah, so I think: 
---
&gt; If you want to be in a serious guild, you'll want to be a meta spec.
---
You keep saying its low priority but you clearly dont know what you are talking about. This info is a google search away.
---
Vanilla leveling was easy, you play something like rf or d2 and it is a joke in comparison on time consumption.
---
Well it's just annoying, to deal with constantly while leveling, especially before you get decent bags
---
I was Prot Warrior from TBC until BFA... WotLK was the best time to be Prot (on any class). I loved tanking in WotLK so much that I had ICC-geared Warrior, DK, and Paladin tanks. I also had Elemental Shaman, and a Resto/Balance Druid.  
---
WotLK was the absolute best expansion to date.  
---
... See? I can say things with absolute certainty as well. Opinions aren't facts.   
---
You didn't like WotLK. Fine. Lots of us did. Every expansion has people who both love, and loath it.   
---
We're all here to play.
---
Yes hi
---
&gt; So you can agree that some imbalance is a bad or toxic thing to have?
---
Keyword being "some". Imbalance is not inherently bad.
---
I never said anything about mechanics. Nice job moving the goalposts.
---
You'll understand when you're in AQ40 and having to slog through MC every week. You'll want that MC to be over as fast as possible and bringing rets into your raid isn't going to help that.
---
Really? Can you explain more the details and the ability and why it's important?
---
Well, that's what it sounded like.  That flying mounts and the "need" to obtain them are the reason the economy collapsed.  That was your original point.
---
No. You’re only confusing people who are creating guilds. They want to be a semi-casual or casual guild and see you saying you raid 3+ times a week for 3-4 hours....which is not semi-hardcore. That is a hardcore raiding schedule. 
---
A semi-hardcore is 1 or 2 nights a week and casual is maybe 1 night a week or 1 night every two weeks.
---
You can refer to yourselves anyway that you want, it just doesn’t mean it’s right.
---
Feign Death definitely canceled casts in Vanilla.
---
Bla bla bla bla
---
How can I do this? I would use my data to play!
---
Yep. Feral tank here. I will gladly take ^ONE Enhance shaman into my group with some Fury Warriors for maximum buffs to my TPS.
---
that's impressive. looks more appealing than the in-game map.
---
You're advocating for a horribly sub-optimal spec in PvE when everyone else already knows how bad it is, so yeah, you are fanatical.
---
To the block list you go, with the rest of the "buh buh but RET IS GOOD GUISE!!1!!!" autists.
---
What the hell are you smoking man, at least share it with the rest of us
---
Hi, /u/stealingsociety77
---
I loved arena back in TBC, and everything you're saying is correct. But I think resilience could have been so much better.  I liked how it made is so the good PvPers didn't NEED to raid in order to gear up.  But it also made every match a 40 min war of attrition.  It was great because we were invested in the game in so many other ways, but on the surface, as a PvP game, arena kinda sucked.
---
Battlerite is similar to WoW arena in a lot of ways, and they have this mechanic where if you take more than 10% of your current max health in damage, then that damage is permanent and it can not be healed back.  In TBC, you could nuke someone to 5% hp and if you don't get the kill, the match kind of reset.
---
I got a server 2nd Cthun on Akama US with a bear OT.
---
If you're looking to find a guild, mention if they mind if you are INSERT-DESIRED-SPEC-HERE
---
There will be guilds who don't mind, but some are going for the fastest clears possible and so they only want optimal specs, especially since the top guilds won't be pre-raid BiS, they are gonna hit 60 and go right into MC with greens and blues.
---
Classic raids are far easier than retail raids, even retail heroic raids are much harder than Classic. Especially once we get a working Deadly Boss Mods on Classic. 
---
It's just a matter of how optimized a raid group/guild wants to be.
---
Money.
---
If you knock off ignite or nightfall, you have drastically reduced raid wide dps. Even in a casual guild, a decent mage will notice what you did and call you out. We are talking wiping out potentially 1k + dps just so you can use MS. At that point, you are essentially negative dps in the raid. Don't be that guy. All the casters will hate you.
---
yup that is accurate.
---
It is only casual friendly if you think having to log into a game daily is casual and it isn't for many, many people and it wasn't and isn't for me.
---
I put in a lot of time in Vanilla, but I did it twice a week. I even put more time into Vanilla a week than I would have to put in to do all daily quests in BC, but I could do it when I wanted to and I wanted to do it on Tuesdays and Fridays, when I was online with my friends who also ONLY played on these days, because they had other things to do on the other days, like me and did not feel it to be healthy or fun to be forced to log into a game on a daily basis. 
---
Again, tell me what makes it important to put daily quests into a game and not leave it open to the player when to log in and spent the time to grind to a goal? 6 days one hour is the same as 6 hours on one Friday evening, it takes the same amount of enemies killed or items collected. Dialy quests do not have an advantage for the player. It only keeps player counts up, so the developer can brag about how many players log in every day. 
---
I am not allowing a game to take the decision away from me when I log in. If it does, I rather quit.
---
Even professions made you log in daily in Vanilla to get a transmuation going or transform cloth, but I could live with not having that as an ingame income as much as others. 
---
In TBC the daily grind got crazy and today people are so used to it that I questions if they can even remember how relaxing it was when that wasn't the case. Maybe you all will get it when Vanilla is there and leaves it to you when you log in and what you do that day.
---
No, it's not inherently bad. Example, as a rogue, I would love for that to be in the game. I think balance is purely subjective based on who feels strong and who feels weak. Which is why I said imbalance is toxic. It's creates negative relationships between players. Whether or not that should be taken into consideration is up for debate, but it still exists. Look at all the rogues and warriors who get camped simply because of what their class can eventually do
---
Omg you blew my mind
---
Was this allowed by Blizzard? I can't remember.
---
&gt; Of course Rets won't ever be a Tier 1 spec in terms of damage, but that doesn't mean Rets have to be "hot garbage".
---
They are. They're not even a tier 2 dps. They're about the worst thing you can bring to a raid without being a balance druid.
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/Default.aspx
---
Im having a good chuckle at people drawing a hard line at no changes for classic and then wanting to change TBC
---
G4 TV had an episode showcasing a Gnome that went above and beyond to grind stormwind rep for a Human mount. Got it the next day.
---
Can anyone explain to me how this affects a Tauren shaman? I'd like to know how it affects all three specs. Assuming that it can help/hurt enhancement, but only hurts resto and ele? Is the casting range affected at all, or will it just increase the distance you can be hit from melee.
---
Also, for those looking to minmax, do the warstomp combos and increased health still give orc a run for it's money if considering both pve/pvp, or is orc far and away the better option in regards to racials for a shaman?
---
Warlocks have searing pain which does a fairly significant amount of aggro, even without the increased crit chance you can get on it.
---
But why?
---
Hunter: Limited bag space, availability of ranged weapons, high food consumption for pets
---
Warlock: Limited bag space, no move speed abilities
---
Priest: Slow clear speed (but high uptime to counteract), no move speed increases, high wand dependence (with no easy upgrades from like 24-40)
---
Druid: Long/difficult class quests for each form
---
Warrior: Long downtime between each pull (eating, bandaging), few ways to deal with multi-mob pulls
---
Paladin: low low dps for slow clear speeds
---
Mage: mana management, lots of downtime
---
Rogue: not great at handling multiple mobs, lots of healing downtime (kinda similar to warr, but with a few more tricks)
---
Shaman: Idk I don't play shaman
---
Selling potion and portal services.  Perhaps a bit of farming.  Would be nice.  The downside is people would go to dungeons, expect not to fail, then the party would need to replace them after they're already in the dungeon.

It's not all true. Unless you're in a hardcore min/max guild, you can play with what you want. The thing with Classic is it's not retail, so you're not about those Max Guilds of Streamers and such, it's about the general community.
---
I don't think there ISN'T a new race to be had. I know there is.
---
I just don't think that the majority care. I know a lot of hardcore raiders now feel the same way. Play vanilla this time like it doesn't matter. The thing is, sure you can race, but it was a painful difficult experience with lots of heartache and not fun. I wouldn't want to go through that again. I want to do the fun this time. Especially without a reason to race, I see no point in racing. 
---
My only point being, the race very much will exist, but it will not be the only motivation for players. I also think a much smaller portion will actively care about that aspect, and instead will be playing without needing to "win" so much as just "try"
---
Disc Priest MT? if you want easy mode maybe
---
real men main tank with fire mages
---
mandatory remark about how anger management actually gives rage while in combat.
---
All raids are going to take Hunters despite their bad scaling as they still need Tranq shot.
---
Healers don’t really have any rotations in Vanilla, they are all about playing reactively. You won’t be competing with other Cloth casters on gear, you are competing with Pallys and Druids on Cloth heal with +healing/mana. Unless you are considering going Shadow of course, but in that case playing a Hunter will be less disappointing.
---
Where is Mankrik's wife?
---
14 years have passed. Peoples lives have changed, priorities have changed. The worst thing someone could do is judge one another for wanting to play the game the way they want to play it. 
---
This community spends too much of its efforts debating the correct way to play Classic instead of appreciating the differences.
---
&gt; The fun part of vanilla is that you are not forced into a PVP set in order to be competitive in PVP, you can put your set together from instances, raids and rep
---
And what about the flip side to this?  I never cared much for end game raiding but absolutely loved arena and PvP.  The fun part for me was the I wasn't forced to raid in order to be competitive in PvP.
---
It's almost like "this sub" is not just one person, and is instead comprised of thousands of different people with different opinions.
---
Imagine that.
---
Notice how I preface my opinion with that we're all different (the implication being that we have different opinions of what we like and enjoy), you passive aggressive, illiterate dipshit. You're free to enjoy WotLK just as I'm free to hate it and everything that came after it, which was my entire point, thanks for repeating it back to me with added salt.
---
I really hope this is the case
---
Classic is much harder than bfa... 
---

Rogue is a great class for both pve and pvp. High dps, high cc, great learning curve, combo points are something really well thought ( when and which finisher to use feels great ).  
---
Role playing with rogue is really cool and you can create many scenarios: my best memory was trying to rob a bank in orgrimmar - sneaking inside the city with two rogues, planning the heist, using distraction... oh man :D ). 
---
I don't have any regrets on rolling this class over the others, i have played with 3 classes in vanilla ( main and two alts all on 60 ) and i have enjoyed them a lot. Each class has something that brings you to the game, the way you enjoy the game is up to you. 
---
You have all the cards in your hands in this game and in my humble opinion you have ROYAL FLUSH. You win.
---
I was expecting a wheelchair to be involved.
---
Don't forget the all mighty Disengage!!!
---
Hmmm.
---
Sword and board, don't go 2 hander. Judge light (or wisdom) and have the opposite seal on. Auto attack. Maybe bubble and bandage in the bubble if necessary. Rinse repeat from then on essentially. Use your stun whenever it is up. 
---
Honestly I played a pally for years (original closed beta till Wrath, healed og Naxx, you get the idea) a 19 elite should not get you in 4 hits. Sounds like you may need to up your gear a little maybe, but would have to know specifics. But pallies are fabulous soloers and well known for being able to solo difficult content, just taking forever to do it.
---
m8 its an old ass game that was beat by neckbeards poopsocking over a decade ago. I dont understand you people pretending like its gonna be cutting edge shit to play in a hardcore raid group where you need to minmax everything just to get to content that people have casually had on farm for longer than you've had a sex life. 
---
Having some ret pallies or feral druids isn't gonna suddenly make MC or BWL or any of these raids hard again. Let people have their fun.
---
Roll night elf for evasion, she would have the best aoe aggro of all tanks and never get hit!
---
what macro version is in classic? is it the original wow macro system or like TBC/ retail version ?
---
No, my original point was that blizzard designed the game to promote flying and felt that players needed 280% flying, and that element ruined the game. I never once mentioned economy other than to point out that flying costs gold and that the cost for training did not inflate with the economy.
---

For those lazy to Google...  [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/mobxp](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/mobxp)
---
Yeah before they ever played a wow expansion.  Pve is for casuals, classic isnt.
---
They did not, and the first level 70 in TBC was somebody who had his guild slaughtering mobs as fast as he could tag them.
---
Or collecting spirit gear and swapping out of combat.
---
Warrior hp regen gained from spirit is legit insane. People really underestimate how much time that can save.
---
Yeah I’m Ret. but I don’t think i even have judgement of light or wisdom yet
---
EDIT: Judgement of Light is 30 and Judgement of Wisdom is 38.
---
I have played game called Tibia - when you died not only you would loose xp but also skill levels. That was something really cool in my opinion but in wow there is simply no place for that :) The game is close to perfection.
---
Hey! Sorry for commenting on an old post, but I also have a base model MacBook Pro from 2017. Can you let me know what FPS you’re getting on what general settings? Thanks!
---
HOW YOU DO THIS? I need, tired of stop playing just to go take a shit
---
I'm gonna try it if I can convince a group of randoms to let me 😂
---
You are worrying about something that may not even happen and if it does won't be for 2-3 years at least! Just enjoy what it is and ride the wave.
---
EXACTLY or now you get the main two tanks with you and Imp buff for that FAT fucking HP pool!
---
Joana's in-game addon will likely require payment, and he said it won't be ready for launch (Sort of demeaning the point for most people wanting to speedlevel/for their first playthrough)
---
Because there is less scripting in quests
---
&gt; That is not true. You will see when Classic releases.
---
Please make a post when your ret carries the dps meters in Classic so that *we all* can see.

Failed! Hit 4
---
BRE is a [self-buff in 1.12](https://itemization.info/item/17076).
---
Insect Swarm is not really worth it. You still want your tank getting hit for rage generation.
---
Hunter's Mark is not really worth it either outside of early on raiding IMO.
---
Shaman is easily mana. No real way around mana issues. If you are ele you oom in 1-2 kills. Enh you OOM trying to keep yourself alive. 
---
The other would be that you need to replant totems for almost every freaking mob, or find a way to somehow get more than 1 - 2 enemies in your little 20y zone.
---
Yeah, pretty sure you can chain it with a macro (on retail atleast), not sure if possible in classic too.
---
PvE servers have always been generally less populated than PvP servers.
---
I rolled Staghelm on launch, and it quickly went to low pop.
---
I'm in the beta, and the PvE server is low pop, while the PvP server is high pop.
---
Tell that to the rogue who hasn't gotten a new sword in like 10 levels, lol. But weapons aside, yeah, gear dependence is minimal. The lack of a self-heal is a pain, and rogues are soft as hell. Bandages and food are your good, good friends. The reliance on cooldowns means your ability to handle multiple mobs is limited/not always available - but, as you flesh out your toolkit, this becomes less of an issue because you generally don't need to blow multiple CDs.
---
Thanks! And yeah most of them aren’t practical but I myself have been looking for as comprehensive a list as possible too although I’m sure I missed a few. For example I missed The Ravager https://classicdb.ch/?item=7717 which should really be up there as an AoE option for large groups. I want to do consumables and quest rewards too at some point. Like a lot of people, I tend to hoard consumable quest reward items that you can’t replace like https://classicdb.ch/?item=1191 and https://classicdb.ch/?item=5816. So instead of doing the quests and leaving them in my bank forever, I think I’ll just avoid all those quests and save my bank space. If we ever get content after Naxx, I’ll come back and get them to use in world firsts or something. However, my knowledge of them is very minimal and I pretty much only know ones on alliance side so maybe I’ll make a whole post asking for other people to help with that.
---
Anger Management
---
The tooltip is actually incorrect. It says "reduces out of combat rage decay by 30%", but in reality, the talent actually gives you 1 rage per 3 seconds at ALL TIMES, even when you're in combat. Every 3 seconds you get 1 rage for free, as long as you don't have 0 rage. This is better rage gen than Fury's "unbridled rage" talent, unless you're using a super fast weapon.
---
What kind of abomination is this.

Tailoring will net lose you money over just AH'ing the cloth. Bags usually sell more *marginally* more than the material components, and you still need to account for all the materials you have to make to level it up to where you can make mageweave/runecloth (which actually sell).

What makes you think you need gigabit internet? Do you need gigabit internet to watch Twitch streams? They aren't streaming a bunch of calculations and a whole computer over to you... you're watching a video feed.
---
As others said, latency is the bigger concern.
---
"Lots" is a bit of an overstatement imo ;)
---
And yet people keep going back to play the same content over and over again.
---
Included in the `Didn’t put Judgements (of light) since it’s alliance-only`. AFAIK, it's not used that much since bosses tend to die fast enough and that there's better debuffs but I could be wrong. My experience raiding is mostly horde.
---
No, EK and Kalimdor are two different instances.
---
That's not how this works. This poll is for both factions. So if this poll shows 15% warriors, 7.5% will be on horde, assuming equal balance, while all the shams, the full 8%, will be in horde. So this poll shows shams as the most populated horde class.
---
No it doesn't, spell hit means it will hit AKA not be resisted.  
---
It's effectively the same thing but you use a different term for it.
---
So no, spells can never miss they are resisted.
---
Funny how many words you typed without saying anything.
---
&gt; Which is why I said imbalance is toxic. It's creates negative relationships between players
---
Feeling bad != toxicity
---
You can feel bad for many reasons.  Just because you were killed by something OP and feel bad/cheated is not the same as toxicity.
---
This isnt even bad.  I'll be doing a heavy amount of grinding on my journey to 60.
---
But...I want the white mechano mod B :(
---
I was just throwing one out there, tbh. Not really thinking of how viable they might be, relative to another spec. The point I'm mostly trying to make is that meme specs don't necessarily keep you from raiding, they'll just cap the types of raiding you do, and how far you'll go. I can imagine every spec will get a shot at MC, for instance.
---
Pick pve or pvp server.
---
Pick alliance or horde.
---
Pick human or undead.
---
Play what you want. Nelfs get a stealth bonus and humans get swird spec and diplomacy. I play a nelf because i love nelfs. The damage sword spec does isn’t a whole lot.
---
Honestly these days if you don't have a liquid cooled, 8k, touch screen monitor...what are you even doing?
---
&gt;if your LAN latency streams &lt;1ms and you feel a 500ms response time, how much response time do you feel when you stream that same data over the internet at 10ms best case local datacenter? how about 50 or 100ms?
---
How in the world are you coming up with a 500ms response time for a local network? How does &lt;1ms = 500ms? That isn't the case at all.
---
Orc.
---
This is such a sad, broken mentality on raiding in numerous ways.
---
Ahh. It has been awhile for me, forgot when pallies get those.
---
Well, get those and you can do it then. Not so much beforehand probably. 
---
So I amend my original to, a pally over 30 or 40 can solo elites but go get some coffee then.
---
Also, holy/prot also can do it a little easier due to talents, etc.
---
The raids were not mandatory, nor were any consumables or other preparation. We were not a hardcore guild.
---
Soloing elites gets easier on a pally as you level up and get more tools. Fast 1h + shield, seal of the crusader, judgement of light/wisdom, bubble, BoP, flash of light. As long as you can keep yourself alive you'll take them down eventually.
---
Orc is probably the best for rogue.  Largest advantage being able to resist so many stuns.  Your PvP trinket won't remove stuns.  The PvP trinket and WotF take off the same things, thus reducing the effectiveness of undead.  In terms of looks though, Undead female still has the best actions and movement.
---
Alliance-wise, gnome's root remove on 1 minute cooldown will never get old, even when stacking with improved sprint.  You will always love having that perk.  Dwarf rogue is aesthetically best alliance-side.  They have stoneform too, which removes bleeds, something that will help for warriors and otherwise not be available to rogues.  They also have the best RP approach, with their treasure finder racial ability.
---
Just dont answer if you cant read, please.
---
an under-valued aspect of race selection is that you are going to be looking at the back of your character for a very long time, especially if you only intend to have 1 character. it takes around 10 days of in game hours to level to 60. imo unless you are a hardcore, elite player, the racial abilities are less important than you liking the way the back of your character looks.
---
I thought the same thing. I was really confused as to why everyone playing wow was a night elf. My brother's friend said they were the best race in the game ,so i thought that was why. When i made a human mage one day and was in elwynn i was so confused.
---
One has more content. The other takes less time.
---
Out of those choices, human for sure.
---
Feel free to ah everything but the prices will be broken :)
---
Human rogue does the most damage in PvE. Nelf rogue has a bit more stealth and higher base agility. Undead rogue has a fear break and can eat corpses every 2 minutes while leveling to get health back
---
I didn't say anything of the sort?
---
That's a great piece of artwork. I'd love to see you carry this on and go through all the maps of EK/Kalimdor.
---
Flip a coin. You will know which you want when the coin is midair. Pick that one.
---
Guides are vastly superior to just questing mods, as they include more info like you suggested with coords and when/where to set hearth. I remember leveling 4 chars to 60 in vanilla, and my 1st char was just by reading quest with the others basically going off memory. I became way more efficient at leveling with each new char just by routing/sequencing the quest correctly. This is why something like Joana's guide will help players like me, I've done all the quest before and I generally remember where/how to complete them. However, correctly sequencing and routing of those quest is not something I could do nearly as efficient.
---
However, Questie and/or pfquest are great for getting quick references to your objectives and allowing you to quickly see where to turn-in/pick up quest via the map.  Also, it give mouse-over info so you can be sure that you're killing the right raptors and often includes drop rates for quest items so you'll still know you're killing the right mob and the rate is just really low. Without these confirmations from questie, things can get really confusing even when you're doing the right thing.
---
&gt; Resilience was good, as a die hard pvper l, I could log on and pvp for 18hrs and not have to raid and I am completely fine with that.
---
The part about you logging on and not having to raid is what's good.  The resilience stat itself was pretty piss poor.  It turned every match into a 40 min war of attrition.  There are other ways to achieve this desired effect other than the resilience stat.
---
Woah, hold up, I never claimed anything like that. I wrote in my comment above that of course Rets will never be Tier 1 DPS in Raids. But I will make a post when we have cleared a raid without optimal raid comp and at least one Ret.
---
Wasnt Pat one of the first to get rank 14 btw?
---
A hunter or an offtank is much better for that job and since no hunter would take the boring job, it would usually be taken by the offtank.
---
Absolutely no reason what so ever to brink retri pala or enhancement shaman other than being a casual guild and just bringing whatever people want to play. Which is fine but it is sub optimal.
---
It was used mostly by people who pvp'd and wanted to double dip on utility.
---
"lack of decent MMORPG competitor"? 
---
how is that upvoted so high? if you think that FF14 and GW2 can't compete with classic WoW you're very dense. GW2 does PvP/WvW better and FF14 does storytelling and PvE content better. So there's 2 huge competitors out there. And if ppl would take their time and play them they'd realize it.
---
Classic will be popular for like 6 months. I think that will also be the time when they announce that it's actually free and you don't need a sub. Then even the last pink goggle wearing fanboy will have realized that vanilla WoW was bad. And that it was only fun cause of the people you played it with back then. And they might not be there this time. And the way til lv 60 is the most unfun thing in any MMO probably. Heck, I've got thousands of hours and I don't know how I leveled my first 2 mains to 60. I just don't remember. I was so spaced out cause of how dull and boring it was. Running back to your corpse for 5 min cause you got ganked or that elite killed you cause your weapon skill wasn't maxxed so you missed 3 times in a row and so on.
---
Y'all are riding high on some memories. "oh, remember how we did rfc first time?", "oh, how often did I have to kill arugal for that robe", "those 40 hour AVs were so fun hahahaha...."
---
I know that a lot of nerds will be triggered now but just cause BfA might suck a-- doesn't mean that classic wow is automatically gods gift to gamers. WoW was AMAZING back then...cause hardly anyone of us knew better. Guess after tenthousands of hours with various MMOs and even just expansions we *should* be at a point to be more realistic about the whole thing.
---
Doing the minimum required of you is still being carried. Even if a fight "requires" 300 dps, it'll be easier with 600 and you'll have a smoother and more fun run with less wipes. A fight that lasts half as long has half as many chances for mistakes, it's less stressful on healer resources, and you're less likely to wipe. If you're a hindrance to that effort and other players need to play better to compensate for your lackluster performance, that's the definition of being carried.
---
I guess it depends on the player base. As in most cases, we are all procrastinators. I have a project that’s going to take me 10 hours. So do I want to sit down and do 10 hours right now...or...do I want to spread that 10 hours into 1 hour daily sessions. The 10 hour session wastes my entire day and nothing else gets done. But 1 hour for 10 days doesn’t really take away from my time and I can still do what I want. 
---
I understand Its an artificial time-gate. That being said, most players would likely prefer to complete something slowly overtime as to still accomplish other tasks. Prioritizing and such.
---
I don’t believe it’s a huge problem and you are likely overreacting. If you quit this game because they offer an exclusive mount for daily activities, and you just want it now...that’s on you.
---

Sorry for the inconvenience
---
Tracking. We’re pallys and shaman that popular during Vanilla? I might have to go Druid..
---
That's the thing, yeah, nobody is saying it's IMPOSSIBLE to raid as a ret, just saying that it's really fuckin' suboptimal and you shouldn't do it, mainly because you're only going to be taken by casual guilds, or guilds struggling to get 40 people in a raid. And when the content actually starts getting tough in late BWL, AQ40 and such, raids aren't going to want the (relative) dead weight of a ret dragging them down.
---
Cancelled casts, yeah, but you can't avoid a projectile already coming at you with it.
---
There was not a single time I actually remember thinking, "damn, that shadowmeld really swung the fight there." 
---
It seems like a fun novelty or an afterthought moreso than anything you should actually plan on using.
---
there need to be at least one.
---
In that case, you should play an orc rouge. And if that's not good enough, an orc warlock or orc warrior.
---
I found the trick to leveling warriors fast was to always stay a few levels ahead of the content. You get less XP from lower level mobs but you kill them exponentially faster with much less downtime. Just grinding mobs a few levels below you really helps.
---
That should be all you’re thinkng about. Don’t worry about tiny minmaxes go with the one that looks the coolest.

Thanks bud

I can see Mankrik’s wife.
---
Get our your tinfoil hats boys
---
Resil was a good balance. You need some sort of stat that's asymmetric between PvE and PvP otherwise 'PvP gear is too easy to get and replaces raid gear' or PvP success is based on your PvE success 'forced to PvE to PvP'. Then if it gets too asymmetric you're playing two different games.
---
Really the only people who didn't have to PvE were those who needed 100% survivability gear in PvP. Warlocks, priests, people who were going to be the target the vast majority of the time. Everyone else would benefit by going for high ilvl PvE gear in some slots for added dps/healing power, then compensating with gems if needed - or just being that much squishier.
---
No, you aren't being carried. 
---
Being carried means that others are doing enough to win a fight in spite of your performance, and that if they were not making up for your lack of contribution you would fail.
---
It is not being carried if your performance would be enough to succeed, but others are just outperforming you anyway. That just means your group is overperforming and you are not overperforming as much.
---
People seem to have this elitist as fuck notion that you are getting carried just because someone is doing bigger numbers, when in a group full of people doing the same as you you would still win. That is moronic. What exactly are they carrying you to, better logs??? It isn't carrying if you would win without their overperformance.
---
You asked for the best race for Rogues and I’ve provided the answer.
---
I am 99.25864% positive its available on the beta
---
Druid: Levels 1-19.  No cat form.  Afterwards easy. the class quests aren't hard.
---
Comment 1: "*No ret carries.*"
---
Your Reply: "*That is not true. You will see when Classic releases.*"
---
If you were referring to clearing as a ret,
---
You can certainly clear raids with a ret or two. With max consumables and a pissed off raid. You can also clear raids with less than 40 people if you're geared, so that's not exactly saying much. People on pservers clear undermanned all the time for better loot rates.
---
True. The classes' revamps and the new talents/spells were really nice.
---
TBC was my favorite expansion to play technically. But I didnt like flying.
---
The racial bonuses are extremely negligible in the grand scheme of things.
---
Orc, Undead, and Gnome have the best ones, but again - pretty negligible. I'd use it as a tiebreaker more than anything. 
---
Pick whatever one you enjoy looking at the best. My first character was a night elf male and I ended up hating it end game because they move and attack awkwardly as fuck, and all the gear fits them strangely. Capes look stretched out, and shoulders are too big or something.

Threat can be an issue if you don’t have a paladin.
---
It def depends on healer makeup and gear but by AQ we pushed our most talented shamans to raid heal with low ranks of chain heal. They would regularly hang with and sometimes surpass our good priests on the healing charts and those buttery smooth raid heals allowed the priests to really focus on min-maxing their spell selection for tank and oh crap healing.

I read somewhere Nicker is now Blackrock Axe, or something similar.

&lt;ATLAS&gt; HARDCORE | NA | HORDE
---
ABOUT US: Atlas is currently recruiting high-level, team players. Our current core is tight-knit and made up of players who played retail Vanilla and on private servers. Many of us are proven to be the best at the games that we play. We have stuck together through multiple MMORPGs and other competitive, team games. We know what it takes to be the best and welcome others who share that vision.
---
Atlas is a hardcore guild. Understanding loot council and giving/receiving criticism is a necessity of our team environment. We need hardcore levelers and team players on launch in order to meet our goal of week 2 raid. After the launch, we expect 100% unexcused raid attendance.\*\*
---
APPLY TO ATLAS: If you have any questions please do not hesitate to reach out via a direct message through the WoW forums, or message one of our officers on Discord (AEric, B, Carlt0n) to chat more. We look forward to hearing from you!

---
If Druid is on the table, I suggest you just go that route.
---
You're a Saint. People get so distracted being petty. Classic wow is about community so we should all just relax.
---
Thanks for all the advice on various uses of spells to tank more effectively. I love the idea of making off-meta builds that can achieve niche success and classic wow is perfect for this. Maybe as a community we should encourage more breaks from the norm this time around.
---
I’m thinking larger faction but less pvpers but more pvers. Better gear from raids which makes better premades
---
I’d say Mage because they are good at pretty much all stages of the game, scale well with gear, great cc and damage and kiting. They are also just flat out more viable than druids and paladins in all aspects of the game. Paladins are more PvE oriented with buffs and Druids are also a good alternative but I’d just stick with mage.
---
Still Shaman, because 4/5 times you won't windfury. The other 1/5 you won't get close enough to. 
---
But for real paladin gets gear that pairs insanely well with the weapon in a way that other classes don't. Like a warrior has many better options that are easier to obtain.
---
Amazing! This is what I'm talking about! Would be awesome to see this is classic.
---
I guess ill go undead then. What bonus does undead have? Eating corpses for hp restore right?
---
I didn't say that it was necessary in TBC. In fact that was my entire point. Flying didn't ruin the game because when it was implemented, it had narrow use cases, and the only real time you used flying was for those specific use cases. Outside of that, flights oaths and a regular ground mount were faster. When blizzard allowed us to bypass flight paths and ground mounts easier, and also created more vertical content the community spent much more time in the skies. This was all during WoTLK
---
I downvoted both of those threads, not because of their content, but the way you put it.        
---
They made you seem like a gigantic tool trying to troll people.
---
Is this some kind of out of season April fools joke?
---
If it comes to that, people will probably start raiding with 30 people so they can distribute more loot to the raid core.
---
Better than having moonkins to steal the resto druid's tier or the caster's items.
---
You can DE any BoE item in the game with a level 1 enchanter. It will be useful to have a level 5 alt learn it
---
while im not sure your posts downvote ratio proves anything, i am glad to hear that those 2 posts were fake lol
---
Memes are harder to understand at first, most people dont understand sarcasm
---
I'm specifically saying that negative relationships between players is toxic. Maybe instead of reading between the lines, just read the lines.
---
Imbalance can breed those negative relationships, which was my point. But just having imbalance doesn't specifically mean that will happen. Blacksmithing sucks as a money making profession, doesn't mean Blacksmiths are out there flaming alchemists.
---
A good read.  I can forgive them for mistakes and unforseen/unintended consequences.  I can't forgive them for not reverting it though.  It would be amazing if the expansion after BfA brought the old way back.

**Guild: &lt;Nevermore&gt; [Horde] [US] [PvP] [Server: TBD]**
---
**Raid Times:Tues, Weds, Thurs 9pm ET - 12am ET**
---
**Goals**: Clear all end game content in and rock in World PvP. We understand that we don't have the same time availability that we did 14 years ago when Vanilla launched, so progression may be slower than other Guilds with more free time. That doesn't mean we cannot strive to be one of the top guilds on our server, clearing all raid content in a respectable time frame. As for World PvP, if it's red, it's dead!
---
**About us:** We are a large org with ~ 2,000 members in our Discord. We play various games, some more competitively than others. We've been around for roughly a year as an org. We also operate as a gaming league, hosting competitive seasonal game play and tournament play with cash prizes and sponsors for CSGO, Apex, and Overwatch.
---
**WoW Classic**: We will be building a division that is as successful as our other successful divisions. Our WoW Classic division will form a large family, just like Vanilla, where everyone works together for the common good, and everyone knows everyone. No more dungeon and raid finder BS! We're building a community.
---
We have a large infrastructure that already exists from bots, to servers, to websites, a large streaming and social media presence, a podcast, to active and helpful staff.
---
**Needs**: We're still very early on in our recruitment. We need raiders that have experience in Vanilla raiding either via many years ago or via current private servers. That said, if you aren't familiar, but you're willing to read, listen, and learn, we still want you. Besides building a successful Raid team, we need everything from Officers, to Raid Leaders, to Class Leaders. We are building our WoW Classic division from the ground up.
---
Hit me up if you have questions.

16859 is a more realistic number of mobs needed. Ill explain why and can link to my math if needed. But in short. The number you linked is true 100% But ONLY if you are only ever killing mobs equal to your level, which is unlikely. Sometimes you'll be killing mobs a little higher and a little lower. I took the average exp of a -2, -1 same level, +1 and +2 mob and then divided into the total exp needed to 60. Giving us 16859 kills.
---
However depending on the level range the mob exp is still different when accounting for mobs that are higher or lower. For example in the level 1-10 range a mob 2 levels lower than you only gives 71% of the normal exp, but in the 50-60 range a mob 2 levels lower gives 88% of normal exp. So if you average ALL the level ranges(which I did) into 1 numbers we get on average any mob kill will give 97.325% of the normal exp. 
---
SO WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN?!? It doesn't mean much using 30 sec kills still. Taking the new exp value only increases the average time to 60 by about 5 hours. Which isn't bad. Maybe 1 evening more to level to 60
---
It will never happen.
---
It was possible to FD, hop up and shadowmeld in vanilla but it required the enemy not to quickly retarget and quick cast after the FD while also having your pet on passive. In the end, even if you pulled it off, what was the point? Only positive would be, if u pulled it off, laying an ice trap beforehand trying to get them to run into it.
---
Should have drawn paladin somewhere in the negative on the Y axis, for being the most useful thing in the game but the most boring as well.
---
The benefit with tailoring though is you can stand on Org bank and offer bag making service, tips only, with their mats.  People will come to you, rank your skill up, you get minor tips and you keep your cloth.    Outside of that 25 silver, I'm not sure how long you can expect profits from tailoring.
---
You're missing a very important thing - content vs discussion threads. "Low-effort" comics that you can briefly look at, get a laugh, upvote, and move on always beat discussion threads in terms of upvotes. By contrast, you posted whine threads.
---
Will of the forsaken. Charm, fear, sleep immunity on use. With a 2 min (iirc) cd.

I rolled NE druid when I was 10 or so on 10 day trial and couldn’t figure out the bear quest for the life of me. was so goddamn confused. played gnome mage for a few days, had a blast, learned it was subscription based and that wasn’t gonna happen, went back to pokémon and ratchet and clank
---
some people take this game way way way too seriously
---
A man of culture I see.
---
Ravager is an awesome weapon, saw vid on it today, you can proc wf from the bladestorm so with good RNG its a beast. The marbles look very good for raids, if it works on bosses. And the other could prove very useful for alot of situations.
---
Yeah, if I was a Hunter I wouldn't roll on this against anyone.
---
Beast/Survival was one of my favorite hunter specs.  :D
---
The spec was definitely subpar overall but you'll never lose to a hunter with it!  Any time a hunter would try and ridicule the build, a quick duel would make things super awkward.  Good times.
---
The lack of separation between PvP &amp; PvE gear was definitely an issue, as well.
---
I was raiding late T4 or T5 content, and my guild recruited a player who was decked out in full arena/BG gear, and did competitive DPS for his class. When a player can solo queue for BGs and earn rewards that allow him to perform comparably in a raid setting as someone who has spent a year grinding rep, heroics, progression raids and overcoming various logistics &amp; scheduling challenges, there's a problem. 
---
PvP gear should never be mistaken for PvE - there was the resilience stat, which guaranteed that nobody would take a raid-geared character into a PvP instance. The reverse should have been equally true. Maybe they needed to add a higher weight to resilience in the item budget. Blizzard struggled with this problem over several expansions. I had quit already, but I think they got rid of WPvP after a while (also a mistake.)
---
The nice thing about Vanilla is that you earn the best PvP gear by raiding. When they started a second PvP gear track in the game, it really caused some issues they couldn't quite overcome with balance alone.
---
&lt;Means  to an End&gt; formed around distantly connected groups of real life  friends and people known from original vanilla guilds. We generally have  lives and responsibilities now, and will be progressing at a more  relaxed pace. Raiding is only seen as one part of what our players would  like to do - taking our time to enjoy leveling, PvP, etc are just as  much a part of the experience.
---
Raids will  be two nights a week, between Sunday - Thursday. Exactly which two days  are not yet decided. A reasonable time limit will be placed on raid  times so people can spend time with their families and get to bed at a  reasonable hour, in the ballpark of 6:30 - 10:30 EST is the plan.  Message me here on reddit if you have any questions, or as Cirdan on the guild discord:
---
Just as I remembered... I was ganked so much by rogues being a noob hunter in the first part of my vanilla experience that I ended up leveling a rogue for ganking purposes. Every time I would park it next to where I was questing with my hunter and boy was it fun...
---
Always play Resto warrior
---
You get a special skill with a couple minute long cooldown called "Will of the Forsaken" that allows you to break fear, which makes it alot harder for priests and warlocks to kill you - fear is one of their only defensive tools.
---
i think he is saying that the comics/memes are also trolling people
---
There are negative relations every time I'm ganked by the opposing faction.  The entire faction war is a "negative relation".  I just don't get your point.
---
The kind of "hyperbalance" that you are striving for is a big part of why retail WoW blows dick now.  Every class can escape CC, every class has a self heal, every class has an answer to everything.  Sure it's balanced, but I don't think the game is any more or less toxic because of it...
---
Is it that hard of a concept? If we can kill a boss in 8 mins because everyone is doing \~500 DPS we could kill a boss in 4 mins if people do \~1000 DPS. My contribution is much less even though it's as good as my spec allows, but if the fight went on twice as long the chances of us wiping are much higher. If everyone in the raid did the bare minimum to succeed we would wipe a lot more. But because everyone in my raid is doing a lot more than the minimum, the fact that I'm playing a weak build doesn't matter, and thus I'm being carried.
---
It's not elitist, it's just logic. I'm not saying we should shun people who aren't optimal, I'm just saying if you choose to be suboptimal for your own enjoyment while the rest of your raid is making things much easier then you are being carried even if you're not playing badly.
---
This is proof of nothing.
---
What do you mean "all specs"? Specs in vanilla don't require you to stick to a specific talent tree or even go super deep into one. And all classes have multiple viable specs.
---
IF everyone else is doing 600 dps while you doing 300, then they could down that boss with 39 people.
---
So yeah, you are being carried
---
Except for weapon skill. Mostly you’re right but weapon skill for melee is anything but negligible. However for a rogue it’s not as important as rogues get weapon skill via talents. Either way not going human will lower your dps potential for melee and going human allows you to play around with your gear more.
---
I nearly forgot about crafting alts and mules....
---
And frankly - and hey that matters too - it is just much more fun to just charge through a sea of mobs than to struggle and perhaps die frequently.
---
No you can do both pve and pvp on either server. It's just that pvp servers have world pvp whereas pve servers the pvp is mostly limited to bgs.
---
I mean, I knew all that and was just exaggerating a bit to make a point.
---
Immolate is higher DPCT than shadowbolt even when you factor in shadow damage talents. It’s absolutely worth using against targets that will live more than ~10 seconds and have room for the dot. But it won’t be used in single target raid fights.
---
What do expansions have to do with anything?  If PvE is for casuals, and PvE existed in Vanilla, then it logically follows that Classic will have a place for casuals.  Let people play the game how they want and stop trying to pretend your way is better.
---
Also 90% of the time you will be the last member of the party. As they are lf1m tank.  So they'll be willing to let you learn.
---
I think that the downfall of WoW is a combination of the death of the community caused by cross-realm LFG/LFR, and Blizzard listening too much to the casual players who didn't want/have the time to dedicate to the game to get the same gear as the people who did, and changing the game to suit them (the adding of the cross-realm LFG tool was probably due to this).
---
"Original"
---
I don't remember. I was a shaman on horde so they felt very populated to me. I remember our guild needing priests while having a wait list on shamans.
---
Thanks! Is pvp on pve servers popular?
---
i don't understand how people like you don't understand. it's directed, rigid content on a timer that is too efficient to pass up. these sytems make it feel like youre checking off a todo list that blizzard created rather than working towards a goal you yourself set
---
That 1 button rotation is helping the other 39 players way more than your very complex 5 button unconventional spec
---
It's not about difficulty in this case
---
I mean Paladin is the best healing PvP class bar none though if you are interested in that.
---
Think of it like +hit, only not really. It specifically affects the % chance that a mob can resist your affliction spells. There is a base chance to resist - this talent reduces that.
---
Blink
---
Who cares, right?  I can blink my eyes IRL without even spending Mana.  THIS Blink, however, *teleports your freaking character*!  Useful for travelling, even more so in PvP.
---
Also the human sword spec bonus isn't as valuable for rogues as it is for warriors due to weapon skill present in the combat talents, so nelf is a very good choice from the start.
---
Amazong artwork of an ugly zone ;-)
---
Never once said that I'm striving for hyper balanace. The only thing I've specifically commented on that shouldn't be in the game (and isn't) is a rogue having the ability to kill a fully geared level 60 while naked. You have a terrible habit of inferring things I haven't said or simply stating that I've said them...
---
My dreams were definitely crushed.
---
Orc &gt; Undead
---
That’s true but I think he wants to DPS people down in PvP
---
The wow expansions made the soft players softer.  The hard times of classic will be far too much for them to handle.  It's okay you don't have to understand but you'll see I'm right eventually.
---
I'm leveling my first warrior right now on a pserver (1.12.1) that stays pretty true to vanilla. I've noticed this too, except if you have a jump in gear then  you can go back to fighting things higher level than you.
---
At level 29-30 I was really starting to struggle to kill things. I had the crescent staff from the WC quest as my weapon. It was really good when I got it but it was starting to fall behind. I did the whirlwind axe quest with some friends and suddenly everything changed. It took me a level or two to catch up on my 2h axe skill but most recently, I'm level 35 and killing things level 36-38 without too much trouble (as long as they are humanoid or beast, anyway). This allows me to do quests that are a bit higher level than me granting great xp.
---
So yeah, as a warrior it's good to keep in mind that you may need to fall back to farming green mobs sometimes but it might also mean that you've fallen behind on your gear and that it's time to upgrade (if you can).
---
Why such a deeming respons? Did I hurt your feelings? Because if you read it again, you might actually agree with me. What do you want Classic to be? 
---
Your insults dont really hurt me, I think they are sad. I only see ignorance and anti-intellectualism. Insulting me over things that have little relevance nor have any purpose. Not one of you ever came close to discussing the tought. You are all busy being a Nazi over how me and my toughts are different
---
Eyes of the Beast is the best ability ever taken out of the game. It's mainly for fun but it's actually pretty useful. You can use it to pull around corners or wherever you're having LoS issues. Also you're forgetting it's main use in PvP which is to gank low levels with only your pet and grind them to High Warlord
---
Good luck to you. Back in actual vanilla days I had a hard time getting pugs to let my druid tank.

Isn't it only like 0.04% for each extra point? I always thought that was negligible, too, tbh.
---
&gt; The downside is people would go to dungeons
---
What if people playing in a smartphone / tablet were tagged as such?
---
What in the world are you rambling on about? I was on a pvp server back in the day and I'm rolling pve this time around, just don't have the time to be camped by skull level horde when leveling.
---
Has absolutely nothing to do with a "feeble mind".
---
That face matches the reaction too perfectly
---
I bet the Goblins are behind this.
---
you need to put on your tin foil hat first
---
Demo Shout can be skipped. I put Thunder Clap in there because Thunderfury applies the same debuff regardless of whether you want it or not on the boss.
---
SW:P has already been explained by other users. You'd want Mind Blast (and potentially Mind Flay) to keep Shadow Weaving up.
---
There can be multiple T2 debuffs on the boss at the same time. I would love to see a bunch of T2 hunters stack them and hit crazy numbers, but in a hardcore raid environment, your hunters are most likely going to run T1 to make sure they don't push off more important debuffs.
---
Here's [proof it stacked in 2006](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MS71t-aWAMw). I was curious since people mentioned that video on the hunter discord but I'd never seen it so I looked it up. Skip to 2:20 and check Ragnaros' debuffs. 3 Hunter's Mark icons, which means Hunter's Mark+2 procs.
---
So you want a do-over? Instead of an alternative long term future for wow?
---
Do you know it takes 20 minutes to run from the Ashenvale border to Thousand Needles?
---
Classic is the wild west. If you're afraid of being ganked/camped, roll PvE. It's going to happen.
---
For me it was the Jimmy Warcraft story of the two gnome mages in tbc. Made me instantly quit runescape after seeing it.
---
T1 kind of sucks, but some of them are better than pre-raid BiS.  T2 is amazing, with most pieces being better than non-tier counterparts, and a great 3 piece bonus.  They aren't always BiS, but they are definitely good, and you are guaranteed to get them quickly since you are typically only competing with 1 or 2 other players. You are competing with 10+ other players for cloth drops.
---
&gt;Its gimped dps vs gimped healing and its much better to have gimped healing because it is not gimped nearly enough as dps is.  
---
&gt;Also much easier to replace your holy shadow weaver then your shadow dpser. You have 6+ holy healers who can respec and have the gear available, compared to one shadow priest who if he is missing you are taking out a geared priest to replace him with much worse shadow gear.  
---
&gt;Also no gear conflicts with caster classes. 1 more debuff slot available. Faster getting to 5 stacks compared to dps priest. Several more benefits. It is vastly inferior to have a dps shadow priest compared to holy weaving one.
---
&gt; Because I feel its to easy, but have not gotten to play
---
So you feel it's too easy...but you haven't even played it?
---
Wut.
---
When I'm level 60 during phase 1 as soon as I finish my prebis I'm gonna farm lowbies and drink horde tears to cure my depression.
---
It's not gonna make leveling impossible but you might have to skip populated questing areas and opt to grind in areas alot of people dont go to.
---
I mean...mines on paper, but not alone, haha.
---
Eh, I'm happy to be done with shaman. It was fun because it was my first class. As soon as I tried other classes I never went back. Wish I had switched sooner back then, lol
---
I don't think I ever said it was impossible. And that's awesome, I'm glad it's doable!
---
But this sub really needs to understand that viability and optimal setup's are very different. You have to acknowledge you're an outlier, especially when Warrior tanks are a lot better in most situations.
---
That's really all I'm trying to say.
---
Maybe if you're a cutting edge progression guild then you'd want to police the meme specs. But even average progression guilds should have no problem bringing whatever specs as long as the players aren't brain dead. If you can clear heroics on live with people gray parsing, you can sure as hell do vanilla raids with suboptimal builds.
---
Same. I love TBC. Best xpac for me. Hope we will get TBC Classic later.
---
I think you'll find you just don't have the time for classic.
---
There's so much information now that maybe people will be more open to experimentation. Here's hoping.
---
Vanilla content is just a genocide of all the inhabitants of Azeroth.
---
&gt;Watching Asmon lose everyday to Mcconnell is definitely empowering.
---
Definitely Ret Paladin is the class for you.
---
Most specs were unusable, but there were still a lot of specs that were used.
---
The mage arcane tree is a pretty good example of this. Most deep arcane specs were not considered "arcane mages"
---
Unless its actually guild with fun times and people who like each other instead of just competing over everything
---
The more things change, the more things stay the same!
---
You know whats insane, you! LOLOOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
---
How many times will you try and post this? Are you so in need of human contact that you post this over and over just so people will talk to you? LMFAO
---
Druid: No boom/instant big damage. We have moonfire but thats about it. Really sucks if you are in tight quarters and are trying to keep that fleeing mob from running to other mobs.
---
In actual vanilla so many guilds got stuck on both razergore and vael for months
---
I just posted about warlock tanking so I best go into hiding
---
Human Sword Spec isn’t a “tiny” min/max, it’s a 3-5% DPS increase on all end-game content.
---
Play on private server
---
Some top tier trolling going on here
---
You just had an entire argument explaining how imbalance leads to toxicity, and how that's a bad thing.  You have a terrible habit of saying a lot of things, but having no point.
---
Yes, but bear OT is pretty viable, specially if no one of the warriors are willing to tank.
---
Can't compare that to a Boonkim or Ele Shaman for instance.
---
Depending on how serious speed running gets in classic, bear might see some use in speed runs due to the higher TPS. They aren't the best at mitigation though, some fights will probably be too dangerous to tank safely.  
---
I genuinely hope that feral finds a competitive niche this time around though, post class rework it's far from as bad as people remember them to be.
---
If you think they will remake the subsequent expansions differently than the first time through you are gonna be disappointed.
---
Play retail sad boy
---
3% dps in classic is completely irrelevant lol
---
I feel bad for this dude's kids.
---
Hehehe... nice trolls.
---
I was trying to narrow down his beliefs. I'm sorry you felt like you needed to be involved?
---
Found the spec finder
---
&gt; aren’t at all great at anything
---
Except at being the best damn WSG flag carrier
---
To me, the start of the downfall of WoW was the combination of faction transfers plus Wintergrasp enabling access to a world boss.
---
I was on a realm that was pretty evenly split between the factions. There was a fun rivalry between them. But with Wintergrasp, you had one faction that participated more often and they won a bunch. This resulted in many people faction transferring to the other side, and the problem just kept snowballing worse and worse.
---
It eventually got to the point where one faction was grossly larger than the other, sadly. The realm was pretty much ruined.
---
wtf! no way! I dont believe that. You're all one person arguing with yourself. Why are you lying to yourself?
---
You're not even talking to the OP lol
---
It doesn’t matter if Classic reflects your personal Vanilla experience. All that matters is Classic reflecting 1.12 Vanilla and that it does.
---
15 year memory vs 1.12 reference client. Find out who wins next time on /r/classicwow !!
---
&gt; This 1.12 cassic beta server does not reflect my vanilla experience in dungeons. CC was mandatory and u were punished for bad gameplay.
---
Anyone remember screaming at people to stop fearing in Scarlet Monastery?
---
More often than not one fear would result in half the god damn instance running back towards you ~15 seconds later.
---
Shadowmeld between autos IMPOSSIBLE TO GET HIT
---
My first BG was AB and I was a crappy ret Paladin. Was it me you saw??
---
(At the time, I was garbage.  I’m still garbage, but the kind of garbage you don’t quite take out.  The kind you instead spray with Febreeze™ so you can stand it a bit longer, but eventually remember it’s still trash.)
---
It's not like there aren't in between guilds. I know my guild in vanilla still worked to prioritize debuffs but allowed some of the warlocks to use corruption since we didn't have *every* min max debuff. It's not really an either or situation.
---
Yes *god*. That time I did my first BG and zoned into Stormwind at the end instead of Darnassus.
---
Elwynn was quite nice, I thought.
---
Gotta disagree. You can kill caster mobs as a rogue without them getting a single spell off. Cycling kick and gouge makes them the easiest targets to kill.
---
Yea, there’s a great tutorial on using it by an underrated YouTuber https://youtu.be/e70dtOAUPfc but I don’t think anyone is 100% sure how some of the details will work. It’s available on the beta right now so maybe someone can get a streamer to test how it works.
---
So controversial, yet so brave
---
Flame shield? Basically cheating. Talk to me when you tank rag with your succubus
---
I can almost assure you that there is no video from vanilla of a full group of twinked 30s (or 40s) attempting this dungeon. I understand what you are saying about the damage but Blizzard has already said they tested it in their client and everything seems to be right. You have to understand that the players on the Beta are in some incredible gear for their level. Some of the items they have are from quests more than 10 levels above them. Its not a fair comparison

Fair enough. I'm mostly speaking in terms of progression. Speed running comes once you over gear the content. A lot of crazy stuff is possible then!

Say on a video recently while looking up Easter eggs in vanilla, there was a guy showcasing that very Easter egg in the video and he said he was doing it on the beta.
---
Or rather, from a WoWHead comment stolen by ClassicDB.
---
Classic is different from vanilla cuz I member and my membery is perfect.  Trust
---
Ty men
---
So obvious bait was obvious and you're trying to use that as proof?
---
Nah fam.
---
Do you really?  Yikes.
---
Blizzard literally confirmed this with the actual reference client
---
Joanas guide is the staple for horde. Some are worried that so many people will be using on release that the route may be over crowded. From my experience horde is fairly straight forward when it comes to leveling only problem is there will be ALOT of people questing in the barrens as it’s the bottle neck leveling zone for Tauren, troll, and orc.
---
I say get lost and enjoy playing it as a genuine fresh experience. I'd kill to get that back 😁
---
Just need a level 5 to learn ench and become a DE slave
---
+1. Fingers crossed it works out.
---
Doesnt take into account getting items, food and drink, skills etc. The time would be closer to double or triple even in reality.
---
https://vanillagaming.org/forum/index.php?topic=19592.0
---
is this yours?
---
All you need to do is send your pet in, scatter shot and then feign death.
---
You're here for our progression not yours! Could be worse ways to play though.
---
Most of the people that are posting about this are just going way hardcore. They are looking at clearing content as fast as possible. IMO this isn't very good for the community/economy/game overall, but to each their own. If you want to be apart of one of these guilds then you will have to play the majority of the day/the spec they want you to be/geared and consumed out. 
---
In general, you can raid casually and clear content with the spec you enjoy the most. 100 dps less than your try hard isn't going to make your raid boss wipe. This being said, players that do devote more time to farming consumes, and the best pre-raid BiS will get better treatment in a lot of guilds (not all), obviously because they contribute more. In my experience there are guilds for all sorts of players, with a community that shares a similar play style as you do.
---
I think that naturally guilds tend to relax a lot more when content is on farm, or start to do alt raids. Probably don't spec fire mage for MC thought &gt;.&lt;
---
**Guild name:** &lt;The Implication&gt;
---
**Faction:** Horde
---
**Server:** PVP
---
**Guild Type:** Casual/Raiding/Unconventional/Adult 25+
---
**Raid times:** Probably 2 nights a week. Tues/Thurs, or maybe Wed/Thurs. After 8:00PM CST
---
**Loot System:** Hybrid Loot Council (Attendance + Need, over attendance. If things are equal, you pray to RNGeezus. MT gets tank gear, but can't roll on DPS gear unless it would otherwise be dusted)
---
**Loot System Example:** 2 Mages who are always on for all the raids, and a certain Mage piece drops... say the chest... One mage is 3/8 the other is 4/8 and the 5 piece set bonus is particularly bonkers... we would define "need" as the mage that gets the 5 piece bonus. If they were both 3/8, RNGeezus would decide. And while that scenario does play in the favor of the mage that goes from 3/8 to 4/8 first... once that mage has 5/8 pieces the Mage that was 3/8 would then be able to chase that set bonus before we started trying to push them both to 8/8
---
**Loot Caveats:** 
---
- Thunderfury is a tank weapon and assuming we ever get there, then the MT is going to get this weapon.
---
- Hand of Rag can be used by DPS warriors and Enhancement shamans, but the preference would be that it goes to a shaman because the WF proc videos are going to be hilarious. Also if we're farming Rag enough to get a hand, then the DPS warriors probably all have Askhandi from BWL, and shamans can't use swords.
---
**What we're recruiting:**
---
We're a bunch of 30 somethings with jobs, looking for other 30 somethings with jobs to play with a few nights a week. We do plan on raiding and clearing endgame content, and we plan on being a successful guild, but we're probably not going to world/server first anything. You don't have to be hardcore raider all the time, but if you show up, and participate in the raid, we will expect you to understand your class, and contribute.
---
**Other:**
---
We do not plan on being Min/Max crazy so offspecs are welcome. This means we'll probably be raiding with less than perfect raid composition, but we think that with solid strategy and knowledgeable players we should be able to overcome the limitations imposed by having a boomkin, and enhancement shaman, or a shadow priest in the mix. Obviously the more default specs are welcome as well, we have a well rounded mix on deck already. (At least 1 dedicated prot warrior, a purely feral druid for offtanking/cat dps in raids and mostly for 5 man tanking outside of raids, enhancement shaman who really wants the hand of Rag :D who doesn't want that, right? A boomkin, a healy druid, a whatever the guild needs priest, a rogue, a hunter, a lock, a couple of mages)
---
**We are actively looking for:**
---
- Pure healers (any healing class)
---
- Pure tanks (Prot Warriors, TF is pretty much reserved assuming we get there, but we're totally down to help you farm that stupid book from Dire Maul)
---
- Ranged DPS, I think we have 1 lock and 2-3 mages on tap.
---
- Melee DPS, fury warriors and rogues
---
- Hybrid Specs - Druids/Shamans that aren't pure healbots all the time (bonus if you play a hybrid class and like hilarious PVP antics.... all druid WSG anyone?.... half druid/half shaman WSG?)
---
**Guild rules:**
---
1.) Help out when you're able.
---
2.) If you say you're going to be at a scheduled event (RAID, etc.) be there. If real life gets in the way, just let someone know when you can. Life happens, and this is, after all, just a game.
---
3.) Don't be easily offended our humor is dark, but we're decent folk.
---
4.) Be nice... don't grief (too much) enjoy the game, and allow others to enjoy it as well. Keep the guild name clean(ish) I'd rather not have the server think we're a bunch of ninjas or terribads, we may need to recruit from the servers player base, or bring in another guild for raid nights, and reputation matters.
---
the quest chains you know from post cata are prolly irrelevant anayway?
---
One of the very annoying things on my male tauren warrior alt was getting stuck in every opening and doorway. Kodos being huge didn't help at all.
---
No one thinks that these racials are bad
---
I thought the oases were so awesome when I first found them! The Barrens is pretty damn cool.
---
There is questie addon, which you can use and of course Joanas guide [https://www.joanasworld.com/azeroth.htm](https://www.joanasworld.com/azeroth.htm)
---
That makes no sense. "Boomer" is a specific historical/cultural reference. You're just being incoherent if you use it to mean "someone older than me who has an attitude that I think is out of date."
---
Joanas Guide is pretty awesome.
---
Because it comes off extremely arrogant and patronizing.  Especially when the other guy has solid points and arguments, and you just attempt to pigeonhole his beliefs while making no point of your own.  I'm sorry you feel the need to do that to people.
---
When do I start?
---
For 300-305 it’s .08% in 5 areas. .4% per point with 2% for 5. Add in that if you don’t have 305 skill the game negates 1% of hit from gear so you would need 9% from gear as a non human. Or gear that gives 5 weapon skill.
---
The real bonus though is in glancing blow damage reduction not the hit rate increase. If it was just hit who cares you can make up for that. However when 40% of white hits are glancing and you can reduce the penalty they receive, it just bumps up the damage increase.
---
Again for a rogue not as important as the talents give you weapon skill for whatever weapon type you want (maces, daggers, swords and fist). Ultimately it will still lower your dps compared to a human but not as big a difference for rogue as it is for a warrior.
---
I dont Thing 20. But have to Test myself
---
I’d rather have a mediocre player I can stand for 4 hours than a top dos dbag
---
I suggest enjoying it, read quests, and play like you don’t know what you’re doing.
---
Exactly.  Someone dramatically over-performing due to gear, skill, or level might be "carrying" you through the content more *quickly* or *easily*, but if you're still putting in all of the work and would have succeeded even without this over-performing player, they aren't carrying you through the content itself.
---
"We would have won anyways, but you made it easier," is not what carrying means.
---
Shaman's sentry totem can prevent death by falling in vanilla.
---
Just jump from any height and when you are about to hit the ground you wtich back to the totem's vision, then switch back
---
Mages: You really want to lead with frostbolt. But you can't frostbolt a mob before a hunter can tag it with an instant shot. In fact, a hunter can tag your mob with an instant shot while your frostbolt is in the air, forcing you to kill the mob for him after your frostbolt pulls the aggro.
---
Basically you can't compete with a hunter for spawns at all.
---
Why not go skinning/enchanter to start and drop skinning for the tailoring?  That way you can DE soulbound stuff for mats while leveling.  I guess with tailoring at start you can craft bags?
---
Regardless of the group or level difference loss bonus there will be powerleveling done via SM, ZF, and various outdoor zones (dependant on world pvp and competition).
---
Huh, no doubt, thanks for the explanation.
---
sure just put in a huge amount of effort like a 1%er did
---
If you have a better link be my guest bud
---
They had better add more servers, then.
---
How many suboptimal specs? Is cutting edge progression in this case just referring to the newest gated content to be released?
---
It always amazes me when a rogue thinks they accomplished something by hiding on a PvP server all the way to 60 while every other class never could be cowards and hide from everyone else.
---
TLDR: LOL
---
You're right.  Megathread stickies are a waste of time.  They serve no purpose except to make mods feel justified/better about deleting other people's post.
---
I think mana spring starts being a net positive after 20 seconds.
---
Sit tight til we see some fresh 60's trying to run UD Strat or Scholo, tuning got tighter the closer to 60 you got, from what I remember. Regardless, even if its still easy, it's compared the reference client they have on file, not a bunch of random gamer's memories, so I trust what they're doing.
---
Trying to understand his point of view is pidgeonholing? Are you serious? I assume that people come from a place of thought when they make statements like "instanced pvp ruined the game" so I was trying to understand how he got there. You can fuck right off.
---
What? You definitely SHOULD kill Ony with 40 priests if you get the chance. Live a little man.
---
They are trying to make Classic as close to Vanilla as possible, and here you are saying it's going more in the direction of Retail without explaining how.
---
How is Classic starting to feel like Retail?
---
delusional
---
I mean, idk why you went on a long diatribe about something I explained in my reply. Again, I hardly did dailies, never felt like the game was making me log in to do them either, and I was still able to afford flying training and a mount. When I did do them it was pretty clear they were designed to be completed quickly so it wasn't an issue. If you did *all* of them every single day then yeah I could see how it could feel like a chore... But that goes for practically anything.
---
As far as vanilla professions go you'd only need to do those transmutations if you wanted to make specific pieces of gear, and you could buy up multiple peoples' transmutes in one day... So that argument is pretty invalid.
---
You could still grind to your heart's content in TBC if you wanted to sit down for 6 hours all at once btw, but from your first post you made it sound as if you didn't even have time to do that so I'm not sure what the issue is.
---
&gt;Maybe you all will get it when Vanilla is there and leaves it to you when you log in and what you do that day.
---
I played Vanilla from beginning to end and I still never had a problem with dailies or anything TBC did for that matter.
---
Marks on units were in classic.  Location marks were much later (I think Wrath or Cata).  I remember throwing colored smoke markers to indicate positioning.
---
Lol woops
---
Very true. I always loved being wsg MVP
---
The gun from AQ is top tier until naxx and that's about it. But ranged skills don't matter as much as melee cause no party and no glancing.
---
Pick PvP server, don't pick PvE especially as a rogue.
---
Don't look at racials as your only motivation for selecting a race, also consider what you're mostly willing to look at for ages, because that's the character you'll be looking at ALL THE TIME.
---
When you decide which race you want to play, you pick the faction accordingly.
---
All the rogue races are valid choices.
---
Troll warlock....lol
---
World pvping in STV and all of the dungeons, in their original forms. Can't wait to explore Scholo &amp; Strat again!
---
Oh, and not being at work for the first few days after launch, lmao!
---
Now I just need an addon that counts my kills.
---
Are druids actually going to be horrendous in raids? I hope not because I love resto druid
---
All these priests and warriors are never going to get geared if everyone rolls them because they believe they're so "cookie-cutter" for raiding
---
I'm on the same.page dude, as long as the gameplay etc doesn't change one bit what's the problem, I can see only pros for myself, I'll be able to easily farm mats, like yourself I'll be able to play in down time at work etc, and when I am playing on my laptop people playing on mobile from the other faction will be easy pickings
---
He's a physicist so that probably wouldn't be overlooked regardless
---
I can still remember clear as day my friend ethan coming down the hall in 7th grade telling me about a new game he got i needed to try. Game over after that.

---
DAoC was great!
---
I can't decide. I will be more familiar with rogue but part of me wants to experience something else.
---
Such scenario is in play. Blizzard is ready for all scenarios, from a 90% dropout rate in 2-3 months, to a steady increase in the player base after launch. Ofc, a 90% dropout rate is highly unlikely, and a steady increase in players is as unlikely.
---
With this in mind, Blizzard come up with a number of "preemptive strikes". First one being layering, and second one being name reserve 2 weeks prior to launch.
---
Layering is in place for the highest probable scenario : the dropouts. A normal dropout rate for a new MMO is usually 40% in the first 3 months. Now, Classic is not a new game, and the dropout SHOULD be less than 40% in 3 months...but, here lays the problem : tourists.
---
Tourists will be from BfA, mainly. I don't see many tourists from outside WoW. There will be some, but not as many as to impact the dropout rate.
---
However, there will also be PLENTY of former WoW players that will try Classic, and will probably not stay for long. They can also be considered tourists, or maybe semi-tourists?
---
All that being said, I believe that the dropout rate to be around 50% in 3 months after Classic releases. After this critical 3 month period, the dropout rate will be close to zero. Pretty much, the players who will stay after 3 months, will also stay for the enxt 12 months.
---
The name reserve option will be a good indicator of how many people will play long term, because it is obvious that who is going to sub before launch to reserve a name, is a long term player. We won't know how many of us will do it, but Blizzard will know.
---
That number will be taken into consideration FOR LAUNCH, and for calculating the potential dropout rate after launch. The realm names will be known before the name reserve option (Aug. 13th), and if Blizzard adds more realms, we will know that more people than expected opted for name reserve.
---
Since at launch, the number of concurrent players = number of total players, and since a Vanilla realm usually had 10-12k players in total, with a predicted 50% dropout rate for Classic, we can expect 8 layers per realm, each with 3k players, at launch day.
---
That will be 24k total players, with 12k total players remaining in 3 months, with 3k concurrent players.
---
Ofc, the layers will drop from 8 to 4 in first month (biggest dropout rate is in the first month), from 4 to 2 in second month and from 2 to 1 in third month, while the layer size will increase for the total player number and stay the same for concurrent players number.
---
Streamers realms. Now, this will be naturally solved. We will know from Day 1, second 1, which realms will have popular streamers. A LOT of people will reroll on different realms. I believe, that the effect will be reversed on streamers realms. Those will be the realms with less players, instead the ones will more players.
---
Sure, some of those realms will have more players, but, only a handful of them. Free transfers. Or leave the streamers realms overcrowded. VERY SOON, a lot of players will reroll on other servers.
---
Blizzard have solutions for the vast majority of realms. 3-4 realms won't matter in the grand scheme of things. Free transfers, leaved them overcrowded and let players naturally leave...or let them be on long queues.
---
I am not worried at all about what will Blizzard do regarding the population dynamic. They have all the means to greatly diminish either a huge dropout, or a huge surge that will increase over time.
---
How do I delete posts on Reddidt again?

 **&lt;Celestial Born&gt; \[NA - PvE Server - A\]** is a new two night raiding guild recruiting for WoW Classic.
---
If you are...
---
...looking to experience MC/Ony during Classic Phase 1 (no DM)
---
...T3 BiS minded
---
...seeking a work/play balance
---
...thinking organized vacation rotation is a wonderful idea
---
...and hoping to play with driven, mature, and friendly adults
---
then we may be the perfect fit for you.
---
As Celestial Born grows we find ourselves home to many outstanding players from Vanilla to Private Server to Retail. We’ve played many MMOs at all levels of dedication and leadership, and have fondly held onto our Vanilla member berries as some of our most treasured. To us a major component to having fun in an MMO is efficiency and proper organization. We seek to be driven but friendly and aim to take advantage of an early-recruitment cycle for Classic to bring like-minded players together who will establish a thriving, competitive, and healthy guild culture.
---
**Purpose:**
---
Celestial Born is being built on a foundation of striking a key balance between real life time constraints and completing the Vanilla raid experience. Our end game is to achieve guild-wide T3 BiS. In light of this, and out of respect for our playtime, we will run the guild in a serious and highly organized manner, but will also work to keep the fun and adventurous spirit of Vanilla in everything we do.
---
Our initial goal will be to experience MC/Ony in Phase 1 as originally intended. In order to achieve this we are requiring an average of 34 hours played per week for the first 8-10 weeks. Please refer to the Charter at[ celestialborn.com](http://www.celestialborn.com/) for the napkin math behind this. We won’t require this rate of play to be sustained beyond the leveling experience. Our goals are intensive, but we aren’t necessarily intense or strict in nature.
---
Tuesdays: 6:00 –10:00 pm. PST
---
Wednesdays: 6:00 – 10:00 p.m. PST
---
We will eliminate Wednesdays as much as possible.
---
In accordance with our aim to establish a long-term work/play balance we will be implementing an optional rotating raid attendance schedule. With a little bit of planning and personal responsibility this system will allow all of us to take breaks without guilt, eliminate a standby bench, stave off burn out, and provide a degree of roster protection.
---
**Loot:**
---
Pre-designated loot council (details in website Charter)
---
We are still recruiting for many positions. It should be noted that if you resonate with us but are unable to commit to our raid program we may be open to recruiting you as a non-raiding member. Such positions remain selective and are held to all of our member expectations.
---
If you are interested in becoming a part of what we’re building please refer to our website at[ celestialborn.com](http://www.celestialborn.com/) and read over the Charter. The Charter will answer many questions that are beyond the scope of this post as well as serve as the best means for you to assess whether we are a good match.
---
Thanks for reading. May you find your perfect guild!
---
Why are they nerfing raids?
---
Until 1 person loads up a meter and links it in /w to your raid leader after Rag submerges twice. 
---
Everybody gets sweaty when a boss has kicked your ass for 3 weeks.
---
Guilds that are dedicated to hardcore raiders are going to min/max and these things will matter.  However, there will be plenty of casual guilds that are much more relaxed.  Most of the advice you see tends to lean towards the hardcore side, since casuals are... well, more casual.  Only the people trying to push the limits are going to care about all the min/max stuff.
---
You must be new
---
&gt; "If you aren't playing PRECISELY this spec, PRECISELY this way, you'll be useless in raids/PvP and no one will play with you"
---
What's funny is this seems to be the same group that then talks about how easy raiding is in WoW.
---
It's from world of roguecraft episode 2
---
Lol you come back to the word bad. How about failures? Guilds that do not beat the raid content pre nerf have failed to beat the content. You are comparing apples to oranges.
---
Upvoted for laying.
---
Ah yes, everyone will be extremely pissed on the raid!! Its so hard when we have these 2 rets around!! Even though people clear MC in during the first weeks in green gear, the whole raid is so pissed off at these paladins!! Chill man. Its gonna be alright.

I dont think flying in tbc was a bad design, nor that there were ever a drought to casual players.  
---
What differates tbc flying from all other expansion is that flying is used to unlock new content, new quests new dungeons new grinds, instead of a skipping mechanism it became a core thing you need to have to get all the content, which is really gr8.   
---
World pvp was alive and well with objectives on maps and with rep farms to unlock better gear for your character was way more than enough for a casual player to skim through before getting burned out.  
---
Not only that but pvp was really fun in tbc, way more fun than vanilla ( IMO ) with most classes having broken specs, you had the SL/SL unkillable lock, druid with hoTS and cyclone which was beyond broken, rogue with their stun until dead rotations. Mage being extremly high skill cappped and so on, so pvp was really really fun, and you could get really good pvp gear smoothly instead of waisting 6 months of your life to get rank 14.  
---
There was TON of content, severall epic questlines at max lvl and really alot to do, i really didnt notice this until i played on a private server.  
---
And kara was very easy after a while which most casuals could skum through.
---
Anything that reduces armor. The rest is without exceptions surprisingly optional and composition dependent.
---
I leveling a Warlock up to 30 on pservers and just didn't enjoy the play style. They are for sure very strong at leveling, but just dotting and waiting didn't do it for me. There something satisfying about taking a chunk of life out of your opponent whether through sword or magic bolt.
---
[The Barrens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KknkTZCxwgs)
---
Just never played horde, care to explain?
---
the worst
---
Thanks for the info. I've always found creating the page itself to be the least intuitive part. Just finished a near 12 hour shift so kind of tired right now, but I'll look into it later.
---
or a rogue who doesn't quite understand why everyone keeps whispering him about his deadly poison
---
Ive actually seen this video haha, i hope its viable as it does look fun and i plan to run hunter
---
Trolls can't be warlocks... even in retail
---
Yes, most likely. Also, more than most likely, there won't be 12k players when AQ opens. More like half.
---
God be with you my friend.
---
How do low priority debuffs work? As far as I know ignite is also a low priority debuff but it's obviously a lot more important than deep wounds. Can deep wounds knock it off or will it say up since it does more damage?
---
Phenomenal series. I'd you like Sanderson's worlds, I highly recommend The Wheel of Time, by Robert Jordan. It's a *loooong* ride, but Sanderson finished the series. Robert Jordan passed before finishing it.
---
Mind Flay also takes a debuff slot, is SUPER long range and you cannot move while running. Spam r1 SWP tbh.
---
Hahaha he's chill as. I love random friendly abuse fights.
---
Rule of cool.  Whatever you think is cooler.
---
Yeah except not really.  You do know that there are guilds that actually just want to raid together and work to overcome the obstacle together instead of recruiting their way through content.
---
I try to explain in the post. Its ofcourse going to be its own thing. But its more like Retail than Vanilla, because you won't face the same challange, it wont be as hard or rewarding and ect. I propose that In order for a authentic Vanilla experiance the game should be made abit harder. I also made another post about the future and what do to afther the current timeline. However I feel like we should bump the numbers before launch. Like people did not run out of quest ect
---
Remember Barrens Chat?  It's back.  In pog form.
---
Troll warlocks don't exist in classic. Troll warlock is a cataclysm thing
---
You can have 40 non-meta specs and still clear any content except maybe naxx, which I didn't clear and can't comment on. You won't clear as fast or as easily but it's entirely doable. For the majority of the playerbase, it'll be bad/unskilled play holding you back, not the class/spec you are playing.
---
Having leveled Shaman numerous times on Vanilla and Pservers, I honestly feel as if there’s no one major downside, just a lot of minor annoyances. Such as having to recast totems to prevent yourself from aggroing mobs. The downtime isn’t great either, but it’s not exactly brutal.
---
They're starting the game with 1.12 talent trees. They also changed the water, the max graphics settings will support much higher resolutions, etc. They have already made changes to the game, this isn't a 100% recreation.
---
It does?
---
 &lt;Lok'Tar Ogar&gt; - Semi-Hardcore 
---
It clearly says "used to" within the first sentence of the post my man. I would argue that most people rank them lower on the totem pole compared to perception, wotf, shadowform, or even war stomp, but imo they're just as good.
---
It really isn't fun to go tri-spec but it is super beneficial for a raid with lots of warlocks, especially if there are only 8 debuff slots. But yeah, fuck that shit in particular.
---
"You merely adopted the grind. I was born in it, molded by it. I didn't max my first skill until I was a man."
---
It's almost like there are different people subscribed to this sub, and not a coherent unified mass of people that keep changing their mind all the time :)
---
If you actually think that level 60 and raids will not kill hype for the game then you are truly a moron. Your argument is fucking stupid, not everyone is some nerd that has played private servers the last 10 years
---
It's just a meme ... and you are right, Vanilla WoW did have that variety with specs that you could build to suit your playstyle and get the utility you needed.
---
Those talent trees were magical!
---
I'm sure your 14 year old memory is completely infallible.
---
Not as much, both participants have to agree (be flagged for PvP) to attack each other which nullifies a Rogue getting the jump on the enemy which is the big advantage Rogues have in PvP.
---
Dw I was just kidding, I just like permeating the stereotypes about Americans on the web it's fuckin hilarious to me
---
I feel sorry for the filthy casual dwarf priests who are such sheltered snowflakes, that they need to ward off any kind fear in order to not get their feelings hurt
---
orcs and undead can be warlocks not trolls. Trolls can be hunter/mage/rogue/priest/warrior (I think is all) Edit - forgot shaman
---
For warlock I’d go Undead for WotF and overall aesthetic. Their casting animations are REALLY satisfying... Undead also have their own unique leveling zone, Silverpine Forest, around the time Orcs, Tauren, and Trolls are fighting for resources in the Barrens. Around levels 10-20 I think. Also, the zone and lore of the Forsaken really compliments a warlocks ego. You’d really enjoy it.
---
Comparing Wrath sub numbers to Vanilla is idiotic. Ever heard of market saturation?
---
He’s back again, I wonder what we’ll deduce from this one being downvoted?!
---
Let's hope so anyway.
---
I’m sure that’s what you’ll tell your Raid Leader when he substitutes you out for a better performer.
---
In tbc all shadow damage spells would use the buff so shadow priests mind blasts and other locks shadowbolts would use 1 tick of the debuff
---
It's not THAT much damage lost for not being to put up all debuffs. Probably something like 20% hp increase to bosses would more than offset it and it'd make it much nicer to play as no-one have to gimp and hold back their full kit.
---
Arena as in instanced 2v2, 3v3 and 5v5.
---
No 1v1 as you said. Also, I didn't mention flying mounts as a think I'd like.
---
Oh, yes it was surely you then. My superior trash was too much for your hot garbage.
---
I've decided on leveling a warlock first and will be saving all cloth and skinning mats I get while leveling for professions and professions of alts. Since I won't have to invest a ton of gold in a mount, I'll save gold for my second character and be able to level them quickly and efficiently with the leftover money. Then be able to crank up to 300/300 in tailoring and LW. Hopefully land in a decent guild and grind for rare Pats.
---
same!
---
Bear is probably the best OT in the game as they can do decent DPS when tanking is not needed, equip mana gear and help decursing on some bosses and go tank trash better than warrior.
---
One well itemized feral druid is something even a serious raiding guild will want.
---
Ehh, for lower tier content there will be a lot of dps shamans, paladins, druids and priests, as it will be very easy to clear. AQ and naxx cant allow them anymore, but most wont make it there anyway.
---
earthbind totem works better than frost shock for kiting and you can still regen mana with the 5 second rule
---
it's gotten to the point where very-slightly-less-than-optimized specs like combat daggers are being treated like survival hunters.
---
My guild had ferals, shadow priests and even ele shamans on the raids. Not AQ or naxx of course, but the low tier raids are so easy it doesnt matter a shit what you bring
---
You asked which race has the best perks for rogue and got the answer.
---
I'm not saying that.
---
I'm saying that instead of just remaking every expansion they could take the OSRS way of development and never add things they regreted (like flying mounts).
---
Wich means never adding the regular expansions, but instead keep vanilla/classic as a separate thing but keep developing stuff for it
---
I have my sets macrod for quick swapping ooc. I barely ever have to bandage or eat
---
Just watch some of the streamers on Twitch to get a good idea of how well the devs are doing to bring it back.
---
I think Esfand did a world first in the beta last night clearing Uldaman and tanking it as a paladin and it took them over 4hrs
---
entangling roots bro
---
To be fair osrs mobile is awesome. You can play anywhere with service. It's never as good as the pc but you can play at least. Granted I see wow being a lot more difficult to play on mobile.
---
I concur.
---
fire blast m8
---
And it's such a memorable item. I know I carried it *forever* waiting for the right time to use it.
---
Did you just assume that priests gender during pride month?
---
I did it in Beta. It's there.
---
Guess it depends how comfortable your guild is handicapping themselves now and in the future by bringing &amp; giving gear to non-meta specs.
---
In my experience through Naxx on several different servers, serious guilds just plain and simply won't. 
---
I have a hard time seeing a raid stocked with non-meta specs taking down bosses like Vael, and alot of others that work on enrage timers, though, unless they already have those raids on farm status and have their members geared out.
---
Your such a little streamer defending bitch. VERY pathetic.
---
Once you got flying in TBC, it served the same purpose as in WotLK.  It's just that instead of Skettis and TK, we flew to ICC.
---
No prob like to get the info out when possible.
---
I wonder how classic would square up if blizzard dropped a massive patch in retail on the same day.
---
The run from ratchet to just the bottom of barnes feels like it takes at least an hour
---
Sadly, people are assholes and unless you learn how to deal with it there are no kind words that will save you. I agree with you, but it seems most people don't agree with us
---
&gt;the only thing that truly "solves" the problem is willpower and self actualization. Other people won't be able to make the person not-anxious/depressed/whatever
---
Couldn't have said it better
---
that wasnt a problem of spec, for razergore atleast. that fight sucked donky balls to work through
---
I'll be subbing to classic. Retail will be my free game.
---
Every class is viable in WPVP. The main deciding factors in WPVP are who jump who at what % life and whether or not the third man jumps in to help. :)
---
guess you didn't read the OP
---
The truth is that the math has already been done and the meta set in stone. Over a decade ago. Nothing has changed, so people still will not want ret pallies and ele shamans. Those super awesome buffs they provide can be given in heal spec, so they have no benefit to them being on dps spec.
---
This doesn't mean you can't get lucky and get a raid slot, especially if you are friends with the guild leaders or happen to be on at just the right time when they need a fill and no one else wants to go. 39 good specs and a subpar &gt; 39 good specs. But it's also cruel to make someone excited about raiding level his shaman all the way to 60, expecting to get into raid easily and find out he can't find any guilds willing to let him go. Especially when he would have rolled Mage if someone would have told him otherwise.
---
It's wrong to tell someone they will get a raid spot easy. It's wrong to tell them they won't. There are too many factors, from what server you are on, to what the players there feel regardless of the facts, to how many guilds there have the raids on farm, to what point in time (be it launch, or 1 year in) you are playing at that will decide which of these is true. It's easier to just be honest and tell them which specs are shit and not wanted so they can prepare themselves to not be invited if it comes to that, and they can choose whether or not they think the gamble is worth it.
---
Oh look, it's that angry dad repost again.
---
Hi, /u/Fawa
---
Thanks! I'll leave the clip version but updated the credit. Also a fun find to watch on youtube
---
I think you mean only in combat.
---
Played on Defias during Cata/MoP, it was more of a WPvP/Drama server with a shitton of toxicity and some absolutely horrible people. I loved it.
---
I believe so, but some people in the beta have discovered through testing that Shadow Oil (which causes shadow bolts on hit when applied to a weapon) benefits from the effect *without* consuming a charge.
---
Yep. I guess we were very comfortable with it. We cleared MC BWL and ZG always with ease. People werent competing that much and we had fun. It wasnt optimal of course
---
Hey guys,
---
Looking for a later than usual raiding guild.
---
I intend to play Horde as a Rogue.\[NA\] I am not sure whether to play PVE or PVP so I do not really have a preference. I live on the east coast but my hours would be 11pm-2am EST given my current schedule.
---
Given that it will be so late at night I will be likely looking for a west coast guild raiding at 8pm-11pm, 9pm-11pm or whatever works out. 2-3 nights peferred.
---
My vanilla experience was MC to AQ40 as a warrior. Ive also raided in TBC to Hyjal/BT as a rogue and warlock. I raided for a few tiers (Heroic) in WoD and Legion as a DK.
---
Generally wondering if any guilds may have a fit to my weird schedule. Please DM me if interested!
---
I always like to pop out of stealth behind an opposite faction chap while they're fighting a difficult mob, then help them kill it :D
---
They panic a bit then calm down, its hilarious.
---
nah but I played SWToR with this character name cus "Jawa" was taken.
---
I agree it has some negative effects but also adds positive ones when the zone has flying in mind. I thought flying in Outlands and Northrend was done tastefully, such that the negatives were outweighed by what it brought. If your looking for the real "step" its Cata...
---
LMAO at T R I G G E R E D tbc fan boys losing their shit at the truth. TBC heralded the death of WoW.
---
Both here and in your OP, you lose. LOOSE is the opposite of TIGHTEN.
---
I'm between Warrior and mage, Main tanking sounds fun but hard to get that role in a top guild
---
Yeah, but that's also when people start bringing alts into raids and stuff, too. 
---
Everyone gets a little more freedom once you get through it. Progressing to that point is the tough part for most people.
---
I really hope there's a compelling story behind this - you're a 30ish vanilla veteran who brought a pen case to work or something similar :)
---
Your group has no tank, if you want to get into raids you’ll need somebody to pick up a shield to get your friend group through BRD and U/LBRS.
---
Thank you for the report, it sounds like I remember it :) Can't wait till I get to join as well. See you all the 27th!
---
Nice one
---
I take it you never played FFXI. I was the 1st NA Bard to 75 with 30 days played.

Guild: &lt;No name yet&gt; (US - East) (Horde) Home Realm - Undecided About us - A new Wow Classic guild run by veterans from Wrath and Cata. Not a super serious Guild, but still organized and a good community!
---
Raid Schedule - Undecided (Not enough members to decide yet)
---
PVP Schedule - Undecided (Not enough members to decide yet)
---
Goal as of May 30th, 2019 - To get around 30 - 40 members before the launch of Wow Classic.
---
Overall Goal - To get an amazing, consistent playing community that helps each other out, and also raids, pvp, and ect.
---
Member requirements - Needs to have at least some experience in Wow in general, whether its from playing 5 years ago, only have been playing for a year, or playing on private servers.
---
What we need - Members that are pretty dedicated and committed to stay for the majority of the Wow Classic life span, and also members in general
---
We are right now recruiting people in every way possible and getting them into our discord server for this guild. Any one can help build our community and have an awesome guild. We are not a super hardcore guild, but will eventually semi hardcore raid, bg, and pvp.
---
If you like the sound of all that, either comment below your Discord ID, or Add me on Discord (ScaryLarry38#0963) And I will run you through a few short questions to join the Guild. Thanks!
---
They literally did last for 2-3 days sometime and waking up to the same people and AV battle raging was so much!
---
Ty
---
Yeah the pvp in the roguecraft movies is questionable but the music and theme is very fun.  They were wildly popular in vanilla and the creator, mute, had a guild called rogues take zero skill on arthas.  Shame about the boating accident though
---
I feel the need to fuck right in, when i read something as absurd as:
---
&gt; Which is why I said imbalance is toxic. It's creates negative relationships between players.
---
also, it's why I *inferred* that you would rather things be as balanced as possible.  Which is why I also felt the need to chime in.  Because that's one of the reasons retail WoW blows.
---
&gt; Mobility is also thing I like, I don’t want to be stuck in one spot while fighting, I like having control of my character.    
---
Don't play a Shadow Priest then. They get locked down like crazy in PvP. Particularly against a Rogue with a braincell, some Shamans, and Warlocks (Felpuppy). Hunters can out-range/pet.    
---
You need engineering just to be a fully working class (bombs, etc). And even then if they're Undead gg. You only really hard counter Mages, Warriors (except high gear), and healers (Mana Burn).
---
lol go play Sims 3 you stupid bitch
---
I honestly think Wrath was the bigger change, but I guess there is a point to be made that TBC dungeons required much less CC and coordination than Vanilla dungeons did.
---
Here we go again...
---
True true. That is a fun phase
---
Hey if you want to be a memester thats fine. Just know that you are a burden by playing ineffcient
---
Chill dude
---
When me President they see.. They see
---
I could not imagine Blizzard wanting Classic to outcompete Retail. So im really trying to be on our side. Think of all the micro transactions, character boost ect.. It would be best for us if Classic is smaller than retail, subscription based and its own thing. Els we gotta generate the same ammount of funds or Die out when the timeline is over.
---
I am subbed here but lately I've been trying to avoid reading it because it's just a *drag*. I'm excited to play classic, but people are so eager to shit on streamers and the retail experience, like they're obligated to in order to enjoy Classic. It's become ridiculously toxic and hateful and I'd honestly rather run into streamers in the game at this point than some of the classic zealots that hang out in here.
---
I agree this community is super toxic
---
&gt; The second and most important aspect of this talent is that if you are in a bad dungeon group filled with dbags, then you can use this skill to get revenge on them for calling you a huntard. Wait for the group to make the next pull, then take control of the pet, hit sprint, and pull a ton of shit. Then Feign Death, and hearth out. Instant justice. 
---
That's a pretty huntard thing to do.
---
Well sure. ”Memesters” werent a thing back then, so I’ll just play like back in the day ;)
---
Agree with everything you said except that you say casual players were not quite a majority in BC. Casuals were always, and will always, be a huge majority of players in WoW. Literally since day 1

Like many said. We know so much more and acces to information was a big factor in succes. We also have gotten allot better.. playing so many more hours. Allot of reasons.
---
The mafias won’t be a thing cross faction collusion is against Blizzard TOS and will be stopped
---
Also layering
---
Paging /u/SoupaSoka
---
That has to be a glitch, right? Doesn't sound like intended behavior....
---
I'd say go Mage.
---
You'll have a hard time PvP'ing as a protection or fury warrior, and you'll have a hard time finding a raid group that wants an arms warrior. 
---
Most raids in my experience will also only take 1-2 shadow priests, also. Everyone else will be forced to spec in Holy, and they suck in PvP unless you want to be a dedicated healer in PvP, also.
---
Mage will allow you to do both PvE &amp; PvP at a high level with the same spec.
---
Warlock, Rogue, and Hunter are also like this where you can be very effective in both PvP &amp; raids without changing your spec. I don't really remember what the meta PvP spec for druids was in vanilla, but like every other hybrid class - they were healbots in raids.
---
Yea, I can see that being a problem, we will be doing raids more casually especially compared to how the group will be treating PvP, we are doing raiding more for just fun and doing it, but PvP we are taking it seriously
---
I may get burned out on vanilla but it’s only for a period then I crave it again.... generally though I don’t get burned out... I just play different character and it’s all good.
---
Is this a meme?  Advice so bad it has to be.
---
Oh man bringing back AB memories.
---
Serpent Sting of course!
---
A lot of specs aren't viable at end-game. You won't see many raids with non-healing Paladins and Druids, or Arms Warriors, Arcane Mages, etc.
---
This may not be entirely accurate. I do believe GW2 is very good at what it does but WoW is too big to fail. Classic is insane nerd boner for every MMO and Blizzard fan. I love GW2 and I think that both, combat, PVP, PVE, story, itemization, skins and overall finish is so much better than WoW in any form, but WoW is what I grew up with. Getting legendary in GW2 feels epic, bit it is no Thunderfury. Playing WvWvW is epic, but it is no AV. I am not saying GW2 experience is bad experience, after all all the content is still relevant while WoW dumbs the previous expansion content as soon as new expansion comes out, but for some reason, the background story is so much better, maybe because nostalgia or lore setting or whatever. 
---
GW2 is amazing game and I will continue playing it for long time I guess, but there was something about WoW that calls me back. I am not sure if I play it or not, I have problems making decisions but while waiting to release, I will continue crafting Nevermore and doing fractals. I know for sure it is not nostalgia or pink goggles. Just look at what is happening on this sub or twitch. Preach is an amazing experience of Classic WoW is, he knew he hated everything about it and knew new WoW was better and harder.... until he made character on Classic beta.
---
How much of a dps decrease would it be? I’d rather have one spec be viable in PvP, PVE, farming than have to constantly switch to a PVE spec that does 5% more dps or so
---
Titanbar + Titan XP iirc does it. It has kills to level.
---
Damn, killing 8165 mobs every minute would be impressive /s
---
Haven’t you posted this before??
---
I expect a good majority to abandon it quickly though, including many here on this very sub. It was a good experience when it came out because we were coming from DAOC, EQ, UO, and AC. It had many player friendly features that the other games did not have but the biggest was lack of death penalty; no lost experience or dropping of your loot.   
---
however it still was stuck with old school MMO issues that EQ had too, spawning issues for quests related mobs and no class balance. plus to get anywhere you need to be social which isn't what a lot of players naturally are. People will tolerate the issues only to experience how the game was back then but the lack of reward and very slow progress for the solo crowds will drive them out.
---
It will however benefit Blizzard because they can hide BFA issues with boosted subs for classic for a few months.
---
It's so difficult to come up with a "dropout" rate. Playing wow or not playing it is not boolean. You can play it less or you can no-life it. What we perceive is not players that play WoW every week but *concurrent* players.
---
And it will be a bit more layered. There will be a huge rush of people day 1. Some will be stuck in queues. Some will quit due to that without ever having played. Do we count those?
---
Your reasoning seems to make sense after things stabilize in 1-2 weeks, *then* your thought processes seem to hold.
---
Day 1 is just like a giant big bang. There is no predicting the first few days. Way too many variables. What if they screw up? What if there are bugs? What if the servers go down? What if layering can be exploited and people hit 60 in less than 4 days?
---
I only knew one person with dual warglavies who was pvping and i believe the account was sold.
---
It's how guild recruitment has always worked unless you can get someone senior in the guild to vouch for you. Guilds know what they need and they know what is desirable. By playing something undesirable you are going to have your options restricted in what guilds will take you. You might not think that matters but there are going to be guilds stuck in BWL and do you really want to be in that guild when the better guilds progressing into AQ don't want you.
---
Lol exactly what I thought.  It's the same as the in-game map except worse because it's a rough hand drawing.  Not saying it's not nice, but when comparing two images of the same style we don't need to lie and say the rough drawing is better than a polished one in game.
---
There’s always a chance if you’re US to join an EU server, ping isn’t as bad nowadays as it used to be, so if you’re willing to suffer with 100-200ms ping that could be an option
---
Yeah, haha, totally agree. Unfortunately it's also when 99% of guilds seem to fall apart. That Vael fight is one of the biggest hurdles I can remember.
---
try this, it should have what you are looking for...
---
http://www.vanilla-info.com/warrior
---
The Barrens music &lt;3
---
It's some kind of addon for pre-1.12 versions. Seen it in multiple old school screenshots on this sub but never saw anybody mention what addon it was.
---
It most likely doesn't exist for 1.12, because I've never seen it in many years of playing on PS.
---
Kevin, do you feel ok?
---
Me feel good. Body strong. Sleep big last night.
---
Raids are only a small part of the game :)
---
That it was. First MMO I ever played and I haven't felt that sense of immersion and community since. Think everyone has such a soft spot for their first MMO experience. So much love for that game.
---
The Phoenix server did a great job although I don't play it anymore.
---
I know Broadsword is making their own classic server but I don't think I am really that interested.
---
I've noticed such a duality regarding spec viability. When I talk to people about playing Balance Druid or Shadow Priest the community simultaneously tells me that I'm going to find my place and also be useless scum. It's kind of surreal at points and I don't know what to expect when I actually start playing, but I'm excited to find out.
---
Thanks a ton!
---
Considering I’m not going for literal world firsts, it’s not going to matter. Everything up til Naxx is clearable with **literal** potatoes in your raid. If you think 3% damage matters you’re delusional as hell.
---
Oh wait, it’s you. LMAO.
---
THE BLACKLISTED
---
No, it generates 1 rage per 3 seconds outside of combat too.
---
...at least, it did on private servers. No reason why it shouldn't, because the tooltip does say "out of combat rage decay".
---
Maybe we’ll see. Will be interesting to see what the difference in flasking is when you don’t have custom node spawns and dynamic node spawns.
---
I fully expect it to be cleared quicker than Vanilla was but I wonder if everyone will be flasking constantly like on pservers when we know that classic will have the og set up of black lotus spawns which pservers don’t.
---
Hey thanks! I started out with the Mistborn series and will move on to the Wheel of time, then of course, to start on the Stormlight Archive!
---
Now to make it retail accurate you just need to tear it in half.
---
Oh yea. Well, we’ll see how it goes this time! Have a good day man.
---
This right here. Is there anyone who played a pserver launch here that could tell how it played out?
---
Gotta be weary of all the classic wow encounters where you have to move every 15 seconds for 15 seconds...
---
Movement is among the most trivial things in classic raiding vs real raiding today.
---
I put something like this as a comment in the past thread for classes, but got no traction over like 4 days I think now so I decided to post it so I could get peoples input
---
Same. It fills a hole in the market.
---
Then go for it. Just take in to account that if you are using the AH that it might not work in classic. Fresh realm, everyone saving for mounts, very very few people will be using the AH early on.
---
Or maybe you were just really bad at the game and your memory of an experience from 14-15 years ago isn't completely accurate?
---
You don't have to be "cutting edge" to not want to bog your raid down with ret paladins.
---
Again, just because you CAN do it does not mean that you should consciously choose to do it.
---
There will still be a lot of battleground action but not world pvp.
---
But thats the thing... is an hp increase best? How much? How does it affect certain phases.
---
For example onyica flight phase. If everyone can dot then that portion gets easier even with a health increase.
---
Funny how you noone else noticed before now xD
---
Oh okay, didn’t mean it in a hostile way I just wasn’t sure if I saw this post before or not :D
---
No, you can't. Not due to distance, just because the continents are 2 different instances.
---
I’m sorry but I don’t even have to read through the post to know that you should just roll all 3. I had the best experience in vanilla through experimentation. My first main was an ud fire mage and I loved it. My dad played an ud shadow priest, so I kinda played it too, and I went ham in AV especially with devouring plague. Now this time I’ll be maining a troll or human warrior as I enjoy tanking and want thunderfury, lol. 
---
Get all 3 to level 10 at least then pick from there. Or make a support system among the 3 if it’s same server and have their professions all compliment each other. It’s ok to have alts. But at the end of the day it’s not a race my man, have fun!
---
I played a Warlock from vanilla until WotLK. I recall being in high demand for MT, being able to banish an imp and seduce a belf while still having fear yoyoing(fear + curse of recklessness) available for screwups.
---
All of WOTLK was much more vertically designed than TBC, so I would argue that they are leagues apart.
---
Okay look, as somebody whose played a lot of WoW, I've leveled and had tons of fun with unconventional specs. They can be very fun to play and experiment with.
---
But the people making posts about unconventional specs aren't people who played vanilla and played on private servers. The people making such posts are people who started in TBC and beyond and are trying to reconcile their experiences with post-vanilla versions of class mechanics from what they've heard from vanilla players. You're not doing those people any favors blowing smoke up their ass on the viableness/optimalness or meme specs. Those people need to understand the reality of the situation they're getting themselves into, or you're gonna have a lot of pissed off lvl 60 rets and enhancement shaman wonder why they wasted so much time.
---
Those people rushing out to beat the dead horse of "what about this meme spec" are doing a public service to help new players have a good experience by not setting themselves up for failure from the get-go.
---
What is this assessment based on? ZA was fun from a flavor perspective but the content wasn't particularly challenging.
---
I don't want the RPers invading my server, so I say keep em all together blizz.
---
It depends on what you want to do on your hunter.  PvP, raid, leveling, farming, solo dungeons, find pre raid BIS, gather pet abilities.  It's best to look up a guide for using a hunter for what you want to do.

**[Horde] [EU] [PVP server] [Semi-core raiding]**
---
A guild formed by a group of IRL friends, who have raided together through retail in various expansions, &lt;HA&gt; plans to be both a social hub as well as an active raiding guild. We like to maintain a laid back attitude outside of raiding, but take progressing seriously both in terms of preparation and during raids themselves. We do not aim for server firsts etc, but we do want to steadily progress through and clear all the content.
---
*************************************************************************************************
---
Our raiding days will be announced closer to the launch, but we will have 3 days per week dedicated to raiding, with times of 21:30 - 00:30 Server time / 20:30 - 23:30 UK time. We require consistent raid attendance, however we will also be understanding if some events make you unable to participate at a given date, as long as you let us know in advance.
---
Looting will be done via DKP/EPGP (or similar) system for 40man raiding, and rolling for 20man raiding (barring a few exceptional items).
---
We are currently recruiting most classes and roles (except shadow priests and main tank), and we are always open to non-raiding socials (so you are welcome to bring your friends or family with you!).
---
If you have any questions, or want to apply, feel free to PM me here on reddit, or contact me (Sir Krabby#7625) on Discord.
---
&gt; (since 2018 actually)
---
Since 2010 actually with OnLive
---
So druids could be even better at being the only viable flag carrier?
---
Assuming you're on the East Coast because of your love of the NY Rangers, you can just join an EU guild.
---
Simply the best. I listen it at work all the time.
---
This is why I think alliance is weak in pugs bg. Paladins are amazing pvp healers but “sorry im ret”....  is the way for pugs
---
With shaman you have the option to do good damage, heals, and buff support with one spec.
---
I mean surely you’re not dense enough to suppose a debuff cap would be lifted without a corresponding numbers tuning pass on existing encounters, right?
---
I see what you're saying.
---
I was more going off retail, where horde is the bigger faction and also has far longer queue times. Will definitely be interesting to see how it plays out.
---
It doesn't man. Do you remember every single Warrior sitting at 100 rage in IF/Org?
---
&gt;Wottle-K
---
*twitches uncontrollably *
---
 - It is correct per version 1.12. They literally have the client and sever code + database.    
---
 - 1.12 was at the end of vanilla, and is easier than 1.2/1.3/etc after the major class rebalance patches.     
---
 - Are they likely going to change it? Nope. They're making 1.12.    
---
So regardless if you're right or wrong, they don't have the original 1.2, 1.3, or similar database or client to work with. So it will never be a possibility.
---
&gt; You have people who want to play classic right now. Then you have people who will just try it out of curiosity and because their friends are playing it. Then it just snowballs from there and eventually even people who were reluctant to play it will try it because it's the thing that everyone is doing
---
Thats how it happened last time, and it ended up with ten million people subbed.
---
Just got to hope they don't ruin it again.
---
That is pretty casual by TBC standards, which is good to me!
---
no, pink is correct.
---
Sorry if i offended you, i didnt mean too. But when you say fun gadgets people might think that you are talking about gimmicks with no real usefullness. I was just making clear that that is not the case. No reason to be butthurt about it. But if you are then too bad, the comment wasnt necessarilly meant for you but for people who probably dont know better and might understand you wrong.
---
Not only talents, but itemization took a big step forward in TBC for the "off specs".
---
Thank you I don’t think I will play Shadow priest now knowing that, immobility is a thing that breaks the entirety of what I find fun in a class, sitting and spamming something just makes me too bored, hence the reason I quit in legion was because of retail being retail but more or less because warlock spamming was just boring for me at that point
---
Dunno man with the attitude of many people here you wonder if they even want to play it, even though they are on this sub. Lot of people sound like they are just here to tell us how bad classic will be compared to anything else since (I guess despite private server popularity?) and discourage their friends from dwindling the numbers in their boring ass live raids by moving to classic come August. People are so damn salty about every fucking thing... Guess we’ll have to lay low and just play once it comes out &gt;.&lt;
---
I'm saying they are less desirable. Which is what it comes down to. The barrier to entry isn't the boss it's the guild.
---
Might be interested in the same. Have a jacked up panama schedule where I can get some good day raids in.
---
maybe for boring ass 2v2
---
And you’re being jerked off in your cute little circle ;). Don’t cum too much on these other jealous man children’s hands!
---
You’re* btw. Dumbass.
---
TIL that Storm Peaks and Icecrown is "all of WOTLK".
---
Not a bug, there was no need to have different colors for paladin/shaman back in Vanilla since there was no way to have both classes in the same raid.
---
Honestly, I kinda hope that nobody who posts on the "Classic General Discussion" forums on the official [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) website plays the game. They somehow suck all of the fun and joy from the game, and are waaaaaaay more toxic than anyone here.
---
No this is the way it was in vanilla. Hopefully someone makes a addon to give them back their blue color in gchat and raid frames, I'll never get used to pink.
---
Oh, I'm sorry, my bad. I overlooked the "no Ret carries" - of course no Ret carries, but you can absolutely clear raids with Rets, like you said, or with less than 40 people etc.
---
So does it affect targets with high resistance levels as well ?  Or does it just have to do with base resist chance levels I’m confused
---
He's specifically talking about raids though
---
All Warlocks share one Improved Shadowbolt debuff.
---
Oh, I assumed he meant across either EK or Kalimdor, not *from* EK to Kalimdor. I know that they're seperate.
---
It can be hell. I have played on servers where faction imbalance was so huge, things fell apart. Meaning you could no longer travel. Horde literally *won the World of Warcraft*.
---
You flied to DM. Some people were smart enough to try to take the back entrance and corpse run in. 95% weren't.
---
They were greeted at the road leading to the DM gates. And what followed was an unexxagerated entire hour of corpse walking inside. If you are lucky, you were quicker than the fat one next to you zombie apocalypse style. Perhaps you were in 30 minutes in and could make a coffee.
---
I want to stress just how relentless they were. They would not just kill you. They would mind control you back and kill you then, so you make no progress.
---
And remember, you are doing a DM run with 5 people. Perhaps 2-3 of you can make it in in 20-40 minutes. But at least one of you will be camped and camped and take more than an hour to get inside. And you have to wait. Many groups already lose all motivation before the run begins and it shows.
---
Keep in mind, 60% to 40% does not sound like a huge Faction imbalance. But for 10 of one faction you have 15 of the other faction. At a bit more than 66-34 you are already at a 2:1 raid, you are facing twice as many of the opposing faction. And this has an effect that the bigger faction has to fight desperately for any of the other faction they can find. They become creative. They camp every choke point. It gets literally out of hand and you have to go out of your way to avoid them.
---
Came here for this comment
---
A lot of the top pservers guilds have a lot of highly ranked pvp players which really helps them gear. Most guilds would be better off with 3-4 hunters at least until naxx.
---
And I never said that it was, but to compare those changes to brand new items is completely disingenuous.
---
$15 ends up being being pennies per hour of entertainment. There's really not much out there that matches that value.
---
Why? Am I in a hurry? I know what it's about, done it several times and I'm fine with taking my time.
---
It worked like that in Vanilla. Shadow Oil and Spell Damage buffs were always used over Poisons for Alliance Rogues.
---
I always wanted to play WoW since it came out! Sadly when it came out I didn't have the money/PC to play it. I started playing it when BFA came out and I have really enjoyed it and can't wait to try WoW Classic.
---
by that logic if you cast curse of shadow or elements on a target resulting in 0 resistance wouldnt that also mean u cant miss/resist ?
---
I’ll take my chances
---
Lol wut? This place has been a streamer echo chamber for a while.  Finally the majority is starting to realize the truth about streamers. Trust me idc about their income.  I watch asmon and soda,  subbed to soda, I just absolutely disapprove of any ingame help.
---
Do you want to be in a guild stuck in AQ though.
---
To get "okayish" dps on feral you're literally sweating buckets and need like 5 (maybe more) specific items
---
Yes. Here's the talent tooltip:
---
&gt; Your Shadow Bolt critical strikes increase Shadow damage dealt to the target by 20% **until 4 non-periodic damage sources are applied.** Effect lasts a maximum of 12 sec.
---
As long as it's not a dot, it should consume a stack of the debuff. The thing with other locks is that they can also proc that debuff if they crit and refresh it.
---
no... infact my comment suggests that they need to do that?
---
Ew, the barrens 
---
Great artwork though
---
Your "toughts" betray you.
---
I was only a mid level pvper at that time, so maybe things looked different higher up. Surely majority of people didn't have the time, luck or the calable guild for that to be meta. Bis however, I could agree with.
---
**&lt; Hope Rises &gt; US | Horde | PvP | Casual - “Mediumcore”**
---
Greetings! 
---
Do you love Classic WoW and hope to enjoy the game in a friendly and active guild? If so, then we would love to welcome you aboard!
---
&lt;Hope Rises&gt; is a guild I founded in 2014 and will resurrect for Classic. Most of the prospective guild members played originally with me on Nathrezim and would like to do so again. As it sounds like server names will not be retained, however, we will try to find a well-populated PvP server that does not have any major streamers on it. 
---
**What we aspire to do:**
---
• To enjoy Classic at a calm but steady pace (begin raiding in approx 3-4 months after launch, which averages out to about 2-2.5 hours /played per day).
---
• To be a welcoming, positive, and diverse guild that will enjoy all aspects of Classic. Though some of us will be putting hardcore hours into Classic, we will “officially” raid just once per week (+50 wife points). We will also have many casual members whose primary interests will be leveling alts, playing the AH, farming gold, etc. 
---
• To have the freedom to show up to raids (particularly early on) with a suboptimal or PvP spec so long as everyone is also willing to change to a more meta role if the raid becomes stonewalled or profoundly inefficient because of it (I’m thinking this will only be necessary way down the line — like Naxx). Many of us have raided for years at a competitive Mythic level in retail WoW, and though we are a competent group looking forward to raiding through Naxx, enjoyment of each other’s company and the mostly laid-back nature of Vanilla endgame is our top priority. If you are impatient, easily frustrated, or are seeking a “world-first” (lol) cutting edge super-duper-hardcore raiding experience, then ~~Classic WoW~~ our guild is not for you.
---
**Raid times:**
---
• Tuesdays @ 8 or 9 PM Central start time, with raids lasting 3-4 hours, depending on what the guild decides. 
---
• An additional, completely optional raid (usually for smaller or easier/dated content) on Saturday nights (again 8 or 9 PM Central start time for a few hours). 
---
• We are not married to a single loot system yet, but one we are strongly considering is an attendance-based free rolls system. EPGP is a close second. We will talk it over as a guild in the coming months.
---
If you are interested in joining or would like more information, feel free to reply to this post, shoot me an email (pwntasch@gmail.com), or DM me on Discord (Oleon#2355)
---
Hope to see y’all out there!
---
Thanks,
---
Oleon
---
Nah, all specs are equally viable in the vicinity of Karazhan in Classic.   This is because there's nothing to do in Deadwind Pass, so it doesn't matter what spec you are.
---
I don’t know if OP mentioned it, but heroic dungeons are also on this spectrum of hard mode “content”. I’m not necessarily against heroic dungeons categorically because I like going back to a refreshed version of the leveling dungeons, but for raids and such the in game “hard mode” like Ulduar seems preferable to the N/HC/Mythic splitting. 
---
This is obviously only my opinion, but a main issue is focusing new content on and around a raid progression and then getting players caught up to that raid. That really started in LK and only accelerated in later expansion. 
---
In Vanilla I would work on getting new dungeons pieces as I could, and maybe get into a pug ZG or AQ20. New raids didn’t really effect my game at all, except maybe making pvp more difficult. In that way, the shape of the casual end game wasn’t super different than the causal leveling game. 
---
What I would really like is just incremental improvement through new quests and new dungeons. I don’t need to be caught up to anything - I’m never going to be a 40 man raider, I just want to continue to improve my character. 
---
Mythic +, while a cool system in its own respect, has the same issues as any other difficulty options. And the gear itself is uninteresting - it captures incremental improvement but there’s no investment. It just doesn’t feel like the old dungeons: I don’t feel like I’m on an adventure somewhere, it’s too gameified if that makes sense. 
---
WoW is more “casual” now in that you can get gear more quickly, but it is mechanically harder than it used to be. Something like the Kruul skin would have been impossible for me to accomplish as a Vanilla player, but possible now. The whole game is harder, more competitive, more gamey, and all that has come at the expense of more role playing.
---
Well you've got two outcomes: either druids are bad but you'll get to play a challenging and unique class, or they'll get rebalanced and you'll be one of the few people who was brave enough to take a chance on it
---
Okay, thanks for the quick responses guys - no bug after all!
---
I usually ignore them because it took like 3mins to kill one. Like, they were never a treat but between wearing plate, LoH, bubble, bop, heals, etc, it's just not worth the time when they respawn in 30sec.
---
it's still available to this day on Battle for Azeroth. don't see why it wouldn't be available in Classic.
---
There is also this Item from Elwynn that gives -25% Hitchance and I'm sure people even used that on TBC Bosses. I always keep these Items and never use them ever.
---
Heart of the Wild spec with Nature's Swiftness allows you to tank and heal without the need for respeccing. In fact, you can even do both in the same fight. It's also the best spec for PvP (assuming you're running flags or guarding cap points).
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG5P71m6D4g
---
The main issue with druids is the amount of work you have to put in compared to other classes just to reach the same point of viability. You need multiple gear sets, lots of consumes, and several Manual Crowd Pummelers for each raid (which don't stack, so RIP your bag space).
---
I guess that's true, but Hunter's Mark always specifically was a "RANGED attack power increase", yeah? So really only hunters benefited from it, with like, one ranged auto for a tank to pull in some cases?  
---
Hasn't really changed much.
---
You know Bag'thera can spawn multiple places right?
---
The easiest obstacle to overcome is replacing everyone underneath the tanks on the meters
---
Yeah, its a matter of 1 minute walk on all spots. From fallen tree log to entrance to ZG.
---
I mean, the edges of sholzar basin as well as the plateaus had things on them. Dragonblight had a floating raid, and another at the top of a giant tower. The capital city was literally floating in the air. Giant ravines in Grizzly Hills. It was pretty well built for verticality and having a flying mount.
---
Yeah, warlock was amazing in tbc.
---
 nobody will mind bringing in a hunter. Im tired of ppl acting like the raids are going to consists of only warrior rogues mages and priests.
---
Find a friend to level with. It’ll make it more fun and more efficient.
---
I agree,  I'd say that was the first real dailies routine.
---
Having said that if they wanted to change it to blue I wouldn't be opposed.
---
https://i.imgur.com/edBQBeJ.gif
---
That’s honestly reasonable. I think it’s kind of lame that the “no change” streamers are typically the ones getting fed free gear and playing slap dick in dungeons. It’s like the no change magically means special treatment and free help for them. I actually understand that and do agree. Lately I’ve just seen such a personal vendetta against them by this sub, it seems a little over the top to me, but I do understand where you’re coming from.
---
u/McconnellReeet just gets everywhere...
---
damn you must have perfect memory then.
---
also this could be the difference betweem 1.12 and vanilla launch
---
You are making the assumption that there is only one sub par spec in the raid. There is likely to be a few already. People don't like to kick others from raids and you are making a bad comparison between a good  player in a sub optimal spec versus a bad player in an optimal one. 
---
It adds up perfectly well. Play something undesirable or has a lot of raid spot competition and your choice in guild is restricted.
---
LoL
---
Tranquil Air tot manages threat in a Warlock group allowing them to go off.
---
You're doing too much thinking, getting to 60 is 6-8 days /played on average.  If you dont pick the class you most want to play then you're going to get burnt out before endgame.
---
&gt;seems like a a lot more item collection, and chances for rare items.
---
The only issue I see is that it's all random. There's no guarantee you'll get a cloth helm as a mage until like level 40 and even then it's probably grey. Shoulder are another rare cloth item for a long time. 
---
I wonder how gearing would go this way. There's a lot of quests with good gear and you can be smart about filling gear needs as you level with what quests you do. My big fear with only grinding is that you'll grind slower than you would if you took a break and did a couple smart quests for good items to help you grind faster.
---
I got into DAoC with a friend but i think EQ2 would be considered my first real MMO so that would be the game that really can't live up to the nostalgia. I only played DAoC for a few months with my buddy before we moved on to EQ2 but i really liked the crafting system and just the way the game played.
---
That isnt even the same patch. Numbers were tweaked from release to 1.12, let alone memories of things. 
---
I remember playing vanilla a ton. Like cutting edge, every day. Been in since pre-talents beta.
---
Playing classic these last few weeks shows how little I actually remembered from the game. Or rather little things here and there. 
---
But one thing I can remember is 2h tanking SM in later vanilla was absolutely a thing. I did it. I also did it this week, and it went about as well as I remember it did back then.
---
Solo gonna be tough, try and party as much as possible.
---
iirc august 13th
---
This feels correct. I was running to a dungeon the other day on my NE and whenever I got a flip I would try to jump at the same point in their running animation and I was pretty consistently flipping 5-8 times in a row.
---
Ugh, I miss the days of knowing my enemies.  I used to know the good alliance players and their reputations and I'd see the same enemies all the time but then realm bg came out and ruined it
---
Gotchu.
---
Hunters are a bit rough from 1-9 without a pet.
---
Holy shit this answer is the epitome of a circle jerk.
---
Jesus christ dude. 
---
Vanilla=intellectuals 
---
TBC and beyond= retards.
---
Essentially how you sound.
---
Hahaha yup they’re hilarious. I wanted to role troll rogue before and they solidified it for me
---
Wow I hope you never go near game design.  Badge Gear is a fine system, it was only ruined in wrath when they used badges to give welfare epics to everybody. Same with dailies, they are not an inherently bad concept. 
---
Dailies existed in classic wow, they just didn’t have a blue exclamation point and weren’t as explicit
---
Even flying did not “completely kill world pvp” as people claim, although I do feel flying was a bad idea for the game overall
---
For every casual that sticks with it 10 will quit.
---
In PvP Mages are incredibly mobile and difficult to lock down. In PvE however they do "sit and spam" that's just the playstyle. There's that old "joke" about a Mage's hotbar just being Frostbolt over and over (it is funny because it is true).   
---
At higher gear levels Mages do stop playing Frost, but up until MC if off of the raid schedule that's the norm.
---
That is EXACTLY what I did. A friend recommended tWoT to me, and I'm a big ol nerd and love me some swords and magic action.
---
But told me the same thing so told you. The last 3 books (which were originally planned to be one book) have a distinct Sanderson feel to them. That being said he not only finishes the series perfectly, but also doesn't overshadow Robert Jordan's work. Truly a great feat. I hope you enjoy it all.
---
Stormloght Archive is already well on it's way to becoming a truly great epic in it's own right. You'll love it.
---
Shout out to u/mistborn!
---
Classes I leveled to 34-60 in vanilla.
---
Paladin: Only one attack that you have to use a seal to use that must be refreshed every 30 seconds. Why the term auto-attack leveling became a thing.
---
Rogue: You will die a lot while questing and is gear dependent like warriors. If you can find a great slow main hand weapon and go combat, leveling should eventually get a lot easier. 
---
Hunter: Easy to level once you get a great pet. Buying and making room for arrows or ammunition is a pain and keeping your pet well fed. FD is very useful if you pull wrong or aggro to many mobs.
---
Mage: I leveled mage the fastest to 60. Having your own food and water and having sheep and frost nova make leveling very easy. I felt like I could take down mobs very quickly on my mage compared to other classes. 
---
Druid: A ton of class quests that can be very tough and require a lot of travel around the world. Very slow to level until you get to level 32 when you get your first real finisher move ferocious bite. Heal dungeons but you compete for dps leveling gear with rogues and hunters.
---
some video I got of the level 5 stress test.
---
go hunter
---
Cc was mandatory at later level stuff. For sure. Early levels were easy in comparison. Were just now getting out of the easy stuff in beta.
---
I just started on a private realm and this is the most annoying issue.  So many people trying to kill the same mobs for item drop quests that I cant get in there
---
do you know when a priest casts it on you? Like do you get a visible debuff?
---
I would be interested in reading the post from Blizzard saying the they have a reference client from 1.12 if someone would be willing to post a link to it. I am not saying that I believe one way or the other I would just like to read about it and see what they had to say.
---
There was an article last year which suggested that Blizzard had been working with some of the larger PS groups because they no longer had a full version of classic as a reference. The article said Blizzard had overwritten much of their older materials because there was no reason to believe they would return to it in the future. And then...
---
No. It can not be the same guy. This is way more intelligent.
---
Things have kinda changed in that people are way better at gaming now. It's kinda why so many people complained that the beta was nerfed when it wasn't.
---
Me and a couple of my coworkers are looking for a late night raiding guild that will raid within the time frame of 12:30am-5am EST and we prefer Alliance PvP.
---
I've created a [late night raiding subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwowlatenight/) for late night raiding guilds. Beyond just finding a guild I think it makes sense for the late night community to congregate to the same servers. Once server lists are released I'm hoping guild leaders can use the late night subreddit to discuss which servers to gather to. I've experienced vanilla raiding and I expect MC will be a breeze especially with the revamped talents all classes have in 1.12. I still expect guilds to hit a wall in BWL and even more guilds to break apart in AQ40. If your raiding guild falls apart and there are other late night raiding guilds on your server at least you can try to get yourself a spot in that other guild.
---
Never quest alone. Ever. You will be easy pickings.
---
You don't have to play the game if you don't like it.
---
Poor guy... hope his life is okay. Take a break bud.
---
I don't think it will be a huge deal for the most part.
---
Surprisingly viable.  
---
I got roped into doing ony for peoples alts on my disc priest while I was doing pvp grind.  I left on my full stam pvp gear mixed with a couple of pieces of pve gear.  UD racials+shadow prot+resists on the pve pieces put me at 140 shadow resist + 15% passive fear resost.  After she landed I resisted every fear and our alt tank fucked his stance dance on the first fear.  I tanked her all of phase 3 without dying.  
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAmXZPuS7L0
---
Also here is a 40man priest ony raid.
---
Most of the zones had ways around this, though.  Flight paths to get around, harpoons with ropes that launch you from one place to another.  The flying was more convenient, but it wasn't necessary to level.  At no point in any of those zones did I miss having flying, except just to wish I could go faster.
---
Storm Peaks and IC are impossible without flying, because you have to fly to places you could not reach with a land mount.
---
Thanks.  I understand any changes would result in the kind of trading restriction that ruined Runescape. So I honestly dont know a solution to it. I don't think there is a solution to it. But I do think that is where the frustration comes from primarily. However being a large streamer has its negatives too. I really wouldn't wanna be a 10 to 50k Andy for Classic. Oof

There you go friend, a piece of og vanilla history
---
Then they arent tourists
---
Go suck someone else off typos happen
---
In b4 shitstorm
---
Yo, if you are doing Felheart (warlock t1) message me so I can get a new desktop background.
---
Timbermaw has nothing essential to your character progression behind it. Sure they had some recipes but if you didn’t get them someone else would. Reps and daily grinds now and in TBC had gear and other items (dungeons even) that were essential to character progression locked behind them.
---
One lets you feel like you want to do it and that’s why you do it. The other leaves you feeling like you have to do it to advance.
---
What is the difference between tanking and this mythical “main tank” why would I spec different if I’m tanking even if I’m not the main tank
---
I'd add having to run all over the world for your class quests to Warlock. At least Gnome Warlocks
---
AFAIK, because of the way feral druid's talents work, stacking AGI is always better than stacking STR, even if STR gives you more AP/point, Crit is just way more valuable. At least that is what the guides say.
---
I was guilty of stacking STR instead of AGI too.
---
Edit: from Elica's guide:
---
For DPS with at least 33% raid buffed crit chance or above; Hit (to 9%) &gt; Strength &gt; AP &gt; Crit/Agility
---
**For DPS with less than 33% raid buffed crit chance; Hit ~(to 9%) &gt; Agility &gt; Str &gt; Crit &gt; AP**
---

I'll give you two guesses.

Pretty.

Uwahhhhhhh!

UWAHHHHH!

UWWWAHHHH!

I hated resilience because in vanilla wow, if someone was fully geared in pvp or pve epics, and you had bad gear, you could still beat them if you were better. Resilience made that impossible.
---
There are so many minor annoyances while leveling a lock currently on the beta that I'd consider that a weakness. Wand issues, pet issues, and the annoying nature of using drain soul on anything above your level for a imp DS proc.
---
I mean if its like actual vanilla there will be plenty of guilds that will let people be off-specs because honestly unless you're gunning for super-sub 2 hour MCs and BWLs you can carry a lot of sub-optimal weight as long as 20ish people care. Only thing probably not specs that have bullshit debuffs on the mobs, sorry hemo-rogues.
---
edit: aq40 and naxx ... not included unless everyone you're guilded with is equipped to the tits.
---
**Question:** How are the reputation gains? What is the average reputation reward for regular kill quests (such as the entry lvl 1-10 quests)? How much rep did you get with your primary faction by lvl40?
---
My daughter has crayons +  im waiting for Classic + im 32 years old and started vanilla in 2005
---
Ya owls are the best all around pet but they only eat meat and you have to level them for the start or wait till your 50 to get one.
---
gear doesn't drop in warframe. materials/blueprints drop, but you craft everything. so I guess that's what's being implied?
---
Nobody called it VC on YOUR server. There was a poll on this sub that showed that roughly 25% of people remembered it being called VC.

Soloing as a warrior taught me to constantly have situational awareness, know what i can pull, and always stay topped off before/after pulling. You're gonna die a lot but if you don't present yourself as a target (i.e. pulling two mobs while you're at half health) most folks in your level range won't start shit.
---
My experience soloing a warrior 1-60 in classic at least.
---
Trust me man, by the time STV comes around you’re going to have a friends list of people you’ve met that would team up with you while questing. The best part about classic wow is you can go in with no friends, but you will have a list of people by 60. If you get ganked you’ll atleast have your crew with you and you’ll die with friends.
---
Well, 15 years ago I was 12, keyboard turned and clicked all my abilities. I still managed to clear all the 5man content.
---
I can’t imagine there gonna be that hard now.
---
Wow thanks for the gold
---
Yeah, this is the only one that i found and that try to go deep, the rest is really old (i know that some will be valid since we will be playing those same patches). But thank you very much for your time and attention my friend!
---
True, definitely more of a war of attrition in 2v2 than the other modes.  But it was still a heal-first meta in 3v3 iirc.
---
Battlerite took an interesting approach on arena combat.  They have a mechanic where if you take more than 10% of your current max HP pool in damage, a portion of that damage would be receive as "true damage", meaning your health bar shrinks and that portion of the damage can't be healed back.
---
i remember discussing what targets without marks at one point, were they raid only or am i derping? tho i do remember that one fight in MC that had too many adds to mark.
---
I played a male orc rogue, stacks of noggenfogger and savory deviate delights always on hand. I feel your pain.
---
Me too...pink looks horrible for Shamans...and that's coming from a Paladin! (although I'll make a Shaman alt for sure)
---
Bear form isnt long. Go to moonglade talk to someone fly back to darn/tb talk to someone kill 1 level 12 thing at level 10 or 11. More flying. Done.
---
Aquatic form is annoying and not needed for a long time after you could get it. Let it sit until you have some other reason to get it.
---
Cure poison isnt too bad at level but could be again delayed and isnt a need until mid 20s really.
---
Cat is from trainer.
---
Travel form is from trainer.
---
Dire bear form from trainer.
---
Moonkin (lol) is from talents.
---
There isnt really a bad druid quest. Hell only bear is really worth pushing
---
Who said I wont like the game? This is very dual. I will like it, I just want it to be better and have a future
---
Memes, mostly
---
Why not just use a laptop?
---
Pretty sure. What a weird life they must live doing all of this for attention over and over. That or maybe someone set up some smear-bots.
---
The current plan is to introduce server queues which incentivizes people to spread out to other servers. For example I plan on having a couple groups I play with and will be on different realms. I will probably lean more heavily to the ones without queues at the point they start.
---
**[Horde] [EU] [PVE server] [Semi-core raiding]**
---
A guild formed by a group of IRL friends, who have raided together through retail in various expansions, &lt;HA&gt; plans to be both a social hub as well as an active raiding guild. We like to maintain a laid back attitude outside of raiding, but take progressing seriously both in terms of preparation and during raids themselves. We do not aim for server firsts etc, but we do want to **steadily progress through and clear all the content.**
---
You're sort of gimping yourself withouth purification or healing way though, during progression that matters quite a bit. I ended up playing 30/0/21 to C'thun but it's not ideal and my other shaman put up the slack. The argument of "your guildies can farm consumables so you can play a worse spec" just doesn't hold any water and is a slippery slope to long raid nights wiping with meme specs.   
---
Mana is/was definitely an issue on horde-side, mana spring is quite bad compared to BoW and people will want to clear raids asap.
---
If the people asking for classic weren’t listened to then we wouldn’t have classic. Doesn’t take a neuroscientist to figure that one out chief.
---
This sounds promising. Thank you.
---
I've wanted a canvas-print of the original Azeroth map for at least 10 years. A week ago I found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bwqzql/here_have_some_upscaled_highresolution_wow_maps/). I really liked the design and quality so I looked up a site that could print it for me and ordered it the next day. Today I got it and set it up, it was really easy. Classic can't come soon enough, see you in Azeroth!!!
---
Big shoutout to /u/AthenaNosta, /u/Eversora and /u/Teeb for making this possible.

"$1.99 for Execute"
---
YEP!  
---
Found that on Yahoo vids back in 2006 or so, when i was a huge runescape nerd. End up switching that weekend after begging my dad to let me get a sub.
---
Locks are quite weak at the start until you get gear from AQ40
---
IMO yes.
---
in game maps are kinda meh, they are functional, they get the job done, but they aren't much to look at.
---
this one has more character. it pops out at you more. maybe it's just the colors.
---
My older brother played in vanilla (I got my own account during TBC) and he let me create a character and play a bit. Best big brother you can imagine.
---
I made a nelf hunter with tailoring because I wanted to shoot arrows but I also wanted to make dresses.
---
It was amazing.
---
&gt; **Players seeking Guilds is for players seeking guilds**
---
Do you have any macro available to click on the Lightwell? I remember being shit on when I raided to click on it but I was too busy DPS haha
---
So I'm asking, even if it's 6 years too late
---
When i was a bad 15 year old back in 2004, I didn’t even have escape artist on my gnome rogue bar.
---
Do you think they will push free server transfers to help balance this out?
---
There is a difference between calling someone a failure and saying that someone failed to accomplish a task. If someone fails to accomplish a task that 2% of players have done, but they have still accomplished more than the other 98% of players again it's a bit of a stretch to just call them a failure.
---
Of course there is a bit of knowing your audience, and if you're on an elitist forum then sure, call them failures. When you're addressing average people though you should probably think before you type.
---
If that hasn't convinced you then I have a question for you. Assuming you're not in the top 2% of everything you have done in your life, are you a failure?
---
Its that thing of not wanting it to look like the game is dying; instead of doing the right thing and merging two servers with balanced faction imbalances, killing one server, they make everything cross realm and kill the whole game...
---
I've always wondered why people keep this mentality in lost cause games. Like seriously? Enemy team has 2/3 caps and our flag for the last 45 minutes, just end it plz.
---
That’s what I thought. I just hope I can find people on the same quests as me or don’t mind helping out when I’m on the previous quest of the chain because I will gladly help out others if they are behind on the chain so I can have help at the end.
---
Oof
---
Her calculation was done assuming you're killing 2 boars a minute for that entire 5 day period. So that's essentially just the actual time you spend killing boars. It doesn't account for the time you spent traveling between zones or returning to a trainer or anything *but* killing boars. Double that time to ~10 days and you're probably more accurate. Which all things said and done not that bad.
---
If you build it, they will come.
---
**Realm:** NA PVP or PVE
---
**Faction:** Alliance
---
**Looking for:** alliance Warlock. Prefer Gnome over Human
---
**Purpose:** Duo Leveling
---
 I'll be playing a holy/prot pally, probably dwarf which is why a gnome warlock friend is ideal. I'll be able to tank and heal dungeons, you can dps. For leveling, the fire imp synergy, aoe with consecration and ret aura plus various other perks make this duo extremely synergistic. I'll be doing huge aoe pulls in various areas to level.
---
PvP vs PVE does not matter to me.
---
I intend to take a few days off for launch and rush to 60. Why? Because I work full time and it would take me months to level outside of this "vacation."
---
Post leveling: - I will raid a bit. I mainly intend to return damage aoe farm for twink gear and play the AH. I will definitely run dungeons and aim for mats + BIS gear for raids at 60. My play time will significantly decrease after the first week.
---
Discord is Arionic#6023
---
I'm 31 and played off and on since vanilla. I know the story and don't need to drag my ass through it slowly again.
---
It is free, passive AOE (healer) threat, at a higher rate in defensive stance then most renew / rejuv ticks
---
Agreed. It’s definitely gotta be 5 kid guy, or a close relative of his/hers....lol.
---
Plenty of guilds just want to get 40 people and will be happy to take fire mages to MC. Play the spec you want. Don't let other people dictate how you play the game.
---
"certain totems".  
---
You mean 1?  
---
Imp WF totem is 100 AP per WF swing. It's not worth going deep enhance for.
---
This is what I've noticed the most of these videos. It's great seeing them killing people, but like I would love their thought process on what they are doing, when, and why.
---
To create pages you just navigate to a page that doesn't exist.
---
You can make drafts of pages under your User namespace. These are known as [subpages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Subpages). Basically if you have a Wikipedia account (even if you don't you can do this as an IP user, but having an account means it's easier to find the page later), just navigate to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:YOUR_USERNAME/whatever_page_name_here and you can create a subpage where you can practice editing and draft articles to your heart's content. Once you're done, just copy-paste the page's source from the Edit page onto the page you want to create.
---
Also, don't be afraid of screwing up. Other editors will (sooner or later) fix things if you forget something like categories or mess up the formatting, and there are tags and pages you can use to explicitly request assistance if you need it. No one's going to punish you for mistakes.

You use 131 copper bars, 90 bronze and ~59 iron to get there, the rest of the materials are usually cheap AF like the low level stone. Early on the answer is most definitely no, later on most likely.
---
That link is gold! That is really something that i need to learn ASAP! tyvm
---
Their servers SHOULD be. Did you play BFA at all? The world server takes a shit when there's 100 people killing a world boss. I hope we dont get the same quality when AQ gates open, but I'm not holding my breath.
---
The only real hardmode to classic wow is clearing shit with brand new toons asap.
---
A week 1 mc clear is pretty impressive. No one cares if you clear mc in 13 minutes 3 months later.
---
The next achievement in classic wow is to start 40 new characters the day bwl releases. Clear bwl with those new characters in 1 lockout.
---
The next is with AQ. Level 40 new characters, clearing Cthun the second lockout with those new characters is pretty impressive. 
---
Finally, Start new characters when naxx is released. First guild to get those 40 new characters to a dead kt is the king of classic.
---
Farming consumables and clearing 15 year old dungeons may be cool if you literally have autism and enjoy watching games done quick. 
---
Showing you can organize 40 people to no life for 2 weeks at a time and take woefully undergeared characters into tough content is pretty impressive.
---
Umm yes, I am fine to be stuck in freaking MC. You seem to be projecting what YOU want and not what might be deemed OK by others. 
---
I also dont care what guilds want me or not. I already have an option for a guild that may or may not even raid which is basically where I am anyway. If I do, it will not be in a rush and I will have no problem being "stuck" anywhere. Hell, being stuck just means more time to collect neat gear that isn't even much worse than the later raids.
---
Dont worry,for every one of us theres gonna be about 30 minmaxhurrdurr human warrior tanks so well be fine getting along)
---
Took me roughly 30-40. Slightly luckier :p
---
Funny enough I hated the Barrens for the exact same reason I ended up loving it. It's absolutely huge and takes forever to get anywhere. It gave me a lot of cool early PVP memories too, like playing cat and mouse with Alliance near the Ashenvale border and escaping an attempted Alliance gank near RFD by jumping off the 10K Needles lift with levitate on.
---
If you save your money and only buy skills/items you really need, along with a gathering profession, youll probably have enough gold at 60 for epic mount. And quests can give great money rewards too so you'd be missing out.

Awesome post, thank you!

    [H] Cerberus - Hardcore PvE Guild - PvP Server - US East (All welcome who can make raid times)   
---
While wanting to relive past    heroism's at a competitive level, the goal of the guild is to progress    at a pace that suits the core of the guild. With only two days in our    raid week, the core of the guild will be held to high expectations to    maximize the time we spend in raid. These two raid nights will have    minimal downtime and minimal tolerance for repeated poor performance and coming to raid unprepared. Ideally, we seek to recruit the top 1% of skilled players who no longer wish to commit to a 4+ night per week raiding schedule.
---
Off nights are to be spent farming consumes, gold, pre-raid BiS, 20 man’s, and, of course, doing other things you love/need to do. The last thing we want is to    burn out our core and, with a more intense raiding schedule, farming consumes, gold, and pre-raid BiS can be very volatile to the turn over rate of players.
---
Maturity and respect is very important. Drama of any kind will not tolerated.
---
Leaders of Cerberus have countless hours, accumulating to years, of  leadership   experience throughout retail WoW and other games and MMO's.
---
**Raid nights will be:**
---
    Tuesday and Wednesday evenings at 8:00PM - 11:00PM (EST)    
---
    Invites will begin 30 minutes prior to raid to ensure we start AT 8:00PM SHARP!   
---
    Loot Council   
---
**Our Goal:**
---
    To progress at a competitive level, on a casual schedule, in a hardcore and mature raiding environment.   
---
**Core Raider Requirements:**
---
    18+ years of age (some exceptions apply for mature/outstanding players)    
---
    Minimum of 87.5% raid attendance (~8 raids a month - 1 missed raid per month AT MOST)    
---
    Showing up to raid on time and prepared for encounters being executed that day  (including proper add-ons, consumes, etc)

Can;t claim it to be my idea, but I researched it and warriors get like almost 1 health per 2 sec per POINT of spirit. 
---
Easy to be getting 200hp every 2 seconds out of combat later on. Wont take much to fill out between pulls then switch out to damage gear.
---
Looks amazing!
---
You're welcome! :)
---
Right now at level 40 i have :

---
1820/12000 Ironforge - honored
---
8623/12000 Stormwind - honored
---
I have no idea about avarage reputation rewards, i just didn't look at that.
---
You can change the title all you want. Facts remain. People who fail to do something have failed. You can call them failures or honorable combatants or the majority. Either way it does not affect the trust of the matter. 
---
To answer your question, I have failed in innumerable things. I will not shy away from admitting to it. If you want specifics I suppose we can go into that but that may detract from the topic at hand.
---
&gt; No one cares if you clear mc in 13 minutes 3 months later.
---
Speedrunners care.
---
I was around back then, no one who was serious about pvp ever discounted those two racials... maybe you did?
---
Gnomes were always best castes for pvp, and dwarf rogues were considered to be warrior killers.
---
Edit: I played alliance back then and was pretty involved in duels/bgs.
---
I think there’s a big chance free server transfers will be available to move off of overly populated realms
---
and as those people answered in about every thread:
---
Just because the raid is easy doesn't mean you want to increase the time commitment by pulling dead weight around you.
---
Early raiding is a marathon, very time consuming but the actual action happening is predictable.
---
And you probably won't have to care about those oppinions anyway in most casual raiding guilds.
---
You're going to hit 5-7 days /played within the first couple of weeks of release? Should I get the RemindMe bot?
---
Very often the type of people who think that is what carrying is are stuck up players thinking they are better than they are, and anyone worse than them is inferior and doesn't deserve to play. It is sad, but you don't want to be playing with anyone who uses the term "carried" freely.
---
I like those odds!
---
Amen!  I want big healthy server pops.  I want massive SSvTM battles, giant capital city raids, huge running of the Cows/Gnomes events, full AV teams, LOTS of 40 man raiding guilds.  No one is excluded and all are welcome, lets do this up BIG!
---
which really means: it unlocks an even bigger grind
---
Keywords: "as long as you don't have 0 rage"
---
you dingus
---
Also, 1 rage per 3 seconds is not enough to stop regular out of combat rage decay. Sounds like someone didn't play vanilla.
---
Clearly you don't understand the connotations of calling someone a failure, or perhaps even what connotations are and why they are important.
---
There's a weekly stickied thread for posts like these. A moderator will be along shortly to remove your post.
---
Badge gear was okay at the start. A mechanic to smooth out the randomness of loot drops by letting people buy specific gear was not the worst thing in the world. What really killed it was in later patches when they let you buy Black Temple level gear from badges you got running heroics and Kara. This completely destroyed the whole concept of gear progression, which yes is an inherently bad concept in an MMO built around gear progression.
---
I will argue that dailies are in fact an inherently bad concept. Dailies serve two functions, neither good. First, they encourage you to log on daily thus building a habit which is good for player retention, regardless of if the mechanic is actually interesting. Second, dailies served as a method of time-gating which artificially lengthened the time to reach some certain goal. Both take power away from the player to chose how they want to play in return for creating an incentive system designed to keep people subscribed.
---
Why does anyone care about karma? It’s of no economic value and really isn’t used for anything either.
---
I've got a Google Pixel 2 and I'm sure my phone could blow past the specs needed for Classic WoW. All it would need is an official application. 
---
That said, I dont think they SHOULD, but they could.
---
it was blue early in beta but they changed it to pink
---
What druid form quests are difficult? Bear form you have to kill a level 12 non elite. Aquatic you dont have to kill anything just swim in a few bodies of water. Cat form and travel are all trainers I think dire bear is too. Moonkin is talent
---
"sweating buckets"
---
"5+ specific items"
---
Elaborate.
---
As long as wow2 takes a hard look at retail and classic and doesnt make the 100 mistakes the xpacs did this my greatest hope.
---
If the boss could be killed with everyone doing 300, it doesn't matter what the fuck they are doing, you are not being carried.
---
By that logic, by overpowering a fight over 100%, even half the raid of 600s is being "carried"
---
You are flat out wrong. Carried means you are being giving a kill you couldn't have done otherwise, and nothing more. Almost guarantee anyone thinking the way you treats people like crap in game anyway.
---
It's far cheaper and easier to spin up your own virtual machines locally than having to create several accounts to use a cloud game streaming service.
---
As for your Geolocking point, I don't get what you mean? 
---
Geolocking is for preventing people from another region to play on it. Not to prevent any kind of attacks.
---
And for playing, no one would want the added latency that comes with playing through a data center not in your own country.
---
[From my testing at 45](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bkumdj/experimenting_with_lvl_45_grind_speeds_10_min/) all classes are actually fairly close at mob grind speed. They have different strengths/weaknesses be it dps or reduced downtime, but I could manage 2 kills a minute on every class but pally, and even they were only 10% behind.
---
Mate did you just copy paste my guild message? Wtf?
---
There is virtually zero world pvp on a pve server. You will be limited to bgs, which imo are not nearly as much fun as world pvp.
---
I've just started on a private server and the Barrens chat is very much alive and also racist, sexist etc as i remember it!
---
He also literally copy pasted my guild message, just put it on PvP server... Even kept my discord name.... Wtf
---
A lot of people in this sub have been hostile and gatekeeping from day 1. Don't act like this just started recently.
---
Just spam seduce and shadowbolt on him
---
If you plan to pvp seriously I would still recommend a warrior in the group.
---
It's pretty straight forward if you want to join a hardcore guild you going to have to be min max down the race you pick.  If you want to be a NE Priest you can be just know that you not going to be in the race for #1 molten core clear.
---
Well it's the only thing they really do better than anybody. I'm not saying they should change it I'm just giving you a druid perspective. You can't take it off and it gives away your position 100%. 
---
It just stomps premade vs premade. Just a nightmare as the FC
---
Dual spec came with wrath.
---
I've been playing since Oct 2005. When TBC landed I was around L57.
---
It probably varied server to server but the original population of Warsong US had a few people like this.  Only one dictator as far as I recall but several individuals who could basically keep you out of world boss, warlord or AQ event status on a whim.  
---
Best way to avoid them is rolling on an RP server
---
While I don't disagree that everything will be easier than it was in 2004 because of our knowledge, the reason people complained the beta was "nerfed" was because the private servers literally cranked up the difficulty of mobs to make it harder. It was people in private servers who were confused and didn't know the owners of said servers did that, not that they tried to hide it or anything.
---
Proof? I do not think it means what you think it means.
---
&gt;Dying happens on a regular basis, and you have to overcome this feeling of fear, weakness, and disappointment
---
Idk man it’s just a game, I leave those feelings for work and life

You'll see plenty of people, just don't get turned off if people ignore you the first couple of days - many will try to just rush as fast as possible to 60 - but there will be way more taking their time :)
---
* Raid Nights: Tuesdays and Wednesdays (With a possible Optional 3rd night being added once AQ drops, to be discussed with guild when the time comes.)
---
* Times: 8pm to 11pm Pacific time

That's some pretty good goddamn coloring.  A+
---
I hope they don’t try and monetize it.
---
Doesn't stack with rogue poison if you're toteming over bois
---
Completely forgot retris, not my faction, but it‘s hard to get a balance into pvp, so that would cause a chain reaction, sadly. So very unlikely anything in tht direction will be happening. Tbc offers alot of that stuff though
---
No. It's just 'the game'. You're acting soft about it. Yes, you get ganked, yes there's twinks. If you're getting greifed you need to reach out to your faction for help. It's part of the game. It's going to happen. 
---
If you don't want that experience you need to be on a PVE server.

&gt;Guilds: North America - Horde - PvP

Playing at launch, only time I *had* to grind (not in the service of completing a quest with abysmal drop rates) was in the final 56-60 range as I literally ran out of soloable quests. Leveling another character in 2006, I never had to grind at all.
---
LFG: NA, Alliance, PVP
---
I am a semi-casual player, meaning I plan on playing a lot but my playtime will vary and I play mainly to enjoy the game, so I'm not going to bumrush to 60. I'm looking for a guild that I can raid with once I hit 60.
---
I work from 3:30pm-12am EST. My normal days off are Mon and Tues, but that can change from week to week so I need a guild that would be okay with me not making every single raid.
---
I played back in vanilla but I didn't reach max level until BC was released, so i missed endgame content. Excited to experience it now. I'll be playing a gnome mage.
---
Out of nelf, human, undead.
---
Orc is the best. I say this as someone that exclusively plays Undead Rogue. The aesthetics are too good to pass up on Undead.
---
Hahaha usually I do that but every time I flip I am like Tina from bobs burger standing there going uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Thanks! Updated post with a gallery :)

On the plus side, you could get into raids without being geared at all if you were willing to fill that role, hardly ever had a repair bill, and got just as much DKP as everyone else.
---
There is always 1% chance to resist even if you are hit capped and your target has 0 resisntance.
---
There's also something called partial resist when your spell deals damage but not the full amount that is caused by resistance and not the lack of hit rating.
---
There is no such a thing as spell miss in the game. Period. It does not exist. 
---
A fully resisted spell is esentially the same thing as if it "misseed" but you don't call it that because that's not how the game calls it.
---
Butterfly meme?
---
Yeh think that might be with pserver bugs etc but it might be possible. Would be cool to see on live.
---
Yeah except thats what happened when season 3 weapons came around. The best offhand dagger in the game for a rogue was season 3, the black temple weapons outside of the illidan main hand dagger were worse. 
---
My problem isn't with the idea of arena or pvp rewards it is more with the balance of them, i felt they should have been serpentshrine cavern quality and maybe just under early black temple for weapons.
---
Dude, I played EVE for like 5 years straight. WoW is nothing compared to that. My point is that you dont need to be a jerk and act hard cause you play a *game*. Get over it.
---
You don't wipe because of less dps, you wipe because you don't know the fight.
---
I mean holy hell there are VERY few fights in Vanilla where what you described could happen. You either fuck up and die or not fuck up and win. Not many fights back then had anything difficult enough for you to screw up occasionally. 
---
And no, you are absolutely NOT being carried if you are performing well enough to succeed. End of story. Trying to pump yourself up into thinking that is the case when it isn't is nothing more than stroking an ego.
---
Woops lol

---
&gt; Why bother doing Black temple or sunwell
---
?? Because you like raiding? It makes perfect sense that you raid because you like the challenge in raiding and the gear you get from raids makes you perform better in raids. And then you pvp because you like to pvp and you get gear from pvp that makes you perform better in pvp.
---
One of the stupidest things is the idea that sitting in a raid several hours a week getting carried somehow makes you entitled to have the best pvp gear in the game. Really deserved.
---
Yes they can
---
I'm not really sure what that stat prio is for, since later on in the exact same guide they give this priority for general use:
---
Kitty: Hit &gt; Str &gt; Agility &gt; Crit &gt; AP  
---
Hit% - 9% to never miss an attack.  
---
Agility - 1 Agi = 1AP, ~20 Agi = 1% Crit.  
---
Attack Power - ~14 AP = 1 DPS.  
---
Strength - 1 Str = 2 AP, 2.4 AP with 5/5 HotW.  
---
Maybe the prio you quoted is for Naxx gear when 33% crit is actually feasible and that particular number is a huge breakpoint? Either way I'm pretty skeptical that 0.05% crit &gt; 1 AP in general.
---
I think there were still enough marks for the adds on Garr.  Might have been one or two unmarked.
---
You are still trolling us right? Trolling is like sarcasm I just don't recognize it anymore.
---
That looks even better than I was expecting, much appreciated.
---
But they could also do that boss with 38 people doing 600 dps. Does that mean they carried the 39th person?
---
On nostalrius (private server) Large Radiant Shards went for 12-16g each, which were disenchanted from lvl 20-30+ blue items. Ethereal essences were expensive too. Small radiant shards will sell well since they are used for fiery enchant and run speed I think... but honestly all this stuff drops from lvl 20-30+ mobs, and like he said the economy will not be at that point yet to farm these. Best to vendor loot for the first month or two to try and get a mount and maybe save your expensive mats
---
If its an rp server ill erp him
---
Yet TBC is considered to be peak WoW by people who played since the beginning
---
Plainstriders...
---
I recall the heroic tbc 5mans as harder than any in vanilla, though gear level really dictated how you saw them.
---
Oh look it's an unarmoured mount!
---
Yeah. You just gotta remind yourself you get arcane shot at 6, and concussive shot at 8 which help immensely. And then the hunter 10 quest do alone is like half a level
---
It was for graveyard camping for more honor.
---
They are in for a rude awakening when they get 60 and some of their pre raid bis is devilsaur leather gear
---
&gt; I want you all to suffer with me.
---
This is a real curse of agony.
---
Disenchanting is nice. It's a lot easier to sell crafting mats in the AH than random greens.
---
You can also make and sell magic wands. Pretty much every caster should be using the enchanting wands ASAP.
---
1. Grab Tailoring at level 5 when you have 24 cloth.
---
2. /yell "Free bags, your cloth. Just 6 linen per bag!" in the area.
---
3. Receive another 66 cloth through trades.
---
4. Make it all into bolts, go learn Linen bag, make it all into bags.
---
5. Give the 11 bags away to the people that helped you, keep your 4.
---
6. Drop Tailoring and pick up Skinning and Herbalism.
---
7. Keep leveling, vendoring everything (or send it to an alt and leave it there for 30 days).
---
8. When you can no longer pick up the herbs in your zone because your Herbalism isn't high enough, drop it on the next return to the city and pick up Enchanting.
---
9. Disenchant any quest rewards that aren't worth vendoring and mail them to your bank alt.
---
10. Ding 60, then deal with that shit and get whatever professions you want.
---
I’m 96 and I’ve seen sources saying I’m technically not a millennial. Most people count it at 1995
---
Personally I don’t really give two hats, I don’t relate as much with people born in the 80s
---
What about those guys that do molten core in 30 minutes? :D
---
how how how how i wanna to i need that for work shifts
---
&gt; The mafias won’t be a thing cross faction collusion is against Blizzard TOS and will be stopped
---
Ahahaha you sweet summer child. That's not gonna happen. Being against the TOS does not stop them in any way. Sure you might get a few people suspended, but theres no way for Blizzard to stop them 100% and with the amount of gold at stake theres no way they will just give up.
---
Amazing
---
It's fun to learn also. Once you get it down it opens a lot of fun ways you can challange yourself and do things no other class can get away with.  Being untouchable has its benefits.
---
Warlocks don't get a lightning spell....... Besides that it looks great though haha
---
Laughs in Esfand
---
Thank you. I think orc male doesnt look right on rogues. Orc female is much better looking. What do you think?
---
???
---
Eh I might be misinformed and 12 when I played but at least I don't insult people on internet forums
---
Assume you have 10 botting accounts, and because there's something like warden, you have to bot through vm. It's far cheaper this way than having enough hardware to virtualize 10 instances of the game. Geolocking adds another layer of account protection if your account is signed in from a new location.
---
That depends on that person's DPS I guess
---
The point is, if everyone else (same classes included) is doing way more DPS than you, you should take your time to think if you are not holding the guild back. Maybe they can clear MC and Ony, but what if you keep wiping on, let's say, Skeram constantly at 1% HP left? Is it fair with the other 39 guys?
---
Thank you explaining.
---
I like wierd specs and I like that people play them. But it was kind of tragic back in retail vanilla when people spent 100s of hours on a character only to discover that it was nothing like what they expected, so being realistic with people is a kindness imo.
---
*​*
---
Then join bg, not raid
---
So are most of the DPS doing 600dps. 
---
If a fight requires 26 DDs to do 300 DPS to win (7800 DPS) and 25 DDs are doing 600 DPS and one DD is doing 300 DPS the **thirteen** of the 600 DPS are being carried because the fight the other thirteen are doing enough DPS to win and any excess DPS are being carried.
---
I like the sounds of this, especially if the guild name is an always sunny reference.  Raided in vanilla through BWL as hunter and thru MC=ZG on druid.  I think I will main hunter again.
---
Saw this line " ~~There are many positive things too! =)~~ " and thought to myself "Those are all positive things".
---
I am making no assumptions whatsoever; I am making a humorous observation on this subreddit’s contradictory beliefs.
---
Either there are going to be so few competent raiders that raid leads will be overjoyed to take anyone with two brain cells to rub together or there’s going to be so many competent raiders of desirable specs that all the offspec hybrids are SOL. You can’t have both.
---
I would love it.  I got kids now, a job, and it would be nice if I didn't have to be locked to my PC to play some good ole classic wow.  This way, I could have the illusion of having a life as opposed to it being obvious.
---
Scraping the bottom of the barrel eh?
---
Also applies to anyone who would dare consider an optional cosmetic option like new models.
---
I saw "I know for a fact" but then never saw any facts. 
---
I wish I lived in a world where if I REALLY believed something to be true I knew it just was.
---
There are essentially two types of resists in Vanilla WoW.
---
The first type is your chance to land a spell and is based off of level (possibly entirely). The second is resisting a percentage of the damage based on spell resist number.
---
Suppression definitely helps with the first type. That might be all it does.
---
I believe with increased spell resistance you have a chance to resist 100% of the spell damage. I am not certain if Suppression helps negate those, but I don't think that it does. I think it's essentially like miss attack/armor reduction. +hit makes you not miss, but doesn't do anything for the armor reduction. The only difference is armor reduction never goes to 100%.
---
Honestly I was just fishing bottom of the barrel for druids, I can't think of any other downsides except those quests. The bear quest can IMO catch you off guard, that level 12 can hit like a truck; and for horde you don't have any attached FPs to moonglade so your HS better be up to get back. Aquatic form is also insane... but yeah past that they aren't bad.
---
Can't think of any other downsides though, they're arguably one of the smoothest levelers in the game with nothing glaringly difficult about them.
---
Based on what? And why? Because it takes longer? No instant gratification?
---
This is one of the things they should really change. An old technical limitation that does nothing but drastically nerf some classes/builds in the endgame. Is it really that big of a deal if affliction locks become viable in raids?
---
Thanks for the share. I know I'm looking forward to taking my time and immersing in this game (taking my time questing, profession leveling, etc.)
---
Ok, but take someone who wants to roll ret, for whatever reason, to swing a big stick and still heal or w/e. Case 1, they probably know that they'll cap their ceiling as far as gear goes by picking that, but are willing to make that compromise. Case 2, they have no idea what they're getting into but that probably doesn't matter, they're probably unaware because they're casual to begin with. I'd bet the majority of the meme specs fall into one of those two categories, and so the majority will be fine with being in said casual guild so long as they can play the knight with heals.
---
Edit: That is to say, for some people it's a role-playing game, not a meta-role-playing game, if that makes sense.

I've decided on this spec for leveling/ dungeons/ raiding in tank/melee group as a resto shaman.
---
Longer and far more tedious and the pve is "boring".
---
I have no doubt, just figured I would expand for those who might not be familiar with some common tricks to be more efficient

"Look how they massacred my boy"
---
Hm as far as i remember raids were the reason why the horde finally got pallys on their side... so something is wrong in this picture.
---
Agree...Blizzard provides the same world with different mechanics for the same price.
---
Hit STV during off hours.
---
But you wouldn't want to do... that.
---
I'll be in general chat spamming twitch emotes and theres nothing you can do to stop me
---
You're probably right I was going off of what I remembered from the last time I leveled a shaman... which was a long time ago!  The only other 'fresh' info I have is at level 60 on a pserver which might be a different calculation than when you're leveling and have lower ranks of it.
---
This isn't a private server buddy.  There are a lot less people willing to risk a suspension if their entire Blizzard account could get suspended/banned.  You are too used to private servers who do nothing about this issue
---
I see you are a man of culture as well
---
Very true, provided that you can stay within its relatively limited radius.  
---
On a warrior you can hamstring kite over 100+ yards if you want =P
---
Just warn the rest of us that you are playing like this, so we can block you to make sure we never end up in the same group together.
---
Lmao, yeah the boating accident, thanks for reminding me.
---
Once you get it right though it's really clutch with grenades. It's a ranged stun that doesn't cost any mana/rage/energy so it's basically beneficial in any fight.
---
they're twitch emotes
---
No, just no.

This is my own personal Duo Alliance leveling route I've made myself.
---
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/568904134904774667/576954417249779732/unknown.png
---
I have my route outline up to level 53 and it's currently detailed out like above up to level 47 (not at home and the above one is the most up to date I've posted elsewhere on Discord to share)
---
I say 53 because my goal is to start with a 72 hour marathon to get a head of the pack, then do 6 hours of sleep 18 hours of play. Once I hit 53 I'll start farming thaurissan firewalkers for the cindercloak pattern, then I'll farm the spellbinders for the crusader Enchant, then I'll just start running dungeons for Pre-raid BiS.
---
what is this comment lmao
---
I wonder if during the design of the in game map if the developers knew what was in store for the Crossroads. Aside from Southshore and Tarren Mill it's really unique in the way it grew in to something much larger than just the Barrens which is also a significant zone in and of itself.
---
Dude did you even read your threads? One quick look and I know 100% they were downvoted because almost no one shares those opinions, and you backed up unpopular opinions with fairly lame opinions.
---
That isn't conspiracy, its just your posts sucking. Can't perform an expirment about coordinated downvoting using posts that would be downvoted anyway.
---
MoP was bad though.
---
I’ll talk about botting because I was banned for it and I haven’t botted since (mostly cause HonorBuddy got fucked, and even before that people started charging for custom routes, but hey I stopped)
---
Cata I botted but mostly archeology and herbs, I did my dailies on my own.
---
Fucking MoP omg there’s like 4 daily hubs and your farm and ugh, I’d wake up for school and set my bit to do dailies, I had to buy a second account to do my farming because even botting I didn’t have enough time in a day for dailies, farming, and regular playing in one day on one account without looking suspicious cause you’re playing 20+ hours a day lmao
---
BFA isn’t that bad, though I like quests more than world quests
---
I want a do over. Without the bad updates that killed the game. No flying. No dungeon finder. No argent tournaments.
---
How feasible is it to get decent gear for a ret PvP set while raiding as holy paladin? Like am I going to just always be months behind, or do enough unneeded drops happen early on enough that I can get decent items if I contribute enough?

Well then for the record it is all good info. Except the mana totem thing. It gives its cost exactly at 20 seconds (maybe 16 seconds with the cost reduction talent). IMO if you are in a single place for that to be worth it, then something is wrong. I mean even at 30 seconds its not a huge gain. Mana spring is really only worth it in a boss fight or for benefitting a group.

**TGIF is Recruiting!**
---
NA Alliance PvP 
---
Server Discord: https://discord.gg/zeUCYFm 
---
DKP Based Loot System (loot council for legendaries) 
---
Recruiting: All Classes/Specs/Roles
---
**Intro:** TGIF was created by a few typical, mid-30s, former raiders. After searching for 1-night a week raid guilds, we found none that fit our mutual availability...and so TGIF was born! TGIF was created to provide busy adults with the opportunity to see Classic WoW's raid content with the most minimal time requirements - 1 night, 3 hours a week (even during progression). We understand that the limited raid hours may result in slower progression in the later phases of vanilla, but we're excited to build a community and progress as efficiently as we can during our raid-time. Also, we think that there are probably a lot of other talented players out there who want to tackle Classic, but don't want to have to push work, sleep, or family obligations to the back-burner.
---
**Expectations:** Given the limited schedule, we need to have strong participation and preparation. We require a 75% participation for raids, though we are flexible with RL schedules if something comes up. We will start raiding as soon as we have a critical mass at 60, hopefully 2-3months after launch
---
**Schedule: We will raid Friday from 10-1am EST (7-10pm PST).**
---
**Optional Scheduling:**
---
Organized PvP Premades 
---
PUG Raiding: 40man raids will be hosted on Saturday/Sunday for any unfinished content, and no TGIF preference given to those who can or can't attend. 
---
20 man raids TBD
---
If you are interested in joining, please join our discord or send me a PM with questions. See you in Azeroth!
---
Nice if it's true and does generate threat it's kinda cool. If you tank.
---
I made it to 60 on 6 characters before BC launched... 
---
And I took my time with each of them. 
---
Except for the mage that i did in less than a week because of a bet. That was brutal.
---
“Ooh a RPPVP realm! The only one!”
---
*streamers roll on it*
---
&gt;I was around back then, no one who was serious about pvp ever discounted those two racials... maybe you did?
---
Well considering I've played gnomes and dwarves for 80% of my WoW time since Vanilla.... No. I've always thought they were amazing. Your server and/or start time differed from mine as most people on my server were more afraid of rogues and fears than they were bleeds, slows, and roots. I too PvPd quite a lot and mostly saw humans and night elves on my side and a lot of undead on the horde side.
---
Maximum health cooking main buffer
---
Yea... there is no way that is true

Possible. 7GB download when I downloaded it.

I think it's fun kiting mobs for as long as I can and seeing if I can kill them before they get to me.  But I also know what I'm doing unlike new players and most hunter players.
---
Haven’t played WoW in a few years, level 1 mounts!? What’s their base speed
---
Did you steal this guide? I’ve read this exact thing before.
---
Taggig unfortunately is not going to work in classic
---
Yes. Mained a Paladin from vanilla to WotLK. Haven't been able to touch the character since they ruined the class in Cataclysm. 
---
It's a great example of lost complexity. Classes used to be *very* different from each other, and Paladins were pretty unique in that they didn't have many flashy active abilities, but they had amazing passives, buffs and oh-shit buttons.

Envy are a long-running guild from private servers and retail looking for additional players at launch and beyond for semi-hardcord raiding, utilzing a transparent loot-council system.
---
17:30 BST - 21:30 BST
---
I think at this point we can just say that there are clueless specs, as in the person genuinely has done zero research and thus has no idea their spec is bad, and then there are conventionally bad specs, where the person is deliberately playing an underperforming spec because they feel the need to be a contrarian.  It's still a cookie-cutter spec like the normal ones, but with the added flavor of being bad.
---
&gt; It’s interesting to think about the what if’s, and I suspect this is what people who advocate for patch 1.13 content have in mind.
---
@ 1.13 - it will never scratch the itch that Burning Crusade scratched for BC fans, and it will never be truly authentic to what classic players want (the thing almost all classic players agree on is \#NoChanges). So you're already starting off at a disadvantage in that regard. Even among those who want 1.13, you'd be hard to find two people agree on what they want actually. The last time someone posted that they thought heroic dungeons would be a great idea for 1.13 they got obliterated by downvotes even though heroic dungeons are one of the most popular mechanics added in TBC. Adding a raid after Naxx is pointless and most people would not keep their sub alive for a raid they'll probably never experience - Blizzard would be better off pouring those resources into a modern raid. 1.13 is really a pipe-dream because the classic community loves classic for wildly different reasons.
---
I loved the tug of war zergs, and I played the worst class to even participate in them (rogue)
---
Speak for yourself
---
Im really excited to be a main hunter on classic. The usefulness of the class really turn my hype up. And i confess that one of my goals is to make that sweet epic bow/staff and even offer my services to solo the demons in the future! Tyvm for your attention and time. This really was a useful guide for me!
---
The problem is that theres a ton of different things that 'should' be in a sticky like that.  At that point it just becomes a mega-post that most people arent going to read if they dont read the sidebar as is.
---
The other obvious problem is theres already 2 stickies...
---
What was the total cost to create and ship?
---
Put points into wand and finish mobs off with wand instead of another cast. Gets you a head start on your mana regen.
---
It's like a chauffeured motorcycle, and you sit in the side car.  I think I get it because of previous characters I've leveled.  I'm not really sure.
---
It's increased 60% movement speed like your first mount.
---
It actually motivates me to get to 20, because I feel really stupid sitting in that side car.  :P
---
Wah wah wah
---
Consider it takes a warrior 30 seconds to chop down a mob, and he still has to eat every few mobs, it's a fair trade-off to mow them down in 10 and sip some free water in between.
---
To answer your question, no.
---
Pretty sure this is a common troll messege in Barrens chat. Almost fell for it once or twice back in the day.
---
!RemindMe 78 days
---
Imagine trying to raid like that
---
Who cares about gold? Do dungeon runs, and select quests for gear.
---
I just want the increased hitbox distance to match vanilla.
---
I don't think it does now from what I've seen and what I remember when I specifically tested the extra hitbox distance in vanilla
---
haha, I wouldnt call it apologizing. he was a corpsecamping, ganking crybaby, but me aggravating him might have resulted in him punching his little brother/sister or going out shooting birds with an airgun or something :o. taunting someone at this mental level for the lols isnt worth the potential collateral damage :p

If you’re in tight quarters you’re usualy in some cavern or building and you can only entangle outdoors

[Mindcontrol should be enough](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=605/mind-control)
---
Good news, I vividly remember MC raiding and I vividly remember only like half the people doing anything at all.  This means it will either 1) Be hella easier this time and or 2) Give people wiggle room to not play über optimized characters
---
Not if windfury procs from a melee skill like Sinister Strike etc. It will lower your dps as you lose auto attack timee.
---
Cool story but..what kind of paladin spec would actually be able to kill a mage?  
---
I suppose a well geared shockadin could get lucky?   
---
You can just reset whenever you want in case you're in any sort of trouble.
---
It is nice to have this idealistic view of gear progression, but the reality of the situation is that by the end of BC, it was incredibly hard for raiding guilds to find people that were geared for Black Temple, let alone people geared for Sunwell.  This is the same thing that happened in vanilla around Naxx, and the four horseman made the problem even worse.  
---
I don't like catchup gear as a concept but the alternative is top guilds poaching all the geared players and the end result is less people raiding the final tiers of content
---
&gt;There were mobs around the world that were in big groups and it was hard for me to clear that spot.
---
As a rogue, you should have the Sap ability which you can use to split up pulls.  I don't have too much rogue experience, but I spec'ed as combat leveling up.  Was a lot of fun and I felt like a grinding machine.
---
will it also be free for everbody else (besides of the subscription) ?
---
Obviously many people are poking fun at your memory, but you give pretty solid points that would make your memory of these things fairly reliable. The issue this highlights though is what I believe is the cause for a lot of people believing that things weren't right: 1.12 is a lot easier than 1.1. Blizzard made a lot of changes through the patches (and even in between them) and I don't think any of them made the game harder. I believe what we're getting is accurate to what 1.12 was, but 1.12 is much easier, and it's just talents.
---
The reason I was asking this is mainly because it seem like if you don't go that particular raid comp, you won't get past first MC boss.
---
I like min/maxing and have been doing it for years but back then I don't recall doing this and was able to join raid group, BUT yes probably it was on farm since i join later and they just needed more people.
---
It just like all the talk we see so far almost make it feel that id be stuck running dungeon lol and raiding with a bunch of people is what really kept me addict to this game.

At least that is what I roughly plan for in our raids
---
Note that this is exclusively for PvE raids.
---
Just thought I'd clear up misinformation about the viability of hybrid DPS/tanks in PvE. I've played all four healing classes at 60, and this is my experience with them, both playing as them, and being in raids with them.
---
"Viable but suboptimal" tier
---
-Feral Cat
---
-Feral Bear
---
Cat can do some decent DPS, especially on short boss fights of MC / BWL, by abusing manual crowd pummeler. Even on longer fights, you can still be somewhat competitive, but you're likely going to need to use 2 or 3 pummeler charges on that one boss, leading to more farming and more bag space taken up by more pummelers.
---
Bear is also pretty nice at tanking trash and adds, although they should not tank raid bosses outside of emergency situations, because with no block and no +defense, you just get shrekt by crushing blows and crits. Arguably more threat than Warriors, and with pummeler you can out-threat them by a good deal, but as a trade-off, you take much more damage, and the damage taken is much spikier since you get crushed/crit way more often.
---
Both specs also bring 3% crit to one melee group and an extra brez/innervate.
---
"Not so viable, but brings useful utility" tier
---
-Shadow Priest
---
-Balance Druid
---
Shadow Priest does mediocre DPS (unless you go full ham and farm tons of dark runes / potions for every raid) but they put up Shadow Weaving, giving all of your warlocks +15% damage. If you have 3 or more Warlocks, you should have a Shadow Priest in the raid. But you only need one, really.
---
Balance Druid is kind of in the same vein. They are called "OOMkin" for a reason. Your DPS is kinda meh, but you bring +3% crit to 4 casters, as well as an extra innervate / brez.
---
"Not so viable, but doesn't bring useful utility" tier
---
-Elemental Shaman
---
You can put out some decent-ish DPS in early raids, but you really don't bring anything that a Resto shaman can't. Just like Balance, you have pretty big mana issues and have to chug potions/runes just to not OOM.
---
"Not really viable, no utility" tier
---
-Enhancement Shaman
---
-Ret Paladin
---
Enh is in the same boat as Ele in that it really doesn't bring much that a Resto can't. Really all you can bring is the improved totem talents to give a slight boost to Strength of Earth + Windfury totems, but that's about it.
---
Ret, same as Enh but worse. You bring nothing that a Holy paladin can't, other than Nightfall. Even with good gear and stacking consumes/buffs, your DPS is just bad, and relies heavily on the RNG of crits for Vengeance uptime.
---
Only way you're getting into raids past MC as these two is if you have your own [Nightfall](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19169), or the guild is struggling to get 40 people in raid.
---
"oh shit what the fuck are you doing" tier
---
-Protection Paladin
---
Arguably the absolute worst "hybrid" spec in raids. You're just inferior to Warriors in almost every way. No taunt. No cooldowns. Lower base health. Almost no gear to choose from. Threat scales more with spell damage, which cannot be increased without dropping defensive stats. Can run out of mana. Little/no snap threat. No spammable threat abilities, can only autoattack + judge + consecrate and pray for Holy Shield blocks. Just overall WAY lower threat generation than warrior/druid.
---
Of all the meme specs, Prot Paladin is the biggest meme and least viable in raids. Sure it's POSSIBLE to tank...molten core, once you outgear it to hell and spam consumes/world buffs, but anything other than that, no.
---
What happens when you have 50 raid-ready guild members online and only 40 spots to fill?

 Alliance | NA-PvP | Semi-Hardcore PVE &amp; PVP
---
**&lt;About&gt;**
---
The foundation of the guild has players from all gaming backgrounds, SC2 grandmasters, Overwatch masters, competitive FPS players, etc. Many of us are IRL friends that have known each other for ages. Our group has been playing games together now for several years, and in some cases far longer. Our average age group is mid to late 20s. Our officer core is composed of former vanilla &amp; classic players that have cleared all classic content, and some have continued to clear even end game content in current retail. We're open to new players and veterans alike, but ask that you be willing to put forth effort in doing your best when progression is concerned. 
---
We believe that WoW is a game best enjoyed when you have a group of fun individuals who are willing to help one another out. This community ideology reaches far in WoW, everything from leveling, pre-gearing for raids, PvP, and random shenanigans are all exponentially more fun when you have friends that want you to succeed joining in on the journey. 
---
**&lt;Raiding&gt;** 
---
 Start Times TBD - Loot Council for key items &amp; DKP Distribution
---
The majority of our guild base will be West Coasters, but we do have quite a few East Coasters too. Once we can get an established member base, we will determine what the most appropriate raid times are as many of us are flexible. 
---
Our goal is to clear through content and show strides in improving our raid group as time progresses. We want to clear all the endgame content, but aren't necessarily rushing to be World/Server first people. We will be constantly grouping with our members to ensure they get pre-BiS (best in slot) gear prior to raiding, will help alts, new members, etc, whenever we have the opportunity. 
---
**&lt;PvP&gt;**
---
We planning on general ranking (1-14), world PvP, as well as hosting premades with those that are willing. PvP-ing is essential to the WoW experience and we want to dedicate time for those who are interested. We plan on forming groups during downtime and non-raid times for any member who wants to come along. We will take things seriously although we won't be a PvP focused guild. Gearing out twinks is another thing we plan to help members do, if that's a player's flavor. 
---
**&lt;Recruitment&gt;**
---
 We are recruiting everyone and all classes. We are looking for players who want to step up and be at the top of their game and contribute to a community. We believe that a guild wont be as successful as it could be if the members have a "*me me me*" attitude. 
---
**&lt;Contact &amp; Questions&gt;**

&amp;nbsp; If you think you fit into our mold, want to compete to better yourself and guildmates, and want to have an awesome WoW experience, please do not hesitate to contact me! Feel free to PM me or contact me on discord, I will link my username below. Regardless where you end up, I hope your classic experience is amazing as this is my favorite gaming experience of all time! Happy travels Azerothians.

Discord Direct PM: chillychill#8609
---
According to Saturnalia on the Classic Warrior discord it does! They tested with goblins at the Samoflange area.  Renew on the Orc warrior caused the additional mobs to take threat to the priest, while the troll held them, with no additional AOE threat introduced.
---
Not everyone shares the same view of where they want to take this.
---
Blizz can have a classic dedicated server for you no changes people, and a continuation server that adds more content.
---
Nothing wrong with having both.
---
I think you got confused at some point and forgot that I'm not insulting classic I'm just saying why people who would roll on a pve server are going to end up not liking it for the most part.
---
I'll be playing classic and fortnite.
---
" Guys like Esfand and Drakova have shown that Rets can be viable in PvP "  
---
What, in level capped beta?  
---
We'll wait until we see decked out WSG premades, I'm guessing Esfand will dodge.
---
I didn't play legion or BFA...did Illidan get his eyesight back?
---
Playing the auction house while taking a dump could be a whole new pastime.  I can see laptop stands going up in a lot of gamers' shitters.  Maybe a padded toilet seat and a little fridge and you're set.
---
My main was a warrior on a pvp server back in 05 and i've always leveled solo. while i definitely got ganked many times, it's not that big of a deal, you just need to keep your head up when in contested zones. as a warrior its smart to keep your distance, and use emotes to show you are friendly and just trying to level. but you will stumble upon enemies at low health/mana fighting mobs, and it will be tempting to run in and finish them off, so its a cycle. also, from my experience there are often friendly, bored level 60s who will help you if you are being harassed.
---
Except those exact same opinions are upvoted to the tune of 100's of upvotes on the threads I mentioned.
---
Local defense 3 has a message for you
---
I plan on playing and raiding casually, and I'm going to look for a casual guild that caters to people with families but who aren't retarded.  I remember vanilla wow, and carrying 10-15 friends and family people every time we went to molten core. It was a small miracle that we were able to down several AQ40 bosses and almost had Nefarian before TBC came out. The people doing the green to purple upgrade program and the bad specs howled a lot when we told them they had to make changes if they wanted to do BWL with us, because we couldn't afford to have people there who weren't pulling their weight.
---
This is great, thanks. I know they are re-doing dungeon drops in a later phase, but do we know to what extent?  If items listed on itemization.info have a different version (as most seem to) like updated in 1.10 will they start at the 1.10 version or will they be the base version and in the dungeon loot change in a later phase change them to the 1.10 or whatever their latest version is?
---
It's a difficult problem. Worst case scenario i'd guess they just merge it and use a queue to control max online population? Maybe offer free transfers away to a lower pop server?
---
Make a invite for people and whoever signed up first/is most consistent goes?  Are you new to raiding or..:
---
And I'm saying that people that roll pve know exactly what they are getting themselves into.
---
Poopsocking will never die.  I'll keep it alive single-handed if I have to.
---
The mage does sustain itself through drinking water it conjures.
---
Most definitely, Also paladins are insanely strong in organized pvp thanks to BoP and freedom and great single target heals
---
Onyxia p2 is kind of an outlier. Would it even matter as she isn't a hard boss at all? And you'd pretty much have to stack classes with lots of dots to make it that much different.
---
Or teach them how to play their class.  If they are THAT low they could just need some help.
---
Color me interested in being your resident meme enhancement. Where might I enquire for further details?
---
ofc, it gets significantly better the higher level you get
---
Ahh yes, Elwynn Forest.
---
Grinding at its beak
---
&gt; and for horde you don't have any attached FPs to moonglade
---
Yes you have
---
I was 6 when WoW came out. My dad was a huge fan, and had continued playing ever since it came out. My brother and I used to bring dining chairs into his computer room and watch for hours, and at one point he taught us how to farm for him so he could make some extra gold. I just remember being in awe that I could talk to anyone, and also play dress up in the auction house!
---
Sure, why does it matter what raid you’re in?  As long as you’re playing with people you enjoy being around.  Christ in TBC I was in a guild on my alt that literally only raided t4 content for all of tbc and I had more fun with them than I did pushing content on my main.
---
That's what I love about the older content.  When it seems like a super simple task can get way out of hand and you come out battered and bloody but you get that overwhelming sense of satisfaction of completing it.
---
For the random chat, maybe.
---
For the bland landscape and lack of storyline, no.
---
Nah man they're rolling on a pve server if they had that level of critical thinking they'd be on a pvp server.
---
So.... it'll be the same as it was in Vanilla, nothing new.
---
Items will all be in their 1.12 state, but if they were added after launch, they won't drop yet.
---
Doesn't really sound right to me either. I would find it really hard to believe that the loss in DPS that 4 people would have without a shaman in the group would outweigh the effect of Mana Spring Totem throughout the entire fight and at least one Mana Tide Totem for an entire healing group. I would be shocked if that actually would result in a net mana loss.
---
A Shadow Priest is far more viable than a Balance Druid. They do not belong on the same tier. 15% increase to all warlocks (and rogues using Shadow Oil) is much bigger than 3% crit to one group of 4.
---
I'd even go so far as to say you should switch Feral Cat and Shadow Priest.
---
True that 1.13 wouldn’t really work. What I think would be better is if they took the design framework that was around in classic and try to embed that into their next expansion. Imagine endgame that was more social by design with fewer of the less engaging gameplay aspects. 
---
For example, Warfronts are currently a face roll bg without enemy players. It would have been way cooler to have made them open world (instead of instanced) pvp hubs where you’re gathering wood and iron while competing with enemy players. The pve aspects could still be in place for players who don’t like to pvp, like the rare hunting and such. But the point is that by design warfronts aren’t really compelling or engaging, but they could have been with more of a focus on players interacting to reach an epic objective.
---
Yeah I don't think it should be a permanent sticky, but I think for like the first week of launch of classic it would be appropriate
---
Optimisation and planning = quicker clears. 
---
You don't need it, things will just go a lot smoother if you plan a bit or whatever.
---
Yep, I'm going to have limited raid time, so I'll be searching for a new guild if I find myself in a situation where the normal raid group is carrying a lot of suboptimal specs that are literally wasting my precious time. I'm not a big try-hard, but I have a family and a small child now, so I can't waste 5 hours in Molten Core on a Sunday evening any more just because Bob, Jenny, and 4-5 other random people want to "play the way we want to!"
---
REEEEEEEEEEE!!!!
---
Well i disagree on feral tanks, not even suboptimal, personal opinion
---
D R E A D N A U G H T | NEXT PLEASE!
---
You could easily play a mage with 0 down time with rank 1 frostbolt/rank 1 nova and wanding, it's just silly because it's far faster to kill things and drink up.   
---
Mage can feel a bit weak in the 20s and 30s but when they start unlocking their whole tree frostbolt becomes an extremely efficient source of damage.  
---
You'll notice a lot of mages (if you watch streams) like playing very inefficiently - i guess it makes them feel good and powerful to go around spamming CoC/FB/AoE/Blink. If you actually save your mana for frostbolt though you'll find yourself being able to kill a lot of mobs between drinks.
---
Wand and use the 5 sec rule.
---
It does get better as you go, but you will always drink quite a bit.  At least its free water.
---
Bro order and chaos has been on the App Store for like five years

The former is far more populated and kept up to date than the latter.
---
Cut out this nonsense - you don't need to dedicate time to vanilla, just play as you like.  If it takes six mouths to hit 60, and that's months after the first big rush, there'll still be new guilds forming and having thier first attempt at MC &amp; Ony.  end game isn't the game.  The WHOLE game is the game, so don't define success or enjoyment by the ability to hit 60.
---
Thanks for the quick answer. That makes life about 1000% easier when considering where to go and what to do for the best healing set.
---
I feel I'm one of the few Druid players whenever I talk to people about classes. 
---
It's especially weird because Druid was class I least enjoyed during my WoW career until the Beta. Times change.
---
I mean 12pm-6pm is pretty peak EU times. Might want to consider joining an EU server
---
I truly believe everything that is considered to have “killed” the game is something the majority of the community demanded or really liked at one point or another. Too bad many of those chances turned out for the worse.
---
In other words the community has had a major part in features that has ruined WoW for a lot of people.
---
Nope. Spriest can't do anywhere near as much DPS as a feral with pummeler.
---
Spriest and Balance are grouped by "they do kinda okay DPS but are mainly just there for their debuff / buff".
---
&gt; "your guildies can farm consumables so you can play a worse spec" just doesn't hold any water and is a slippery slope to long raid nights wiping with meme specs.
---
Farming consumes is something they should have done. Forcing a shaman out of the melee group, because that person is too lazy to farm consumes is an issue. No real guild would tolerate that. If it weren't for that I would agree with you. Just to be clear it's key that you understand. The reason why top guilds don't care as much about mana tide. Isn't that it's bad. It's that you would have to pull the shammy from the melee group to use. Which is huge for obvious reasons.
---
As far as mana being a problem. I'm sure in 2005 before people understood itemization and down ranking mechanics it was. However in the 1.12 meta it should not be an issue.
---
Time and pending expansions are a big part of the catchup issue. You are right, because of catchup mechanisms, more people were able to participate in more of the content before it was all made irrelevant by WotLK. But at the same time, as a player who was in a guild that was pretty far behind the curve, seeing the new badge gear just demoralized us. Yes badge gear opened up the new content, but it also obsoleted progress. 
---
This is why I really wish Blizz would have evaluated the various vanilla items that feel like "catchup" mechanics, ie Spellweaver's Turban an it's ilk. Now that there's likely no time pressure on vanilla, no impending expansion to blow everything away, it makes sense to stretch the content out, not to destroy the value of the content by putting in catchup gear.
---
Now do that with a feral druid!
---
Just kite in a big circle around the totem
---
It works in the Beta.
---
people don't really talk about base stats because they are minuscule compared to big racials like dwarf stoneform, escape artist, war stomps etc. etc. 
---
Nightelf having 1% more dodge and a couple more agi isn't gonna make a difference compared to +5 weaponskill
---
Need at least two charge up episodes before then.
---
No one talks about the stats because they they're super trivial.
---
If your play style relies on stealth (e.g., to backstab or somesuch) then night elf provides a bonus to that.  If your play style is more of a melee combat w sword, then human provides a bonus to that.  Undead I don't know, but looks fun.  In fact, ignore the rest just go for what looks fun.
---
If you count the bonus damage an Spriest brings to a raid as its own, the Spriest outclasses the Feral cat no matter how many pummelers they have.
---
And they are all wrong. 21/25/0 is a lot stronger build for priest.
---
Just kite and you can do 3~4 autoshots before the enemy is in your deadzone. After that they're almost dead anyways
---
That wasn’t how you phrased the question though. You asked which race has the best perks and then said which races you would like to play. Sadly the best race isn’t one of the ones you wanted but that doesn’t change the fact that Orc is your best bet. Out of those races though human is probably the best but then you’re stuck playing alliance.
---
so little almost insignificant.
---
Tauren get 2 yards of melee range and they get 5% + base stamina racial.  Perfect for warrior/enh shaman
---
Why have such a defensive opinion about guilds not wanting bad raiding specs if you're not planning on raiding much?
---
The development of Mormonism?
---
Isn’t the weapon skill benefit only a factor when dealing with threat? Because outside of having slightly more damaging glancing blows, active mitigation or passive in some cases still matter, no?
---
Yeah literally the hardest part of hunter lvling is 1-8 once you get conc shot you are pretty golden
---
And my personal experience raiding with ferals is that they take way more damage than Warriors and thus are harder to heal, plus they don't have the useful cooldowns Warriors do (shield wall, last stand, lifegiving gem) and they cannot use potions/healthstones/etc because it drops bear form.
---
They're fine for tanking trash/adds, just not main tanking raid bosses.
---
Thats my point. A lot of people who think they are going to be tourists are going to stay forever. This meme about tourists leaving isn't going to be real.
---
I mean definitely good to not take a Pyroblast to the face, no?
---
You forgot the best part. I had a bugged Alterac Valley wolf and would challenge people to beat my pet in a race for money.
---
So if you don't have much interest in raiding or care about progressing why do you feel the need to judge others who do as having a "sad, broke mentality"?
---
Horde is the default faction for main stream casuals / twitch chat
---
eu shaman looking for raiding guild, evening times uk any day of the week. ideally want to play ele but will play resto for progress is neccessary
---
Thanks for letting me know! I'll use this to determine if i need to lower the pass-mark for the future vids so it deffo helps! :)
---
There is nothing wrong with having both, and it makes sense to us to provide more options. They could keep the purists happy, while appealing to the "what if" crowd. However, this is Blizzard. They will do whatever is easiest/makes the most money. Right now leaving vanilla as is requires no additional effort, as everything has already been done. The only time I see changes being implemented is when they decide what to do afterwards.
---
With that being said, advocate your heart out for changes. Just don't  be surprised when you are met with tons of downvotes as many people want to keep this a preservation project.
---
Yeah having started again on the private servers, the walking distances really aren’t that far if you’re moving with purpose and not getting distracted by everything, which is hard...
---
To be fair, Americans have more land than Aussies, and based on what I see on the news, everyone in North America is trying to kill you too—except with guns—down under it’s just teeth, claws, poison...
---
And have you seen how hard we project being macho?
---
They didn't mention how to get away from something in melee range.  
---
Side step away while spamming your Raptor strike/wing clip combo and Mongoose bite. (Go easy on wing clips once it's applied it will drain mana just reapplying it) Side stepping keeps your back from being exposed and you will fight back while you try to get away.  Turning your back on any thing or anyone hitting you is very bad.
---
Scatter shot after getting a Raptor strike in and applying wing clip to stun and make room to kite.  (If you are a dwarf you can stone form to cleanse rogue crippling poison)
---
So the sequence against melee is:
---
Raptor strike/wing clip -&gt; scattershot -&gt; get away  and cleanse slow if possible.  Then start kiting as normal and win.
---
Mages, priests and Warlocks will be free kills.  Interrupt their casts with a scattershot and feign death.  Most of the time you won't even know which one of the 3 you just killed.   
---
If a mage freezes you to the ground and blinks close you scattershot the mage or spam Raptor strike and wing clip to push his casting bar back long enough to get free.  I've had mages blink away from me in that situation just to get shot by me.
---
wow that was hilarious. dunno how ive never seen that
---
Yeah I play Warframe, it's so weird to add it to the list.
---
Seems so. Down voted.
---
I DON'T WANT PINK FOR SHAMANS.
---
These are not the same situation. The first example has the group doing nearly twice the required dps to win.
---
This example is the group having just under the dps to win.
---
But the trade-off is that having more spriests doesn't increase that damage. You only need one spriest. More druids will give more damage, more spriests won't give more warlock damage.
---
And you're not going to be choosing between a spriest and a feral druid, so it's kind of a bad comparison to begin with.
---
No, not really.
---
Locks are strong right out of the gate if you wear the right greens and blues with the proper stats.
---
In late endgame they are so strong because like the mage they scale so well...
---
Your entitled to that opinion. I don't wanna make it sound like I'm angry or being contentious. I'm just saying that's been my experience on private servers. Keep in mind this may change when they drop retail classic for obvious reasons. Anything we say is open to change because the truth is no one knows for sure how this is going to play out. 
---
I am only speaking from my experience as a shaman in the raiding guilds I was in.
---
&gt; The question is what do they do when they release naxx?
---
My expectation is that classic ends and people leave around that time.  Enjoy the ride while it lasts...
---
Hell I think getting distracted by stuff is half the fun, haha.
---
It's nothing compared to French mon ami.

**&lt;Crab Bucket&gt; [Alliance] EU [RP-PvP] English**
---
We are a 2-day raiding guild eagerly awaiting the release of Classic. We plan to play on an **RP-PVP** realm and are currently looking for raiders to fill our roster but socials are equally welcome.
---
*Schedule*: **Wednesday** and **Sunday** 19:30-23:30 CET
---
*Loot system*: **DKP** with a weekly decay and a silent single bid, along with some additional tweaks such as reduced DKP rate for our Spriest and the tank loot essentially being handled as loot council.
---
*Other*: We will have an Attendance Points system alongside DKP which will reward players who are committed to attending raids as they will be able to then spend these points on items that don't particularly benefit the raid, but have collectible or niche off-spec/PVP value, such as 2H weapons and ZG mounts.
---
**What you can expect from us**
---
We have two main goals in mind; the first being to down content in a timely manner, and the second is to laugh and have a good time. We aim to have a guild with a good mix of classes and specs (so not 15 fury warriors), with room for more niche specs provided they add sufficient utility/flavour to the raid; a SPriest that buffs the warlock dmg, a Feral that can OT when needed and provide crit for the melee. In short a relaxed raid environment but with competent players.
---
**What we expect from you**
---
We're looking for players who can commit to our raid schedule and who are motivated to participate in progression on a fairly light schedule. We're not just looking for people who can top the meters however; survivability, situational awareness, and most importantly, being able to fit in well with the guild both during the raid and outside of it is also key.
---
**How to join**
---
On our discord you can find info on how to join.

---
The only reason you bring a cat druid is because they can off tank trash while the main tank takes their dog out for a piss. You never want more than one.
---
If they don't, they will be like any other newbie in vanilla...
---
A free HK.
---
Yep until you farmed mc to the ground and want to get into AQ or Naxx, then frost it is!
---
I love shaman leveling. Astral recall and ghost wolf are awesome. You can frost shock/earthbind kite strong mobs. The only problem I see is a lack of damage really. But honestly the high travel speed makes up for it for me. The travel times are what makes lvling drag for me atleast.
---
If anything is challenging Wow in general right now, it's F2P games like Fortnite and League of Legends. I've played several other MMOs (GW2, ESO, KOTOR, and Wildstar) and while they might do one thing better than Wow each, no one does the package deal nearly as well. For many current wow players, classic is a new update they've never done before. That does mean it will have a big drop in players after some time(market saturation is mostly to blame) but, a lot of people will enjoy the old school style and even more will enjoy wow with a focus on community again. You're entitled to your opinions of course, but there's still a reasonable argument that no other mmo will compete with classic/ retail package(since you're paying for both either way)
---
I love barrens chat, I love it even more with my lvl 60 dwarf hunter sitting at x-roads waiting for horde to get off the FP so I can go pow pow brapp with my gat.
---
Yep, carrying is when the same 10 people manage to die early on every boss fight but the other 30 players are doing their job so the boss goes down anyways. (This was every Sunday in Molten Core in the friends and family guild I was in).  Those 10 people that die early, or survive but hardly contribute anything, are the ones being carried.  If the raid had 40 people like them then zero bosses would die.
---
There are 3 that have info and they show similar. Don’t remember if they showed all levels.
---
Either way that’s more finite information than a Reddit poll where it’s possible not everyone that voted will even play, some will change their minds, some will start the class but quit and try another, a large portion won’t make it to 60, etc
---
At least those stats pages show actual characters and not just someone says what they might play. And I don’t know what beta census you’re talking about but if there was one, the beta is an even smaller sample size than private servers.
---
But will you ERP me?  I dont drop loot, full disclosure.
---
I'm talking about hypothetical future classic, not live.  I haven't played live in years...  Live is 100% garbage to me.  Game might as well not even exist.
---
Yep. And, short answer, go to brd :P
---
A holy paladin solo assaulting a clearly defended base a good sign there is a stealth class hidden nearby.
---
Haha amen to that. Thank god there aren’t flying mounts...So many hours spent wandering
---
I played NE hunter on a Kel'Thuzzad kill in vanilla. I got to do all of the pulls through all of the content and played a major role in raids that did not show up in the meters.
---
Also, I was a powerhouse in PvP BGs and open world at every stage in the game. So many of the "OP" pvp classes I deleted.
---
I could solo dungeons, I could mob tag like a boss since mobs showed up on tracking before their model appeared, epic class quest was the best, etc. etc.
---
Don't let meters be your only indicator that a class is good. That is what got us what we have today on retail.
---
I'd say that having a bear as tank number 3 or 4 is most definitely optimal. Less loot table congestion combined with an increase in versatility due to a significantly better ability to aoe tanking for suppression room as well as being able to gear up fire resistance much quicker for early MC runs. Almost forgot the extra battle rez without needing to bring too many druid healers.
---
According to the OP, anyone can do this with a Windows touchscreen laptop or a Windows tablet, or with a remote desktop client  tablet.  Have a ball! :)
---
I've had my doubts also, but as I see more and more footage it does look to be correct. Saw a group attempt ZF, and get absolutely obliterated. Low level dungeons have always been trivial unless you have afks and people who facepull.
---
A spriest starts to shine when the raid has 4+ warlocks. Anything before this and an additional warlock does more damage. So while the bonus damage is super beneficial, it really depends on the raid comp.
---
&gt;Also there was no notion of an expansion. There was no concept that you only had two years to finish the content. We just played the game. There was no rush. 
---
UO came out in 1997. EQ in 1999. Both had several expansions by 2004. Most previous Blizzard games had expansions. Just because you didn't have a concept of expansions didn't mean other people didn't. Many players already had the concept of competitive raiding ingrained into them before they ever even logged into WoW beta from playing or just hearing about other MMOs.
---
A lot of people had very different experiences with Vanilla. It bothers me when people phrase things in a way that universalizes their own personal experience.
---
Too bad you cant kite the Generals out of their bases anymore, those were fun 10 minute AVs
---
Looks like something a middle schooler drew
---
TBC itself was great, the problem is how the features were handled in later expansions. Dallies were just an alternative to traditional gold grinding methods, badge gear was just a different way of implementing the catch up gear that started in vanilla, and flying mounts were expensive and slow unless you paid a ridiculous amount of gold. The zones were designed for flying mounts as well.
---
Shadowpriests do way more damage than balance druids though.
---
A lot of great and even innocent posts get down voted to 0 before they make their rise. Ive suspected it is probably some retail renegade. I don't think it's on the scale that you describe but, as a person who exclusively browseso new, I see it.
---
You are a god!

&lt;Adventures and Consequences&gt; North American Alliance West Coast / PvE Realm
---
About us: &lt;Adventures and Consequences&gt; is going to be a casual PvE guild, we're recruiting players just to have an awesome time with WoW Classic and casually progress through content. There will not be any sourt of pressure to reach max level, we all have lives that come first and will be the priority. The raids we do will likely be half pugged. We're coming to this game to have a great time and try to pursue loot without destroying our lives. That being said, this will be a mature guild, under 18s are allowed but must understand that we won't heavily censor ourselves around them (Though harrassment isn't acceptable).
---
PvP focused players are welcome to gather here, though the leadership isn't planning on focusing on PvP much more than the occasional BG.
---
There is not currently a set raid schedule but end of week (Wed-Fri) is the most likely direction we will take this in with maybe a pickup on Sunday or Monday, the leadership is based in the west coast region of the United States.
---
If you'd like to find out more feel free to DM me, Discord is Takerofsoles#2742. I check discord a lot more frequently than reddit. There isn't any formal application process but I would like to just speak to you before I hand out invites to the Discord server.
---
&gt;if someone really wants to ret dps for example, then they should be able to prove themselves, but if they expect to gear like a warrior and not use consumes and be able to raid, then they are gonna be disappointing.
---
But if someone refuses to go healing when the guild needs healers (which they likely will) their dedication to the guild could be questioned somewhat. It's not really that you need crazy dps in a raid, it's a question of why you are not trying to help your raid as much as possible? 
---
Like sure, as a warrior I can show up to raids [with this spec](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LAMcbV0oZxE00xZV0x), but why on earth would I when I can just spec a proper fury spec or whatever and help my guild so much more? Or maybe more realistic, if my guild needs a tank for something, why would I refuse? I know how to tank, I'm playing a tank class, it's pretty shitty of me towards the rest of the guild to refuse to help them. 
---
I honestly feel like this is a retail WoW issue being carried over, with people getting so used to pugging or whatever that they don't give a shit about their guilds any more. Back in the day people also played suboptimal specs, but that was because they didn't know better (and/or didn't bother to learn how to heal), that is usually not the case for many ret palas on here, or at least it doesn't seem like it.
---
Rets bring improved BoM which is nice. Enhance brings totems, very useful if you don’t have 8 Shamans. Both are more useful than a Balance who’s the ultimate meme spec.
---
If you're going to minmax that hard, you shouldn't be bringing druids at all other than a single resto to buff motw / thorns.
---
:\^)
---
This is simply an overall "how useful is this class in raids" tier list. Not a hyper-bleeding-edge-min-max list.
---
I'm on a nostalgia trip, my dad used to say that a lot to me! Thanks man.
---
Aquatic form is easy if you use the Wetlands shortcut.

&lt;Those Who Remain&gt; Alliance, PVP server, raiding, pvp, hardcore and casual
---
&lt;Those Who Remain&gt; is a guild coming to WoW classic that wants to enjoy the game the way it was originally intended. We are a community looking to have fun and help other players. Wether you’ve been around since launch, just started today or anywhere in between, we have a place for you. Our guild will be progressing raids and doing PvP/world PvP.
---
Accepting of hardcore and casual. Raiders, dungeoneers, and pvpers all welcome.
---
Big basic rule is no drama.
---
Time zone: Pacific standard(NA west coast)
---
Raids specific schedule yet to be determined(most likely weekday evenings and weekends 7pm pst potentially)
---
Raid leader tanked naxx, looking to get there again.
---
PvP and World PvP scheduled event yet to be determined. (We have some hardcore always willing to PvP, 5 man squads will be frequent at lvl60)
---
This post is dumb and so is OP
---
Shaman the entire class itself brings the same totems regardless of spec. Infact, its more viable as enhance because youll be placed in a group with warriors and therefore, their windfury will have more attack power. That's equivalent to having a whole extra rogue auto attacking the whole time damage wise.
---
If anything is useless, it is class wise, not spec wise.  Boomkin being the most useless since itll go oom in the first 5 seconds and their HoTs dont even stack.
---
Awesome, thanks for the quick response!
---
Would it be possible for you to do the first 4-5 quests in Teldrassil and note the reputations they provide? It would be interesting to compare it to the values of private servers.
---
For some reason, no beta testers seems to have checked reputation gains.
---
Here is how solo leveling a warrior goes.  Warrior pulls an equal level mob.  Priest walking by swp's said warrior.  Said priest /lol's until you die.
---
lol no one actually grinded in runescape back then, everyone just used that pixel bot to farm everything.
---
They are not even near top tier dps, and very slow levelers. But that’s the point I’m trying to make, I still had a blast playing because that’s what i wanted to play! At the time I had no clue what I was doing, but I loved it and kept with it even though I saw other people progressing faster. Hope this helps a bit!
---
It's not like rocket science vs kindergarten kind of complexity comparison.  But yes, classic was much more complex when considering all the smaller pieces together.  
---
Talent system has cookie cutter builds, but still allot for 3-20 points being up to the player.  Some might be PVP talents for a Raider, or off-spec talents for others.  Some classes only have 3-5 points to juggle while others have half a tree to work with.  Some actually have 5-10 wasted points, needing to be dumped to hit the 20-21 point tier talents.
---
That's just talent decisions.  The entire system is much more watered down in retail from what I understand.
---
Take gearing.  Retail became some perfectly itemized game, everything was Main stat + 2-3 variable offstats.  And most builds now revolve around stacking that 1 stat, crit or haste until "cap" and moving to a 2nd stat.
---
Shitty itemization in classic worked because of how massive the game was.   Spend 3-5 hours doing BRD or UBRS run, and decide to pass on an item because it has "attack power" and not "crit" would be fucking crazy.  You grabbed upgrades whenever possible, and didn't worry about perfect itemization.  Anyone targeting a "pre-set" best in slot list will be highly disappointed.  
---
Professions were harder and more intricate.  Forming groups took longer, travel took longer, group wipes were a consideration \[jumper cables, divine intervention, etc.\], crafting/tipping, PVP was more rewarding.
---
Quality of life changes after classic slowly turned WoW into a spoon fed baby game.
---
Is this a "waaah it's not like my private server" post? I can't tell.
---
Is it bad that I want to unironically try to MT Warlock demo spec?
---
Holy paladin can bring that.
---
Healing the tank is rarely a problem. They are damage sponges that do way more TPS than most tanks. Only a dual-wielding fury tank can do as much TPS and that's quite a dangerous build and it requires a very good player to pull off.
---
Even worse.  
---
If your warrior has used a sharpening stone then he won't get windfury...and he can't dispell his sharpening stone.  
---

Hey all. I'm looking to relive the vanilla experience all over again, just from a different perspective. I played at launch and played both a 60 Orc Hunter and 60 Dwarf Paladin in raiding, clearing MC/BWL/ZG/AQ20 and some of AQ40. My guild(s) filtered out around that time and I never got to delve deeper into AQ40 or even touch Naxx, however this time I'd love to progress and clear all content.
---
While I'm no longer 14 and I don't have the time to dedicate a complete no-life schedule, I do plan on leveling relatively quickly and focusing my time into progressing. I've seen majority of the content when it was actually live and I played through the beginning content a few years ago again on a private server, so I've got a good idea between the two as to what I'm going to be doing.
---
As a side note, I plan on participating heavily in world PvP should I have the group/guild to be able to do it.
---
I'll add I only did Tauren druid aquatic form questline in BC.
---
I'm talking about DPS vs Healer for these classes, not the class as a whole.
---
But thanks for calling me dumb :)
---
That's nice but what if we chopped it in half and slapped some mushroom shit all over it?
---
yesssss
---
Damn, that is crazy healer turn over.
---
It depends on the guild, I guess, but if they are going for any kind of progression, all the dps plate you need for ret is probably going to the prot/fury warriors before you get to touch it and they will expect you to get and keep up your holy gear as a priority which will mostly be cloth mixed healing stuff. If they run off a point system like DKP and allow you to bid off spec over people on main spec, you could bid with the warriors and maybe get a few good pieces.
---
As far as strictly PvP gear goes, you can grind BGs and certain reps in-between raid and gear up decently in some PvP blues. Once AV hits a little after launch, you should be able to get an epic axe maybe? Idr, it's not going to be as good as raid equivalent, but still decent. Some PvE gear from dungeons, quests, reps etc. are also used instead of just pure PvP gear for PvPing, so you will need to look up a BiS list and go from there, imo.
---
Honestly, my PvP was limited to world PvP and twinking, so I would not be the best person to ask for level 60 gear PvP sets, and like I said, how much gear you get from raiding as an off spec is going to heavily depend on the guild and their systems. I hope someone else can answer your question better. 
---
As a side note, I'd recommend maybe making friends with a warrior tank for dungeons that doesn't mind letting you loot dps plate with him. You could probably also start some dungeon groups yourself as prot and not invite any plate so that you get all of it as well. It's a little harder to tank as prot pally, but it's doable in dungeons unlike in raids. You could also get a bear tank friend and only invite cloth/leather/mail dps. This is pretty much what everyone does to ensure they don't have to compete for loot. Obviously two people will end up competing, but the other 3 get free shit.
---
I want to tank as a warlock, where is your god now??
---
And the first Spriest you bring to raids is far more valuable than the first ~5 cat druids you bring to a raid.
---
The pvp weapons and armor were basically best in slot and superior to anything you could get in all the raid tiers with the exception of late-sunwell bosses. I had full gladiator armor, the S3 2h mace (for pvp) and the 2h sword (for pve sword spec / blood frenzy / imp slam) and they outperformed anything you could get from Gruul's, SSC, TK, Hyjal, and most of BT.  Cataclysm's edge was barely an upgrade over the season 3 2h sword - 
---
S3 sword - https://tbc-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=33688
---
Cat's Edge - https://tbc-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=30902
---
It wasn't that hard to get high rating in pvp if you found yourself a good 2v2 or 3v3 team. 2 weeks of high performance with a decent rating got you a weapon superior to anything you could get in raiding. I did both raiding and pvp (because they were both fun,) but raiding was always disappointing when loot dropped because  the itemization was always superior on PVP gear for melee dps. I pretty much just collected tanking gear and the occasional trinket.
---
****************************************************************************
---
1) level in pvp spec (arms), ignore the meme pve spec (fury)
---
2) get engineering. The ability to interrupt casts at a distance while rooted is so valuable (bombs)
---
3) save pots for when a random guy attacks you and make him regret his decision
---
These raptors don't have heads man !
---
The land just moves Chuck along out of respect.
---
I think I'm going to rush to 60 on my main and then casually level an alt hunter or warlock, something easy to level.
---
That's really interesting.  Do you know if that test was run on the beta or a private server?
---
And why is that? Why are people that don't enjoy getting ganked unable of critical thinking?
---
All warlocks(and Shadow priests) share and can deplete the same stacks.
---
Any warlock can also reset the stacks back to the maximum of 4.
---
Doubt it. The feral does a lot more damage than the shadow priest on its own and also buffs his whole melee group, the buff is not as strong as the shadow debuff but he probably makes up for it in personal damage that the priest doesnt.
---
Shadow priests are so bad that people dont take even one anymore to raids because its just a lot better to have a holy spec in to the shadow debuff
---
Orc Shaman: What's my purpose?
---
Raid lead: You cast chain heal.
---
Orc Shaman: Oh my God.
---
I don't think I've ever met anyone who didn't consider Blink to be a core part of Mage's class identity though
---
Because they are still wrong regardless of what I chose to do?
---
I only brought up what I am doing because they tried to tell me what I would think as a defense. But I guess you are right, why counter their irrelevant claim if it is irrelevant.
---
The original post was still ripe with superiority and assumptions of others viewpoint. I only mean to point that out as wrong and it would affect others in more ways than just raids. That type of outlook affects every aspect of play negatively.
---
I have tried a few times to play a drinking game where I drink when my mage has to drink. I have yet to make it out of  Northshire Valley.
---
Not OP, but I’m also choosing druid (after initially getting really excited about warlock...still might make an alt). I like the fact that they have to use their entire arsenal of abilities. You might start a fight in stealth as a cat, put a couple DoTs on, swap to caster and root, travel form and get distance, do ranged damage, swap to bear form when they’re back on you, back to caster form for heals and HoTs, repeat, etc. They are extremely difficult to kill when played well, and that’s my goal in PvP (have mostly played holy paladin). The best FCs in WSG and defenders in AB and AV.  Obviously a strong quality to have in wPvP too.
---
Our raids take place on Wednesday, Sunday and Monday night at 17:30 until 21:30, and we prefer our raiders be available for slighty longer on Monday nights for progression periods; currently looking to start MC progression within three-weeks of launch. We will also host optional ZG raids (once released) throughout the week at the same time. We are currently seeking exceptional players of all classes and roles at the moment, though healers are always highly sought after.
---
I also want this.  I will be the tauren druid randomly RPing for no reason other then to keep things interesting. (When I'm not healing progression raiding that is.)
---
What's up with all these strawmen? I've been here since it was &lt;1000 subs and I've NEVER seen anyone crap on unconventional specs. This sub has been above and beyond supportive of playing what you want, how you want since the very beginning.
---
Look man I can't explain all human nature so you can understand this.  Believe me or don't and time will prove me right.  Have a nice day friendo
---
&gt; Just because the raid is easy doesn't mean you want to increase the time commitment by pulling dead weight around you.
---
Which is fine, but you wouldn't know it listening to some of the talk as it usually has a very negative connotation to it like "I wish it weren't so easy."  It's simple enough to challenge yourself if you really want to.  I remember when my guild was first raiding MC we took a premade of 9 players in to see how far we could get with a small group.
---
\&gt; unless you go full ham and farm tons of dark runes / potions for every raid
---
Tbf, this is definitely how people will be raiding this time around. Everyone is going to be far more prepared, has far more experience and just is generally WAY better at the game than we were 97 years ago.
---
I picked that quote not because I'm a spriest or anything, but because I think it's a good example. Imo hybrid specs will be a bit better represented this time through because people will put far more effort into it than before.
---
Because what I am choosing to do has no bearing on both my ability to see such a thing, nor weather it is right or not?
---
I mean, the fact I am challanging the narrow minded opinions of the post and then need to defend the narrow minded assumptions made of me pretty much proves my point.
---
See you at Twin Emps
---
Alliance have some very solid raiding advantages. Pally buffs are really strong in general, especially Salvation. Shaman have some really good buffs (Nature resist totem, poison/disease cleanse totem, tremor totem, Windfury, etc.) but they are limited to their own party, so 1/8 the raid. In general, I don't think they can keep up with a 30% threat reduction buff. In addition, Dwarf priest can come in handy since a good chunk of bosses fear. Horde also only has Troll's berserking as far as racials that help a caster. 
---
With that said, I'm going Horde, I don't have time to raid, and I think shaman are a cool unique class.
---
Barrenes chat them feels
---
People are going to be offended, but this made my day.
---
On the flip side many original vanilla players rolled on pve servers due to peer pressure from real life friends (who often didn’t even make it to end game). Since getting back in touch with about a dozen of old friends from my old pve server all but one have the ambition to roll pvp straight away this time. Many of us did end up making a pvp server character and loving the added dynamic of PVP servers even though we were late to the party and often found ourselves in the “lvl 20 being corpse camped by lvl 60’s” situation. But because of the time and effort already invested in our pve server mains we were usually stuck raiding on those characters, leaving the pvp server characters as a pet project. Will be interesting to compare player bases of these types of servers a year after the release of classic, I for one hope you are wrong, as an unpopulated pvp server means I won’t be getting the experience I’m signing up for, time will tell. 
---
Nevertheless I wish you a good pve server experience, even on pve servers cross faction notoriety was a thing from battlegrounds and standing in front of raid instances still flagged from being dragged out of a battleground. Some of the people I will be playing with used to be on the opposite faction but over the years we gained a mutual respect for each other that later grew into friendships. One of the perks of a pve server is that you can make a character on the opposing faction and just drop by for a chat with the people you just fought in bgs, or the douchebag that just chain feared the MT during a world boss fight because someone showed up flagged from a bg and the infection spread through buffs and heals, allowing the other faction who had a non pvp flagged raid to down him.

Ex-Mormon checking in.  Look over at /r/exmormon for any questions.  I’m also happy to answer any questions.
---
Could be just a case of distribution of general talent across servers. I was on Bloodhoof in Vanilla and Dwarf Priest/Gnome Mage was the overwhelming standard
---
Engineering is the best pve profession in pve due to gnomish battle chicken and nades
---
Admit it you were just waiting for an opportunity to use infallible
---
shamans got switched in healer group infight to set down manatide. that takes around 15? sec defenitly worth the minimal dps loss. 
---
maybe infight group switching isnt a thing anymore but in vanilla it was.
---
&gt; debuff limit
---
Pretty sure the debuff slots have been expanded since before 1.12.
---
Keep your weapon upgraded and you will chomp through most classes you come across except maybe warlock while leveling (until you get your fear immunes).
---
There isn't a class I come across when leveling that I think. "got to run away"
---
You're delusional if you think more cat druids will be in raid comps over shadow priests. There are 5 classes that should always be brought over a cat druid.
---
I had watched a full documentary on South-Park so I'm pretty seasoned
---
What's there to know lol?
---
outdated!
---
&gt;Why is that stupid? You have an infinimate amount of tries to get the first jump. That will always happen.
---
2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more flips will also always happen, if you just try enough times.
---
The reason why this is stupid, is because you guys are arguing semantics.
---
The first guy used the word "attempt". Get him to define what counts as an attempt, then the correct answer won't be up for discussion.
---
Warriors have a leveling problem. You’re highly dependent on slow melee weapons since your hit is too low to duel wield. Glancing blows occur often and are extremely detrimental for rage generation since they nullify crits.
---
With knowledge, as a warrior, you’ll want to grind out dungeons until you’re about 3 levels ahead of what would be the normal quest curve.
---
Quests always give the same XP until grey. And while mobs will give less, the extra damage and less damage taken will even out the grinding XP.
---
When you do reach PVP quest areas, you’ll be higher than a lot of people in the area which will discourage ganking.
---
I don’t think there will be bored level 60’s on a fresh server though.
---
What kind of dumbass team doesn’t want a druid in AB?
---
No way, he was server first for many many stuff
---
Some healing shamans go into enhance tree for improved weapon totems but theyre still healers
---
Dark runes are a pain in the dick to farm. Either you farm satyrs out in the world with their ~4% drop chance, or you run Scholo over and over getting an average of 5 runes each run.
---
The spriest in my guild said he would go through 20-30 of them every raid. That's a lot of farming. Not impossible, sure, but just takes a LOT of time and effort to farm that much for every raid.
---
literally no fun allowed on this subreddit
---
Forgot about the dead zone...and area that hunters can’t attack anyone, but can be attacked lol
---
Why would you want a druid for AB?
---
This. 
---
Even just asking in LFG in the region chat you will find lots of players drop what they are doing to help out, which will cause the enemy faction to do the same. Before you know it, it’s a full on rumble in the jungle.
---
The rumors about mankrik's wife floating around there are brutal!
---
You still only have 16 and that means you don’t put up dots.
---
Just a heads up if you plan on rolling on a PvP realm: You can't make Horde and Alliance characters on the same realm.
---
Yeah I know that feeling. It was worth it to make the blacksmithing weapons using primals from raiding because they were better than S2 weapons, but that was about the only thing worth it at the time. If you were in a guild capable of clearing hyjal / BT in season 2, you were bleeding edge at that time. Wasn't until season 3 that more guilds started catching up and clearing stuff. Was pretty disappointing that drops from Kael'Thas, who at the time was one of the hardest raid bosses Blizz ever came out with, were basically trash for anyone who had pvp gear. My guild spent weeks wiping on that fight while we worked on our coordination and planning. When we finally killed the bastard and saw the drops, it was like "that's it?" Besides phoenix mount and rod of the sun king he dropped some pretty lame loot.
---
Apologies, check [here](https://willitclassic.com/addons).
---
I think free server transfers to lower pop or new server, its what they did back in the day.
---
haha
---
Maybe in PVP. But in PVE, Orc &gt; Tauren every day.
---
The actual race you select for any given class is rather minor in the overall scheme of things. This can be best summarized by what moonsti says towards the end of each of his videos on "Best Race for XYZ" where XYZ is some class:
---
"In the end, your race won't make a huge difference. The fact is, the racials here won't impact your performance that much. If you're going for that "picture perfect" setup, then I'd follow my advice, otherwise I'd play whatever the fuck you want."
---
Honestly, just play whatever race you find the coolest. Because honestly, having the "best race" is meaningless if you find said race to be ugly/boring/whatever makes it less enjoyable to play. It's far better to actually play and enjoy playing a given race than to have the "optimal race" that you find boring and therefore don't play.

what level of engineering do I need to be for those bombs? I plan on taking engineering later but if it helps me out I might take it earlier.

Yes but it's still a bigger benefit then the couple stat points.

Melee Attack power boost. Make sure you not that it wasn't until TBC that it was changed to ranged and Spellpower.

What patch, and what gear were you using?  The only time i broke 4k without buffs was when i intentionally went all stam - sacrificing all other stats.

I don't think I broke 4k even in Naxx gear.

Yes, your ineptitude to explain your reasoning is very clear to me.

This doesnt just apply to games either. You see it a lot in the workplace too.
---
Something to keep in mind; very few classes in classic will have the kind of mobility many classes have on retail.
---
Really, even the classes with good mobility on classic pale in comparison to their retail counterparts. Mages have twice the mobility on retail as classic, same with warriors and rogues. Hunters and druids are probably close, but those are really the only classes I can think of.
---
This paragraph is exactly why I left retail wow so many years ago.  Zero community.
---
  I had more fun this morning pretending to be a tour guide on the flight from org to undercity than I did in the last 2 years of my wow sub.  It wasnt even very clever and i still got 3 to 4 people responding and 1 even tipped me 10 silver.  I will be spending time writing up quality dialogue for the future, just that little reaction from the community made it worth it.
---
Then these servers will have que times after P2 once they remove layering. They've already stated this will be the case.
---
They will also likely have an option for a free transfer to a low pop realm
---
Do they require you to have the latest expansion for retail to be able to play classic or can you just go into your account and add game time to access it?
---
ill give it a try! thanks dude
---
Hi talking about dps vs healer for these classes, not the class as a whole.
---
but thanks for calling me dumb :), I'm dad.
---
Np, good luck! :)
---
It's not slightly more damage on glancing blows, it's 20% more damage on glancing blows, which are 40% of all your white attacks. That's an 8% damage increase on white damage, which for some classes, is over 50% of your total DPS. And that's just what it does to glancing blows, it also gives +3% hit and some other smaller beneficial stats.
---
I may have to make a video about this now.
---
As a shadow priest, Starshards-- when you get your shadow tree interrupted, Starshards remains available as a damage option to finish off a low HP target.
---
Homogenization of classes ruined the class system for me.
---
At some point in Cata, I realized the direction they were moving.  Every classes needed X amount of interrupts, X amount of CC, X amount of snares, X amount of CC resets, etc.
---
Like if Mages had counter-spell....all other classes needed something similar, on damn near identical cool-downs with damn near identical use cases.  Just look how many classes have self healing now vs classic/vanilla.  You get a self heal, you get a self heal, EVERYBODY GETS A SELF HEAL.
---
Let's not get into Bloodlust and Heroism, the earliest indicator of this meshing and blending of abilities.  The paladin and shaman on both sides was like the first shot, 2 distinct raiding styles gone.  Now both sides are the same.
---
Bloodlust was for the Horde, while Paladins had Auras and blessings.  Alliance was more sustain and threat management, while Horde raiding had dedicated Bloodlust burn period.  The raids were different and had flavor to them.  Alliance assisted by the holy light, and the Horde a pack of savages with bloodlusting aggression.
---
The server technology can have both improved and the dev team tuning the server to be efficient at different things. We've seen several hundred people at the same spot in the beta/stress test with minimal server issues. That's not to say handling 1/2 of the servers population in southern Slithius is an easy task.
---
This sounds perfect for me. I've been playing since Vanilla and have raided in all roles at some point or another. I've gone from hardcore in Vanilla down to casual husband and father over the years. I'm super excited to revisit vanilla WoW with some fun and laid back guys but also do some casual raid progression.
---
I plan on playing a Warlock this time around. I also might be able to talk my Priest friend into joining us. I sent you a friend request on Discord, I'm spy890#3578. Is there a guild discord?
---
We don't know that, just because it's a shared sub doesn't mean there won't be a cost to buy the actual game, kinda like the cost of each expansion they release + the sub cost
---
The raid needs 40 people...half of the time being a warm body is enough
---
Molten Core is rough for Ret, and everyone is hungry for loot early on. Even on-spec top contributors might only get 1 drop every month or two, depending on luck. It gets a lot better when ZG and AQ20 come out. Not only are there good ret pally drops there, but loot in general becomes more plentiful, so there is less competition for drops. The AQ40 paladin set is really good for Ret PvP, too.
---
It’s hard to pick a favorite for me but this is easily the most iconic zone in all of wow
---
P.s. Nice drawing 👍
---
This is going to start a shitstorm haha
---
As long as your pants drop im in
---
This is more or less my plan. I dont have too much vacation left this year and I have 2 corgi pups that demand my attention constantly. I will be taking them for walks to tire them out so I can focus on the grind.
---
farsight totem pvp
---
if you autorun while casting your char model will keep moving and every melee gets a "out of range" message. if you switch out of it you are back at your totem and the rogue somewhere chasing your "shadow clone"
---
dont know if that still works, it did im vanilla
---
Alchemy and Goblin engineer (providing your main is gnomish).  Disenchant on bank alt.  Potentially leatherworking and/or tailoring to sell your cooldowns.
---
Planning on playing druid too...
---
what are your plans in regards to leveling (spec) &amp; PVE/PVP (Spec)?
---
I do in fact remember your name! I was global r1 s8 on my sham in 3s ( Razzlin-Magtheridon). Never got r1 as druid.
---
I have exclusively played resto druid and resto sham since TBC and I am nervous for classic. I know ill enjoy doing bgs and world pvp as resto or resto/hybrid. But raiding just seems downright boring. Do I really only cast healing touch for the most part?
---
A part of me wants to play warrior dps, but I don't want to learn warrior and stress over getting gear with there thousands of other warriors in classic.
---
Let’s see all yall’s videos of you doing it then, I’ll wait.
---
There's multiple types of shaman in hardcore endgame raiding indeed:
---
* Resto shaman sitting in melee group providing WF totem
---
* Resto shaman sitting in caster group providing -20% threat totem
---
* Resto shaman sitting in healer group providing Mana Tide totem
---
I didnt think BG's were even in the first phase of the release.
---
All the WoW guides on the website have been stolen. I tried posting links to all the originals but it was removed by the automod for promoting private servers.
---
You’ll die lmao
---
You don't need to be elemental for that.
---
In a group game, people who play badly and under-perform also negatively affect every aspect of group play.
---
it's literally not possible unless the rogue/warriors keyboard is literally flooded with their own drool. It's impossible
---
Most sensible comment in this entire thread. Amen, brother.
---
Just make 4 servers, one for each set of rules and have them be endlessly layered, problem solved
---
I wouldn't be surprised. I've been playing Destiny (a first-person shooter that's very much RPG-lite) on-and-off for the last few years, and all PvP is instanced there. You'd be amazed by the amount of whingeing that goes on every time a quest step requires you to play a couple of BGs. In a FPS!
---
There are a lot of people these days who just don't like the idea of being bested by another player.
---
but how do you download from there?
---
Doesn't really make any sense when you could just grab someone from the guild or a random and pay them 1g. Just levelling something to lvl 35 is going to take you at least 30 hours of work. At lvl 60 if you put the 30 hours into farming you would have 1000g + that would be many times more useful.
---
And to think that I thought new patches and expansions were what I needed
---
Daggerspine here, humans and night elves of all classes were the definite majority. The first grand marshal on our server was actually a druid. Both sides hated the shit out of gnomes, but that made it all that much more satisfying to play a gnome rogue. Dwarves were less popular than humans, but definitely more prevalent than gnomes of any class.
---
Yeah its bs. I have cutting edge raiding exp in retail during legion, and I'm looking at classic like 'Why the fuck is there a meta, this game is piss easy'. I took a deep dive into the private server raiding scene and it's just as easy as I thought. That's the reason I'm going Ret, there's no incentive to play meta if you're not in a speedrunning guild. Play what you want and get good at it and you can clear naxx. The game genuinely isnt hard enough to have a strict meta, as long as you know your class, you should be fine. 
---
That said, you have to know your gear, your stats, your build, you have to farm your consumes, and do whatever else you need to do to do real damage, but any class can do real damage with appropriate effort. Sure, you can get away with less on a meta class, but thats not the point, if somebody wants to play ret, and they put the effort into the theorycrafting and consume farming, they're generally gonna be more useful than a warrior who doesn't put in the same effort. 
---
Player quality will trump meta in 95% of situations, but good players are naturally drawn to meta specs. Speedrunning and raid racing are the only areas of the game where you need meta specs for PvE.
---
yeah good point, even people who get to 60 quick are gonna have a lot of stuff to do before they get bored and start helping lower level players.
---
If she’s healing at 60 you won’t have huge overlap. While leveling it won’t be a huge deal. Most dungeons will end up with 2-3 cloth and you are 2 of them. You can always choose not to bring a mage, but not sure I would do that for dungeons. 
---
Most of the hard gearing is at 60 and unless she’s going shadow that won’t be a huge issue. She can pick up dps / farming gear as she is able to.
---
Just life tap!
---
When i came back in WoD after a break since Wotlk i changed my lock to troll since it's the best racial for the class.
---
Bank alt should be level 5 with enchanting for disenchanting trash greens where the mats are worth more than the item. 
---
Another good one is alchemy and tailoring. Level the alt to 40 so they can do arcanite transmutes and mooncloth transmutes.
---
The whole "viable" feral dps plan is based around powershifting with Wolfshead Helm and the Furor talent. This means you're spastisitcally going in and out of caster form and cat form every time your energy goes to 0. Since this eats up your mana and mana pots are on 2min cool down, you'll also need dark runes since they don't share the mana pot cool down. In addition to all this, you'll need a shit ton of Manual Crowd Pummelers, at least 1 MCP for every 90 seconds of non-shit dps you need to do.
---
So yeah, you are sweating buckets jumping back and forth between forms, timing consumables, being smart about when to pop skills like Tiger's Fury and Ferocious Bite vs just shifting again for more energy.
---
And your payoff for all this effort: you can maybe do the dps of an under geared rogue whose barely paying attention.
---
I hated murlocs. Damn things get low on health, and run off to grab some friends. Then a couple of expansions are released and Wrath of the Lich King created something I would have considered flatly impossible..... a cute murloc.
---
This looks horrid. I can't imagine playing games like that on phones. I don't even play any phone games, and I hate phones.
---
So you also want a long term future for WoW? But also a do-over? So this seems that you want like a middle road. Vanilla was to hard, Retail to casual. Like Vanilla with fixed classes and abit easyer and faster?
---
Haha it's that same joke people say.
---
&gt; I turned up on time, had all the consumables I needed (ie food buffs, pots / exilers), gear all properly enchanted..... and I wasnt a drama queen.
---
I wish I could upvote you twice. Unless your guild is trying for world firsts, your top priority as a person shouldn't be to top the meters. It should be personal accountability, reliability, and being a person that other people want around.
---
I've never played a top DPS class in any MMO, but I've always had a spot in raid guilds because I keep my cool, I know my class, and I don't slack off.
---
Didn't play in Classic. Started in Wrath and played a resto Druid. Still my favorite class but in Classic it sounds like Resto Druid gameplay is healing touch spam, so I'm going to play a Resto Shaman instead. Will definitely make both though.
---
If you and I both hit 60 and go run Deadmines together and I do 300 DPS and you do 600, are you carrying me?  I'm pretty sure we're both 1-shotting basically everything, but based on your logic I'm still being carried.
---
What does it matter if it's Van Cleef or Nefarion that we're fighting?  If my DPS times 30 DPSers (or 3 in a dungeon) equals a dead boss either way, then it doesn't mater.  Your DPS just means it dies faster.  Sure, faster is better, but that's not what carrying means at all.
---
Time for a new guild.
---
Thanks for the excellent field report!
---
you have one job, play mana tide totem and let your raid lead know when it is over in a tell so he can put you back with the melee group for WF totem.  If they don't need your mana tide, you are not progressing or trying hard to push the raid limits.  Sometimes you might have extra shaman, but most of my raids didn't have more than 2-3 cause of their low popularity and support play style.  If you do maybe you will be in a mage group permanently and just give them threat reduction and mp5.  
---
If you want to pay attention to the health bars going up and down you have a couple heal spells in your book, but generally you won't be on the meters besides some big AOE fights as exception if your chain heals don't get sniped by prayer of healing.
---
Make sure its like 10 minutes long, repeat yourself a lot and have like a 3 minute long outro plugging your other videos. Gotta be like every other Tuber.
---
That's pretty interesting to be honest. I wonder what caused the differences in racial majority across different servers.
---
Homeboy below responded more than adequately, sorry i didn't give an in depth explanation
---
There's always the Google machine , though!
---
Learn to wand to finish off the last bit of health, you'll start the spirit regen going and you'd be surprised how much this matters.
---
Cat druid isnt the most viable because of the lack of gear and lack of scaling. As well as the Debuff limit prevents you from using your best abilities aka bleeds. Bear tank on the other hand is honestly the best 3rd tank in the game. It helps you gear your main and off tank without having to worry about spreading gear to a 3rd warrior tank. The druid gearing is very neiche in the fact that you will get prioritized certain items over other tanks were other things you'll wait. If you want to bear tank i say go for it but the liklihood of you being able to cat dps in raids is very very low. Due to the fact they pull very little dps. If you are willing to farm 4-5 manual crowd  pummelers per raid night then i say try to find yourself a newly forming guild and get on that druid tanking slot. Private servers have proven that they aren't just memes but actually work out quite well. I can speak from playing one. But i stick to warrior because the main tank life is the life for me. If you have any questions feel free to ask.
---
\-Kyliemanogue Main Tank of &lt;Participation Totems&gt;
---
Thanks for responding in my place didn't see the reply til now , you went way more in depth than I would/could've! Lol
---
Yeah, on the dark runes that's a fair point.
---
I still think people will be more useful in general this time around with hybrid specs. Also, since the content itself will be much easier for everyone, having a bunch of hybrid specs in the raid won't be nearly as big of a deal as it was during actual vanilla.
---
Modern wow players will be able to clear MC with 30 players, probably even less with gear, so having some people with less-optimal specs won't be as much of an issue. 
---
My guild in vanilla ran with 3 shadow priests a lot of the time, 2 of which would just sit out of shadow form off-healing and such. I could see people having trouble getting into pugs though, as a hybrid spec.
---
A class is as good as you play it. It’s the same in fighting games. Play whatever you feel most comfortable with and you will do the best.
---
I did this entire chart myself. I started with Holy Priest and came right back to the class I love. It’s a game after all. It’s supposed to be fun.
---
Level all the chars you want before p2.
---
This is also something they will likely work itself out. Unless you have the exact same play time just start building a friends list when the game launches. Or invite people as you go. 
---
Guilds are also a good place to find people to level with.
---
 #thisisnttwitter
---
Man, people really love throwing the word meme around when it involves anything that isn't by-the-books raid comp.
---
I intend to play ret. If I'm ever dead last in raid, I expect to be benched. If I'm not competitive, I expect to be benched. If I am dead weight, I expect to be benched. Just like I expect dead weight warriors to be benched. 
---
If a player is genuinely dead weight, they should be benched, but most of the comentary on the classic meta is hyperbole. Any player who puts in work can double any DPS check in the game on any spec, unless the boss is resisting the spec's core spells. Classic isn't tuned to be hard enough for the meta to matter outside of PvP content, which includes competitive PvE.
---
good guide, it will be a great help for new players
---
would like to see how you handle a build that gets SoCOM for lvling more efficiently but stacks up healing gear to be able to heal
---
i don't get it why is this funny?
---
If it's financially successful, there's 0 chance blizz doesn't continue to milk the rehashed content.
---
Awful reactionary aren't you, my name-calling friend? I hope that flinging insults on the internet acts as an effective release valve for your pent up emotional problems.
---
Anyway, I never said anything about playing on private servers. I said that this content has already been "revealed", in your words. (See how I directly responded to a thing you said?) I was talking about the period from 2004 to 2006 when all of this happened, and I'm saying that anyone can go look at the content any time they want by doing a quick Google search. Allowing people in the beta to stream it isn't going to do any more damage than the thousands of YouTube videos that analyze every minor detail of vanilla. 
---
Sure, showing off the higher level content may make some people who are hyped now lose interest, but I would argue that the people who are so easily deterred are probably not going to make it past level 30. No one spends hundreds of hours getting to 60 *just to see* level 60 content. No one farms gear at 60 for hundreds of hours *just to get into* the next raid tier. WoW is about the grind, not the novelty.
---
For a long time feral was a spec on its own that had tanking and damage talents. So dps feral would be a build that prioritizes damage talents.
---
That doesn't really contradict what he wrote.
---
His guilds don't want a ret pala. They want Esfand, which happens to play one.
---
At least french is beautiful
---
I watched a video on Reddit like 2 days ago of French people trying to pronounce English words, some of the people were just like "are you joking? That's a word?" Lmao
---
I bet every language has it's intricacies, English just has about a trillion
---
Objective facts about TBC:  
---
- It introduced flying.  
---
- Even though it began with attunements, they were all essentially removed later in the expansion and they never came back.  Sunwell was the first major raid to not have an attunement.  
---
- It introduced short, "loot hallway" style dungeons as the standard format.  
---
- It introduced resilience into PvP.  
---
- It introduced the concept of badge gear.  
---
- It introduced daily ~~chores~~ quests.  
---
- It removed the concept of faction-specific classes.  
---
You can downvote, but you can't change reality.  Many of these shitty design decisions remain in retail to this day.
---
I was a holy Paladin at that time and it was brutal.  I wish they would have buffed healers and kept dungeons the same.
---
Are you implying that people might be disheartened by being called failures? They know it better than you do and will be the first to point out that they didn't beat it under the most difficult settings. I am not saying that guilds that do not beat the hardest difficulty are failures, just that they failed at achieving their goal. That is important to understand. You might set a goal and fall short but that does not mean that the effort spent was useless.
---
What? The meta has changed in major ways over the years. To the point where MC and other raids are seeing 1 lockout clears. 
---
How can you say that the meta hasnt changed when efficiency has skyrocked across the board?
---
what just happened
---
+5 weapon skill is like a 15% increase to white damage in raids. That is no joke at all.
---
PSN and XBL are both a lot more affordable and cover a wider array of games. One could argue you get a lot more for your money, and a lot more enjoyment because you are playing games that aren't just trying to buffer out your experience with time restrictions, etc. 
---
My point is that WoW is a game you pay to wait till there is new content, and at $15, it's not worth a subscription if most of your game time is down time.  Just about any retail game is responsible for giving you new environments, features, mechanics, story, etc. - for a flat rate. WoW is hinging on you enjoying one mechanic for a long period of time, baiting you with new content "coming soon"
---
Is having one stormstrike for mages good? I feel like that would warrant a debuff slot similar to how nightfall does
---
Yeah beating Kael'Thas the first time was incredibly hard and the reward for it was that you got a few easy bosses in black temple to farm before things started picking up with Reliquary/Mother. Then they decided it would be a good idea to get rid of attunement for black temple so there was no longer a point to progressing through SSC and Tempest Keep because the path of least resistance was to get most of your pvp purples and start jumping on those early easyish BT bosses and farm out the trash table. So basically there was no point to SSC and TK anymore.
---
When you click on one of the addons, it will take you to that addon's page. Once there, you can select where to download the addon depending upon where the author has uploaded it. The options available will be highlighted, the remaining options will be greyed out (CurseForge, WOWi, Website, git, etc.). They're located in a vertical row to the right of the addon's description.

The only exception to this is the +skill racials in PVE. Those are a HUGE difference.
---
Isn't the debuff only 2 minutes?
---
With 40 people (more like 38 due to tanks being unlikely bandage targets) and a 8s(or was it 6?) channel, that's 304s of targets to bandage. On fights with lots of raidwide damage why not bandage?

---
It's mostly for Cat dps. If you are in a hardcore guild, it becomes very important for the threat generation. A casual guild will not be pulling enough dps to every approach your standard threat, so you don't really *need* it in that scenario, but it's still probably good to have a couple on hand.
---
Yea but no cleanse. Cleanse wins games.
---
I could be wrong but I don’t think this was meant to look like the warlock was casting it. Since it is T3, I assumed that the lightning was being generated by one of the lightning capacitors in Thaddius’s room, just to give a little flair.

Just like in Vanilla. Meaning it's intentional and unlikely to change.

I guess it’s only relevant for hunters on alliance side given no racial is good for them but hunters are very stat dependent.

crossroads babbbeeeeeeeeiiii
---
Feign Death is one of a hunter's most important abilities.  It lets you do things in combat that you normally can only do out of combat like droping traps
---
Make a feign death and freezing trap macro that makes your pet stop attacking.  A one button instant freezing trap during combat stops pretty much any thing that's on you.  So, there are plenty of ways to escape most melee situations.
---
When you fein death an enemy will have to manually retarget you.  So you can FD, drop a freezing/Frost trap on an enemy and get away without them getting a hit in if you're fast enough.
---
So in PvP you can run up to someone and literally shit a freezing trap on them even in combat. (30 sec cooldown)
---
Carry drink and food on you so you can get a snack in while your victim is trapped in the ice.
---
I feel you, I didn't start using it until around level 50 when I realised it was awesome for fighting, then I slammed the shit out of it whenever possible.
---
Not in a traditional vision sense, he's always had that shadow sight sorta thing,  still did till the end of legion when he went MIA again
---
the second one
---
The assumption that you get anything even close to perfect loot drops perfectly gearing your raid is just ludicrous. RNG is a. bitch and many drops are pvp gear or worse, useless drops that get DEd like Shadowstrike
---
If they're going for authenticity? Yes. If they change this, I have a list of like 20 other things that I consider clear and obvious bugs/deficiencies/flaws that they have intentionally re-added in Classic.
---
My small brown sack

Moonfire should only be available when it's night time on the server. =P
---
POGGERS
---
WHERE IS SHE!?
---
At low level you have no spell power gear so your damage to mana ratio is stuck in the 2 range.  With good gear that ratio increases massively so the mana needed to kill something drops.
---
TBC had attunements for a while, but was also responsible for removing them.  By 2.4, all attunements had either been nerfed (Kara) or removed completely (everything else).  Sunwell was the first major raid to not feature any sort of attunement.
---
Dude, I'm 30 years old. Calling me "kid" just because I don't agree with you is wrong
---
Hell yes I still have this stuck in my head occasionally to this day. No one ever gets the reference. I’m getting old.
---
long westfall is long.
---
For raid progression, do you really want people who have to be taught their class from people who don't even play that class?
---
If your goal is anything beyond bantz with the boys in a raid environment, you shouldn't put that much effort into fixing other people's mistakes unless they're a close IRL friend or something.
---
Dude I was thinking SL warlock with that Armor cloth set and tanking as a warlock.
---
Yeah what you said is definitely true.  It is the same reason why the titanforging system feels so awful for high end players.  I do like the way vanilla added the catchup gear in order to keep older content relevant
---
I don't see why it shouldn't be in a permanent sticky. Gonna be honest here - like 80% of reddit users don't read sidebars at all (myself included.) If there is a compiled list of community resources, it deserves to be in a sticky instead of shelved in that region.
---
I never really *liked* the barrens, I just always ended up there somehow.
---
Thanks...For trying. But  noone of them worked out.  Even when updated in may
---
11 weeks ain't shit, we almost there boyos!
---
you just said there is no chance to miss and then you use "hit cap" to explain....
---
It was funny at the time. Memes have evolved so much but back in the day this was what we had.
---
Based on your user name I think you are ready. Just convince everyone they can’t kill anything without you. Keep that SnD up and be ready to evasion tank (they think you are a god when you do this). Also get some jumper cables and you will never have to do anything but log on for raid, scream “HEAL now or wee all DIE”. And spam DPS meters after kills.
---
Beautiful canvas! I'm sorry for the newbie question, but when you say 120x90cm, do you mean 120cm (width) by 90 cm (height)?  Thank you kindly advance :-)
---
oh could be, i figured he wanted it to look like a lightning spell cast between hands.
---
I would just be cheeky and say it was my Goblin Jumper cables haha
---
That’s actually hilarious.
---
I wonder if you can MC people out the instance
---
OK maybe I am crazy, but I swear I remember a youtube clip of an Affliction lock soloing Ony in classic wow while the rest of the raid watched.  Did I make this up?
---
Druid used Gnomish MC Cap on the mage and then had the mage run into the horde portal by hugging it. Hordes can do the same to alliance by having them run into the alliance portal.
---
You don't but it's a useful place for an Ele Shaman.
---
It's why they get free water... play lock you can tap your hp for mana.
---
It's not 40 DPS less it's about half the DPS or less.

Daily quests were/are always a problem.  It's lazy, inorganic content.

Except when they drop 5!

Mormon joke and a WoW joke, bold.

If you can't compete in retail you can pretend to compete in vanilla

actually you go fire for AQ and Naxx. Mages go Frost to MC and BwL because Bosses have high fire resistance.
---
The only macro I had was one that did a chat message on how to use the lightwell. Not sure about other macros, especially since you don’t target the lightwell itself, just interact with it.
---
Lol ret. There was NEVER a point in ANY raids I've ever done on anything where we needed a ret pally. Besides, they had a tendency to be morons.
---
You're just out of touch, ya boomer.
---
OP: *asks question*
---
You, and this sub in agreement: Why would you even care about the answer to that question??? Stop le mixmaxing!
---
Nothing personal, kid.
---
I dont think anyone intending to play less desired specs is looking to get carried. I plan on playing ret, and you bet your ass if I'm not competitive I expect to be benched. Just like I expect a dead weight warrior to be benched if they arent pulling weight. 
---
Take it from a modern cutting edge raider with a full naxx private server clear. The content is not hard. All classes meet all DPS checks and blow right the fuck past them if the player puts in the work. Nobody is getting carried. Dead weight memespec players should be sat, just like deadweight rogues or warriors. The game isn't unbalanced enough to the point where skill can't overcome spec. 
---
Guilds, even naxx guilds, have revolving door rosters. It doesnt matter if I'm on ret or fury, if I show up, farm my consumables, and do at least middle of the pack damage. There will be worse players than you if you try hard, even on a memespec. Sure, you would get better results on a warrior, but a well played and farmed out ret can out compete a LOT of applicants and members in naxx guilds. 
---
Naxx guilds can look as bad as normal raiding guilds in retail on a mechanical and game sense level. Quit trying to act like the content and players are hard enough to beat that a good ret or enh player cant crush them. 
---
If a player isnt holding their weight, sit them. Thing is, every guild has bad players and a memespec that puts in worth is worth a lot more than a dogshit player you need to bring for a body. 
---
Idealistic 40 man perfect rosters do not and can not exist. Take what you can get.
---
You can.
---
Yes it's only for threat, but every tank needs to do something to increase his threat, so by having it in your passive, you can build my tanky while still holding aggro and thus be tankier
---
Look up false consensus bias. Some people do not enjoy the same thing as you, no matter how unfathomable it seems to you and me. I'm rolling on a PvP server myself but it's not hard to see that getting ganked in an unwinnable situation can be rough on the player experience.
---
I really like levitate. Great for going from LM to BS. Also great for running away in world pvp, or just travelling from place to place. Also, you float.

---
When you're able to do the wombo combo (frostbite + shatter) you'll kill enemies with fewer spells and need to drink less as a result.
---
If you want zero downtime chain pulling, look into druids and hunters.
---
Incredible!!

I suggest you [check this guys website](https://shadowpanther.net/) also [this part where he put updates](https://shadowpanther.net/questing.htm) also [found this info](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bshono/regarding_rep_gains_on_grey_quests_closed_beta/)

Deep wounds is like, below low priority. Everything knocks it off including ignite and it wont knock off ignite
---
INNER FIRE!
---
*boom*
---
He got crit sorry.
---
dude you can't compare Moonfire to a Kame-hame-ha.
---
Sounds like the game is almost ready to go. From watching streams and hearing descriptions like this makes me wonder why the release date is so late
---
vanilla also had 12 patches. wow classic right now has 6 phases all known and played out on private servers and from 2004-06 and zero content patches.
---
I think this is the dumbest comment i've ever read.
---
The biggest thing I'll miss from retail is being able to fight the tank on single target DPS as a resto druid.
---
Funny, ret has better logs than feral does by a decent margin.
---
Hit the burning things with fire! They wont see it coming.
---
Unlimited debuff slots wpuld completely trivialize vanilla bosses. They would die so fast. Would be a massive rework needed
---
True - Maybe I’ll start #justsafewchanges campaign when it comes around lol.  Though the only attunement that deserved to be removed or reworked was the SSC attune; needing the Nightbane item was annoying as shit for a 25-30 person guild and having to make sure everyone had the item from a 10 man raid.
---
Oh no! Are they going to have their client deleted and start over and make a totally different game?
---
Lol at ignite and nightfall not mattering much.
---
It was actually 6,660,000 seconds remaining when you made this post. You were off by 19 hours 26 minutes and ~40 seconds.
---
[16:05:47 June 10 to 18:00:00 August 26](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=16:05:47+June+10+to+18:00:00+August+26).
---
You only go 22 points into enhancement. You're just trading Mana Tide and one point in Purification for Imp. Weapon Totems. It's still more resto than anything else. The thinking is that the dps is worth more than 10% healing on one healer and a mana CD. For guilds with exceptional dps and threat generation it's an easy choice.
---
&gt; Ret, same as Enh but worse. You bring nothing that a Holy paladin can't, other than Nightfall
---
even then a holy paladin can equip both nightfall and annihilator
---
and so can the tank or offtank.
---
paladin is the worst weilder of these
---
I have the same "problem" as a healer. To top the meters you have to heal everything constantly. But someone needs to dispell. Often its not efficent to heal that slight bit of health someone is missing. Sometimes you need to drink a few seconds longer instead of going for the instant heal. Comparing meters makes everything super stressfull.. also as dps.. something gets pulled? You need to instantly attack to dont fall behind no matter if you should normally drink a little bit in case it gets tuff. I hate meters for that reason they suck the fun out of it since everybody needs to be on 10000% efficency all the time. They also dont care if you are good player or not, they just care what damage/heals you have done. Like you kited the whole fight like a god and made the group not wipe? Guess what you are now super behind in the meters.
---
The only reason when they do good imho is if your guild really has problems and you try to at least get a hang of what is going wrong. But other than that? Fuck them!
---
Fishing isn't really mandatory, but nice if you can be arsed to keep it up. Will slow your lvling down so isn't really worth it
---
Kael'Thas was the Guild destroyer in TBC. Vashj was hard, but Kael'Thas REALLY showed you who the trash players in your guild were. There were so many nights of shit-flinging, pissed off people, wasted hours gathering consumables, and as soon as it came time for the legendary weapons to drop and the loot distribution all hell broke loose. People would loot stuff they weren't supposed to, tanks would mis-time the spell damage absorbtion on the shield, people would swim into the environmental damage when KT flipped gravity... what a nightmare. And you HAD to kill him. You couldn't get into Hyjal without his attunement item. And you had to do it multiple times if your guild had 5-10 extras benched for spare raid slots. 
---
Pandaria-babies have NO idea what it was like to go through all that only to have sub-par garbage drop that was inferior to 2 weeks of pvping in arena.
---
It’s on my mind all the time, it’s driving me crazy!!! I need this in my life lol
---
I've been struggling with this myself. On one hand I wanna play the dwarf pally I started with and clear all the content I didn't get the chance to. On the other hand, even back then, I hated healing lol and loved watching my friend play fury warrior.... I think I'm playing fury warrior.
---
probably. Pretty funny in all honesty.
---
Good catch.
---
Rep is only giving 10% at honoured and is working correctly on beta.
---
&gt; If your internet can run it, buy it. It not, don’t.
---
i'm don't think your internet's capability should be the only reason you do or don't buy it
---
That wasn't my point at all. Griefing ≠ Besting. I support and even joy PVP. But just like Twitter/Facebook, toxic behaviors aren't just easy they're encouraged (by comments like this one)
---
You needed Keys for the Heroic dungeons back in TBC. And those were Revered reputation and upwards only on release. It got only lowered to Honored later on and finally removed as a requirement.
---
So, if you didn't do dailies you couldn't enter some/all heroic dungeons at all.
---
You don't get to 32min BWL clears by inviting moonkins for the hell of it.
---
If the guilds bring something like a ret pala or feral dps on one of these runs, it's because they're exceptional players who will tryhard and utilize their class mechanics enough to not be d e a d w e i g h t.
---
Honestly I wouldn't mind a phone app coming out for basic tasks like gathering stuff and doing AH stuff. Could make downtime more fun
---
Oh gee. Let's see now...
---
Dwarfs - +5 Gun skill... Too bad best ranged weapon is a bow. Meaningless.
---
Humans - +5 maces &amp; +5 swords. Formula for weapon skill gives you a 0.04% improvement per point. So those 5 points gives you 0.20%. Is it better than nothing? Yes. Is it significant? No.
---
Orc - +5 axe. Somehow I don't think the 0.20% is gonna be any better for Orcs and it was for humans. Still insignificant.
---
Conclusion. If you want to min/max, sure, pay attention to the racials. But overall, they're going to be insignificant in the overall scheme of things. So play whatever race you find the most enjoyable to play.
---
&gt; Flying didn’t “take you out of the world;” it took you above it.
---
That's tantamount to "out of it" in an MMO.
---
&gt; Dailies were also a natural progression.
---
They are a lazy, inorganic form of content that made playing the game feel like a chore you had to do every day.
---
&gt; And Badges are a natural evolution as well.
---
A shamelessly inorganic one.  Seems to be a trend in TBC's design.
---
Yeah it's not +3% hit though the rest is correct. Pretty sure a single point of weapon skill is 0.2% hit. Though it also reduces chance to be parried or dodged but that only matters for tanks or melee stupid enough to attack from the front.
---
Damn dude, you know how things work and you know how to explain them. Bravo!
---
Lol there was a post earlier people saying ele shaman is just as good as healer as resto and I got about 125 downvotes because I said ele shaman isnt a healer. bahahah. People were convinced ret pallys could heal. This community is hilarious
---
They definitely won’t kick you because finding a tank is hard lol.
---
Right, but it would make a lot more sense to go after the software that enables multiboxing.  Saying you can own multiple accounts but if you were to party together or follow each other you'll get banned.  Now that effects people who just want to play with their spouse or relatives and typing /follow becomes a violation of ToS, which I'm sure we could agree would be absolutely insane.
---
Now if you go after the software, not you're going after anyone with a logitech keyboard capable of doing one for one inputs.  You're banning people who have disabilities (like Swify who has a missing finger), people who rebind keys with autohotkey, people who have keystroke emulators for productivity completely unrelated to WoW.  I'd have to buy a new keyboard and could no longer rebind my alt, shit, and control modifiers to my mouse etc.  You'd have to download a Blizzard software scanner that looks through your computer and bans you like anti-cheat for having keystroke emulators installed/running.
---
So which part in the chain do we make against ToS to break multiboxing?  You can no longer play with your relatives or you can no longer rebind keys and emulate keystrokes?  Those things effect just about everyone.
---
There will be cat druids. It will just be what they do when they aren't off tanking as bear.
---
Honestly (imo) League of Legends did more to kill this game than any of the stuff you listed.  Since that game came on line they've sapped current and future wow players.  They even managed to take Greg Street (Ghostcrawler) from us.  
---
We can talk about what in game killed WoW but a shift in gaming culture to freemium and mobile games did more damage than flight.  What would have been new wow players didn't have to get their parents to give them $15 / month to play, they could literally play as much LoL, DotA and mobile games for free.
---
Just my 2 cents
---
Edit: also MMOs are "out" in gaming right now.  Mid 90s through 10s they were king.  For the most part gamers don't play MMOs. Really only WoW and Final Fantasy have survived and have done so mostly on franchise name.
---
 So on a PVE server you can make toons of BOTH factions? I didn't know that. That's interesting, thank you.
---
“THEY’RE ONLY COSMETIC!”
---
Donated mine years ago, now regret it.
---
But this isn't even remotely true.
---
Compare a fury warrior or rogue to a balance druid or enhancement shaman in any raid tier.
---
Not the dude you replied to and Idk all the details but it's pretty easy to realize the difference between a good hunter and a bad one, especially in PVP.
---
I look forward to the 2 day matches in AV. lol
---
I think I've been Moonfiring wrong.
---
Goonies never say die: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZeAH5QV7Ig
---
My first experience with wow was in the middle of Legion so it’s safe to say I’m really excited to try out a new  mmo! Atleast thats the information I’ve gathered the last few weeks, that it’ll be a completely different experience
---
Ya I was just making a joke about ferals not getting invites because nobody knows what feral dps is lol.
---
I'm not even saying they aren't a thing I'm just being silly.
---
Lol no. A Human using Swords or Maces and an Orc using Axes against a raid boss has:
---
* plus 3.0% to-hit
---
* plus 0.2% to-crit
---
* plus 20% damage on glancing blows (40% of all white attacks)
---
* minus 0.5% to-be-dodged
---
* minus 0.5% to-be-blocked
---
* minus 8.0% to-be-parried
---
Learn to math.
---
Resilience and Blood Elves were also devastating to pvp and faction balance
---
 [https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-addons/](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-addons/)
---
Oh Kid, not sure if serious or just completely retarded. Use your brain, kid.
---
You can say the same thing about a lot of Vanilla content.  Quests with a 1% drop chance should just be 100%.  Quests to kill X mobs are lazy quests.  Reputations that require you to just grind to Exalted or to farm dozens of hours for cloth are lazy as well.
---
Players will always outpace the amount of content that the developers can create.  They have to find some way to gate some things, and to keep players playing.  Do a few daily quests and then go grind breaks up the monotony.
---
the reason is people are picky. You can get everything done if the players are fine. You can have a paladin tank, druid heal and so on. Maybe not in super late game but everything is possible. You dont need to min max at all. But once people KNOW whats best they want that.
---
Theres another game I play, leauge of legends. Every champion in that game is strong and can win the game. But as soon as something is nerfed, doestn matter who small or whatever, or the champion is not meta at the moment, people will bitch about it. People are playing 10 times better with the champ they always play, doestn matter if it does 5 damage less now. But people think its better that you play something thats meta right now because they think what you play is shit. 
---
If there is a "best" way to do something people will always complain if you are not offering the best version. If you have a nice guild however it will not matter at all in the end.
---
Clearly you didnt play Vanilla.
---
In vanilla, people tanked in Arms spec. In vanilla, MS was OP and both blood thirst and shield slam had to be buffed in later patches and MS nerfed.
---
So how can you say it will be just like Vanilla? We arent even on the same patch that most remember from Vanilla. Parry may or may not ruin these other specs. Stop pretending you know better. You dont know shit.
---
Can you give any good reason why prot would be the only viable spec?
---
I just don’t wanna farm 20hrs for a patter that won’t be in the loot table
---
that's not what carried means
---
LOVE Goldshire too!
---
This vastly underestimates the volume of shared / wasted drops. It's especially bad before set tokens in Mc and Bwl.
---
This is my thought too. I was not in vanilla (started in Wrath) but everyone in my old guilds always talked about half the raids being extremely "basic" and really just there for roll call. This is why I don't understand everyone's fear of not having enough of x,y,or z.  If it was doable with garbage players 14 years ago why would it not be doable with decent players on worse specs now?  It cant be both harder and easier, can it?  If the overall player base has improved I have to assume someplace in all this math at least 1 person will be aloud to play a boomkin, or enh shaman, or shadow priest/warlock preNaxx.  IDK.
---
I was really bad back then
---
I want wow veterans to play and friends of wow veterans who had to put up with all the vanilla talk over the years. That’s about it.
---
Dude it comes down to why you enjoy playing...I’ll be playing a fury warrior...longest grind to 60, no raid spots unless you swap to prot. Whatever you enjoy playing man
---
Ratchet is my favorite city in vanilla, if i'm going to be honest.
---
Can't wait to see asmongold respond to it
---
Yes sir. If you’re not stealthed it’s gonna be a barrage of shots concussion sting mark and a pet chewing dicks off.  :)
---
Whoosh
---
Wow interesting stuff dude, was surprised warlocks and mages are the same. Mages have so much downtime and warlocks barely have any so, was surprising to see. Priest winning isn't shocking though, spirit tap OP.
---
I'll allow it.
---
Do you know what Ignite does? Why dp you think it does not matter? Nightfall is 15% more dps from every single caster. Why is that not important?
---
I mean, no reason you can't replace the touchscreen laptop with a 2in1 device like a Surface Pro or whatever. There would probably be a drop in performance, but unless you are raiding like this (please don't), it's likely negligible. 
---
I've also used steam in-home streaming to stream WoW to my laptop from my desktop before while I did.. stuff. It worked great. No loss in performance but there was a slight latency increase (negligible for what I was doing at the time though).
---
It is 3% to hit. https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/bug-hit-tables/185675/32 The first +5 skill gives much more +hit than any +skill after it because there are two formulas depending on whether your weapon skill and the mob's defense skill is greater than 10 or 10 or less.
---
A Human using Swords or Maces and an Orc using Axes against a raid boss has:
---
&gt; saying that the TBC features were the reason that this game is in its current state is totally wrong.
---
Some objective facts about TBC:  
---
- Even though it began with attunements, they were all essentially removed later in the expansion and they never came back. Sunwell was the first major raid to not have an attunement.  
---
Almost all of these shitty design decisions remain in retail to this day, or gave way to other equally shitty mechanics that replaced them.
---
Is TBC to blame for all of what makes retail a tattered shell of a game today?  No.  Was it a major contributor?  You bet.
---
What is with you people and having 'progression' under your top priority when it comes to raiding... let alone your entire existence for the game.  Honestly, I do feel sorry for people who treat the game like this, you are truly missing out on a lot.
---
Who says most guilds will even WANT to be pushing progression?  You do understand it is possible to just be in a guild with people you enjoy being around, and then going into the raids you are able to do and have fun in them correct?  
---
&gt;If your goal is anything beyond bantz with the boys in a raid environment, you shouldn't put that much effort into fixing other people's mistakes unless they're a close IRL friend or something.
---
If your goal is just progression I think you may need to bring that mentality over to /r/wow.  What's so wrong with teaching someone or giving them pointers to be a better player instead of just outright ditching them?  Honestly that's such a shitty mentality I hope to never be apart of any of your groups.  I have pushed progression back in the day, I use to clear all 'current' content from Vanilla&gt;Wrath, and I have gotten gladiator in multiple seasons of the game, and I have done it all without having that shit mentality of if someone is bad you just remove them.  I was in raids that actually were patient with people and taught them what to do as long as they showed up, and I have arena'd with only friends and worked together to get the ratings we ended up maxing out at.
---
If you're just recruiting to fit the 'goal' you have set in mind, then that just makes you a shitty player IMO.  Anyone can stack their roster.  Not everyone can actually help people and learn with them to push through obstacles.
---
Druid can solo anything as well, as long as it's outdoors.
---
Before launch date, I aspire to accomplish the following:
---
Get in the best shape of my life
---
Finish reading two books
---
Finish all my TV series 
---
Run a half marathon
---
Join a yoga group
---
Quit a yoga group 
---
Learn to prep cook for server launch
---
how will they have 12k people in the zone at one time?  
---
They (server engineers) know the limits of the servers and when the limit +1 person attempts to log in they are placed in a queue.  Once the limit population - 1 is achieved the next person in the queue is allowed in.  
---
It is common sense if you want to use your head.  If you want to throw your arms up in the air and say the sky is falling, I guess you get more karma that way?
---
what version did you get? one of the denoised ones or the original?
---
When you put it that way it doesn't seem so bad.
---
Your opinion is bad and you should feel bad.
---
You’re as worse as DOOP
---
Imagine taking talents for ganking lowbies.
---
Lowbie ganking specialist.
---
IN MY ROOM BROO!!!11!!1!
---
4 hours a day minimum IS no lifing the game If you have a full time job.
---
Lol I remember doing this when I needed respec money. Me and a paladin or druid buddy would get half the gold up front from a rando, get them to 1800 and get the second half of the gold once we hit the rating. Sometimes you'd find a good pvper that just didn't have the friend network and it was easy, other times you'd basically be 2v3ing decent teams. 
---
Also, F the rogue/frost mage/disc priest makeup.
---
I agree so some degree, it definitely makes it mythical or whatever. 
---
But kind of falsely so, like the stat that only 1% of players cleared it. 
---
Part of why so few did, was that tbc came too soon after, and people couldn't be arsed to farm consumables for 3 hours a day to be able to raid a place that was becoming absolete in a couple months.
---
I know some elite guilds today might not even need that many consumables, but they will surely require you to have them anyways.
---
oh word I thought he meant just for playing from lvl 1-8 haha
---
i think everyone should stfu and just have fun doing what you wanna do.   
---
raiding and end-game content isn't the end-all, be-all of WoWs fun.
---
You're utterly dense
---
4,486,666 global cooldowns
---
Dampen is really handy solo. Takes the edge off a lot of caster mobs and can straight up negate some elementals (I recall with the max rank of it some of the fire eles in un'goro just didn't do damage to my mage since their normal attacks were also magic damage).
---
&gt; I expect most of them to quit before their 30 day subscription runs out.
---
You'll find spots playing anything if you're a good/dedicated player.
---
But your spec will be an instant turn-off to 99% of players outside of 5mans, unless you have a reputation - and you'll need to know the right people to get the SOLE spriest spot in a 40man raid.
---
For boomkin, you'd need to find a guild desperate for players to fill their raid, and convince them that you know what you're doing.
---
Tri-spec (for Silence) is a good PVP spec so just max Shadow Weaving instead of whatever else may have used some of those points.
---
You lose out on a bunch of the mana efficiency of a fully raid-specced priest but your actual raw healing ability is unchanged. Just may use a few more mana pots.
---
Because off tanking demands different things than main tanking. Sometimes you will be tanking a second mob, sometimes trying to stay second threat on a boss, sometomes just doing dps. The main tank usually is always just tanking something while the off tank has more diverse duties.
---
Yes hello. I was pretty active on the forums and well known on emerald dream back in classic. Wish we could just recreate that realm.
---
It was vanilla-- for everything except class balance.
---
For some reason this has excited me more than anything I've seen, think it reminds me of attempting my own drawings and looking in the Brady strategy guide as a kid. You've got me by the nostalgia now!
---
I wish I could see this man's face when he learns about Twin Emps. Will be like a child on Christmas.
---
Now, it's been quite a while since I raided but there was always a shaman in the caster group(s), there was no need to take take one away from the melee group.
---
Even without mana tide you straight up lose 10% healing done from purification and someone has to spec healing way. If your guild is a "top guild" who expects people to grind, the guild might very well see it fit to expect you to spec optimal as well. Consider yourself lucky to be able to play 30/0/21.
---
Yeah you can hit pets and they'll break cc for you.. which is the instance I would think someone wouldn't see a use, PvP. Understandable.
---
Do people think it's useless in PvE? Jesus.
---
I'm in need of some karma
---
fuck trump!
---
Winning isnt a static level. If everyone else is dramatically out preforming you and if they had a player at their own level, they would do better. By virtue of you being the worst memeber in the raid, even if you hit minimum dps checks, you bring down the quality of the raid. 
---
If your dps is 3, and your guild's DPS on average is 5, by virtue of your 3 existing, even if the content requires a 3, drags down the clear compared to having someone with a 5 in your slot.
---
That said, I still believe hybrids can be competitive dps, but you cant be complacent and expect to be carried doing bare minimum meeting dps checks in a guild that has you outclassed player for player.
---
IE a win ranking might be a 4 without you, or a 3.9 with you.
---
where do you see 1.13 on this website?
---
keep in mind wow classic on august 27th is 1.13
---
People need to stop lumping feral in with oomkin, dps shams, and ret. It's actually really nice to have a feral off tank in raids. It just takes a lot of skill, so a lot that you do not represent how good they really are.
---
IMO vanilla was the pinnacle.  TBC is a distant second.
---
A totally different _mobile_ game.
---
You can actually level as the ele resto hybrid and be pretty efficient.  The thing is, most of your damage will come from Flametongue Weapon and Searing totem.  
---
Lightning bolt to pull, earth shock to interrupt if necessary, seating totem, then stab them to death with your dagger.  You will exit the 5 second rule and regen a decent amount of mana to repeat.
---
If your goal is to lightning bolt mobs down from 100-0, that isn't going to be fun while leveling.
---
I cannot find anything you just stated in the specific post you linked, just the part about the 1% of hit being ignored if you have more than 10 less weapon skill than the targets defense. Which isn't getting a 1% to hit so much as allowing any + to hit to work. But still, that would be 2% gained if you have any +hit stats.
---
People are hyperdefensive.
---
When there's a joke about feral druids, you'll see twenty angry people in the comments.
---
I remember my friends telling me I had to leave the Barrens to continue leveling.  I loved the xroads and all the raid that rolled in, even when I couldn't do much.
---
Great plan, just need to ignore the fact you get no honor after killing the same person 5 times in a row.
---
Out of the classes you listed, I would say mage is easiest to go back and forth between PvE and PvP. Maybe also consider hunter.
---
You absolutely can! One of the players from our rival horde guild almost got gkicked for showing up at a world boss with our guild on his alliance character, even though this was at like 4 AM and the horde side couldn’t have pooled enough raiders if they invited from different guilds (which that guild was categorically against). He was given the choice to gquit from our guild or get kicked from his horde main guild. He was only in our guild as a social, and it being an emerald dragon we needed some abled bodies ourselves, they found out it was him because he just swapped 2 letters from his name.
---
There were other ways to get those keys, such as non-daily quests leading up to the dungeon, or else farming the dungeons themselves.  There were no dailies to get rep with the Bronze Dragonflight for the Caverns of Time heroics, for example.  You had to grind Durnholde and Black Morass.
---
Even if you did unlock the heroic with dailies, it's not like dailies in Mists of Pandaria, that you HAD to do every day for the entire expansion.  You just had to do the dailies until you were Revered, and then they were optional after that.  If you weren't planning on doing that Heroic yet, then putting off getting Revered wasn't a big deal (whereas in Legion, if you put off getting Artifact Power, you're behind by however long you didn't do the dailies).
---
&gt; I'll probably roll a dice before release.
---
You'll probably end up rolling all 3, lets be honest now
---
Chances are the quests you know aren't the ones you'll see anyway. I would suggest just enjoy it and don't worry about not knowing the quests. That's how you really get the Vanilla experience. The complete lack of knowledge of where anything is.
---
You could always just have your bank alt scan the AH.. and then DE when on a boat or other downtime.. if you are doing dungeons you can do it while waiting on others to get to the entrance portal.. etc.
---
Why should a well-designed MMO need catch-up mechanics in the first place?  If your rate of vertical progression is so extreme that you require catch up mechanics, maybe address the underlying cause instead?
---
&gt;Are you new to raiding or..:
---
Just talking from my experience raiding in vanilla.
---
Ah ok :) o.O Have a good day!
---
Getting enough rep to run heroics was pretty easy, the standard quest chains got you almost all the way there. The only dailies I remember running was the flying ones in terokar and blades edge, and that was because they were easy and funded my repair bill as a prot warrior.
---
I can hear the music playing right now. Oh by the way has anyone seen Mankrik’s wife? I heard she’s somewhere in the Great Sea.
---
4str 4 Stam leather belt! AAAAAHH UHHHH OHHHHHH!!
---
I did say in my original post you might have one for the caster group. Again though as I keep saying. The reason why guilds expect you to farm the consumes isn't to let a shammy play a meme spec. It's to make sure the shammy never has to leave the melee group.
---
Top guilds don't think in "if" the raid is going down. These are old simple well understood raids. They think in "how fast is this raid going to go down". So slowing the raid even by a little is pretty frowned upon. I've seen a pre-bis raid clear MC in 45 minutes. I'm pretty sure thats not even a record either.
---
If you click on the ghostweave belt it says it’s added 1.13. Also thanks you for the clarification!
---
Nothing you said makes using the term "carried" correct, it just proves a completely different point. 
---
Like you are moving further and further away almost to convince yourself at this point. 
---
No matter what, you are not carrying someone to victory if they could achieve it without you just because you play better than them.
---
While i know beta is probably not as accurate as launch will be.  But there were people buying greens and mats off the AH on day 1 of the beta.. a 6 slot bag from a vendor is 5s.. and i sold a couple on day 1 for 4s.. \*shrug\* maybe people didn't care about their money because of the level 30 cap.. or maybe there will be a lot more casual style people willing to buy stuff off the AH right away?
---
Looks like it dropped as early as 1.8. That means they should drop at launch right?
---

Subject: "both belt and gloves"
---
&gt; Both recipes for ghostweave belt and ghostweave gloves dropped by one mob in azshara - ruins of eldrath.  
---
I have never seen these recipes on sale though, maybe the drop rate is rare.
---
you will bring one priest for shadow weaving but the boomkin isnt worth it.  you would do more raid damage bringing another lock or mage
---
Lol dude all of wowhead says 1.13 that’s not the actual patches for the items
---
This, OP.  At about Level 30, you'll have access to:
---
* 3/3 Frostbite
---
* 5/5 Ice Shards
---
* 5/5 Shatter
---
These will greatly increase your efficiency.

First honorbot at work.
---
In terms of PvE, I'm entirely optimistic that Blizzard can "bring it back" next expansion. I think BFA's reaction has drilled into Blizzard's collective heads that class fantasy is VERY important - tier sets, class-themed quests, all of this stuff is vital to the experience of the game. Tanks need to feel meaty and proactive with their mitigation, healers need the ability to proactively deal with threats, and DPS need to feel like they're bringing unique utility to the table rather than strictly DPS - classes are always going to be stacked at the top level so it is fool's errand to try to make every class the same, what is important is whether you feel like the character you chose matters. 
---
As far as PvP though... eh. Raid-centric design have infiltrated the game on every conceivable level. WoW is raiding now. Raid-or-die was bad in vanilla WoW but at least they tried to accommodate PvP. BC was a great leap forward with stuff like Cloak of Shadows or Shadowstep added to Rogue - you could tell that the PvP team had an honest say in the direction of the game. Now? PvP is an afterthought. Not once would you ever hear the lead PvP designer able to veto a decision from the raid team because it conflicted with the PvP meta, PvP is really just there "because" at this point. Warcraft thematically still hits the "war" notes but in terms of game design it isn't important. Like you even mentioned, Warfronts, what should be the PvP war, is a PvE event. 
---
I don't want to sound too ranty about it, but eh. I don't think Blizzard can do anything to make me care about PvP without firing Ion Hazzikostas and bringing in someone who cares about PvP into the lead game designer role. When you look at the talent during the "classic age" of WoW, you had talented PvP-focused directors coming in from Starcraft, from Warcraft 3, these games were PvP masterpieces and they were bringing that passion into World of Warcraft, fighting to keep World of Warcraft a game where PvP mattered. Over the course of the years these guys left and no one with any real pull who cared about the War part of Warcraft remained. Think about this - right now World of Warcraft is run by a guy who only cares about raiding and whose only experience in design was working as part of the raid team. Peter Principle in full effect here - he was not equipped to handle this project, and WoW PvP can't be salvaged until he's gone.
---
Thanks for the kind words!
---
Its very easy to pull of with a macro. Its basically the same macro you use for trap. It goes soemthing like this: ( i dont know the commands anymore its been 14 years, but you get the idea)
---
/pet passive
---
/cast feign death
---
/cast shadowmeld (or frost trap or whatever)
---
You just spam this macro since it cant do all this things at once but since feign death is on cooldown it will do the next thing. I used it all the time in vanilla (as i said i dont know macro commands anymore, thats more like an example) and it worked fine!
---
1.13 wasn't an original patch in vanilla, it's the name for the classic patch, which is 1.12 + some exploit fixes.
---
I was thinking about tanking as a warlock actually.
---
I tanked heroics in BC as a warlock for the memes. Obviously in high end pvp gear but it was fun nontheless.
---
Honestly, if you were to spend any time in /r/DestinyTheGame you'd see that it's the people who don't like to PvP that are generally the toxic ones. The more PvP-oriented people generally just want to play the whole game, and those who don't like it can be quite vocal.
---
I don't mind if you or anyone else wants to play on a PvE server. Not everyone likes to engage in PvP, whether it's ad-hoc or something they queue up for.
---
Personally I'll play on a PvP server because one of the things I realized I missed when playing destiny was the feeling of being at-risk while out in the world doing your every day stuff. I also like large-scale world PvP, which I think is only likely to happen on a PvP server.
---
Usually no demo shout or curse of weakness memes, only rarely thunder clap tbh.  Imp shadowbolt is big, judge of light on a few bosses like loatheb sapph, maybeeee judge of wisdom for t1 clears early? you need a second debuff for the spriest, as they need either swp or mind flay debuff to even stack shadow weaving. also the rest are filled with corruption slots from your nightfall warlocks, and maybe one more for imp expose armor if the classic interaction does not drop sunder stacks off the target, just overrides the effect because its stronger
---
So only one ISB debuff can be active on a target? And any ISB proc refreshes the count, regardless of which Warlock triggers it?
---
Heres some examples off the top of my head.   
---
\-TBC netherwing 
---
\-TBC heroics  
---
\-Cata firelands   
---
\-Arena  when weekly caps were in though they put a band aid on this eventually with the catch up point accumulation
---
There's a plethora more , but the point is the more toward retail you go the more time gated content got so that more people wouldn't feel left in the dust and the more sub #'s dropped.
---
Do you like different shades of yellow and orange?
---
If you have a ping of 50, you're going to get a frame time of 25ms. That's 40 fps. Console players are good with below 30... 
---
&gt;you see everything you do instantly without latency 
---
Yes and no. You see everything (at least in recent games), but the server still has a fixed tick rate (which hardly ever goes beyond 30).
---
yepp
---
For slightly different reasons, at least for the former. Razorgore was a mechanically difficult fight.
---
&gt; VW has an AOE taunt actually.
---
It's actually an AoE threat ability. It does not force the target to attack the VW, it is just an ability with high threat.
---
Honor decay simply means that you need to play more to progress. 
---
Honor DR means that probably you won't be ganked by the same ranking team more than 10 times, it's a good point actually.
---
Mainly because of early days of WSG. Barrens chat as we know it today wouldn't exist if it weren't for pre-battlemaster BG's
---
Yeah I’m seeing that now. I was so confused. Now I just look like an idiot haha
---
I leveled my Druid alt just for mining and herbing
---
"Sounds exactly like I remember it" is NOT flexing, and you're delusional to think so.
---
Not if they’re grinding mobs to level.
---
&gt; Funny enough, flying, dailies and badge gear is what I loved most about TBC and is probably the only reason WoW maintained its place as the top MMO.
---
WoW was the top MMO because vanilla had generated a huge amount of momentum by the time TBC was released.  All Blizzard had to do is not screw up too bad and it would've kept growing regardless.  Basically, TBC was handed success on a silver platter.
---
The things you mentioned are things that detract from it as an _MMO_ in my opinion.
---
Definitely a possibility as well, I think it is nice though that they shouldn’t have to purchase anything other than a subscription to play classic. I know a number of my friends have been turned off of playing retail over the years because they don’t feel like purchasing a sub and the latest expansion to play current content.
---
Well warriors can wear cloth etc. so it doesn't matter that the plate exists. The debuff is applied to the target, not the caster, so you could definitely do some raid healing. But the real problem is that the bandage cast breaks as soon as the target takes any damage.
---
in vanilla you could get a full cast off before leaving stealth. So for example if you where in shadowmeld you could cast aimshot completly in stealth, then imidiatly auto and multi shot before your enemy could even react to this. If you got an opener like this it was a nearly sure win.
---
They however also changed it in vanilla to not work this way anymore and I have no Idea if 1.12 will still have it.
---
That's because you have to also look up the hit formulas for weapon skill.
---
&gt; If the difference between the mob's Defense Skill and your Weapon Skill is less than or equal to 10 then the formula for calculating your base miss chance against that mob is: 
---
    5% + (Defense Skill - Weapon Skill)*.1%
---
&gt; If the difference between the mob's Defense Skill and your Weapon Skill is greater than 10, then the formula for calculating your base miss chance against that mob is: 
---
    6% + (Defense Skill - Weapon Skill - 10)*.4%
---
So at 305, your base miss chance is 6%.
---
And at 300, your base miss chance is 8%.
---
But now you add the 1% that Blizzard clarified and we all understood through data (just not the why) and you get to the magic number of 3% difference.
---
But I think that's kind of the point. It takes a LOT more work and a LOT more skill to do something, in most cases, that is inferior to a Warrior who doesn't need as much work.
---
It just begs the question: why? I understand, from the person wanting to play Feral, why. But why would a guild with semi-serious raiding intentions take one?
---
Feral is really good in WPvP, Dungeons, and certain fights. They can make a decent OT. But, as a whole, it's inferior.
---
I firmly believe that people should play what they want and let the cards fall. They'll find something and there will be groups out there that are ok with it. I guess I just get a little "peeved" that people try to push certain specs as "viable" when in fact... they aren't. Feral is probably the only exception to the "memespecs", as you put it. The gap between Feral and Warrior is a lot smaller than others, so if any can make it work, it would be Feral, I suppose.
---
Yeah, you will definitely get side tracked pretty easy.  Hillsbrad can similarly devolve into a zone wide cluster. 
---
That said, I can imagine in the early going it will be similar to current expansions where people just wanna level up and will largely avoid too much conflict.  I think from BC to BFA I can count the number of times on my one hand that I have ganked while leveling.  It usually happens to very low levels or max levels roaming in groups killing 1 or two of the same level.
---
If your group is achieving a win at the level where a player could not reach in a group of 40 players of their own level, you are carrying a player. Seeing the kill isnt the only thing that matters, often times logs, parses, kill times, etc matter a lot too.
---
because racial abilities scale with your gear and starting stats have basically zero effect past level 20.  E.g. Tauren v Troll.  Do you get 10% of your 500 hp per 5 while you are below 100% health?  Do you pick 5% of 5000 health as an extra buffer?  Versus Do you get a troll with 1 more agi which is 1/53 crit or tauren with 1 more stam which is 10 hp? (don't know numbers but assuming trolls have agi and tauren have stamina.)
---
&gt;Those people rushing out to beat the dead horse of "what about this meme spec" are doing a public service to help new players have a good experience by not setting themselves up for failure from the get-go.
---
This is a fair argument and an excellent point. It's about setting realistic expectations for new and uninformed players.
---
Blizzard's current stance of "bring the player, not the class" and their persuit of class homigenization developed because performance of some classes/specs were so far behind the baseline of others.
---
The man himself! Thank you very much for all of your hard work on these wonderful worlds and stories.
---
Journey before Destination
---
Enchanting (de only) and alchemy on a 45 warlock is probably best for hardcore players - otherwise a level 5 de banker is best.
---
Yeah that sounds like a safe method. Maybe not grinding dungeons but grinding in the previous zone for a couple of levels so I’m ahead for the next zone.
---
I think dailies were still problematic in TBC, they are problematic by their very nature. They encourage logging on to do a time-gated chore, and logging back off which is the essence of modern WoW. Don't spend enough time in-game to really get invested. Anyone will get their rewards as long as they keep subscribing and logging in at regular intervals. 
---
Vanilla WoW has huge time sinks, but you split them how you want, which to me keeps it from feeling like clocking in and out of a job. 10 hours one day, 0 the next? No problem. It's like the difference between a normal game, and a mobile game like Clash of Clans. Isle of Quel Danas was when I first began feeling burnt out in WoW.
---
If you look closely, you can see me getting killed by harpies.
---
Pretty easy money from tips for resses.  1-2g per res would add up fast if a healer just went out on ambulance runs.
---
Yes, Hit = Not resist for a caster and Hit = Not miss for melee and ranged physical.
---
How is that hard to understand?
---
I've played since open beta and I think TBC is worse than vanilla in every way except class balance.
---
Is Stolen Silver bugged?
---
Also from the guide
---
&gt;The hard part about gearing a Druid in vanilla is how our itemisation works, we have awesome, excellent scaling, but awful gear options. Most Druid players gear like a Rogue, play like a Rogue, then wonder why their DPS is awful, hence perpetuating the 'lol druid feral dps is awful' stereotype.
---
&gt; We only gain 1 AP per point of Agility.
---
WE ONLY GAIN 1 AP PER POINT OF AGILITY.
---
&gt; Similar to Shamans, we get all of our AP from Strength and +AP items. While a certain amount of Agility is desirable for crit (and Agi is usually on any piece of leather with strength on any way) we want to try and ensure a 2:1 ratio of Strength to Agility for DPS.
---
And then further along
---
&gt; Kitty: Hit &gt; Str &gt; Agility &gt; Crit &gt; AP  
---
If anything the first quote about 33.3% crit being some incredible break points seems likely pulled out of thin air and given what the stats actually do stacking strength is always better (definitely for levelling where you don't even get the crit talent early and you rely less on finishers anyway).
---
 I am currently looking for a couple of officers for our guild. We are a semi-hardcore Alliance guild aiming at a PvP server. Please message me if you are interested in being an officer and helping with recruitment. Our guild is in its infancy (11 members currently at time of post) and needs some more help besides myself.
---
You seem to consider your perspective to be universally correct.
---
Progression doesn't mean "tryhard" - it means that you're trying to progress in the raid you're tackling, which is what the vast majority of guilds do. It's what gives your players gear, and the satisfaction comes from this incremental progress.
---
Plenty of people love the social aspect of raiding - but for people like me and most others, it's within the framework of having goals to achieve in the form of killing bosses, completing raids, competing with your friends, or for the really tryhard people - improving times.
---
I deliberately appealed to the ultra-casual view of raiding in the second part of the post you replied to, saying that you obviously don't need to worry about anything at all if you don't care about killing bosses. The replacement of players not pulling their own weight, and the perspective of a raider's value matter at least in some degree to people raiding to achieve certain goals.
---
By the way, I have my doubts that you've cleared Naxx, Sunwell or have multiple gladiator title with your mindset. Do you have any proof? It sure would help your credibility.
---
As a healer, I would totally be down with this. 
---
I also support shaman tanking. FOR THE HORDE!
---
&gt; The issue really is that Blizz took control on how fast I could achieve something. 
---
So you oppose raid lock-outs then? Because Blizzard controls how many times you can farm Molten Core in a week?
---
I knew the music before the video even started!!!!
---
I think healer balance was just pretty bad. As a restoration druid I had a blast healing those dungeons, since I didn't have as much mana problems as other healers.
---
Oh my! I've never done a single macro in my live. I will need to learn that for sure! I saw that the best way to manage the pet is by alwayes keep him passive and only controlling by using macros, need to make those too.
---
awww that's adorable you think that
---
Take my upvote!
---
Of course Twin Emps, but I was thinking about getting that blue set that gives you tons of armor and stam and tanking 5 mans for the memes.
---
I tanked heroics in BC for the memes as SL/SL warlock and it was hilarious. Obviously there I used high end pvp gear overgearing the place by a lot I guess but still good memes.
---
Thats impossible
---
Mine are similar but it wasnt the leveling up in Dun Morogh, it was me and my brothers and level 30 or so making it to Dun Morogh to kill low level Gnomes. It was the Gnome Punt Hunt.
---
Yet another reason Horde&gt;Ally
---
Hi, /u/xcoatsyx
---
Oh, this brings back memories. I had completely forgotten about this :D
---
You just keep trying to tell yourself that man, ok.
---
You will always have to drink, you may get to a point where you can squeeze in another mob or two before you drink but you will never be able to chain pull like a hunter and hell, even they have to drink every once in a while.
---
Why? Yours is so much lvls dumber. This is just disrespectfull.
---
Private servers make it simpler. They rely on player reports and investigation. Simple /follow is very easy to distinguish from alt-tab multiboxing and from keyclone multiboxing.
---
Same with botting, same with account sharing. All these rules require a lot of manual work to enforce.
---
I mean just look in this thread.
---
Racial abilities are much more important
---
"WoW Classic is a grind!!!"
---
"Grinding is a chore"
---
Make up your mind guys
---
but does everyone think retail is bad, or just reddit? Number of subscriptions would have to have fallen dramatically with the latest expansion.
---
Hang out by crossroads? Oh, you mean getting ganked by  high level alliance?
---
The barrens of classic is all about the social environment and the chat (which you might love or will piss you off). 
---
Some of my fondest WoW memories have come from there, but the zone itself is so fucking huge and I hated leveling there.  For other characters I would purposely try and avoid it.
---
Sweet, delicious pain.
---
wf lingers 9 sec, manatide has 10sec duration, thats 1 sec downtime on wf and 4 free mana pots for your priests. sure, if you have most raids on farm and are not progressing ele is fine, but you are really gimping your healing potential. no heal interrupt, no healing way, no improved toteams, 10% worse healing in general and no option to tankheal.
---
&gt; You can say the same thing about a lot of Vanilla content. Quests with a 1% drop chance should just be 100%. 
---
&gt; Reputations that require you to just grind to Exalted or to farm dozens of hours for cloth are lazy as well.
---
We'll have to agree to disagree then.
---
Yeah, the novelty made them seem cool but they were not good for the game at any point. Even before flying in the old world was introduced, TBC and WotLK feel less like actual, real places because of how flying disconnects you from the game world.
---
I usually liked to kill gankers
---
there are a lot of players that pve in order to pvp.  They are good players, but they would rather spend time in BGs.  They will not spend hours out side of raids to farm up consumables or change their talent specs 5 nights of the week.  They will do the minimum like bring 5-10 mana pots or fire resist pots when they have a good pull and need to do some more dps.  Keep in mind the raid balance team didn't expect all 40 players to be e-sports pros to experience the content.  They just wanted moms, dads, and children to have a challenging experience when they entered the instance two or three nights a week.
---
Noice
---
Played a priest on private server. Mind blast, SWP, begin wanding. Go make a sandwich, eat sandwich, come back and loot. Repeat on next mob.
---
While I’m being hyperbolic, it’s not really challenging or engaging at all. The only time it’s remotely challenging is if you are fighting mobs 3+ levels over you (yay hit/resist chances) or a humanoid runs into others and chain pulls. Even then, not so much because all you do is run away and reset.
---
Also save your big CDs for when you get ganked.  I can't remember the amount of times I was ganked by a rogue higher level than me and killed them because of Retaliation/Overpower.
---
I played a little vanilla back in the days , but decided to grind runescape/ osrs for 15 years, iv recently decided i have had enough runescape and will be full grinding on Classic wow, this transition will be sick! Super excited!
---
RIP your life
---
We both know u didn’t and you won’t be
---
Abandoned alts that are 35? or 30, I can't remember the level req should get alchy for transmute and tailoring for mooncloth transmutes.  Passive ~8g per day/character.
---
&gt; close to that.
---
&gt; perfect loot drops perfectly gearing
---
Does it sound like we said the same thing? lol
---
It is not entirely “unchanged” (I have years of playtime exclusively on priest and lead hardcore guilds through all of Naxx).
---
You are correct, we are not spamming max rank greater heals (but sometimes max rank flash heals). Effectively missing out on beyond 13 points in disc and beyond 13 points in holy makes it so you cannot sustain the same heal output over time.
---
For instance, your point struggles with a fight like Sapphiron, where you probably spam pots and runes on cool down and priests need to sustain 600 HPS over more than five minutes (ideally 700-1000 HPS).
---
If you don’t feel like you can agree, then Loatheb is a good example. Your raw healing gets directly affected there.
---
As long as you are not using max rank or a very low rank, mana regeneration and healing power are mathematically equivalent. You can always convert too much regen into power by upranking and too much healing to regen by downranking.
---
So whether you take a hit on regen or healing is not too relevant in the spreadsheet game.
---
&gt; Wand issues
---
Lesser magic &gt; Greater Magic&gt; Cookie's Stirring&gt; Gravestone Sceptre&gt; Whatever on the AH
---
&gt; pet issues
---
yeah, that can be tough until you get improved voidwalker. Then it's pretty smooth
---
&gt;  drain soul on anything above your level for a imp DS proc.
---
Suppression 5/5
---
They really don't do that shit dps. They won't top the meters but they won't hang around with the tanks either. The problem is that you can only field one in your raids, which means there will usually only be one in the guild. But this can also be a good thing. That priest will be stacked pretty quickly, especially since they don't share so many items with the mages and warlocks. At that point a shadowpriest can do pretty good damage. We have one of our officers go shadow, that way we know the items won't be wasted on someone who quits the game later on.
---
I remember rushing to get my dungeon 1 set and then trying to raid.  Ended up in ZG for far too long but I did get the fist weapon set.
---
This time, I am going to level leisurely and do the same thing mostly.  It will be relaxed and fun.  I plan on streaming so people can watch me goof off and do stupid stuff.
---
Wtf why
---
Welcome back to vanilla wow.
---
You can save a lot of mana if you duo with a warrior

[Citation Needed]
---
Can't recall a time where a ret did 1k DPS single target in MC/BWL gear like ferals can.
---
&gt; have never played an mmo before or do not usually play them
---
Sounds like a lot of people who got into Vanilla WoW the first time around.
---
No offense taken.  I am just providing an alternate view on engineering:  it's fun in a way that has nothing to do with tryharding.
---
Will You play a game or a friggin excel spreadsheet?
---
&gt;  it's the people who don't like to PvP that are generally the toxic ones
---
I should rephrase that: the people who are toxic are generally those who don't like to PvP.
---
The PvP people will play all aspects of the game to get the gear they want. Some of the PvE-only people will complain that they have to play the part of the game they don't like to get some gear they want.
---
Ah I was thinking purely from the perspective of a shaman with Windfury *Weapon*.  Yeah it makes perfect sense now, thanks.
---
basically camwhoring but for people without any friends
---
&gt; the community more or less remained the same: no changes, friendly and helpful to newbie questions, a deep curiosity and propensity towards theorycrafting, hostile to "QoL" stuff that erodes gameplay and immersion, etc
---
There are a significant number of Classic fans that want some QoL, balance, and other changes. If you're one of those people, this sub IS very toxic. And your statement there shows exactly why: the majority here think everyone is 100% "nO cHaNgEs". Anyone that thinks otherwise gets insulted and told to "go back to retail."

I never thought it was really an issue.  Get your PvP trinket when you can and save pots/your 30 min cds for when you get ganked.  Assuming you're arms (which I was when I leveled in vanilla) and have a good weapon, you can take almost every class in a 1v1 except maybe priest/hunters.
---
On Alliance side those few bodies of water for seal form are on different sides of the planet. They were also extremely annoying to find in a world before questing databases.
---
Having an additional column for cumulative total would be great.
---
Just read my comment again and tell me how this comment makes sense. Smh.
---
"The assumption that you get anything even close to perfect loot drops perfectly gearing your raid is just ludicrous."
---
If you think you are going to have even a single raider completely geared out from MC after 3 months of raiding, you are terribly mistaken.
---
My Alienware laptop I’ve been playing on is touch screen I use it it’s easier sometimes never thought about making buttons bigger like that though to make it easier and my screen would get so smudgy

Grinding dungeons also gives you an edge on gear. You’ll always have the best for your level range. If you clear DM 3-4 times, you might get a two-hander and the Defias chest. Same goes for the other dungeons. That gear will decrease your time-to-kill.
---
What is this supposed to mean? I remember hunter showing melee weapon until at least Cata.
---
&gt;, or shadow priest
---
Ya had me in the first half, not gonna lie
---
Shamans should have stayed a 2h class! DW FTL! All they needed to do was make stormstrike have a shorter cooldown. Or......
---
Make windfury a permanent effect, with the other imbues turned into short-medium range magical melee attacks that do both a physical and magic damage component that scale individually with sp and str. (Rockbiter double melee). Melee portion not applied if target further than 5yd. Magic range limited to 10yd. Really make the hybrid aspect of the class shine without majorly changing the playstyle or feel of the class. Still bursty, still have big crits, still magical, still trying to stay close to the target, increased and more consistent dps. These abilties could be on just as long of a cd as stormstrike.
---
They kinda sorta went this route with DW in TBC and lava lash, but it was not good.
---
I think the Mortal strike debuff should be kept up as well, and maybe Serpent's Sting.
---
Thats everyone, everywhere. It wasn't as rampant as it is now.
---
You are to far down my man!
---
People underestimate it because it was patched in TBC and wasn't on any private servers. Warrior is not a hard to level class in Classic, the bottom of tier of levelling is now just Paladins/Rogues.
---
Low (35) level alts with alchemy/tailoring/leatherworking are very nice to have because of cooldowns.
---
Absolutely. I hope and pray that on Friday evenings there’s a short queue to log on, because that means the community is alive and popping!
---
Tired Old Lady face = Kill On Sight 
---
But beehive hair is acceptable
---
&gt; Dallies were just an alternative to traditional gold grinding methods
---
It wasn't just about gold.  It was about reputation and badge farming as well.  Some of which did not have a grinding alternative.  Capping progress with a glorified cron job like that is a terrible design choice for an MMO.
---
&gt; badge gear was just a different way of implementing the catch up gear that started in vanilla
---
It's inorganic and unrewarding.
---
&gt; flying mounts were expensive and slow unless you paid a ridiculous amount of gold. The zones were designed for flying mounts as well.
---
Doesn't matter.  Flying was and remains a detriment to the game.
---
I'm just hoping they all go back to whatever BR has just launched as soon as possible. 
---
I know the streamers will switch games soon because ya know, they do whatever their subscribers want instead of being their own people
---
One of the problems was said to be Wowhead etc false statistics.
---
Assuming a Green Gizmo drops off a Mosshide Harpy, only during the "Mosshide Gizmo" quest.
---
The stats would count the chances of it dropping including kills that were not related to the quest. This skewed the drop as rarer than it actually was when on the quest.
---
I’m already dreaming about running around in game.
---
If you want to play the most powerful class roll a mage.
---
Well this time around tell your mom to be more careful! I mean, WTF is she even DOING in there anyways?
---
I know right.. and these are people from private servers. You'd think they'd know a thing or two about the game before reading up on how to connect to these servers. I've raided with so many people who don't anything about their class it's just crazy... so when people think everyone in Classic will be super hardcore and know everything about everything, they are gravely mistaken.
---
I mean if it takes 20 mins to get from ashenvale to thousand needles that’s a two-parter right there.
---
You either end up with less gold because you have to drop things that you could vendor, or leveling takes longer to empty your bags more often. Not a huge downside, but it's there.
---
&gt;  If it was doable with garbage players 14 years ago why would it not be doable with decent players on worse specs now?
---
Because people have some hardcore nostalgia goggles and remember Vanilla as being incredibly difficult. What they don't account for is that the game is completely figured out, and they were likely a young teenager at the time.
---
&gt; Shaman the entire class itself brings the same totems regardless of spec
---
Which is exactly why ele/enh are bad. They have mediocre DPS and do not bring anything special that a Resto shaman can't.
---
&gt;Boomkin being the most useless since itll go oom in the first 5 seconds and their HoTs dont even stack.
---
1. they have mana issues but not "first 5 seconds" lol??
---
2. why are you casting HoTs as a DPS
---
Thanks for calling me dumb though.
---
This is why Vanilla was magical.
---
Clearing MC is a cakewalk, we all know that, it's when AQ40 comes that I'm worried.  
---
You're giving one class a reason not to spec optimal, I can't remember any other class getting that excuse, especially during progression(you did mention that it might be different at the start)  
---
Casters in AQ and Naxx require tranquil air, so at least one will be there.   
---
We'll see, but I fear I'll end up leveling another character just to be able to do something other than raid.
---
TV input lag + controller wireless input lag + network latency + rendering latency can easily add up to around 500ms depending on your TV and peripherals. 
---
Granted I never gave a measured metric, I am ballparking it at 500ms. Realistically it was probably closer to 350 but I’d have to measure it. Don’t believe me? Google around for Nintendo switch pro controller input lag in the new super smash, you will find similar results, and that’s all locally rendered.
---
He is the alliance.
---
Good luck getting into any raids as a ret pally.  They aren't very good in vanilla.  Maybe once you get AQ40/Naxx gear you might be able to not get last on the meters, but they are definitely not a raid spec.
---
it's amazing for getting you and your party into BRD quicker.
---
&gt; they do kinda okay DPS but are mainly just there for their debuff / buff
---
People are just trying to say that shadow priests do better DPS and their debuff is 10 times better.
---
1. yes hit means its not resisted but that is according to the error of the combat log which was the reason i created this post as i wanted to know if classic had that fixed or if it is still the same....
---
2. miss &amp; resist are never the same... one is the cause from the opponents resistance versus your penetration while the other is based on your hit chance versus enemy level...
---
Yeah, the ebonroc gloves are bis, im pretty sure you ise the tier 2 helm and legs though. But what i was saying is, yes a few pieces here and there are good/bis, but never a full set (in terms of min/maxing)
---
Rogues don't even learn to parry until lvl 12.
---
Everyone starts somewhere.  
---
As someone who just took the plunge to start tanking; i was open and up front about being new. The people who had patience and helped me along the way became long-term friends and gained a reliable and ever more confident and proficient tank when they needed me :)
---
Just logged on last week to get my fix before classic and I found that barrens chat never changed.  Love it.

---
oh idk I thought they were bad till geared.  not an intentional gotchya lol just ignorant on my part.
---
Wasn't Vael a DPS check though?  Had to kill him before all the dps died.  Fun fight as a warrior though with execute spam!
---
I’m not! Input lag isn’t network response time. Round trip network latency is around 1ms but input latency includes controller lag (wireless controller) + network latency + rendering latency + TV response time. Keep in mind I was also estimating and that number is probably closer to 250-350.
---
Say that to mages grinding dm:e all day every day for entire Vanilla, or people going for rank 14.
---
Dailies are a shitty, inorganic form of content and should never appear in an MMO ever again.
---
Fireblast is one of the best tagging spells in the game. Priest/Warlock would kill for a tagging ability at lvl 6.
---
&gt;Why is there a meta?
---
There is a meta because people know which classes are strong. If you're a PvPer and you've done the early raids more times than you can count, you're not going to want to spend hours of your time every week clearing content that you've already figured out a long time ago.
---
If you optimize your raid, clear MC in less than an hour, suddenly you're free to spend the rest of your night doing whatever you like. That's why there is a meta, people don't like to feel like their time is wasted.
---
That's unfortunately how it is among PS players who have been on the circuit for a while, they've been there and done everything many times so they look to free up their time so they can do the stuff they enjoy the most.
---
And he was pretty good back during actual vanilla. Soo? Don't get that guy. Hes a legit vanilla god who became a streamer. So what.
---
This is legit hilarious. Bravo man.
---
indeed
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klm2Q7xu_d4&amp;t=
---
They added a very short internal cooldown on WF sometime before 1.12 to prevent windfury proccing on windfury procs, if I remember correctly
---
You could also do this with a sit stand macro back in the day. I remember fake leeroying into bosses while people on vent were yelling.
---
Such innocence
---
Thinking this way would require OP to actually have a brain that can see beyond just the DPS chart parses.
---
Your original post is still incredibly wrong. You only need 2 items (Wolfshead Helm, pummeler) not 5, and still didn't explain what "sweating buckets" means. Oh no, you have to press more than 1 button, such a high-skill and stressful rotation, wow.
---
Seeing as mages don't have a spell that deals nature damage no, it's not that helpful. Theoretically you could use it buff ele damage but it's 2 charges on a 20 sec CD so it's nothing but meme tier.
---
A guild I was in, was stuck in ZG almost forever.  We had tanks get gear and leave.  Happened almost every time we geared a tank up.  Once we killed Hakkar a few times, we attempted MC with another guild and got a couple of bosses and I left at that point.  
---
I believe you are 100% correct.
---
Bear druids initially had very low armor in classic, the bear bonus was something like 160%, instead of its later almost 400% armor bonus. By the time they got buffed a few patches in, it was common knowledge that 'druids can't tank'. The stigma stuck with them for the entirety of classic, and only got shaken off in TBC, when they suddenly became 'viable' despite receiving next to no survivability changes going from classic to TBC.
---
We were all pretty new and dumb back then, its quite likely feral tank is viable, maybe even optimal for some fights.
---
yes i did play vanilla until cata and then sporadically since. I mean congrats, you let someone bully you out of playing the game you want to play instead of having half a brain and just going elsewhere. 
---
&gt;It was WEAK to log out untill the ganker leaves.
---
Fix'd for ya.
---
I can see it with IQD, but that's also because I was trying to get as much gold as I could at that point and so I was putting 3-4 alts into there every day.
---
The difference is that there wasn't much penalty if you didn't do your dailies.  They weren't so much better than the other content that it was stupid to ignore them, and most of the rewards weren't that big of a deal if you missed a few days.
---
Do you not work full time? (honest question). That is a fuck ton if time playing
---
Yeh
---
According the the general feel on the Beta, people are blood thirsty and VERY pumped for WPVP. ALso, if you aren't able to no life 12 hours away for the first couple of weeks to hit 60 early. those who do, will ABSOLUTELY be running around ganking STV
---
Getting an "lol ok" from thunderclapping warriors that don't know battle shout generates threat awakens something vile within me.
---
I once paid multiple level 60 warriors to all message this one twat that kicked me from a group over it to msg him directly telling him that it does.
---
They were probably talking about dungeons and were right.
---
Afaik no it doesn't. For PVP, you only need two points in it. 
---
Spell penetration is a separate thing.
---
They did show melee weapons, atleast 1h swords, that I'm sure of from back in D dayz.
---
You're just obviously out to pick a fight lmao I wasn't attacking you or ferals
---
 it's ok buddy you don't have be so edgy by getting offended by every single thing on Reddit. People will like you for you, just give em a chance!
---
You should really have started with the duel with the cow in Warsong if you weren't going from the start.
---
It looks like OP just looked at HPS and DPS parses and then decided his rankings on that lol.
---
Definitely something to take into consideration. Personally thinking of rolling a tank because I've never tanked before and instant party invites sounds nice.
---
closed beta is out, game launches august 27th
---
I work 10-630 PM Thursday- Monday. My commute is 10 mins to my office.
---
Dumbest comments ever
---
A little over 15.  I made a video about the Barrens and tested it, following the road the entire way.  My all time favorite zone.
---
If it's actual classic wow in a simple pve server, I would not mind.
---
That's my point.  You complain about artificial gating in the form of dailies.  But a 1% drop chance is also artificial gating.  You're not complaining because the gating exists, but because you don't like the version of gating that took place.
---
I don't agree to disagree.  You're making claims about TBC features as bad.  The same can be said for the Vanilla features that filled a similar role.
---
At launch only MC and Onyxia will be available for raids.  The other raids will release in phases.  But for most guilds those will be slow clears due to lack of gear/skilled players.
---
Pretty easy on a shaman too with frost shock / earthbind as long as you have space to kite
---
In retail right before the end of the raid they nerf almost every end raid boss by ~5% with some other huge nerf right before the end of the tier. I'm not sure why they do it, I guess they just want struggling guilds to get Cutting Edge for free.  The recent Jaina nerf made it so the final phase was a complete joke and the amount of guilds who have killed her doubled that week.
---
 **Husband and Wife looking for PvE raiding guild.** 
---
Guild **MUST** be.. 
---
*  NA region
---
*  PvE Server (**No PVP servers**, I don't care how PvE focused you are, the  gank squads won't either.)
---
*  DKP (Some item reservations, especially legendaries and tanking loot  are expected, but **no pure Loot Council**)  
---
We would **LIKE** a guild that is...
---
* Horde (Though we do have experience on alliance side as well, we  prefer Horde) 
---
* Mature Community (In attitudes, not necessarily age)  
---
* Semi-Hardcore Pace   
---
What we have to offer.. 
---
*  Open availability. (We will make your raid times work for us.)
---
*  Genuine Vanilla hardcore raiding experience. (Top 3 progression guild  on Hyjal \~2005-2006)  
---
* Recent Vanilla experience on private servers.  
---
* Decades of MMO experience \~1996-Present  
---
* Leadership experience in most, if not all, officer roles, including in  hardcore progression guilds.  
---
* Maturity and professionalism with a willingness to go above and beyond  for guild progression.    
---
We are willing to accept officer or advisory positions within a guild,  if a guild thinks our experience would be useful, but we're more than  content with a position in the rank &amp; file.   My wife is firm on  maining a holy/disc priest. I am more flexible, I'm provisionally planning on rolling Hunter but have experience raiding as Hunter, Mage, Warrior (Tank), and Druid (Heals). If you think  we'd be a good fit for your guild, or have any additional questions, please shoot me a private message on Discord, e-mail me at  nafunnufan@yahoo.com, or contact me on reddit at u/nafun_nufan
---
Welcome to the internet.
---
How can you literally ignore the first half of my sentence that says the same thing, then call it different? How dumb can you be?
---
Well on a lot of servers PvP is involved in leveling, and there lack of mobility is absolutely a negative there.
---
Yeah that works sometimes. But if they resist or break out early, or if its indoors. Best to not rely on it.
---
So you don’t remember anything before cata I’m guessing..
---
I was, though I don't think it should change much.  PvP outside of battlegrounds is pretty irrelevant towards overall honor gains when you're talking about the higher ranks, and in reality it's just a waste of your time if you're doing world pvp for anything other than enjoyment.
---
If you're talking about the fact that there may just be more people interested in pvp and thus more competition for the top percentiles, it might matter slightly but overall I can't imagine it would mean much below rank 13/14.
---
Hard for me to really say though since I never played on PvE.  At the end of the day, rank 10 is super easy to get  if you have a reasonable amount of free time to invest so unless your schedule is less than 10 hours a week then I don't think it's a concern at all.
---
It's also \*way\* easier to get to ranks 8 and 9 slowly while playing quite a bit less, so if you can find a single week of dedication after hitting 9 while playing more casually, you can jump to 10 in a week no problem.  8-&gt;10 in a week would probably require a pretty nutty time investment, but, again, would be pretty easy to do in 2 weeks with some lightly hardcore hours.
---
No addon
---
If the length is not 10:0x then it is not a youtube video.
---
SW:P only applies Shadow Weaving when it’s *cast*, not on every tick. Depending on how hard your guild is pushing, chances are they won’t even have a dedicated spriest and instead have 1-2 priests that apply it with R1 Mind Blast. 
---
I put Thunder Clap because it’s useful when damage gets high and it’s always going to be there once you get a Thunderfury.
---
Yeah, that just makes you a complete POS. Grats on needing to fight like that. I'm sure it's "just for lawls" but deep down we all know why you have this tactic mastered.
---
I never had that issue with bg's
---
And that's ONLY if it actually takes 20 minutes. If it takes more, it could be a three part, or even four! Four times the money of the same idea! Think of all the midroll ads.
---
No, the barrens is Horde territory. Can't get ganked if you aren't pvp flagged.
---
That’s literally what happen in the video.
---
Feral's problem is it's ironically not a hybrid spec. If you want to be a cat, you can put in the effort and spec for it, but you skip on the talents that make Bear really work. If you want to be a Bear, you lose the Cat abilities. 
---
Shadow provides its buff, Moonkin too even if its lesser. Moonkin also have major dps/mana issues compared to others. 
---
Ret is actually a lot better than before, with the discovery of the Spellret build. Almost all of the theory behind them has been confirmed true in the beta. Its farm intensive, but if somebody wants to put in the time, why stop them?
---
Shaman... Well, elemental is terrifying in PvP and I'm alright with some specs being for PvP only. Enhancement though. That tree is a mess. There has been some research going into it based on the Spellret findings, but iirc the best they came up with was an Arcanite Dragonling stacking fire build.
---
He was not a bad player lol, but with a 1.5 sec GCD clicking was not a huge deal for most people. 
---
And to be honest, most raid encounters were 1 spell for most class's. I always kept my dots up (because i was greedy and had unending mana with dark pact)
---
No we were not.  Many of us were already experienced adult gamers, with top notch systems , high speed  broadband internet.
---
Well _obviously_...
---
I specifically made a note that sustain is worse, so ofc you will suffer for the fights where that matters and you can't just compensate with more consumables.
---
Battleshout does not do threat on betaz just fyi
---
live to win
---
No flying mounts but wall jumps and slow fall.
---
You realize PvP servers exist on retail, right?
---
Paladin Blessing of Sacrifice. Lasts 30 seconds, every time the target takes damage, ~40 HP of that damage is transferred to you.
---
Great for breaking CC in PvP.
---
&gt; limited mobility
---
We solve this by making everyone around us mobile vis-a-vis Fear.
---
Sorry I forgot it was nature damage. Thought it was fire frost or nature.
---
Looks&gt;racials&gt;stats 
---
It could be super optimized but if you hate how your character looks , what’s the purpose ?
---
If you're playing on the N server, there should be dynamic respawn.
---
The L server however, I'm not sure since the population is way lower.
---
Okay. So I was close (ish). I last did that run eleven years ago so memory is a little faded.
---
I dont get how Ele shaman is supposedly really decent in PvP but thrash in PvE. Like, you need mana in both. Balance for example has mana problems and is bad in both.
---
I'm interested in shaman and fine with resto in PvE but really questioning if anything else makes sense for them.
---
The video of serenity now crashing the funeral in winter spring. 😂😂😭
---
Because both are true. Ret paladins are not going to enter raids much, so if you want to raid you should go as a healer. If you don’t care about raiding, play whatever you like.
---
Even with that type of build, ret pallies shouldn't be beating any other class on the damage meters.  Their damage was REALLY bad for raids.  But doing that build can be interesting for PvP.  Shockadins with a lot of spell damage can actually do a good amount of burst damage.
---
Only 16,330? Easy.

I've played some Korean MMOs since WoW that make those look like rookie numbers.

I would like to take your tour!
---
I could totally see them implementing phasing for he AQ opening event. Eveone and their mother will be there and back in the day, it ran very poorly. If you didn't have everything turned to "ultra potato mode" you would never get above 5 fps. Especially on the servers with 10k+ players in Silithus at the same time. 
---
I know hardware has come a very very long way, but cramming every single character on a server, into the same area, is clearly still a major issue.
---
Same, you don't experience the game/story like you would if you progressed through each zone.
---
I'm not saying that everyone does it or even that the majority do it because that's not the case, most people who frequent this sub are pretty cool but there are those select few who go out of their way to let everyone know how much they enjoy the smell of their own farts, and it wouldn't kill them if they were told that their farts stink just as much as everybody else's.
---
I love the idea, but i wonder who would bring heals.
---
&gt; or can you just go into your account and add game time to access it?
---
Yep - this.
---
10 times
---
Found the Cata player...
---
It is an Always Sunny reference. 
---
Right now I’m just taking down reddit usernames to send out more info when available.
---
A Mage is also able to contribute to a PvP fight with lesser gear.
---
&gt; the biggest concern is latency
---
Not with Google Fiber
---
It's 15 years old, but bobody has played vanilla since 2007.  Actually, really, later 2006 because I don't consider the TBC patch to be vanilla.  Everything else (pservers) has been an approximation.  A rather incorrect approximation, it seems.
---
If you think nothing new will come in Classic, then I have a bridge in Brooklyn that I'll sell you for $2.
---
It's funny the whole reason I did that was because the meme has became so strong that warlocks are amazing speed killers, and that mages (single target) and priests suck and are very slow so I thought I'd actually test it out.
---
Second HerpDerp's request. PLEASE reinstate your awesome site!!
---
4 stremgth 4 stam leather belt. Aahhh oohhhh!
---
If you don't care about numbers in a game full of numbers, stay away from all of us.
---
Oh no does this really bother you?
---
As a matter of fact getting a raid spot at 60 will be easier as Fury than as Prot, Warriors are top-tier DPS classes.
---
&gt;Druid: Long/difficult class quests for each form
---
All forms besides Bear and Aquatic form is purchased from a trainer Bear one isn't that bad. You start it in Darnassus/Thunder Bluff. You teleport to Moonglade. Take to a Bear spirit in Moonglade, then you fly from Moonglade to Darnassus/TB to continue the quest.
---
Then you go to the Barrens or Darkshore, kill a Moonkin and then heart back to Darnassus/TB. 
---
The Aquatic Form is definitely a bitch to get, but I usually don't even bother with it until I'm done leveling as its not necessary.
---
Make sure you spray it with febreze so the canvas doesn’t absorb your sweat smell.
---
Here is good enough. I’ll document reddit accounts and send out messages closer to release. 
---
I still need to organize things a bit. But I’ll setup a discord server for the guild soon and that will probably become the primary means of communication.
---
I disagree, you can take a lot of fun while leveling an alt, you won't get fun by brute farming for 30 hours.
---
You level 2 or 3 alt, one should be a warlock to help your guild with summon.
---
You gave them LW+Alchemy, or tailoring if you have some time (because felcloth can be a bitch to get at a fair price). Then every 2/3 days you'll grab 30 gold of cash just by connecting your alt, it's 100 gold a week, 400 gold a month for minimal effort.

What’s wrong with them?
---
I know
---
**I KNOW**
---
#I KNOW
---
Oh, interesting. Is that intended? I didn't actually get to level cap in retail vanilla so my experience is limited, but it does on the private server I'm on so I assumed it did then too.
---
It's so hard to know what these shitty private servers choose to change for no fucking reason.
---
Thanks for the warning!
---
Being ganked is fun right
---
Failed got 6 right!
---
If you're on a PVP server, you can only have characters of one faction on the same server.
---
Here's your complimentary pity reply. Savor it.
---
I doubt you did, its normal practice to log out. If a guy corpse gank you with an epic mount as low level there is not much you can do except die over and over again and wait the respawn time every single time.
---
Its not about avoiding queues, its about avoiding TONS of players all starting out in the starting areas all at the exact same time and quest being completely pointless due to mob tags and shear number of players stuck in the same areas and unable to level.
---
This is that we call Stockholm Syndrome.
---
What the fuck is this post.
---
This is the kind of thing that people keep posting here over and over and over and honestly there's no way to know this is going to be true or not.
---
If people need warm bodies what's wrong with bringing more shadow priests? Someone doing damage is always better than someone not doing damage unless that person is bringing the baron bomb into the group or something...
---
And what happens when a rogue/hunter/mage/warlock can't make the raid? Real life kicks in? They get sick? 40 slots in a raid is such a massive number there are multiple factors that would contribute to below top-tier builds getting into a raid.
---
&gt; nobody has played vanilla since 2007
---
Private servers.
---
"b-b-b-b-but APPROXIMATION! INACCURATE!"
---
Pservers are like 95% accurate these days, in terms of class spells/abilities/talents and raid scripting. That excuse might have been valid in 2009, but not 2019.
---
I’m on Beta and it is very cutthroat but people also hit the lighter level caps sooner so there are more bored people running around.   It honestly feels like people are running dungeons way more than just world PvP unless the streamers decide to do something stupid. 
---
People also leveled in group and it was sort of rare to see people leveling solo so there was definitely some world PvP but the overall level process didn’t seem hampered compared to what it was like on a PvP server back in the day. 
---
It seemed exactly like the classic experience and business as usual.
---
I keep seeing comments like "People Whisper you and ask for help" or "People are willing to talk to each other and help each other out"
---
But when the flood gates are lifted, and all the immature people that currently make retail a hell hole sometimes will be playing classic.
---
Right now with the limited access, classic is in it's most ideal state.
---
Eventually the majority of people will drop because Classic is to much of a time commitment, but for the first month it is going to be rough.
---
But that is just my prediction and hopefully I am wrong.
---
Initially, then they started talking about them being taken as raid healers. Apparantly ret pallys make great healers as well
---
This man is trolling people and isn't even in game. Outstanding.
---
PvP is not sustained spellcasting for 2+ minutes, that's why.
---
Also lots of bosses have nature resistance, and curse of elements/shadow does not buff nature damage.
---
I didn't even know what a streamer really was until I started camping this forum. I'm sure a portion of kids and old farts like me are going to have no idea what they are getting themselves into.
---
Lmao man classic is gonna be terrible with people like you. Hope to avoid you at all costs.
---
Blizzard wouldn't have remade the game for just a preservation project when the Vanilla servers already serve that purpose quite well.
---
It makes perfect sense to have a vanilla server forever, and I hope Blizz does just that.
---
But not everyone wants it to stop there. Some people like TBC, or WOTLK more than vanilla.
---
What we can all agree on is to keep anything in Cataclysm out of classic. IMO we need Classic/TBC/and WOTLK servers, and from there make future expansions while leaving previous servers alone while keeping the talent, and class systems.
---
[This fucking video did it for me. Immediately begged my mom to buy it for me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDXgUc0F4Nw)
---
Anyone planning to raid as ret in classic is doubling down on being a moron with everything we know now.
---
Yeah, for solo play Druids are really great. There weakness is that other classes perform all the roles they can perform, but better. But thats not a leveling weakness, just a weakness of the class overall.
---
1-21 is rough for Druids. Its not until you get Feline Swiftness when you feel the leveling power of a Druid. Before that its not very good, even with Bear Form.
---
Looks like ur ready to no life it pretty hard

Let's not feed the trolls, people.

It should be showing his melee weapon sheathed on his back, if it's a 2 hander. It was like this in vanilla and anyone who says otherwise is wrong.
---
proof: https://youtu.be/7XgF_P9Ddjk?t=316
---
I actually totally forgot about that In vanilla...just so heavily dependent on gear to be considered to be useful in a raid
---
They said Classic runs better than retail, because there is less info to be send to and received from server (cloud), mostly spells / skills if I remember correctly. Which is excellent news regarding mass populated events.
---
Ohh you! There's ways, there's always ways.
---
On PvE servers you can make characters on both factions. On PvP servers you can only have characters on one faction; you'd need to pay for a second account to have characters on the other faction on that same server.
---
Mind Vision is godly in Warsong Gulch, use it dozens of times each BG on my Priest.
---
Pretty nifty in world PvP as well, only the stealth classes can hide from a Priest.
---
That's a great idea actually. Just roll the dice to see what you're going to play, it will land on something and you'll realize what you actually want to play and just roll that.
---
Ahahahaha haha 
---
Oh my sides
---
So the current top post of this sub is now a colouring in of the barrens? I thought the retail sub was bad but holy fuck...
---
Tanxiety
---
Isn't that a private server behaviour?  In the stress test mobs who feared at low health would run in a random direction.
---
Intrested in playing? As a Gm and Mt of a hardcore guild I need to hold myself to a higher standard. Very happy we are getting an end of summer release so I can enjoy the nice weather.
---
yeah or spirit res and go elsewhere. 
---
&gt;I doubt you did
---
you can think that, you'd be wrong but your more than welcome to have wrong opinions, as evidenced by the rest of your post.
---
I just realised... I have played since release and still dont know where the exit inside WSG for alliance is :D
---
I was with you up until the end there. Can you clarify how you got to -8% parry chance?
---
110% Interested. Can be more interested if necessary. Please keep me posted.
---
I'll go the other way, they will be less represented because of everything we know now, who would want to roll something that we know is bad on day 1 of classic?  Just put all that effort into a class that is actually good at the job you want to do and watch your numbers double.
---
Thats a lot of seconds.
---
Rogue, hunter, mage, and warlock all bandage.
---
If I end rolling horde, I will definitely send you a ping. and agreed. Now just to bide the time till the 27th of August.
---
Might be right on that. If you can confirm, I would be interested to know.
---
And here I am hoping for RP-PVP server so I dont have to go to pve server. :P
---
I think I'll probably pvp more that raid this time around anyway haha
---
The reputation from dallies wasn't really that big of a deal though. You didn't need it. And the only dallies that gave badges were just the daily heroic quests which again weren't required, you could ignore the daily and just do whatever heroics you felt like whenever you felt like it. Of course there was a daily reset, but there were so many heroics that you'd never run out of heroics to run and hit the daily limit unless you're grinding 12 hours a day and speedrunning.
---
And I don't really see a difference between running dungeons for catch up gear and running dungeons for currency that you use to get catch up gear. All the badge stuff was mostly catch up gear anyway so it's not a big deal.
---
And flying worked out well in tbc, the fast versions were rare enough to not be a problem and there was still plenty of world pvp. Ground mounts were still faster in some situations unless you paid tons of gold for fast flying, which not many people did.
---
Resto Shamans won't go OOM because you are going to gear for maximizing Mp/5, and you are usually spamming rank 1 Chain Heal. You can't really downrank as a caster DPS and raid bosses have Nature Resistance, which is not reduced by Warlock curses, unlike Fire/Frost/Shadow resist.
---
&gt; You seem to consider your perspective to be universally correct.
---
I never said this, or even implied it.  In fact, it's fairly ironic that you are the one accusing me of this when I was just offering a different approach from the game besides the 'raid or die' mentality and all your answers were something along the lines of, "Do you really want to teach people when your pushing for progression?", assuming everyone even considers pushing progression.  And stuff like "Why would you teach someone when you could just replace them".  You were talking as if YOUR perspective was universally correct and I am sitting here asking why would you want to play the game like that.  I'm not saying mine is correct,  I'm saying that there are other ways to raiding besides that shit mentality you have.  
---
 &gt;Progression doesn't mean "tryhard" - it means that you're trying to progress in the raid you're tackling, which is what the vast majority of guilds do. It's what gives your players gear, and the satisfaction comes from this incremental progress.
---
The vast majority of guilds have always been and will always be casual.  Period.  Most guilds don't even raid.  I know this is hard to accept when you have this mentality and only pay attention to raiding and raiding guilds, but the fact of the matter is casual players who just like to be around one another and just do stuff because they want to do stuff together, if they accomplish it or not that doesn't matter.  Christ I would argue most guilds aren't even END level guilds.  But you probably don't even consider those 'players' do you?  Lol.
---
&gt;Plenty of people love the social aspect of raiding - but for people like me and most others, it's within the framework of having goals to achieve in the form of killing bosses...
---
Wrong.  You are just flat out wrong.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not suggesting that a minuscule people feel like this, but it's the minority for sure and this has been proven time and time and time and time again to be true.  
---
&gt;I deliberately appealed to the ultra-casual view of raiding in the second part of the post you replied to, saying that you obviously don't need to worry about anything at all if you don't care about killing bosses. The replacement of players not pulling their own weight, and the perspective of a raider's value matter at least in some degree to people raiding to achieve certain goals.
---
This thought right here is why I keep saying you have a shit perspective.  You are acting like replacing someone is the only option if they aren't doing exactly as what you see as the correct playstyle.  TEACH THEM.  If your raid leader, or class leader (which you should have for moments like this), is not capable of teaching people who may not be the best of the best, then you're trash.  If you are solely relying on recruiting your way to the top then you are just bad.  Especially if you are a min/maxer.  And this is coming from someone who use to min/max themselves.  I don't anymore.
---
&gt;By the way, I have my doubts that you've cleared Naxx, Sunwell or have multiple gladiator title with your mindset. Do you have any proof? It sure would help your credibility.
---
I'm having trouble believing you even played during these times if you find this hard to believe.  I have this mentality because that's how I ran my guild back then.  We were all friends who helped each other out.  When we did push content and progress we learned together, we didn't kick someone out if they were behind we helped them.  I only acknowledge that some people don't even worry about pushing content because like I said, I have been apart of those guilds on alts back in the day where we literally just did T4 content for the entire expansion and it was fun.  
---
As for proof, I am not going anymore out of my way than to link an armory of me tbh
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/tichondrius/vaosan/achievements
---
Of course I can't really prove the Nax or sunwell because of how achievements work and I'm not going to dig through SS just to prove what I have done.  What have you done?  Pservers I assume?
---
Well good thing we are getting cross realm BG's instead of your stupid ass option.
---
this is all it ever needed to be. simple, to the point. Then the cash cow showed up and demanded a milking
---
Nice sounds good! What class and race do you think you would play?
---
They may not be that bad but all I can remember is the anxiety of seeing a "healer" go into shadowform.  
---
There was this guy on our server, skinsurgeon, who would dual box a warrior "tank" and always claim, "hey, I have a tank that wants to come too is that OK?" Only it wasn't OK.  I am forever scarred to what shadowpriests were in vanilla.  I am haunted by the repeated wipes and the "healer" claiming they did everything they could when they were oom because they were spamming mind flay and mind blast.  I can never recover from the scars left by this deception.  I have trust issues for a reason, this being it.
---
If you want to kill someone as a warrior you to deny your target an easy escape route
---
wdym
---
You’re on the list.
---
Well that's one way of doing things, but people have figured out smarter ways to manage their rage after all these years.
---
These days what Warriors do while leveling is they start at 0 rage and auto attack one mob to death. That's usually enough auto attacks that your rage fills to about 80-90. Then they pull two nearby mobs and spam cleave to quickly take out two mobs in one go. At level 30 you spec Sweeping Strikes, and now you can start to cleave up to 3 or 4 lower level mobs.
---
You're never rage starved as long as you don't use heroic strike. Which shouldn't be a big issue since HS's main function is a rage dump.
---
Hahah was wondering if your name is MMA related :D
---
this is not a change.
---
so we’re just full on mentally challenged in here now
---
I would like to see more memes plz
---
I'm ashamed I never made this connection.
---
You mad bro?  Everyone is complaining about the death of the community in retail wow and I experienced first hand the start of that decline to death and it was cross realm bgs
---
You can buy gold, &amp; cosmetics. 
---
You can of course by BoEs and runs through any content with gold. So yeah it's deff pay to win at this point if you want to spend a lot of $$$
---
what dumbass guild would even bring 1, nvm 2?
---
Orc Rogue =\]
---
Does this mean I can raid naxx as elemental?
---
OP is a Druid shill, the real tier list is simple:
---
1. viable but suboptimal, 1/raid at most: Shadow, Feral 
---
2. deadweight: the rest
---
Do you want to be in the top two horde/alliance guild on the server? Min-Max everything. 
---
Do you want to be in a guild that clears content during the relevant phase and starts new raids as they are released? Show dedication, have good attendance, be spec'd for raiding.
---
Do you want to play a "meme" spec, use essentially no consumables, or raid only on nights when you feel like it? You won't be clearing raids before the next tier raid comes out. Focus on joining pug raids.
---
&gt;Lightning bolt to pull, earth shock to interrupt if necessary, seating totem, then stab them to death with your dagger. You will exit the 5 second rule and regen a decent amount of mana to repeat.
---
Yeah that's roughly what I was thinking of doing.
---
The only WoW-killer is WoW classic.
---
get over it.
---
guild wars 2... lmao
---
no fun allowed?  sounds like the mods wrote the title
---
You're not wrong, there's a lot of really good stuff in there, but it'd be smart to consider number of items over how many bosses. But then you'd get into how many bosses you need to kill on the way there, how many are there in general, the different types of runs that are typical of an instance (there's like 100 ways to do BRD)
---
Denoised. I went with /u/AthenaNosta's recommendation in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bwqzql/here_have_some_upscaled_highresolution_wow_maps/eq29z1t/) which is the V1.2 32768x24576. [Link here](https://www.classicmaps.xyz/WoW%20maps/V1.2/32768x24576/).

---
Yeah, if you tag with fireblast you won the battle but not the war. Now you're at short range and the angry mob running at you isn't slowed. You're going to have to blow your nova early and so you'll end up facetanking it down for the last 30% of its health after that nova breaks. If you don't like drinking every other pull, you *really* won't like eating every pull. This is why the first sentence I wrote is "you really want to lead with frostbolt."
---
Luci is pretty easy business - the puppy down the way is a bigger challenge.  Then you get to Huhuran or the Twin Emps in AQ40 and you're like "wtf, MC was child's play"
---
That is true to the whole Warrior class, in all roles.
---
holy fuck dat reference
---
So true
---
Bag of marbles! I thought that I was big-braining by saving it for use on hogger. The fucker resisted it.
---
&gt; Pservers are like 95% accurate these days
---
hahahahahahahahaha
---
you don't need heals. in that regard you are favored over melee dps.  You can dodge and out range a lot of mechanics.  You can also kite something if necessary unlike the other classes.  Do you have to be top dps every pull in order to pick a flavor of the month class that may or may not be the play style you like?
---
Luckily we are ~100,000 out of hopefully multimillions so much like the class polls vs actual in beta counts there will probably be a ton of rogues, hunters, and mages as well.  Warlock is a top 3 choice on this sub but is consistently pretty low representation-wise.
---
Fire blast is instant and ranged.
---
Hunter auto shot has a .5 sec cast and arcane shot is instant but has a slight travel time.
---
Fire blast beats out any hunter skills for tagging.
---
Yes, you're correct!
---
I for one greet it as an old friend
---
People who know the least have the most confidence in what they're saying. (Dunning Krueger effect.) And naturally, different players have different play-styles that work for them, so I can only talk about my personal experience. 
---
Searing pain is mostly handy when your shadow tree is interrupted, (but it can also be used to bait interrupts.) In my opinion, being good at warlock is mostly about positioning, i.e. where are you standing. 
---
If people are attacking you, it probably means you've positioned yourself poorly. If you constantly position yourself poorly, I could see searing pain being more useful. Because it's the nearly only spell with a cast-time you'll be able to get off while being focused. (But it also receives far less from +sp than your other spells due to the cast time.)
---
Playing on Emerald Dream during WoTLK was the most fun I ever had playing WoW. The only better times in gaming I've had were playing EvE Online.
---
I want RP-PvP servers in Classic, especially with the extra emphasis on community that draws people to classic, RP-PvP servers will only amplify that feeling. I played primarily to raid but RP-PvP servers (Emerald Dream specifically) made the entire world feel populated (because, well, RP!) and the PvP resulted in constant open-world content. The drama was like no other and ended up being a perpetual fun generator (RP out in the world -&gt; PvP from opposing faction --&gt; Call to arms from friends -&gt; Large engagements -&gt; "Battle reports" on the forums -&gt; Much drama -&gt; More PvP).
---
Not to mention the random player-made events. I remember flying around Outland and randomly finding people at the Blade's Edge Arena. It was a group of Alliance and Horde standing around being chummy while people took turns having 1v1's and 2v2's inside the arena. Another fond memory was some RP wedding where Horde and Alliance met up at IoQD to celebrate it. So, despite the pvp rage, people could be civil and act like a community on the side, which felt awesome. I only wish I had cared enough about WoW to start sooner) and subsequently find my way to an RP-PvP realm sooner because once Cata launched, everything took a dive community-wise.
---
Bring. It. Back!
---
[A small gallery of Emerald Dream memories](https://imgur.com/a/fhV94BH)
---
If you read the tooltip, it says "reduces the chance for enemies to resist" not "increases your chance to hit with spells by x%" this is not the same as hit chance. It does does mitigate high amounts of resist, atleast it's been that way on private servers (yes it's been tested). This is why you see shadowpriests go 5/5 shadowfocus with their pvp specs.
---
Not optimal lol but Anything is better than solo warrior!
---
I'd say mage
---
Wand spec is your friend.
---
Thank you! That's refreshing to hear.  Funny that my comment got downvoted. Thank you for replying with such  a well thought out answer. I'm looking forward to finding that "nice guild" and playing with people like you when classic drops.
---
You don’t know what you’re talking about. I mained a hunter in TBC and I can tell you 100% there was no fucking quivers.
---
Mage. I'd say its not as gear dependent/respec necessary as others.
---
Flying is the biggest downgrade to WoW.
---
It's kind of a waste to farm Mara when you can farm DMN.
---
A DPS check where you’d usually wipe if some one pulled aggro. 
---
The whole raid more or less had to stand at his side, and if somebody went too hard, too quick they would pull aggro and the entire raid would get one shotted.
---
A *loooot* of guilds broke up stuck on that fight.
---
YouTube doesn’t reward videos under a certain length. That’s why they are always longer
---
I'm super psyched to play vanilla again with a different class but I'm really scared to lose my life to it again. I really like my wife, I don't want to piss her off by ignoring her for raids.
---
Dingus is an acceptable insult
---
Np, and right back at you! &lt;3
---
I never understood why escape artist had a cast time but stoneform and wotf didn't.  Only complaint I had with it.
---
We'll have to agree to disagree.

Damage meters

Can you be level 5 and reach max prof?
---
I absolutely LOVED my parachute cloak because of jumps I'd make like that. If I was in combat, then I would feign death to equip it and loved to /wave as I jumped off a cliff.

I also trolled a troll. As they were waiting for the Thousand Needles lift I walked up to the edge did a /cry and /t "I just can't take it anymore!" Before jumping.

Lol, yeah. Time-wise, 1-20 is like 5% of your playtime on the way to 60.

**&lt;Incarnation&gt;**  Alliance **|** NA-PvP **|** Hardcore
---
Raid Times: M TU W 7-10pm PST
---
Hi Everyone! Incarnation is a Hardcore Alliance guild looking for passionate and competitive players for Classic WoW. Our goal is to raid and clear content efficiently while promoting a healthy community.
---
We are a fresh guild, meaning that we do not have “core members” or “clicks” yet like many other guilds. Just because we are fresh does not mean we lack experience. We have a wide range of experience ranging from World competitive Naxxaramas clears in Vanilla WoW (14th), private server Naxxaramas clears, US server first endgame content of different expansions of WoW; as well as multiple PvP achievements including but not limited to rank 14's in vanilla wow, rank 1 arena gladiators from various expansions and even pro gaming experience through various games.
---
We do not expect all our recruits to have this level of experience, however we do have high expectations for all those interested in joining.
---
We expect all our recruits to know their class, game mechanics and how to progressively adapt into the later phases of Classic.
---
We are hardcore in the sense that we put a lot of time in preparation for the raid (farming consumables/pre-raid gear, knowing all boss mechanics) so that when we do zone in to a raid, we are fully prepared and ready to clear. We are raiding 3 hrs per day for only 3 days and not excessively long hours because we pride ourselves on using raid time efficiently.
---
**Goals:**
---
\-Strive to effectively and efficiently utilize time invested in the game to be the top guild in the server.
---
Druid(Resto) x 1
---
Obligatory all exceptional players consideres. (People in our guild switch classes sometimes so even if your class is not listed, do apply! We are looking for good players with positive attitude!)
---
Please apply on the website at [https://www.incarnationguild.com/](https://www.incarnationguild.com/) or contact ephy#0620 , iggy#1473 using Discord. (When filling out the application please be descriptive! It is hard to know who you are if you are answering each question with just one sentence!)
---
its not an epeen flex, it's a race for *huge* amounts of money. Like actual irl money, lots of it
---
Your questions depend entirely on the guild in question, and the players’ desire to progress through the raids.  Generally casual friends and family style guilds aren’t getting more than a few bosses in, if they can get 40 people at all.  
---
You don’t have to be in a top rated pve guild to want to optimize your parties and chances of success.
---

Thank you OP.

&gt; few who go out of their way

I say fuckem.
---
not even close, pvp gear got a lot stronger in TBC with the addition of resil, but you were still at a huge disadvantage without high end pve gear.  top of the ladder in the later seasons was filled with 4/4, pve jewelry/trinkets, glaives, etc.  even guys who didn't have a guild to raid with would pug as much as possible for certain pve pieces because they were that much better.
---
This guy can even sheep 1 mob while he kills the other. The nerve!! 😁
---
Total cost was 1014 SEK which is around 108 USD or 95 euro, shipping was included in the price. Originally it was 1268 but I found a student discount for 20% that I clicked. Not even a student but it worked anyway lol. I think it only works in Sweden, but here's the [link](https://mecenat.com/se/photowall).
---
Hit ‘em with a well timed Rip and they die before reaching their buddies
---
That tickled me
---
If youre competing for spawns then dont use a move with a cast time, use fireblast or arcane explosion
---
Actually, we do know that.  They (Blizzard) has said that WoW Classic will be accessible to those with an active subscription (no further purchases necessary).
---
You heard wrong. What happen was a guy was being a douchebag for over and hour in a tournament being streamed acting like some special snowflake trying to troll while on stream. This same thing happens to Sodapoppin constantly even in retail so he constantly has to change shards to avoid people. Nothing really to do with getting killed or camped, it's 99% of the time people from his own faction.
---
This dumbass subreddit somehow took that as Sodapoppin being mad about being killed and camped? I don't think that's happened to him in the beta, that he couldn't handle easily. I'm not sure why people think this, as that's probably the least of his worries as he can pretty much 1v1 anyone, and will probably be in one if the best Horde PvP guild on his server, but regardless that's how this sub painted it. 
---
Soda was talking about blacklisting players that troll to their 15 minutes of e-fame, such as spamming psuedo nwords using a faction translator, or spending time tagging his mobs while he's trying to get a drop, or say putting together a raid group to just try to gank him while he's doing necessary mats gathering.

I've made it my purpose to let them know loud and clear whenever they were being ridiculous... ;)

**NA, Alliance, PvP, Hardcore Leveling**

**MAGE** Looking for Duo Leveling Partner   
---
Ideal Classes: Mage, Priest, Paladin, Warlock   
---
Intend to go very hardcore for AoE grinding mostly to 60  
---
Asharial#0569 if you want to potentially discuss.
---
It'd probably be more interesting to find some original vanilla footage or at least badly geared PS kills where they don't just stack and kill in 20 seconds and then repeat it 3x.
---
The link in OP leads to a 404.
---
This one will work:  [https://sage-guide.netlify.com/index.html](https://sage-guide.netlify.com/index.html)
---
Going to roll ele shaman because everyone forgot that they are broken
---
One of my worries of modern client was the weather effects. I am glad they are heavy as it were in vanilla! Well done Blizzard (I had years to say this).
---
In my youth I would sit at my computer for.. well basically all day every day.
---
So 4 hours is casual for me personally, even *with* a full-time jerb.
---
I mean... I'm 30 now so ehhh... Lol
---
From what you described, go hunter. Easiest class to level, it's abit easier than rogue to gear and it's more fun/better in battlegrounds.
---
I hope it stays popular. A lot will either go back to retail or leave WoW when they find out things take longer.
---
Too late for that mate.
---
Or you could be a grown up and not play a childs game again if you dont want to?
---
Be a big boy

We were at a bus stop with my friend and he randomly started telling me about WoW, i was so intrested we missed like 5 bus purpose because i wanted to hear more. The day after that i bought it. So my friend made me sell my soul. The first moment i realized im falling in love with the game is when i dueled this same friend at lvl 6, he was higher level and he polymorphed me, once i realized 1. you can fight other players and duel them and 2. you can turn them into sheeps, at that point i knew this game haad soooo much for me to discover :D  
---
EDIT: Ive played every single expansion since then, except BFA, because they announced classic at the same time pretty much :D
---
&gt; At lvl 60 if you put the 30 hours into farming you would have 1000g +
---
So you believe that any class and specc can reliably farm at a rate of 35g/hour, even before the release of Dire Maul. What a broad statement.
---
it's getting harder to tell the trolls from the people who can't watch 5 seconds of literally any hunter video from vanilla

Is this one of those Berenstein / Berenstain things? Because I could swear it used to show the melee weapon, too. I could totally be remembering things wrong. It has been A LONG TIME.
---
Wait, what? That, only for the free tier of Stadia. For the Pro, for 10$/mo you will have a ton of games to play/stream, not sure you've seen the list of games included with the 10$ package  [https://www.ign.com/wikis/stadia-google-game-console/List\_of\_Google\_Stadia\_Games:\_Announced\_and\_Confirmed](https://www.ign.com/wikis/stadia-google-game-console/List_of_Google_Stadia_Games:_Announced_and_Confirmed) 
---
It's just like Netflix - there's a ton of movies and serie on Netflix, but new movies are cinema-only and only after several months they (maybe) come to Netflix. Stadia will function in the exact way. Brand new AAA games you need to purchase if you want to play at release, otherwise you'd wait a certain amount of months until they're included in the subscription. Just like Netflix, not all games will come to Stadia, but will be only on competing game streaming services.
---
I was excited to try shadow or feral until I talked to people.. guess I'll just be another warrior/ mage in the crowd. :(
---
i hated that i had to do it but its all i could really get without using someone else´s footage, it will get better on the harder bosses that dont take 20 seconds :P hope you can see trough fingers with it \^\^
---
No, professions have caps that are only raised by going above a certain level.
---
Really? They say you can play at 10-15mbps at 60 fps. Split that in half if you're ok with 30 fps. As for you downloading a 50-100GB game over a 10mbps connection, I hope you're joking. If you truly have under 10mbps internet in 2019, then sorry bro, but honestly you should (atleast consider) moving to a normal place.
---
&gt; It's one of the most powerful tools in a hunter's toolkit
---
Lets not get ahead of ourselves
---
Why would i spirit ress, spend my time traveling, wait 15min, pay for repairs, when i can just log out, grab some food and once im back the guy will have left already, that is LITERALLY what people did in vanilla, its common knowledge.
---
I believe a working AH addon is called aux. Questie, cartographer, map coords, recount, UI addon (I use zperl).those are what I use for now. Tukui creators have said they are doing a classic version of elvui so we have to wait on that.
---
You write like a retard.  I was mocking you and you didn't get it.  Big surprise.
---
IIRC, there were a few fights in BWL/AQ where MS made the fight much easier.  I don't remember them off the top of my head though.
---
I'm saddened by how many people in this thread are either trolling or willfully ignorant.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIXNOQ8ej9c
---
I’m looking and this sounds right up my direction. I’m rolling a holy Priest I cleared MC to AQ20 during vanilla. I have lots of availability for raids and helping w gearing.
---
One of the perks of 40 man raiding is that you can squeeze some of your garbo pals in.. and have a shaman cry over an earthshaker or something.
---
Rebinding A and D is bad for casters because you cannot change direction while changing target.  Pros keep all options not remove them.
---
DMN doesn’t come out p1
---
Dude awesome! We actually don’t have many locks or priests yet. I’ll message you on Discord with our server info.
---
I think you should spend more time on this.  Please explain to me in detail what you mean?
---
Thank you! I've been looking for something like this for weeks now. Nothing was up to my standards, but this is amazing
---
Let alone the fact that if people saw your body turn into a skeleton they would rush to the spirit healer, as a vanilla player you should know that.. You run on feet, they come with an epic mount
---
I know very well of that failure (and I've put my hopes in it back then). I was referring to the services that are available today and that offer 1080p 60 fps streaming - very good image quality, decent latency: Geforce Now, Shadow, Parsec - they require no additional hardware, you can just play the games on any low-spec computer/laptop or on your smartphone over 4G.
---
Can you even call it a city? It’s chill af though
---
No taunt. They are not viable.
---
Most pro casters rebind A &amp; D to strafe.
---
60 a few weeks after the first wave means about a month in. That is still insanely fast for a casual player. Most people will hit 60 a few *months* after the initial wave
---
That's true. I'm not really sure what all the different ways are though. I know Jailbreak is a run in and of itself, then there's emp runs and arena farms.
---
Is there a list of all the most common types of BRD runs somewhere?
---
Wow thanks, I found the guild leader and an officer of my classic guild. I'm so excited to talk to them!
---
^
---
Just generate more threat. Problem solved.
---
I can't wait to spend a month leveling in this zone.
---
I honestly am probably going to play a healer and most likely a shaman but I would definitely play a druid if they had a rez...
---
Proper kiting. Whether it's a warrior with a swing timer doing hamstring kiting or a hunter using the jump &gt; turn &gt; shot &gt; turn &gt; land kiting method, you can usually spot a great player from a good player by how well they kite.
---
Rogues can gain a good bit of burst by timing their opener to happen just before their +20 energy tick, essentially reducing the cost of their opening move by 20. 
---
Proper use of consumables, both for pve and pvp, proper use of LoS in PvP. Really there's a ton of things that can be done to really set yourself apart, keybinding is pretty low on that list as everyone should have a keybind setup that lets them get to any ability they need quickly.
---
Getting 40 decent players together at the same place at the same time and on the same page is the incredibly hard part.  Guild management drama simulator is the real end game.
---
Nice! You did a really good job
---
I didn't mean to hit 60 a few weeks after launch lol, I meant that once the first wave of people hit 60 (whenever that is), you can afford to hit 60 a few weeks after them without losing much
---
Thanks for the chuckle. I will be playing this now.
---
&gt; Just use pickpocket macros
---
What macro?
---
Who fucking cares nerddddd
---
There's no turn speed in wow (your character can spin around instantly), so you don't have to begin to turn early.  Since keyboard turning is so inaccurate, I would prefer the delay of targeting and then turning.
---
Well there is  difference in telling people that their Moonkin/Ret/Arcane/Elemental charakter won´t compete for #1 dps and the mostly aggressive adverting that you´ll never ever find a raidspot in a guild that isn´t run by imbeciles and that you should be shamed even trying and "burdening" your raidmates.
---
lol, it absolutely wasn't an outlier
---
anyone who was serious at the high end was wearing pve gear, usually as much as they could get their hands on
---
what is suicide kings?
---
Who cares when playing in a casual guild and the retri is bringing consumables to not get hardcarried trough the raid?
---
**&lt;Circle of Dominus&gt; | US PVP | Alliance**
---
Well Met Adventurers of Azeroth!
---
We welcome any adventurer looking for a **Semi-Casual** PvE/PvP Guild where you can meet new people for the ultimate Classic WoW experience. We believe in a **non-rushed**,  friendly leveling experience where both veterans and new players can  thrive. We do plan to create a progressive raid group, a PvP team, and a  social environment where everyone can enjoy the game in many different  ways. This isn't an exclusive group, but rather a fresh new guild open  to any background.
---
**Raiding**:  After reaching level 60 and creating the core raid group, we are  looking to spend two nights a week from 9-12 CST raiding, exact days  will be ironed out once the group is formed. We will use a Loot Council  for distribution of gear. We are not a hardcore group and will not  require you to grind out 24/7 or have the best gear ASAP, but we still  want members to do what's necessary in order to complete the raids. We  welcome those who never raided with open arms. We will teach you how to  properly extinguish Ragnaros, Slay Onixia, Storm Naxrammas, and many  more!
---
**PVP**:  #1 priority is to show the Horde that the Alliance is the best when it  comes to PVP combat! We are looking to form groups for Phase 3 &amp; 4  for the ultimate PVP experience. We again welcome players who never done  PVP combat and will teach them how to dispose of the Horde.
---
**Social:**  The sense of community is what makes Classic WoW a Classic. We are  inclusive to all types of players, from the hardcore Grand Marshalls and  Kel'Thuzad slayers to the curious new folks first learning about the  world of Azeroth or casually playing the game. We have a discord server  where players are encourage to hangout and chat together during their  journey, and have direct contact to the GM and Officers 24/7 for any  questions. We are not here to belittle those who don't have the grasp of  the game, but rather encourage a positive learning experience and a fun  overall adventure!
---
**LF Officers:**  If you have a good background in private servers/vanilla Raiding and  PVP and want a chance to lead/become a social icon, we are currently in  search for our future Guild officers! PM me on Reddit or Discord if  you're interested.
---
Hope to see you there!
---

PVP server you can get ganked
---
I think its in everyones best interest if they play it to at least get perspective on what the game used to be, and why it was the juggernaut that it was during it's time. Sure TBC and Wrath were more popular, but this is the game that got the ball rolling and built a foundation that crushed the competition and turned it's players into addicts. The modern games gotten away from a lot of important elements, and the genre itself isn't doing too hot. I think not only WoW but the MMORPG genre itself needs classic atm.
---
There isnt. People might say it helps w ebonrocs healing, but she only heals at all if your tanks cant press taunt at the right time. It's a very easy fight, perhaps the easiest in BWL, and its one fight. Id rather have nightfall.
---
It's literally ideal for feral druids.
---
Is that perhaps the mechanohog? Having friends with a two-seater really speeds things up, but the way you’re explaining it doesn’t seem like I’m on the same page

---
I bought boosts for mounts, does it also count?
---
Hi yes I'd like to subscribe to the facts like these
---
Everyone calls the Spellstone good in PvP (which it is!), but they often ignore that the flat +1% crit may be better than many pre-raid wands stats wise.    
---
This might not seem important but with the phased release of classic, a lot of popular wands won't be in the game yet (e.g. Touch of Chaos from ZG, Wand of Biting Cold from AV quests, etc). Which isn't to say there's no better wands, there are plenty, you just may need to farm for them (e.g. Bonecreeper Stylus from Scholo).    
---
Obviously before you hit the level cap you **need** a wand. After that however, the Spellstone might have a limited usefulness in 5 mans/very early raiding.
---
Level to 39. Now you have a twink and a bank
---
No one will watch streamers if everyone is playing. 
---
It’s a self resolving problem!!
---
I'm kind of excited to see places like Desolace, Felwood, Ashenvale, and Winterspring flourish with active players again. I have great memories of those places giving some great world pvp while leveling.
---
A friend and I got bored in wrath and timed how long it took to run from the northern tip to the southern tip of Kalimdor, staying on roads where available. We then decided to rp walk it but gave up around crossroads. I don't remember exactly but I'm pretty sure it was an hour and a half or so of a run.
---
Rwlrwlrwlrwl
---
On the first raid night of every phase you roll for ladder position. Top of the ladder gets an item they want. Then you fall to the bottom of the ladder. If you miss a raid you lose some position on the ladder.
---
shadow priest isnt needed at all, like i said. Nowadays you just have a holy spec in to it if you wanna be efficient. Feral isnt needed either. If shadow priest ends up having more representation thas not really a sign of viability. Feral are probably the hardest spec to play right and the spec that has to do the worst preparation for raids. I dont think 99% of the playerbase wants to play a cat because of that alone.
---
I think the hardest part is trying to explain to people why all of that stuff is important for making an immersive experience, and they just look at you like you're crazy.
---
First of all, lok tar. Second of all, resto druid for life
---
The difference is that even when "gated" behind a 1% drop rate, TIME is the currency used for progress. When gated by a daily, # of days logged in is your currency.  And that fundamental difference is what some people despise.
---
Eh. I hate the retail talent setup, and would much rather a Wotlk or BC setup -- because at least then there's not the perception of "worthless" classes, that actually do have a basis in reality. 
---
I'm all for people playing what they want. As long as they can acknowledge that putting in the same effort on a ret/balance/feral/elemental/shadow priest/etc would result in better DPS on another class (e.g warriors, rogues and mages). 
---
It's the dishonest people on both sides that bug me the most. The people who lie and say "you'll never find a group,” but also the people who lie and say, “I can do just as good as DPS as the spec I want, because I’ll put in more work.”
---
No. No you won’t. Play ret. Play whatever you want. But don’t piss on me and say it’s healing rain.
---
Dude we aren´t fcking fighting the zombie apocalypse, we are trying to have fun at a game.
---
What macro is this?
---
Why arent you trying to generate max TPS in the first place?
---
I have heard people saying its not until level 60, others have said that specific keys trigger the ring where other low level ones wont.
---
Doesn't appear until you loot a key, I believe.
---
Vanilla lead dev said once in his stream that wow never had an attribute system where players could put points where ever player wanted, because there was room for too many irreplaceable mistakes. It was better that each race and player had almost identical basestats because there were customization systems already in place and it would have just added one more exactly similar feature on top of everything. You make your build different with stats from gear, talents and partially racial abilities while the racial difference is insignificant stat wise.
---
He also mentioned that they thought about greater freedom for attribute and skill systems. There would have been cases where all new systems were too overwhelming if presented at the same time. Players wouldn't find the attribute and skill trees always or they would have forgot to spend their attribute and skillpoints leaving them underperforming. Also in general most people would opt for only extra damage if they had an option to either gain more power or more survivability to beat previously unbeatable mob. That way they would gain experience at faster rate as well compared to other players who took the other path and there would have been players who would have picked wrong stats altogether.
---
That's why it was better to make system more casual friendly. Now you start with one ability, learn what quests are and soon are able to purchase your first new abilities. At level 10 you would unlock talent tree and be introduced to first real customization system and start the game for real. There's no tldr. I just wrote something to kill time and try fall asleep.
---
This is true and I think a lot of people will like it, but the video game market demographic is a lot different nowadays than it was in the days of vanilla wow. I know it is not the same genre, but back in those days, people were perfectly fine playing shooters that had no unlocks or collectables or levels, while now people complain that there isn't enough to do even when some of their systems are more complex than some RPGs. 
---
I'm not saying it won't be popular. I am saying a lot of people are going to try it that just play the flavor of the month game, or that aren't actually interested in sticking around, and of course it won't click for some people. The initial numbers will be inflated because of all of the hype. I am just saying don't be disappointed or panic if the numbers drop (not that blizzard will publish them).
---
People think I'm a long pooper, no I'm a serial masturbator. Ota a vicious cycle.
---
Masturbating&gt; letting my sweat dry off and redness disappear&gt;shit stamina renewed&gt;masturbating&gt;....&gt;holy shit its been 40 minutes and my dick is purple!
---
People already know they're amazing at tanking dungeons, but they just have too many issues to be raid tanks. If you don't mind not raiding, then play Prot. Its really really good for tanking dungeons.
---
It doesn't appear until you get your first key.
---
A shadow priest becomes more valuable to a raid than a 5th warlock. They'll absolutely be used.
---
Feral cats? Not so much, ever.
---
They're not viable raiding main tanks.
---
Except there's more important stuff that is getting stickied, like the beta bugs megathread and the weekly megathreads as well. There can only be two stickies at a time.
---
This is false.
---
Diamond players in LoL (top 1%, often up to 0.4%) dont look anything like pro players, top 200 SC2 ladder players get dumpsters by pros and again, in SC2 have a style. Global CS:GO players again, look absolutely nothing like elite CS players. 
---
These are all competitive games with incredibly high skill caps, sorry. But WoW just isn't close to being one of them.
---
Saying this as someone who was multi rank 2400+ quite consistently, often hit gladiator on multiple races as someone who didn't 'tryhard' (was never my main game) WoW PvP. 
---
Anyone who isn't a clicker and knows how to properly pilot their class can do well in WoW PvP - The only 'skill' is not wasting your cooldowns, which is the only indication of a 'bad player' at higher ranks - I.E. the priest that instantly uses Ignore Pain on a sapped target.
---
Ugh. Maybe not. I'm more of a writer by nature. So this would be more like a documentary.
---
You're right though. Don't care for modern entertainment.
---
Yeah, typically people who are trying to "prove the haters wrong!!" and other such nonsense. Then proceeding to spend months leveling to 60 only to realize that ret is garbage.
---
I mean I'd love to play ret in PvE but they're just straight-up bad. Even in BIS gear they still struggle to do half the DPS of an actual DPS class.
---
Druid tanks with AQ gear are arguable better than a warrior tank, same for Naxx
---
Not many good items for druid tanks around and before MC
---
The keybind thing just gets easier the more you do it. Start simple with keys 1-4. Once you do it you’ll never go back to clicking major damage abilities.
---
Consumables and mana management. Unlike warriors, prot pallys can't just constantly sunder.
---
Idk, I started in TBC and it's like my fondest memory of any game
---
No, people on the beta have keys and no keyring. It is either very specific keys that trigger it or level 60, probably the former
---
Where manrik wife plz?????
---
Because you can only have 2 posts stickied and there's more important things to sticky than advertising this website. It's on the sidebar and that's as good as it will get.
---
Except players have keys on the beta and no keyring, so unless its very specific keys taht trigger the ring
---
I don't just want to be able to manage to clear MC and BWL, I want to do it efficiently with the lesser amount of time I have to play now.
---
Port Town?
---
False, I have seen people loot different keys on the beta and it just went into their bags. Even after looting their second key, the keyring didn't appear sadly.
---
Playing in the office while pretending to work
---
A sense of accomplishment and community interaction is the reason without getting long winded about it.

NA - PVP - CST - Horde
---
In order of leveling will be doing mage &gt; warrior &gt; rogue &gt; priest
---
Leveling/raid times: free most weekdays except Thursdays in the evenings, weekends am mostly free unless travelling. 
---
Played vanilla and burning crusade but not since. Primarily played Hunter so learning new classes.
---
Looking for someone to play with casually.
---
I agree.
---
It probably will be, they said nothing stating otherwise.
---
What software do you use to edit? Good job, looks really cool B)
---
The first thing that came to my mind was Chuck Norris jokes.
---
Also comes in handy when you're looking for quest targets you don't know the exact location of. Just target them (\/tar [mob's name] - you an wrap that in a macro and spam it), and use mind vision.
---
I was bad in vanilla. Like really bad. It was only years later through a friend did I find this out though. A good thing to get used to that really helps was key bindings for me. Setting things up as easy, and comfortable as you can for your style. Addons aren’t necessary, some people even shun them, but they can be very useful for helping newer players learn the details of what they’re doing. Also read up on fan sites. Wowhead.com will have a classic section with guides and everything to help you along the way. As long as you’re enjoying yourself to the fullest. That’s what really matters.
---
Aux is for vanilla, right? Will it work with the classic API? I'd guess that TSM is probably more likely to work for classic than AUX.
---
What classes/specs have taken the meta away from warriors, locks, mages and rogues?
---
It's for threat. 
---
I hope it works out and people take u. I know elitists will be elitists. Best of luck
---
Shaman in raids is plopping down totems then spamming chain heal, yes.
---
"support" roles are not a thing in vanilla. You're either a DPS or a healer or a tank, trying to do more than 1 will just leave you gimped at both of those things.
---
You don't need to be Enhancement to throw down windfury totem in the melee group.

Free transfers is the best answer for breaking up mega servers when phase 2 hits. But I haven’t seen a blue post on if that’s the plan or not. Which is the reason for my post. 
---
I sat in 30 min queues on Illidan back in vanilla. I don’t want to do that again at 35 when I have way less free time then I did in my 20s. But also don’t want layering past phase 1 nor do I want to be stuck on a dead server. I have not seen an answer from Blizzard on their plans for server over population when layering is closed. If there is one I haven’t come across it yet.
---
This. Now that they give previous expansions free, maybe I can try a demon hunter but thats it.
---
World PvP is active from day 1, so I'm not sure why you think adding ranks is suddenly going to change wPvP when ganking lowbies doesn't give you honor.
---
Search for will it classic. It's a site that's tracking add-ons that have been updated to work with classic.
---
Any dps class sure. You're right if you want to play a healer/tank and you want a solo way to make money an alt is probably a good idea, either to park at 35 or level to 60.
---
You can change direction with the mouse tho why used A, D? its probably faster to use the mouse even
---
That's not how it was in Vanilla.
---
1-39 get 4 slots, 40-49 get 8 slots, 50 to 60 get 12 slots.
---
From the patch notes: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.11.0
---
You know, even kiting can show a difference in skill level. Knowing when to strafe, how long to wait for your aa to shoot, etc... Just go in a starting zone and you'll see quite a lot of hunters who have no idea.
---
Do you play playstation or Xbox? Do you have to look at the controller to know what button you're pressing?
---
Really appreciate the link! You're right, so this backs up my point, where's the 4 slot key ring, and for the lvl 40's on the beta right now, the 8 slot?
---
Played vanilla and burning crusade but not since. Primarily played Hunter so learning new classes. Limited raiding experience.
---
Looking for a guild that's ok with a casual player that's relearning how to play and doesn't have super extensive experience. Looking for a group of friends to bring back the experience I had as a teenager.

I know this will be hard for you.....but Mountain Dew is not water.
---
Can you have a prot pally tank in a dungeon? Sure. They take more damage than warriors/ferals and have WAY more downtime.  I would almost always take a warrior or a druid over one.   But can they work? Yeah sure.
---
It did, it is not one of those things.
---
I can't wait til I can hang around crossroads too, but probably for different reasons since I'm ally. At least once the cap goes up I'll be able to fight the guards maybe.
---
&gt; nightfall
---
Nightfall is a pretty expensive weapon to craft.  You wont be able to get it til BWL (or even later) and even then 12 Dark Iron Bars is going to take a while, not to metion even getting the pattern.  You need to be a 300 master axesmith who is Exalted with TB.  Getting exalted with TB is no small feat on its own.  People wont have the kind of resources to get this until they are pretty much done with BWL.  And by that point you would really only want an offtank using it who isn't actually tanking.
---
Wow. So I actually had no idea he posted this. I’m OP’s buddy. I posted this to my discord of friends who already know my strengths and play styles. 
---
To put things into context:
---
I played rogue in vanilla through WOTLK where I swapped mains to death knight. I played rated arena as a death knight (all WOTKL tabard except relentless, s8 glad) and pushed server raiding profession as a rogue. Guild fell apart mid cata and rogue was basically shelved for good. 
---
Full time swap to pvp where I mained DK to this day (unsubbed for both wod and legion season 2 through the end of their respective expansions). My most successful in MOP (also think it was the best arena expansion) with 3 glad titles on dk, and played warrior to 2700 as well. 
---
My favorite iteration of both rogue and warrior is probably WOTLK . I know vanilla war isn’t dramatically or mechanically different.
---
Most recently playing shadow priest, I love the arena feel to it. High utility with heavy spread pressure and good single target burst.  Feels like MOP dk. 
---
Favorite comps (over the years) to play have been RPS PHDK SHADOWCLEAVE. Contrasting to most success found in PHDK SHADOWCLEAVE TSG (success really only found on warrior and dk). 
---
I do not like live warrior, and I don’t really like live dk. I think live rogue is fun. Live shadow priest is by far my favorite. Though these days I’m pretty washed.  
---
 I’d say doing maximum unhealable damage is appealing to my play style, but I’m also a technical player who takes full advantage of the the utility kits my classes have had over the years. 
---
Rogue was out of the question until I saw the perplexity 5 video. Now I can’t make a decision. That CC the entire team style seems very rewarding. 
---
 And here we are, but now with context 😎
---
My favorite is going to be getting jumped by a comparable level alliance while grinding, killing them, and then cannibalize corpse.
---
No not even on pvp servers in horde territory horde has to flag to get ganked.
---
I dont know man I dont know, I play games so I can take the edge off. Instant gratification is the exact reason I play them, drink alcohol, jerk off. If I wanted to do something long, slow and tedious I would hit the gym and try to get better at my job or hobbies.
---
One thing i can think about is totem quests slow you down a bit.
---
Yeah, it is fun.
---
It's basically impossible to lose an account unless it's not in your name (like my original account wasn't...). If it was in your name you just scan your ID and send it to them and they'll give it back.
---
TBH I'm not sure but I know people did/do all sorts of runs. Lord Incendius, MC attunement, Emp, Arena, Quest runs, Plugger runs (rogues normally), coffer runs. But that doesn't cover all of the bosses I don't think, and on top of that you can get to different places via different skips which I don't remember. There's flipping the big gear going upstairs and jumping, there's at least one lava jump (which I don't know if it will work due to lava damage changes over time, I think the modern client has a better way to figure out if you should take lava damage, so they'd need to nerf it back to vanilla), and a couple short drops in the dark coffer area.
---
That place is quite overwhelming at times, especially when there's no in game map, and I didn't know there was a mod for a map, albeit without a marker for yourself. I really want to delve deeply in there, but I also have limited chunks of time, like 2 hours at a time, so the odds aren't great outside of specific shorter runs, like MC Attunement or whatever.
---
Edit: good gave me some good results.

---
If you aren't #1 you're shit.
---
&gt;As long as they can acknowledge that putting in the same effort on a ret/balance/feral/elemental/shadow priest/etc would result in better DPS on another class (e.g warriors, rogues and mages).
---
Only problem with that is those classes are heavily over-represented as it is. I'd rather have another buff/dispel from a ret then another fury warrior of which I'd have a mile long line to pick from.  And if that ret is showing up with full consumes/enchants, etc, it shows me he at least gives a shit, which goes a long way, imo.
---
Honestly, just see all the.optimisations as people knowing about classic release for over a year now and are.just hyped for its release. 
---
I'm reading through a lot of thoerycrafting channels and most of these are communities with 1000-3000 max - a lot of these are just on-lookers like myself.
---
In the top 50 or so guilds? Yeah, expect to not get a raid slot unless your playing War/Priest/Mage/Rogue and a select few Druids/Hunters/Pala/Shams. With few exceptions, of which if you have to ask, likely no, you wont get a slot on a serious raiding guild as a Moonkin.
---
Any other guild? As long as you dont wipe, and do more dps than a tank toy will be taken.
---
I don't think anyone will quit for good, like i said most people will do what the new patch brings to retail then come back to Classic. Don't underestimate the amount of people who are dying to play WoW but can't find anything worth doing after clearing the latest raid.
---
&gt; There was NEVER a point in ANY raids I've ever done on anything where we needed a ret pally.
---
There was a time where having exactly one ret paladin was useful for BoK. But that ret paladin still wore +healing gear and healed, never once trying to pretend to actually do damage.
---
One thing I'd like to know that this video doesn't cover is whether Decursive-like addons will work as they did for the 1.12 version of the API or as they do on the live version. I imagine private server players are able to use the old version that makes the curse trivial but I don't think that works with the modern API.
---
I just like how in Vanilla and TBC you had to work and earn your gear and with no LFR/LFG you got to know people on your server intimately and built relationships and worked for getting everything... nothing was handed to you on  a silver platter.
---
I honestly look forward to seeing how things go with dungeons and raids and people try to zerg and not use CC or play smart.
---
Layering will flip off, queues will turn on, more servers will be released and (paid) transfers will open up
---
lmao go play on a pve server you baby
---
Idk, it was added in a patch prior to the one we are getting so it should be there for sure
---
Yeah. For some similarity, think of Hemorrhage. It increases the damage done by physical attacks by X for 30 hits.
---
The difference is that ISB is a proc from crits instead of an applied ability, and only affects shadow damage, while Hemorrhage is an ability and only affects physical damage.
---
I think the instance in talking about is some fortnite streaming “star” just reporting people because he thought if he died the person must be watching his stream and usually fortnite actually banned the players without any proof. I don’t remember his name it’s like frost or something.
---
Edit; it was Ninja
---
Then you get to bosses that are actually hard where no one can be carried anymore and it seems ridiculous
---
Yes, but probably by the same margin other classes are slowed down by their own class quests. Plus, we get Ghost Wolf to make the travel time less intense.
---
Rogue because stealth op
---
IIRC death coil isn't learned until 42 or so, and siphon life is deep in the Affliction tree. You're not wrong, but this post is about an early leveling journey.
---
Main Tank holds most of the raid mobs attention. But especially the main boss or whatever the main damage output from a raid fight is. They take it all.
---
Off tank helps with stragglers who might rush off after a healer or cloth dps like a mage.
---
You also may help with large waves of smaller mobs while the main tank takes the actual boss itself. Many bosses summon minions to fight so you will often help deal with them. But not tanking the main bosses top tier damage.
---
Or you may take the boss off the main tank during a difficult part to give your healers a chance to heal the Main Tank who should quickly come back in to take threat away from the off tank.
---
And if none of that needs doing, then you're just outputting as much damage as you can which ass an off tank usually means you're more built for the diverse role of damage and tanking rather than just tanking.
---
Don't get me wrong, 15 is just as obnoxious as 20.
---
Longest zone in the game by far.
---
Right, but what rule would they be breaking?  Or are you asking for the ToS to be changed?
---
·  I have been playing since vanilla. I was hunter class lead in my  vanilla guild and got up to the last few bosses in AQ40 before BC  dropped. I have had top 300 kills in BC and cleared everything. Missed  all of cata and most of mop. Raided mythic in WOD, and legion, but  haven't picked up BFA.
---
· I  know my class; I come prepared to raids and don't miss raids. I work  hard to be the best raider I can be and to help the guild be successful  in any capacity. I'm looking for a fun group of people to down some  bosses. Message me and we can talk. Thanks for taking the time to read  :)
---
Welcome back
---
Imagine playing a different mana class. You'd have to pay money to drink. At least you can conjure it.
---
Which is a major issue when combined with no threat.
---
yeah that's what I did
---
i just thought so much time had passed that they wouldn't be able to restore it
---
There's no probably about it. Keyboard turning is painfully slow. Even with the sensitivity down low, the mouse is going to be significantly faster
---
Night elf priest?  yOu'Ll NeVeR geT a RaId SpoT
---
Yep. I know there will be tons of folks hyped to speed level but I think it misses the point of classic for me. It’s gonna be cool hanging with people in the open world again.
---
They should've made the Ret holy damage aura boost damage AND healing from holy spells. Then you could totally make an argument for grouping a ret paladin with the priest/paladin healers.
---
One of my favorite battles from back in the day was a fight between a bunch of us lvl 20s in Stonetalon
---
A good ret paladin can't be snared by a mage and will outlast in a war of attrition. Between cleanse, BoF, DS and healing and judgements a paladin can stick to a mage pretty well. Just need to AA them to deal with SoC procs and HoJ the Evo.
---
Not a bad player, him clicking all his spells say otherwise, takes him ages to cast some spells lol.
---
As a former tauren shaman, that range is huge against casters but it's just a pain against warriors and rogues.  
---
No way to kite them, which you'd want to as you lose most straight up brawls. Not to mention the huge disadvantage for your other 2/3 specs.
---
You're not wrong.
---
when those locks get to 30, head to STV and get camped by an UD rogue(deathcoil at 42) with 0 chance of counterplay they will reroll quicksmart.
---
I’m interested ! 
---
Shaman here from 2004
---
Shadow is totally fine for what you'd be doing with it, with the option to heal when you wanted to.
---
Gotcha. Well, for now you can consider me interested. Initial class pick would have been mage, but I'll definitely go Enh mascot for a guild if using HoR.
---
I'm an adult, always prepared for raids, likes PvE and PvP and I've been playing off and on since 12/31/2004 and have a handful of server firsts sprinkled throughout several expansions. If you need any more info let me know.

And what is that addon when you speak to the horse lady. Her dialogue. Thanks.
---
yeah but most of them are kinda optional for other classes, kinda need totems tho. Same with druid forms.

I can't see anything here, it appears to be a Barren canvas
---
By 5ghz I speak about wifi, it's non sense in mobile 5g only means generation 5.
---
I dont see why your guild wouldnt have those mats by the release of BWL.  Any good guild will have multiple. Weak argument. If your raid doesn't have nightfall, then sure you can use an arms warrior in AQ. You will still be pushing better debuffs off but less impactful. But once mages are fire in AQ, pushibg off ignite is unacceptable even if you dont gave nightfall.
---
I remember getting to the first dungeon when I first played Zelda (I was 6). We were convinced it was the end of the game. 
---
Atari games did not prepare you for games with a lot of levels.
---
This should be a stickied comment. Unless you have aspirations of being in a world first guild with content that was cleared already over a decade ago then play whatever you want.
---
A good and competent player is valuable over someone who players a FOTM spec and sucks.
---
Good dps is alive and self-sufficient dps.
---
You drew Westfall wrong.
---
Play whatever class and race you want

There's an experimental version for the newer API out:

---
i dont think it does but with the mouse clicking healing addons like vuhdo you can set like middle mouse button to decurse the target you´re hovering over on your raidframe which is basically the same th ing
---
It gets 10% of +healing, which is pretty much nothing.
---
You werent mocking me. The intent of your post is clear. You just have poor reading comprehension and are now covering it up.
---
Aye, but imo you shouldnt go STV at 30. Usually when I go STV too early I run out of quests and feel helpless around lvl 40. On alliance that is, cant remember how it wa son horde.
---
The correct answer isn't up for discussion.
---
The odds of your next 7 jumps being flips is 5^7 
---
The odds of getting 7 in a row if you are jumping around is 5^6 
---
So in practice the odds of getting a 7 streak flip if you are jumping around is definitely 5^6
---
Whipper Root Tuber?
---
That’s a very good point.
---
Kinda. Depends on what you consider a bug or an exploit. It was a little joke but wall jump was not fixed and a bunch of little things.
---
At least you can summon your own water, and you can probably burn down a mob and drink faster than a pally could kill the same mob.
---
Mana starts to regen after 5 seconds of not casting. If you get a good wand and finish mobs off with that (hopefully while they are still slowed and walking toward you), then you'll use less mana and it will start regenerating while you finish the fight.
---
You'll still have to drink, but you may be able to drink less often.
---
I'm fairly sure the tanks were switched into groups with 4 hunters so they can battleshout for threat on AoE fights like Nefarian and Fankriss.
---
Server cap used to be 2.5-3K. If you have 4 layers of active subs now all on one server it’s going to be a problem. 
---
Good luck getting black lotus when there are literally 100s of other dudes farming the same nodes in the same zone. If they don’t offer transfers off of mega servers it’s going to be a problem.
---
 I’m fine with same server layering for phase 1. But what happens to an 8 layer server that doesn’t have major player drop off before phase 2? 2 hour queue times? Even if you double the max server cap you are still going to have massive queue times. That’s a problem that I haven’t seen a blue post on it yet.
---
The only advice to give is learn to use a keyboard man.  If you don't know where keys are idk how you can play a game where you have to hit more than just the keys your fingers rest on.
---
Still holding onto mine on retail, waiting for the perfect opportunity after 14 years...
---
Exactly my tougths! Raiding with a guild in retail is still the best coop experience any game can offer rn.
---
Bad boi
---
Siphon life is obtainable at 30. And Deathcoil at 42, correct. But taking on elites 8-10 levels above you is just for the hell of it. It's definitely realistic to be soloing elites in yellow range.
---
I just want to be viable and not get blasted in the @#$ by every horde faceroller, and I would like to be chosen for premades. If human spriest isn't viable for this, ill probably have to settle on a human rogue.
---
Sometimes you need to go backwards, to go forward.
---
I disagree with you. Outside of SC2, which I cannot comment on because I do not follow or even pretend to know anything about that game, pros, top .01%, and top 1% players all generally look the same. The separation is usually execution and communication, not still or knowledge. Being able to predict ults, rotations, and positioning or players is what separates players in a game like OW. Something that doesn't translate visually most of the time unless you generally understand what's going on at a high level. Diamond players definitely are more aggressive and take less favorable trades, but you have to be educated on what the actually means to pick out the differences between a diamond 2 player and a pro. 
---
If you are genuinely a former glad, I think you're down playing the difference between glads and people at 2200-2400. I am a former glad. When I watch rogues play, I can almost immediately tell who knows what's going on, and who is just there because of the class/comp. Positioning, energy pooling, swap calls... All of that is just at a different level when you watch a player who performs consistently enough to stay in top .1%
---
All that taken into account, unless you have that micro knowledge of the game, it will still look the same. I'm sure if I went and watched a pro SC2 players and someone in platinum (I think that's a rank?) I probably wouldn't know any different. But that's because I don't know the game at a high level... And most people don't know games at a high level. Remember... 1% of retail vanilla raided. Only 1%
---
I have not seen ANYTHING but speculation and a slow trend towards more people stating it as fact. Has all the earmarks of a rumor.
---
some fights ( ZG for example) Hunters need to keep viper sting up to drain the bosses mana to keep them from spell casting.
---
Both are good levelers. Hunter is a faster leveler for sure, lots of mobility and can handle multiple mobs if he gets extra aggro. 
---
Priests pretty much never have to drink once they get Spirit Tap. Some people find the leveling boring because its Power Word Shield &gt; Front Loaded spell Damage &gt; Shadow Word Pain &gt; Wand until dead.
---
I really like leveling Priests because its so efficient. You aren't killing super duper fast, but you have zero down time.
---
I would pick Hunter personally. Its more casual friendly, so is Warlock. Pets are really useful. Shadow Priests are great in PvP especially 1v1's, but they're really gear dependent imo. Anyone who told you Shadow Priests are a meme PvP spec is an idiot. They're ridiculously powerful.
---
In Battlegrounds though, I personally would prefer a more supportive spec priest as opposed to a Shadow Priest. I personally think Shadow Priest shine more in duels and wPvP.
---
Hunters also have massively better gold farming potential over a Priest.
---
I’m so torn! I played horde for years Bc-pandas but I wanna play pally again which means alliance
---
A meme spec but useful for 85+% of max level content? Hmmm...
---
Lmao there are plenty people like me and u will have trouble Finding a group with underpowered classes like drood or pally.
---
And the and of the day its min/maxing if u dont go for meta, dont expect to see endgame content. THATS classic, get used to it. Good Luck avoind that.
---
I honestly don't know what "casual" is now a days. Some people think anything less than 8 hours a day is casual, while others think less than 3 days a week is casual. What's 3 hours a night?
---
its sad.. druida are og tanks in dungeons
---
I'm all for the occasional ganking. What's dumb is people that build for and spend countless hours ganking lowbies because they cant win a fair fight.
---
Well if premades concern you yeah, it's going to be hard work getting into premades as a spriest.
---
I remember a lot of lower level keys didn't ever go in the key ring, it was mostly the level 50-60 ones that you actually needed to keep.
---
Yes, they announced that at the last blizzcon. They had said that if the tech at the time had allowed more they would have. But, to keep the same feel of the game as before they are going to keep it at 16 because otherwise it could completely change the fights.
---
What's to stop the mage from constantly reseting the fight?
---
I'm just picturing a lot of rank 1 frostbolts spam to force cleanses.
---
No it’s not that bad. Play whatever you want.
---
In PvP racials matter the most and for this scenerio dwarf and undead would be best.
---
But picking a different race won’t stop you from reaching a specific tier.
---
Most likely you’ll do better as something you like because you’ll be more interested and invested into your character driving you to be better.
---
Not really
---
I really hope they don’t try to monetize server population balancing.
---
Why do people give this answer?  He's asking questions and you're just spamming because you think everyone is as casual as you.  Saying LOL DO WAT U WANT is just spam dude, what he wants is to play a good combo and that's why he's asking about it.
---
Shadow priests melt face in pvp
---
Ratchet and Booty Bay were always my favorite, they have character.  
---
Maybe i just like pirates. And Goblins.  And Goblin Pirates.
---
Thanks guys I showed him the post/poll.
---
Did some googling to find these "smarter methods" you refer to here, and of course they are private server stuff that include /sit abuse to get permanent enrage which will not work in Classic. And even then, there seems to be disagreement; some people say you take way too much damage doing that for it to be efficient, which was my reaction. So meh.
---
If you're new to warrior, I don't think planning your leveling around a very specific build or rotation is a very good idea. If a new player reads what you wrote and tries to do your method once they get Cleave at level 20, they're going to be even slower, not faster.  They won't understand why they're doing it or why it works. They'll probably die more. Better to go with a build that just gives you lots of rage to play with so you can learn the class, and then respec around 35 or 40 once you understand the basics if you want to git gud.
---
That's all?
---
I really like how you drew the mountains

Well, I personally think if you're min-maxing a Shadow Priest you'd go Troll on Horde for the extra Blackout procs from Shadowguard. 
---
Racials don't matter very much. If you want to min-max PvP on Alliance its Dwarf. Beyond that just pick what you think is prettiest. I personally only play Night Elf Priests because they're pretty and Shadowmeld + Mind Control is the most fun thing in the game for me.
---
In short, no you don't need Devouring Plague to be a good Shadow Priest.
---
Agreed. It's weird flexing.
---
I'm quite sure the guy above you is trolling.
---
I played vanilla-wotlk as a resto druid, leveled a few alts and got a feral druid to 60 on a private server so I have experience and don't necessarily need a casual friendly class. 
---
Yeah thats my main concern doing mostly Bg's is that a shadow priest won't actually be as good as I think it will.
---
I've also been wondering, /camp reset will not work in vanilla. For hunter mauradon farming is it pretty easy to get out of the dungeon after killing rotgrip without wasting too much time?
---
Suddenly, mind vision.
---
What do I think? I think we'd just see thousands of threads going

"wahhhh rehashed content"

"wahhhh blizzard are reusing models/zones/NPCs/etc"

No ty.

I believe female dwarf is still pretty rare even though Dwarf Priest is one of the most mandatory race/class combos so you could always do that.
---
Well my BTO/PTO is approved, 14 days straight to drink Monster Zero and no life as hard as possible before all the responsibilities come crashing back down

Comrades, don't stray from the commune and fall into u/NostalgiaSchmaltz's trap of individualism. Alert the politburo!

Then youd have like 40 raids worth of gear to balance every xpac.  Sounds like a huge dev time sink
---
It's just bugged atm and it has been reported a lot of times already, so i'm sure that blizz is aware of it :P
---
Claiming that anyone's enjoyment of something is completely nostalgia is a pretty dumb argument no matter what it's about.
---
Personally I never played vanilla WoW. I was playing EverQuest and Dark Age of Camelot at the time, and for players of those games WoW was seen as the casual-friendly hand holding MMO for normies. 
---
A friend begged me to play with him a bit during TBC, and it was alright, but the game was pretty much what I expected it to be. I then moved on to a bunch of other MMORPGs that were heralded as "the next big thing" but they all just ended up being poor WoW clones.
---
I even wrote articles about how WoW probably ruined the MMORPG genre permanently. But a few years ago, there was a lot of hype surrounding Nostalrius and I didn't have much else going on at the time so I decided to see what vanilla WoW was like.
---
And something happened that I didn't expect - I had fun. Vanilla WoW was actually really fun. And to this day I regret not giving it a chance when it originally released. Sure, there are a lot of things that I don't like, and things that I think games like EverQuest and Dark Age of Camelot did better, but believe me that I'm just as excited for Classic WoW as all of you.
---
So, nostalgia isn't a factor for me but I'm still highly anticipating Classic. I'm sure nostalgia is a *part* of why a lot of the rest of you want to play Classic, but to suggest that it's the only reason is just obviously horseshit.
---
Have to (not really HAVE TO) carry 2 sets of gear if needed to heal? Yeah its a stretch. Druid in 1.12 is possibly the best QoL leveling character.
---
Thanks for saying my own point back to me.
---
Hunter is the the faster leveling experience and perhaps one of the most self-sufficient classes for farming and quests. It’s not a bad option especially if you’re casual but they don’t scale as well later on. They might be perfect for you if you’re just having fun and not raiding hardcore. 
---
Priests are certainly powerful and decent levelers themselves. They’re viable healers and dps. Another good option.
---
What class/race were you on dragonblight? I was horde but I think I remember your guild name from ally
---
What patch did they add the Alliance flight point to Ratchet?
---
I love elemental shaman, it was my main from late BC into every further wow expansion, but the useful place for an elemental shaman is a battleground, not a raid 😭

mankrik did it

Everlook is my favorite, goblin town in the snowy north. Area 52 in TBC was cool too..

---
**Time zone**: Australian Eastern Daylight Time
---
**Guild Type**: Semi-hardcore

If you are interested in joining just pop in the channel and write to us or message me directly on Discord.
---
Don't prot pallies generate threat just for being attacked with Holy Shield, Retribution aura, and Blessing of Sanctuary? I don't know how that compares to sunder spam, but it seems like it would be pretty good at threat gen. The lack of a taunt would just mean that'd you'd need to watch a threat tracker like a hawk.
---
Unless the support is feral druid with a rogue with a NE hunter that has a pet that can shadow meld as well. God I loved camping my own flag amd/or protecting the FC as a hunter that could go unseen. Just amazing to be able to see the rogue coming from afar on my radar and pinpoint him out before he could go into the shadows.
---
Loved killing those armorless STV gorillas to level my warrior. I'm 2 levels over them? More must die!
---
I’ve leveled through so many times I’m starting to hate it TBH ): 
---
This zone and stonetalon are making me wanna run alliance because horde get bottle necked here so on a fresh it’s brutal!
---
If you're smart enough to pick human, you should be smart enough to attack from behind.
---
They will, I mean, We've been paying $25 bucks for an automated service for 12 years.
---
I heard the most vulgar conversation ever on the barrons chat. I'm still scared from it today. This zone is the reason why I only play alliance.
---
I intend to do herbs while tailoring. Going to spec in hemp production.
---
I'm a tank. So that might be difficult... but I'll do my best...
---
Depends on how you’ll spend those 3 hours. Are you going to be adventuring and farming gold? Or will you put all 3 hours into just PvP, or do a raid a day? Or spend 1.5 hours on both PvE and PvP?
---
Not casual. Like you said casual is skewed heavily. I think like you said about three days a week would be casual play.  If you play more than 4 hours a day, let’s call it what it is , extreme.

Yeah probably but I had the feeling that it was getting ignored so nothing wrong with giving it some extra attention so it gets fixed : )

Crossrooooads take me home
---
Don't go too far fast guys, it's not like there is another Wow Vanilla to release again after that
---
perception will kill a rogue when you know he is there (cuz he is bad) some of the time. stun resist can change the result of a fight vs any class that relies on stuns which is pally, rogue, warrior, shadow priest, feral druid, etc. perception is no where near as good as hardiness
---
Warcraft 3 while they work on the 4th
---
For the time it'd take me to level and gear a whole other character i can grind enough to respec weekly for at least a year..
---
Can't you have fun and like each other when preferring an optimized raid as well?
---
Then\*
---
Id argue in content where people shouldnt die regularly (5 man dungeons) druid is equal to priest in healing if not better. MotW is a better group buff than fort, thorns does a lot for tank threat, able to dip into 5 second rule more than others, NS as an oh shit button, innervate is such a good CD.
---
But as soon as a res is needed, problems.
---
A good mage can't lose against a warrior though, so I don't know. From my experience leveling one 2 years ago, some are ok matchup if you can charge and are 263 levels above, but if you can't charge it's dead.
---
People have bug reported it. Blizzard will probably get around to it, hopefully.
---
Thanks, mom

**[Horde] [EU] [PVE-Server]**
---
**&lt; Wipe in progress &gt;**
---
&lt;WIP&gt; is a freshly formed guild, created by people tired of drama. Raiding should be a fun and social event, where difficulty comes from killing bosses, not from navigating a Game of Thrones - like maze of officer politics. So if you want a guild that aims for steady (but non-hardcore) raiding progress, read on!
---
We aim to raid on **Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays 21:30-00:30 EU Server Time (20:30-23:30 UK time).** Our aim is to eventually clear all the content, and we have experienced players and raid leaders to guide people towards that goal. We will be happy to teach newer and inexperienced people, all we ask is that you approach raiding and preparation with effort and dedication, and show same respect towards other people (and their time) as they do to you!
---
We expect our raiders to attend most of the raids, however will be understanding if life gets in the way - just please let us know in advance, so we can adjust and prepare.
---
Our main 40man raids will use EPGP system for loot distribution, while our alt/20man raids will be rolling for items (barring a few exceptional items).
---
Most important rule of our guild is to follow Wheaton's Law: **Dont be a dick**.
---
(It is however perfectly fine, and at times expected to call someone else a dick!).
---
We are currently **open to recruit most of the classes and roles!** - and we always accept social applications from anyone willing to join us!
---
So if you're ready to hear immature jokes about toasters, have fun doing dungeons and quests with your guildies, and work towards good raiding progress - please come check us out!
---
https://discord.gg/hSS95Ev
---
Feel free to message me here or on Discord (Thirteenera#8084)
---
Some sort of threat watcher is mandatory for pretty much EVERYONE once you start running dungeons or raids; tank, healer, DPS, doesn't matter. There's no other way to know your threat beyond when someone pulls aggro, which is too late to matter.
---
But it's not a gold sink which affects all classes equally, therefore it's a horrible goldsink.
---
You and me both buddy,
---
That's what I thought
---
&gt; LFR for example. Players asked for it, but at the same time this change killed part of the social interaction that Vanilla had, and that made WoW unique. 
---
But how? LFR (Looking for Raid) was designed for players that were not in raiding guilds or those that didn't have enough time to complete real raids. There's a significant time investment involved with getting your character ready to raid, and then getting into an organized guild that can do the raid, and then completing the raid. 
---
LFR just lets you do it on easy mode. It has ***zero*** impact on everyone else on the game and only positively benefits the players who I mentioned earlier. 
---
Does it feel bad for you because players get to experience the game at a different level than what you think they should be allowed to do?
---
&gt; like some Class Changes through out expansions that dumbed down some classes/specs
---
Like what? One thing that Blizzard did was give certain group buffs across several classes, that way you weren't required to take a particular class and didn't feel "unoptimized" if you didn't have that particular class in your raid. 
---
&gt; iLVL made your gear goals more "souless", you are just turning it to numbers.
---
That was already happening in the game anyway. Players started to use an addon that would put your gear on an "item level". It got popular enough to where a large portion of the player base had it. Not having it would ostracize you from certain group activities. 
---
&gt; Players stopped looking for that X Weapon that made them excited and just started thinking about the iLVL that they had to achieve.
---
They still look for that X weapon because your weapon is still super important. Maybe not so much for Legion, but each expansion had ***the*** weapon that you were looking for. 
---
&gt; I really hope Classic thrives and that it can help Retail to be a better game, because I love mmorpgs and I really dont want this game genre to die.
---
Blizzard anticipates for Classic to have a large influx of players at first, and then for it to start to lose interest after a couple of months. Classic still suffers from a lot of problems and in general only the most hardcore of Classic players will want to play once the game has be released for a number of months. It was a game designed for people that had a lot of time to spend on the game, and most people don't have that kind of time anymore.
---
What they will be looking at will be things like what kinds of quests people choose to do at which point. So, for example, Redridge has a quest for Alliance that sends you to an Elite area to kill orcs for a couple of quests. It is legit a difficult series of quests that requires at minimum 4 people and a proper team comp. 
---
At launch, this quest area will be relatively easy to do since their will be a huge influx of players and classes, but what about 6 months from launch? A year? There won't be nearly enough players to make that quest even doable. This is exactly why they revamped all of the stater zones in Cata. There were hundreds of quests that people just were not doing because there wasn't enough players on. Ideally you want the work you put into quests to last and be doable no matter what direction the game takes. That's just smart game design.
---
So if I were them, I'd pay attention to the data that shows about the point where people stopped doing those group quests, and then figure out a way to implement a scaling or sliding bar quest system for certain quests. That way you retain the difficulty and social aspect of the harder quest, while still making it doable for when the zones are not as populated.
---
That's what I mean by "researching player behavior" with Classic. There is likely not going to be a single thing you'll find in Classic make its way on to retail 1 for 1.
---
Paid transfers. You will pay one way or the other, cause classic is amazing, and playing wow on a dead server is horse shit. But never being able to loot a black lotus because there are 40 people standing on each spawn point is also horse shit, And you're 35 and probably can afford it while you couldn't in your 20s.
---
Only getting paid 5 times over here before I can resume spending money on wow!
---
I played a Warlock from Vanilla to S4 BC (When I switched to the Rogue) and it is a lot of fun, pretty easy to level, and very useful. But I'm not repeating that choice as there are a couple things I don't want to deal with again:
---
* Farming Soul Shards for raid
---
* Dealing with dumb pet AI 
---
* Pets dying mostly by getting 1-shot by AoE
---
* Macro'ing pet abilities in general
---
* Not being able to use DoTs so you end up spamming SB
---
* Wondering if I should've just rolled a Mage
---
If you're doing mostly 5-man content and PvP Warlock is one of the best classes IMO. Perhaps the best. But if you want to raid I found it honestly pretty disappointing because you don't even get to use half of your class' toolkit.
---
That's a badass staff what is it?
---
It also works against them too though, a tauren trying to run away can be hit from his attacker from farther away.
---
Well most of the hybrid classes are good at one or the other (pvp/pve), so people might be rolling a hybrid with pvp in mind, and there will definitely be plenty of those. 
---
Ret is pretty good in pvp, and spriest is one of the best pvp specs in the game. Both of those specs would typically just raid as off-heals. 
---
Even classes other classes that aren't hybrids will have similar situations. Fire mage is basically useless in MC but there will be plenty of fire mages raiding and doing ass-dps spamming frostbolt.
---
What your post is really referring to is raiding only, and yeah I agree that if all you are doing is raiding it would be kind of silly to play a class/spec combo that is known to be bad. Pvp is still a big part of the game in classic though, and that is where a lot of the hybrid specs shine. I'm just saying I don't think those players will have a difficult time finding raid spots.
---
I do, that's my main computer. But my phone is always with me and this would let me play a game I enjoy to fill idle time when out and about.
---
The portal to MC is huge, or the NPC just ports you in

What if you're a philanthropic priest or other type of philanthropic buffer? You'd have the duality to either go against your philanthropic principles as well as let your doodes die, or help and get PvP flagged.
---
Looking forward to seeing IF busy again, favorite city by far 😊 always fun to see these recovered characters — not too much longer! (Well, it’ll always be too long but one day at a time right?)
---
They are great for passive aoe threat generation. And combined with blessing of salvation on party members (reducing their generated threat by 30%), yeah, they should almost always hold threat. But if you lose it, you have nothing but your cunning to get it back.
---
Unless you're farming 8+ hours a day and go into every boss using 3+ potions and full consumes every pull, your sentiment is straight up irrelevant. At that point, why are you bothering with full consumes nonstop to clear MC/BWL? Its the same logic, why spend all that extra time on wasted consumes for content that's piss easy? That seems like a bigger waste of time than bringing a few specs that can't hit the highest highs. 
---
I get what you mean on clearing faster, but you're talking top 1% guilds. Your average private server guild, even your average Naxx private server guild, is fucking dogshit. If you havent played high end retail since MoP, you would have no clue just how dogshit private server guilds are. The mechanics and difficulty creep that exists in the modern game has dwarfed the difficulty of any encounter in classic. Most mechanics from Classic have been reused over and over and over in modern raiding, paired with numerous other overlapping lethal abilities. 
---
You're talking competitive guilds, but those competitive guilds are sub 1% of the population. Most Naxx guilds aren't at the level of competition you're talking about. 
---
Like trust me, I'm no stranger to high end raiding, I can link some of my good logs if you want, the level of play you're talking about, where you need a defined meta, only exists in the absolute elite of the elite guilds. Most guilds cannot field a roster of 40 good players on a regular basis. Most servers won't be able to field a guild you're talking about. 
---
I know why there's a meta, there's always a meta, but my entire point is that the 'metagame' is designed for top 1% players, and it's pretty much straight up irelevant from any level of play below that. I'm not saying 'bring a pure memespec raid and stack boomkin' I'm saying that a good boomkin will beat an average mage. A good ret will beat an average fury. Player effort and skill will always trump the class they play in terms of usefulness. 
---
In most guilds, including naxx clearing guilds, there's such a massive disparity between the best and worst players in the guild that a genuinely good hybrid player can usually sit in the top 25% of the dps. If you want to go to Speedrunning guilds as a standard, sure, rets and other hybrids dont fair as well, but that's because the content is effectively PvP and not PvE at that point.
---
The problem is you can’t reset the dungeon quickly as /camp doesn’t make you exit the dungeon. At least what I know so far from seeing people play the beta.
---
Also, could you imagine going 15 years without ever upgrading your weapon because Thunderfury is BiS for every raid tier?
---
Devouring Plague is a niche PvP spell on a long CD. Its not going to make or break you in BG's. I think Fear Ward and Shadowguard are better. Personally I think if you're interested in playing Priest in premades, that going a holy/disc spec is just objectively better if we're getting into a min/max discussion.
---
Also premades tend to not take many Rogues. Its a spot you'd have to fight for usually. Honestly its the same way for shadow priest.
---
Sorry, your arguments seemed inconsistent otherwise, so I assumed you made the point that would make your arguments consistent.
---
There likely wasn’t a stealth nerf. Instead, as you just agreed, players probably just got better gear and became more knowledgeable over the year ~ year and a half between the patches you listed.
---
Nobody ever argues that they can't tank 5-mans. This isn't contrarian and this definitely isn't an unpopular opinion.
---
5G mobile is 3.5GHz—this is just the frequency of the signal. 
---
Regardless:
---
5G mobile is slotted to do 430 mb/s download, you’ll be able to stream games on it.
---
There's like two or three fights in a raid that they are useful to have in. That's out of all raids.
---
They are great in a dungeon and you can gear them up easy in raids as Holy.
---
If you want to be that sweet fast clear tank on your server for dungeons then raid as Holy, get T2 and then go Prot for 5-10 man's. You'll be popular.
---
But know your place in raids.
---
Cringe is a verb.
---
Chuck Norris doesn't need to kill Zhevras; they bring their hooves to him.
---
No, on Pservers too
---
urgh, that sounds horrible.
---
Yes I know, thank you :)

---
That’s Benediction, a priest only class staff you get from a quest chain.
---
I think the complaint is less about classic being more challenging that retail (because its not) its more about classic being more dangerous. Its much easier to die on classic which makes the world feel more challenging even if the gameplay is still really easy. Perhaps it could be said that both are very easy but classic is more punishing?
---
One boomkin with the mages.
---
I was four and my mom introduced me, and I've been hooked ever since
---
Thing is, in vanilla you will lose threat at one point or another that’s just how it is. But with no taunt you’re just swinging away hoping to regain Aggro which the other 2 tanks just don’t have to worry about. No taunt is a massive issue that really holds back prot pallys.
---
Good luck balancing 50+ raids with each additional tier every patch
---
Same here, think what I’m most excited for is the social aspect mentioned while questing, dungeons, pvp, etc. I’ve played a lot of MMOs over the years but nothing has really ever come close to the community and social experience I remember from playing Vanilla
---
It did threat in vanilla. Even repeated applications.
---
&gt;Hunter
---
Huh? Sure, you have less bag space than other classes, but I never found it to be too much of an issue. Also, "high food consumption for pets" what? Once your pet hits max loyalty level (about 6 hours /played) you only need to feed it every hour or so. There's also plenty of ranged weapons, what are you talking about?
---
&gt;Priest, no easy upgrades 24-40
---
Lesser/Greater Mystic Wand. A few horde-specific quest ones too.
---
&gt;Druid
---
Long/difficult? Bearform quest isn't difficult at all, takes maybe 30 minutes max for the entire chain. Same with aquatic form. Cat form doesn't have a quest.
---
How was being a Druid main in classic? From what I’ve seen it’s going to be the least played class upon release because it’s perceived to be under powered. Your thoughts on your end game experience and pvp?
---
I  will suffer from if need be.
---

---
Preach that good talk man.

This sub is stupid sometimes and people need to chill out.
---
Think I vaguely remember the warrior! Did you do a lot of bgs on him? I was a troll hunter - ghouse
---
Lol if it's red, it's dead
---
Nobody says that.
---
You won't "never get a raid spot", it's just harder because dwarf priests are so much more useful.
---
For someone with a family and full time job 3 hours every night is probably unrealistic. Probably like 10 hours a week.
---
I liked flying and dailies ok. What REALLY and truly destroyed it was LFG/LFR
---
Is it any good?
---
I would say you’re quite like me (returning to wow with kids) might want to check out unity (I’ll just also copy my guild info - hoping it copies right when on the iphone)
---
Yeah, same here in America , "draft beers"
---
Already hated being "that guy" by correcting him, so tried to keep it simple and not list every definition.
---
I just hate English tho lol
---

---
I was able to negotiate 3 days of no kid duty. I consider that to be a win. I told liz.. I took 3 days off work, and when I would be working any way.. Ill leave the house and game like a feind! Hopefully that will get me into my 30s at least.
---
I created this spreadsheet so I could easily sort the loot I needed once hitting 60. I'd seen the lists, knew where to find them, but if you asked me what all gear I needed from Scholomance, I'd need few minutes to check. To use this list, click the link, make a copy, and use the sorting functions at the top.
---
Please, if you find a mistake or typo, let me know and I'll correct the original. Thanks to Dhralla whose guide I used for this list! To find his guide, you'll have to google it. Thanks!
---
So you’d have to pick and choose which raiders had a chance at bis gear: 
---
Sorry mr warlock next time we do TOT is 6 weeks from now, maybe you’ll have a chance at getting your trinket then.
---
Sorry, but until they gave paladin the ability to regain mana by being healed and having a taunt, they were shitty tanks.
---
"I went arms tree and put points into every weapon spec... you never know when you'll find a better weapon so why would I waste gold to respec every time I do?"
---
nah dude. i'm going male and I've already picked out my beard style and color. Priest and dwarf is my favorite class/race combo (independent of min/maxing), so I'll just have to suck it up.
---
Why tryhard pre raid? Bosses are pretty much big health pools. Relax man

**Looking for Guild**
---
*NA / Adult guild preferred / Horde preferred / PvP Preferred / Evening raid times / DKP / 2-3 nights / No later than 11:30 CST*
---
Looking for guild that will be emphasizing both PvE &amp; PvE elements. I will be pushing for max level as quickly as possible, and would be looking to participate in both raiding and premades as quickly as is feasible. Between the two, I place a slight heavier emphasis on PvE and would want to be with a guild intending to clear all raid content. I would however like to run with folks who are serious about attaining at least rank 10/11 in PvP, as well.
---
I've been playing off and on since 12/31/2004. I've raided as Dps, Tank and Heals through the majority of raid tiers since release. DPS from MC-&gt;Naxx in Vanilla, and throughout TBC. Tanked from WotLK through mid-Legion. Healed 2nd half of Legion. And in BFA I played Dps till I stopped playing.
---
I have acted as a Guild Leader, Raid Leader, Class Lead, General officer and lastly rank and file, and am comfortable in any role. If I'm an officer, I take that seriously. If I'm rank and file raider, I show up and shut up. Whatever is needed/required.
---
**Classes I am currently considering are:**
---
*Mage - Most likely*
---
*Warlock - Possibly*
---
*Hunter - least likely for Dps*
---
*Ele/Resto Shaman - If guild is more pvp focused. Unlikely.*
---
*Enhancement Shaman - If guild is heavily pvp focused. And wants to gift me a Hand of Ragnaros. #noshame. Highly unlikely.*
---
After my main is leveled, I intend to level 1-2 other characters. One such alt will be a prot warrior.
---
Please DM here on reddit if you think your guild and I are a good fit for each other. We can then exchange discord names afterwards.
---
Does inviting someone, passing lead and leaving not work? I know it worked in vanilla before 1.12 (specifically from farming Mara as a hunter) and I thought it worked later as well.
---
It isn’t instant though if there is a solve for that. It just gives you the timer to send you to a GY.
---
Maybe in theory, but practically it’s only 2 slots you miss. 1 for a HS and 1 for a spare Soul Shard, it’s really not that bad.
---
Having leveled 2 warlocks to 60 on P servers i never felt like bag space was the main issue.
---
My main problem with warlock is how you have to micro manage a lot of things to level effiently:
---
Making sure your WW doesn’t run out of mana.
---
Is it worth casting CoA? Should I use drain life? Should I wand? Has my Soul Stone run out? If WW is oom, should I just summon a new or should I let it Regen mana and just drain tank a couple of mobs? Should I use Immolate on this mob? If I fear it will It pull more mobs?
---
All these questions you constantly ask yourself while leveling a warlock, which makes it a bit exhausting at times but also so rewarding.
---
Are you sure you're not double-dipping there? I assumed the change in formula was people trying to understand the 1% hit chance being ignored.
---
Allways played as alliance. Gonna play horde this time around. All new aspect of the game for me: zones I never quested in, new quests, new fp's, new towns and cities, etc. I read and viewed a lot the past few months, but I didn't turn to private servers cause I want it to be a 'new' experience. And is, sort of, going to be.
---
Sir, you keep stating "no ice" but you have yet to make a beverage order.
---
I'm just listing downsides, those are factually downsides. Some classes have less impactful downsides than others, that doesn't mean they aren't downsides. You think losing an entire bag, and having to spend 5x what a priest or druid does on food isn't a downside?
---
Wow lesser and greater wands, literally read what you quoted, I said 24-40 has a dearth of wands not 5-20. You'll get GSS and be stuck with it for 15+ levels unless you fork out tons of gold for a world BoE blue.
---
As I've already said, I was scraping bottom of the barrel for druid. They don't really have any significant downsides, that's the most I could come up with. Maybe a slow 1-20 before they get cat form... That's it.
---
Hey man, don't naysay my need for organized spreadsheets! I'm not a *barbarian*! ;)
---
BoF. Dont need to cleanse.  In this fight you just want to keep running and using blink on CD while peggin him with instant casts... if he stops to heal, cast. CS big heals, sheep FB others.  It's a long RNG fight.

**What is &lt;Drive&gt;?** 
---
&lt;Drive&gt; is a North American guild focused on progressing through end-game PvE content at a reasonably quick pace. We are aiming to reach max level within 4-5 weeks of launch and will start progression rapidly after doing so. Our primary focus will be on PvE and, as a semi-hardcore guild, we expect our members to have a healthy thirst for progression.  
---
**Where is &lt;Drive&gt; located and what are the raid times?** 
---
**Region:** North America 
---
**Server type:** PvP 
---
**Faction:** Horde 
---
**Intended raid/play times:** 8:30 PM – 12:00 AM Tu/We/Th EST 
---
**Type of guild:** Semi-hardcore Raiding guild 
---
**Loot Distribution:** DKP except for legendary items which will be distributed by loot council.  
---
**Why join us?** 
---
1.) We have stellar communication during raids and have well-defined goals that we lay out before each raid. 
---
2.) We are very accountable towards our members. We hold everyone to the same standard. 
---

Just play when she’s asleep.

I wait until my wife and 19 month old are in bed and play until like 1-2am. I get up at 7am so it ain’t too bad. When I get overtired I just have a short session until 11 or 12pm

Seems pretty good if you like healing and shadow gameplays !
---
Paladin can basically never kill a mage and take the flag, because the mage can just keep kiting and buying time forever. The paladin may not die, but the flag will not be taken either, so mage wins.
---
20+ minute respawns? I'm wondering if I should even bother playing on opening day. The starting zones would literally be impossible to quest in.
---
No, the formulas don't account for the extra 1% hit. Until Blizzard clarified, there wasn't a consensus on whether it was 8%, 8.6%, or 9%, but everyone agreed the formulas were correct.
---
Hah I remember you for sure. I did quite a bit of BG's. Any excuse to roll out there with Sulfuras or Ashkandi and try to crush some Horde.

---
But even in short fights like Huhuran you can dump your mana by upranking as I said. Max rank flash heals and greater heals.
---
Also I am assuming 13 points in Holy because without the cast time reduction and Inspiration your support is indeed quite gimped.
---
Could you use steam streaming to play wow on your phone outside the home?  Just curious for like....playing at work and being a bad employee...
---
Don’t know. I would assume it will work the same way. So it ports you to the nearest GY which for alliance would be at the NE corner of the map and you have to wait a minute for the teleport and rely on having to invite someone every run.
---
I've considered this a lot. I'm still not sold on my path quite yet.
---
... maybe you don't know how ranks work?
---
In classic I was a healer. I was like 10 years old and everyone loved me, I got good at innervating people and battle rezzing. Was a lot of fun to have that many people loved me. I rolled a feral druid on a private server and boy oh boy was that rough. I wanted to tank mostly and was great in 5-mans but in pvp my damage sucked (would have been way better if i was specced right) I could beat warriors 1v1 though in bear form which was a load of fun but thats about where the fun eneded.
---
When I tried to raid and even told them I would go into cat spec and dps they said they already had a feral and really just wanted me to heal. Which I did for a bit but then I just got kinda fed up. Basically..... if you wanna tank you gotta be serious about it because so many other tanks will be going for that spot in raids. For dps you gotta get power shifting down and you will still be worse than a rogue. If youre resto everyone will love you. Oh I also played some boomkin back in the day which was fun.
---
So I would only really suggest Druid to someone who wants to heal, and support/flag run in battle grounds. In PvP even as feral I found myself being much more helpful when I was healing and cleansing poisons.
---
They are really good in solo match ups in PvP, but they are really meant to played as hybrids with lots of int and not bursty cats. Bear form has good PvE viability though. For PvP they can dot, frarie fire rogues and other druids from stealthing, they can heal, dispell poisons, and root people. They are fantastics supports.

Hunters on both sides, really. Crossbows are not bows IIRC, so the troll bonus is about as good as the dwarf bonus in the end.
---
How are you so unaware of how stupid you sound?
---
It certainly is haha
---
Oh yeah. It only. Got serious once you hit BWL.
---
No, it's the Chauffeured Chopper.
---
[https://www.wowhead.com/item=122703/chauffeured-chopper](https://www.wowhead.com/item=122703/chauffeured-chopper)
---
It's a reward for collecting 35 heirlooms.  An NPC drives the chopper, so it's essentially a mount at level 1.
---
As is fitting for retail WoW, you don't need friends for this!  :P
---
If I remember right - not in a party only the person who has “tagged” the mob will be given credit. So the level 20 can hit first and the 60 can kill with no impact. 
---
If you’re in a group I am not sure how the experience would be divided.
---
Also, don't let anyone tell you to uninstall. It's a neat trick, but they are being jerk faces

______
---
**Raid Times**:  Servertime / CET -  20:00, Friday and Saturday for *40man/progression* 
---
+  optional raids during the week for zg/onyxia/raids on farm
---
**Loot System**: Loot Council 
---
**Guild Bank**: via Discordchannel &amp; updated google spreadsheet
---
**OUR DISCORD**: discord.gg/VquUGmu
---
___
---
**About us**: We are a rather young guild, formed only a few months ago with currently a little over 110 members, consisting mostly of experienced vanilla veterans and/or """unofficial""" classic server players.
---
We intend to level at a medium pace. That means we won't stop to smell the roses or "explore" every corner of azeroth but we do not want to rush the game either. 
---
Instead we hope to do all sorts of fun guild activities together along the way, such as guild-only dungeon runs (off-meta builds aka. memespecs are fine, too), lots of pvp, etc.
---
Non-raiders, casuals and socials are very welcome to join us as well, as we're trying to build a big community rather than just a raid roster.
---
**What we can offer:**
---
- active and well designed discord server
---
- organized guild bank
---
- spreadsheets for professions, rosters, etc.
---
- helpful &amp; experienced class leaders
---
_________
---
**PvE**: We expect to have a raid ready roster of ***atleast*** 40 people within 2 (maybe 3) months after launch and clear Molten Core before Phase 2 starts. We already have more than 40 active members on our discord and we expect lots of new members once we're actually playing classic so for now it seems like we might end up with more than just one 40 man raid group. The current plan is to keep one raid group, our main group, for our most active and hardcore players than won't miss a single raid while the other raid groups are more flexible, with rotating rosters for our casuals, socials and busy players that won't be able to join all of our raids. 
---
**PvP**: While we're not too pvp focused, we still want to do some organized wpvp together during phase 1 and 2 and premade battlegrounds later on. If theres a high demand we will do even more PvP stuff, like city raids and duel tournaments. 
---
Most importantly, we wish our members to help each other, even if it means to slow down their own progress in exchange!
---
&gt;*One of us is being ganked by those annoying undead rogues in lakeshire?*
---
&gt;**Go and help him out**
---
&gt;*One of us is short a tank for a dungeon?* 
---
&gt;*You need help with a difficult task?*
---
&gt; **We will help you out!**
---
**Goals/Hopes/Dreams**:
---
- big &amp; friendly community
---
- become a known and popular guild on our server
---
- PH4T L00TZ
---
- enjoying Classic together
---
____
---
**Recruitment**: We have a pretty balanced roster and don't lack any specific classes right now so we're recruiting every class and role (except Main Tanks for Phase 1). We still need a warlock and paladin class leader so we're looking for a socially capable player who knows the class inside and out in all context and is willing to help others. 
---
If you're interested please contact me on Discord **[Howaito#3139]** or join **OUR SERVER (discord.gg/VquUGmu)** so we can get to know each other until Classic release!
---
***In any case, HAVE A CLASSIC SUMMER!*** :)

But endgame and raiding were the most important parts of vanilla and race should be picked soley on it's impact on endgame.

Or some crap like that.

I have 99 runecrafting. I fear no man.
---
Well you're a muffin head
---
Ooooooooof
---
only in gun free zones are people trying to kill each other. violent crime is up in countries that banned firearms. cnn is fake news.
---
they always would, because annihilator increases the tanks tps and thus your caster dps.  annihilator actually especially helps locks (class with most threat problems) and mages (can roll thiccest ignite longer)
---
How do I sound stupid? Tell me whats stupid about it... your just so ffing dumb man. I dont know what to do with this. You are unable to read

&gt;having to spend 5x what a priest or druid does on food

I mean I never carried more than 1 stack of food around on my hunter at any given time.
---
"5x" ? lol no
---
&gt; literally read what you quoted, I said 24-40 has a dearth of wands not 5-20
---
How about YOU read what I said?
---
I said "lesser/greater MYSTIC" wand. M-Y-S-T-I-C. You know, the level 26 and 30 wands.

"tons of gold for a world boe"

Wand of Allistarj at level 45 is always super cheap because people see the arcane resist and /lol.
---
&gt;As I've already said, I was scraping bottom of the barrel for druid.
---
I'm not saying it has no downsides, I'm disagreeing with your reasoning. The shapeshift quests are not "long" or "difficult" at all.
---
Used to be jealous of people like this, now I pity them. Good luck man.
---
Unless I'm seeing wrong it looks like both the quiver and the melee weapon shows. Quiver only when shooting.
---
Though it is possible that one server's cup runneth over with with competent raiders and another is scraping the bottom of the barrel.

Hey there! [You can come check us out](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bz0yom/looking_for_group_monday_updated_june_10_2019/eqptzdc/), however you might have trouble finding a raid spot as elemental, as they are quite terrible in most of the pve content, at all gear levels. Restoration (or totem buff) shamans are always welcome though!
---
if you're intending on using this for phase 1, you'll want to remove the dire maul and ZG stuff to not confuse yourself
---
Lol sorry, can you explain where you got the number 85% from?
---
Because pally tanks are useless in...
---
Any pvp
---
Any raids
---
And only good in undead dungeons at 60.....
---
why dont you stop them
---
Sorry, i was misremembering a little bit. After you were no longer validly in the instance, you would log out and presumably right back in. I remember doing it because it was also back when you could log out-jump to float in the air.
---
I think when you logged in it left you at the entrance again, but my memory failing there makes me second guess further assumptions.
---
I hope you get ganked nonstop
---
&gt; wands 
---
Uhmmm....
---
Either that or he's loaded.
---
It's absolultely more than just nostalgia, but what gets me about the anti-Classic crowd is that they throw around nostalgia like that's a bad thing.
---
I love firing up older games that I'm nostalgic for, like say Oblivion. If anything the nostalgia and love I share for certain games like Classic WoW simply *enhance* my experience, not diminish it.
---
it's a bit off, dal rend set is pretty much #1pre bis. Also, I think MC comes out before dire maul so I think you should probably remove dire maul gear from that list
---
bloodseeker is #1 pre bis tho for the beeg aimed shots
---
If you can't tell I'm salty from this exact reason

Indubitably.

Same here but favorite race is troll and favorite class is Hunter. Rolling the same shit I did in Vanilla.
---
Ah, so the confusion between 8% and 9% was from the 1% hit bypass then?
---
What does +5 weapon skill do in PvP vs a level 60 target with no +defense gear?
---
How is a level 19 going to stop a level 60
---
Why are you even on this sub lol
---
Classic is way less demanding on the servers than BFA is.
---
That is not exclusively a good thing.
---
Your point is null as the first reply in this thread already answered his question.
---
Also the second part of my statement is an answer to "will I hit like a wet noodle?"
---
I don't recall having said anything about private servers or having mentioned even one of the things you just rambled about and I can assure you that none of that garbage such as /sit enrage procs is what I was referring to.
---
I specifically mentioned:
---
* Not dumping your rage on the worst rage:damage ratio warrior ability
---
* Auto attacking and pooling rage
---
* Pulling two mobs and spending rage with cleave
---
* Taking Sweeping Strikes in the arms tree, which implies you're arms spec, meaning you won't even have enrage until level 55+
---
I literally said "People have figured out smarter ways to manage their rage" which shouldn't be a very ambiguous statement at all to you. None of the things you just mentioned are relevant to my points at all. We're talking about classic WoW, not that private server garbage.
---
Not unlikely he’d smash you in pvp. You seem like the sjw keyboard turner carebear
---
Why would a mage spec fire during MC and cast frostbolts?  Do you mean in later phases when they are fire for the current tier but still clearing MC on farm or something?
---
... but who's counting?
---
That G4 TV channel had a video of an Onyxia raid with no dialogue, just music and sweeping visuals. I think it may have been a Cinematech spot, but I can’t seem to find it online anywhere. It was unlike anything I’d ever seen before. So I got right into it.
---
Why am i getting a zoomed in part of bloodhoof village over the zoomed out map...?
---
Yes, that's true.
---
I thought I read somewhere that the Classic build was based originally off a Legion client wherein the keyring had been removed since Cata? Maybe that's why it isn't there as it's not a part of the build at all so they'd have to recreate it? 
---
Not sure, but I'm sure they are working on it.
---
:O
---
Omen Threat meter wasnt out until AQ40.. so yeah. threat was a beast of a boss.
---
I hope you/we can get this to happen.  Biggest fear is joining a server for a late night guild only to have it break up and no new late night guilds to form out of it.
---
I love it until I have to do Call of the Water...
---
*Cries in water totem*
---
Because you clicked on the image called Scaling which is there to showcase how far you can zoom...
---
If you are playing solo, why shouldn't you?
---
Purge is pretty damn good though.
---
What server?
---
The blacksmithing weapons were pretty good (e.g Stormherald, Lionheart).
---
The dreadforge retaliator is *very* close and will have way less competition. Plus you only need one drop for that.
---
Nelf is also a really solid race for ally hunter. They have the most base stat agility (9 more than Dwarves) and Shadow Meld is surprising good for PvP since it lets you Aimed Shot and you can FD to meld in combat. Of course, Stoneskin is also really nice in PvP, but hunter doesn't struggle that much with rogues and the most prepared players can substitute it with [Jungle Remedy](https://classicdb.ch/?item=2633) anyway. I think most serious ally hunter rankers roll Nelf.
---
Goddman fucking A-type people doing what they have always done.... Sucking all the damn fun out of everything they touch.
---
You type of players are literally the annoying jocks  of MMO's, simply fuck off and beat each other off at the idea of having a world first achievement.
---
I feel the community will be a lot more anal than the time before.
---
Not a soul in IF... not for long though!

get to lvl 60 and kill them. don't be so weak
---
You imply I'm not watching streamers while playing on dual monitors
---
fear ward
---
nuff said
---
Drinking is just part of the rotation, hence why one of our abilities conjures food/drink
---
Yeah it depends if you mean just getting a group together to beat pubs or if you mean a premade to beat actual other good premades where you expect everyone to be good.
---
&gt;You'll notice a lot of mages (if you watch streams) like playing very inefficiently - i guess it makes them feel good and powerful to go around spamming CoC/FB/AE/Blink. If you actually save your mana for frostbolt though you'll find yourself being able to kill a lot of mobs between drinks.
---
Probably just bored of Frostbolt, Frostbolt, Frostbolt, Frostbolt, Frostbolt, etc. and trying to make things more interesting.
---
Correct. We knew there must be more than a 8% base miss chance at 300 skill because people with +8% hit were still missing, we just didn't know why. Now we do.
---
In PVP, it's much less valuable. Only a 0.2% difference in hit, crit, dodge, parry, and block.
---
Quilboars in the south and Harpies in the north are some Good Grinding™®©℠
---
As long as you know where to go, what to pull and what not to pull, you'll have a great time. Be a shit tank... People won't be pleased and word may spread. Best of luck to ya.

In the elementary school locker room, this kid just would not shut up about this video game he played with his teenage brother. I listened to him talk about it for months before I asked my mom if I could get it for Christmas in 2005.

Go Dwarf if you're Alliance, go Troll if you're Horde. Best in PVP and PVE. People are out of date when they immediately think of needing WoTF.

Warriors &gt; Ferals &gt; Shaman  tanks &gt; Prot pallys

You can hit level 5 in an hour without killing a single mob.

I think an optimized route is \~50-55 minutes.

The chinese hackers massicated my hunter when I took a break after BC. I got my account back half way through wrath and  had to start Wrath naked and with my undisenchantable/unsellable Rok'dolar/Lok'dolar as my only posessions.  I went to Northrend with what I had and built myself up again from there.
---
I replaced every thing I lost for transmog over time except the Wolf Slayer Sniper Rifle, it just never drops.  How I got it in the first place is beyond me.
---
Also I got to beat heroic ICC in all green gear when my friends carried me through it as soon as I hit level cap.  I was just trying not to die.
---
Clearly. Since I literally just showed I do.
---
You don't get an HK if someone is grey.  So ganking sub 5x wont give you ANY honor or progress your rank. Try me again though, if you want.
---
If they are under a certain level ( Their level color is Grey ) it gives no honor for rank. If their level is green it gives about half the honor for rank, if that and decays to 0 honor after 4 kills, Same for people the same level as you.
---
Blue is just so much better for a Shaman.
---
No by default but if you VPN into your home network, you can use it that way. There will be significantly more latency though and you need a pretty good network connection on both ends of the network. There are probably better streaming solutions than jury rigging steam in-home streaming though but I'm not aware of any. Teamviewer also works.
---
But it launches 8/26 in the US
---
Its 51, and OP isnt aware that killing low levels doesnt grant honor lol.
---
Maybe you don't know how ranks work?
---
You can rank while you level and 47s count for 60s.
---
You welc.
---
No. They dont lol.  It's clear you didnt play vanilla.  Look up contribution points, and stop responding to me.
---
I’m not surprised, and I debated rolling one for classic myself. I would be if I didn’t remember my lifelong dream (read as; since I started playing in Cata (RIP Cata baby)) to get all legendaries in the game and this will be my first chance to get Atiesh.
---
Not dissing on the choice, just trying to be funny with a classic gaming meme
---
Actually agi is much better for bears.
---
Normally a Warrior isn't running away from something that cares about his melee hit range. That said it definitely does have downsides but overall for melee classes I consider it a buff.
---
Oh snap. That’s fancy.
---
Stamina doesn't reduce your incoming damage. Only armor. And damage reduction is more useful than the bigger health pool.
---
Look at TBC Druids. They stacked resilience, not stamina. Resilience doesn't exist in Classic, which means armor is the most effective way to get more mitigation.
---
yes that’s great mate but we’ve had a bazillion of these threads already
---
&gt;No. They dont lol.
---
Illiterate too I suppose, your statement makes no sense.
---
Haha awesome. I probably would've FD and mounted if I saw sulf coming my way
---
Yarp
---
I really wish people would stop with this stuff.
---
- Protection Paladin is a good tank for 5 and 10 Man content.
---
- Every raid will bring 1 Shadow Priest for the shadow weaving debuff.
---
- Every raid will take 1 Enhancement Shaman with Nightfall / Improved weapons totems.
---
Situational? Absolutely. Perfectly viable in every group or comp? No.
---
How far did you get?
---
With a lvl 35 char you can get to max skill.
---
And now resorting to personal attacks because you have nothing else.  You'll be added to block now.
---
everyone knows about that pummeler so it wont be a secret
---
Luckily you can skip STV for questing. There are 2 other zones that you can quest in for 35-40/45 for each faction. STV just has some of the quests people remember.
---
Yep. A casual that says they have done it all when they haven’t. 
---
“Only thing left to achieve is pathfinder”
---
Well yea when you take away 80% of the game you’re not gonna have much to achieve. Let’s see your mythic and pvp achievements.
---
With that edit it looks like you're saying "there are good things too" sarcastically. Lol
---
If you cast max rank heals (you do in PvP), then bonus healing doesn't add much percentage-wise. Regrowth in particular scales terribly with bonus healing. I'd always take the set with stats over healing in PvP.
---
"Pre-Raid BiS list" ft.
---
* DM items while DM isn't in the game at the start.
---
* Items that aren't in the game until 1.4
---
* Items that aren't in the game until AV is out
---
* Items whose recipes are gated behind ZG rep
---
* Items that aren't in the game until the pre-AQ patch
---
* Items that aren't in the game until 1.10
---
This is nothing but copy/pasting an outdated pre-raid list from a pserver. There's already a more in-depth "wrong" pre-bis list from [Nost](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j81TgG0p_HrYKajiUiQfYIoSUx1culzy2u_Fc4wtiS8/edit#gid=312055117).
---
There will be guilds out there that will allow for unconventional specs, even in raids. There may be guilds run by people with that mindset as well. So yeah maybe it's true that not every raiding guild will accept you as a Shadow Priest, but others might.
---
I do think it'll be *harder* to find a raiding guild as an unconventional spec compared to if you played a conventional one, but it will still be possible. Maybe the more relaxed/casual raiding guilds who are just full of adults wanting to have some fun will be more accepting. Meanwhile other guilds who just wanna focus on progressing through raids as fast as possible will be stricter and only accept conventional specs.
---
There are a lot of people who are gonna play classic and many of them will have the same mindset as you. They can also form guilds. That's all I'm getting at really haha.
---
Blessing of sanctuary
---
It prevents a flat 24 damage per damage source and adds a recoil effecr dor tanks with a shield.
---
At first glace 24 is nothing, but the amount of damage this can prevent for free is higher than you think. In a raid situation it really relieves strain from the healers.
---
Yes great for 2 classes.  Fire Mages and Druids to harass them....
---
I'm sure it was fun for you but it still takes away the danger from most other passerbys.  I think afk-ing in flight was a terrible thing for the game.  (Among many other flying disadvantages for breaking the world).
---
Sorry if I offended you?
---
If you get honor and there are zero bgs, the amount of honor available is scarce - so how do you rank? (Which is back to the original post) saying you don't get honor against 46s and under at 60 is irrelevant to the conversation.
---
My apologies for ruffling your feathers, enjoy not understanding how things you try to speak on, work ;)
---
What's scary/depressing is that I know for a fact that I've spent at least four times that amount of GCDs over the years.
---
Teleport Moonglade.
---
You can set your hearth (as horde) to Kargath, and have an extra hearth to Orgrimar anytime you want. (Hop the flightpath in southern Moonglade -&gt; Winterspring -&gt; Aszara -&gt; Org)
---
Ty, wasn't thinking about DM being released later. Do I have anything from ZG included as well?
---
It mitigates physical damage. You have to include that. It only mitigates physical. It does quite literally nothing against spells. It even does nothing against bleeds. 
---
You can't stack armour and expect to run flags as a druid. Sure it helps but that set is not the best armour gear either. You wear 3 pieces of it because of how good the set bonuses are. There are too many wasted stats on that set to make it useful for flag running.
---
aprox 40% of every vanilla server since retail has been undead. your classes only CC will be able to be broken at will every 3 minutes. secondly the counter classes to shadow priest is warlocks and maybe shaman. being UD will help you vs locks and you wont face shaman if horde
---
Bloodseeker isn't in the game until AV is out, which is at the same time as BWL opens.

No, you're mistaken. That's the lineup of confirmed games that will be available for *purchase* on their platform. With Destiny only being the first confirmed game to come free with the subscription. [This is from their main page on Stadia](https://i.imgur.com/yeeVSov.png). View it [here](https://store.google.com/us/product/stadia_founders_edition?hl=en-US&amp;srp=/us/magazine/stadia).
---
The $10 a month Pro package only gives you access to their "free game" list that will be released on a regular basis (whatever that actually entails is what they haven't really elaborated on). The **only game that's going to be available with the subscription at launch is Destiny**. Whatever comes next is to be determined. Every other game must be purchased, just like you would on a console or PC.

It was a rough estimate for all 40 man raids. Frankly, I thought I was being generous assuming that 40 man raids were 15% of the endgame, but I could be very wrong. Admittedly, I never ran AQ 20 back in the day, so I have no clue the relevance there. 
---
But any 5-10 man and ZG can be run with prot pallys.
---
Hemorrhage in the rogue talent tree.
---
Many would-be rogue players will take a look at the tooltip and conclude it's a rather underwhelming talent - less damage than sinister strike and all you get in return is a somewhat lame debuff? I'll pass, thanks!
---
But the REAL benefit in hemo is not the damage, nor the debuff - it is the fact it only costs 35 energy to use but still gives you a combo point. This is huge.
---
The fact it costs less energy, coupled with other synergistic combo talents, enables you to pull off huge, complete stunlocks on targets that you simply cannot do with any other build. For some classes, particularly if their PVP trinket is down, you can stunlock them from 100% to 0% with literally no way of them escaping.
---
Having been a daggers/backstab rogue for almost all of my early rogue career, back in late-2005 I saw a series of videos by an almost unknown orc rogue called Oozo, in which he demonstrated the controlling power of a hemo build - it is slower to kill targets than a cold-blood ambush spec, but grants you a crushing and suffocating control over any fight. I also believe I saw another rogue take Ming, who was a well known rogue player at the time, from 100% to 0%, whilst naked, in a series of videos he designed to show Ming how powerful the build was.
---
I'd be interested to see how crucial flying really is with some tweaks to Outlands (and a level of speed above epic ground mount).  But regardless we can certainly agree to disagree.
---
R fucking I fucking P.
---
If you grind you need to make sure you are either levelling cooking or buying cooked food for extra stats. Alchemy pots also help alot and reduce downtime immensely.
---
Most good grind spots let you stay in an area for 3 to 5 levels and only drop cloth for first aid and coins. So your bag space should be full of stat buffs
---
Bro, since the game released and every expansion, they released on a Tuesday, there maintenance day. It releases on August 27
---
The list is more a BIS and *almost* BIS list for options. The original gear list made by Dhralla in his guide goes into more detail. I just wanted a way to sort the list so I could know what to look for from each dungeon.
---
It's not an error in the combat log it's how it's supposed to be.
---
Even the text above the mob says resist.
---
There never existed any version of the game where a spell could miss.
---
Resistance will increase the targets chance to resist which can be countered with spell hit and spell resistance reducing effects (spell penetration as a term doesn't exist in vanilla).
---
Resistance also can cause partial resist where the spells damage is reduced, this is not effected by hit rating of course, only full resits.
---
Also if you have hit cap for spells works in a way that there is always 1% chance to resist a spell no matter what. If you had 200% hit% you would still have 1% chance to resist.
---
bow from AV should be removed 
---
DM gear should be removed( incl the headpiece)
---
etc
---
Even if they try to hide it, it will get out. There will probably be a list 2 weeks before launch when you can reserve player names. I guarantee their sperg fangroups will let it out.
---
I think it was TBC when I saw this for the first time, blew my mind.
---
Does 1.12 have single stack shards(?)
---
Well said overall, I played from BC until panda came out finishing raids doing high level pvp with breaks months at a time before expansions were released.
---
The community was the biggest draw for me and I could really tell it was dissolving the more LFG tools they added. I’m excited to play again where you gotta meet people and form groups to do things
---
&gt; I dislike caps and cooldowns. If I have the time let me do what I want with it.
---
The cap on badges (X number of badges per weekly reset) was created to prevent players from feeling like they had to sit and farm nonstop to acquire the items they needed through that system. 
---
&gt; Gating everyone behind caps and cooldowns rather than actual challenging difficulty is what every garbage mobile game does.  I don't like paying a monthly fee just to have a game tell me I'm not allowed to do anything. 
---
But that's exactly what Classic did for much of its endgame content. If you wanted to get into [Molten Core](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCuz3kIibps), you had to get attuned first. That's pretty easy though. 
---
Blackwing Lair, [pretty easy](https://www.wowhead.com/quest=7761/blackhands-command) too. 
---
Then it started to get more intense with raids like [Onyxia.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJgBDRFL1F4)
---
[Naxxramus](https://youtu.be/lVjjLYL7_uM?t=1358) was the largest barrier of entry (his whole video is worth watching).
---
First you have to do a Rep Grind with Argent Dawn to get to honored to get access to the quest. This will require you to run strat and scholmance a couple of times, or grind out undead in EPL and WPL. The quest will cost you gold and materials to even start it. However, if you are exalted you don't have to pay. 
---
That's the definition of gating everyone behind caps and cooldowns rather than actual challenging difficulty. 
---
I'd like to point out as well that these attunement quests also prevented new players from catching up. Imagine getting your friend in your Naxx raiding guild, only to find out, no, he can't join you on your raid night because he has to grind rep for Argent Dawn first for a couple of days (based on however much time he can spend). 
---
&gt;  I understand why they utilize daily quests, caps, and cooldowns, but if you look at the actual bottom line reasoning it's "we don't have enough content so we're going to dribble it out in tiny bits until we feel like a certain percentage of the player base is all on the same level of completion, and hopefully by then we'll have some new content."
---
The alternative to your complaint here is what I just described to you above. Rather than make the content repeatable while still being rewarding, they used to force you to do the content you may not even need anymore so you could play the new content they just released.
---
&gt; I've been seriously considering getting back into WoW just to play Classic again because I felt like I earned things, rather than "welp, I logged in and redid this same thing for three months and all I got was this lousy t-shirt."
---
This is a common thing I am seeing among players who describe their experience in Vanilla. You felt like you earned things because of a number of reasons:
---
1) In general, resources for the game were not as wide spread or common. So most people were bad at their class. So content felt harder than it should have been. 
---
2) In general, most players were bad at MMOs since WoW came up when MMOs were not as popular. So content felt harder than it should have been.
---
3) Time. Things took longer to do in the game because the game was designed to eat up as much time as possible to artificially extend the time it took for you to complete content. This is done by cutting down on mobility (no summoning stones outside of instances, as one example, or gating mounts behind level 40.)
---
Humans will often attribute value to something based on how much time they have spent on it, which can skew their judgement. 
---
&gt; The quest lines to get keys to access new areas and gearing up to enter more difficult dungeons... I felt like I was being compelled via logic of the WoW universe to do those things, not because I need some arbitrary number to be bigger on my paper doll.
---
But isn't that an example of gating? How is that different? 
---
&gt; Now? Last time I was poking around you can't enter certain dungeons until your gear's item level is high enough.
---
Incorrect. You are not able to do LFR or LFG at certain levels unless your gear is high enough. The reason for this is obvious. It's a random group, and so you would be hindering them by not having the appropriate gear to do those activities. You are literally unable to perform effectively in whatever role you have chosen. 
---
You are still allowed to manually enter those dungeons with a group so long as you are the appropriate level. 
---
&gt; No one forced anyone to get keyed to Scholomance by completing that long quest chain back in the day but if you didn't do it you'd end up standing around yelling in chat, begging for another player who had the key to open the door for you.
---
I think you are confusing an "option to do something" with "I literally cannot do this particular action unless I do X first." 
---
Besides, if you wanted to get into Scholomance you could just die outside the door and then walk through the door as a ghost and res on the other side. 
---
&gt;  All Blizzactivision has done over the years is shuffle the grind around while telling everyone it's new and improved
---
&gt; You can log into WoWhead and see exactly how many days it will take to repeat daily quests to get exalted, or whatever the reward is. It's mundane and boring.
---
This is an odd thing to be upset at, tbh. People would do the exact same thing for rep grinds in Vanilla too ([check out this argent dawn rep grind guide from 2009.](http://wow-pro.com/general_guides/nilz039_argent_dawn_reputation_guide)) It's always been a thing. 
---
The only difference between then and dailies now is that dailies break up the mind-numbing mob kill grind with actual "daily" activities. It's actually one of the exact reasons ***why*** Blizzard put in daily quests to begin with. Because no one liked having to grind mobs until they reached a rep level.
---
See I skipped the process and instantly went to the top right. \*Daus Vult intensifies\*
---
That's my point exactly. Vanilla is not instant gratification. Some will hate it and leave pretty quickly.
---
It’s my birthday. I’ll be 27...
---
Summoning stone? Oh yeah you don't get that they're just "meeting stones" in Vanilla.
---
Yeah I've done some uldas and we just don't go to archaedus.
---
My class decision was based purely on faction because my friends all insist on playing Alliance.
---
If I have to play Alliance to play with my friends, I might as well take full advantage of that and play a Paladin.
---
That set also has terrible stats. It has the lowest stamina of any PvP set in the game. Including all of the blue sets. 
---
The epic set actually has less stamina on it than the mage blue set. Now it does give two very nice set bonuses but that's where you stop. 3 pieces.
---
Annihilator doesn't matter if the other debuffs reduce armour to 0, which will probably be the case in classic on many bosses.
---
some of the crafted stuff - the batskin and bloodsoul sets
---
Only need to be 35 for maxed professions.
---
40 would be for what, mount?
---
I can definitely speak to that. 1-40 on the beta server and I have like 35+ people on my friends list
---
Gotta get rid of the BFA mindset. 
---
Anything you choose to play will work.
---
Not everything is supposed to be the best and equal.
---
Go whatever race you want to play, if you think one is "trash and unplayable" because of racials - start re thinking about how you look at classes :)
---
Thing is, it's the casual players who need optimized specs the most. Casual raiders aren't going to be fetching DM and song flower buffs every raid, or farming the cash for jujus, firewaters, elem sharpening stones, ie every little buff in the game. Casuals need every edge that their spec can give them to make up for the time they're not spending farming consumables and gear.
---
Yeah that's the only one that was super inaccurate.
---
Its where i was always asked to meet when buying gold. Not only was the website i used to buy said gold shady as fuck they have me finish every shady gold sale by going to a city in wow that also screams "illegal shit happens here"
---
Oof. That still all adds up to about 1% additive DPS though, assuming that fractions of a percent don't get truncated out.
---
Well, technically you cleared it. But you know it was a boost so it’s on your own morality when in a discussion to say if you’ve cleared it or mentioned it was a boost.
---
You keep equating PVP'ing (which I like and support) with griefing. Let's try this: the vast majority of people on PVP servers are fine and 'do PVP' and that's great. Good for them, go for it.
---
There is just a small minority of people on PVP servers that don't do PVP, they grief. It's a hack, an abuse, of a system that is meant to add value, challenge and fun to the game.
---
Have you heard of Angwe? The Horde rogue that camped Menethil so much Blizzard actually added NPCs to make it harder for him to get away with it (so the story goes) That's the kind of thing that is just far too easy to happen. Much like Twitter trying to police toxic behaviors, the fact that Blizzard has had CHANGE THE GAME to stop it proves this is an issue .
---
Now the vast majority of griefing isn't as extreme as Angwe (who apparently was a great rogue) but it still occurs frequently enough that I'm choosing to move to PVE. I also support your right to choose PVP, just stop saying "you don't like PVP" I do. I don't like griefing. They are not the same thing, not even close.
---
&gt;I literally said "People have figured out smarter ways to manage their rage"
---
And I said there are about a billion classic WoW warrior guides on the internet and no one seems to be talking about cleave stacking as the proven, ultimate, only way to grind mobs on a warrior.  And I can tell you 100% if a newbie warrior tries your strategy when he first gets cleave at level 20, he's just going to die a lot. My advice was aimed at players new to warrior; what the most efficient way to farm mobs at level 40+ is isn't really relevant, because they will have logged dozens of hours by that point.
---
Your strategy isn't even incompatible with my suggestion. I didn't say to spend rage on heroic strike. Just respec at 40 if you think Sweeping Strikes are that important. In the meantime, more rage isn't going to hurt.
---
&lt;Ascendants&gt; - Alliance \[NA West - PVP Server\] Semi-Hardcore PVE + PVP Guild General Introduction: Welcome to Ascendants, we are a group of semi hardcore PvE/PvP players that are looking to start a guild in preparation for Classic World of Warcraft. We are currently recruiting new members before release and are welcoming players that are: 1. Willing to learn and work with a team, 2. Enthusiastic and Friendly, 3. Just be a good guild member and do what you are supposed to do. We look forward to meeting you and playing with you in the future. We will decide on a realm once the game is released or whenever a realm list will be made available. Raid times will more than likely be around 8pm PST, but the days will be determined at a later date and will take into consideration the vast majority of players available. The loot system that we will be using will be loot by council. Whether you are experienced at WoW or just starting out it doesn't matter, we can learn together. Contact me through PM on discord at Crimsoneagle#3839 or respond to this post as I will be checking it regularly.
---
That is fucking awesome. I wonder what the TPS looks like at max level. I can't imagine it out paces a Orc using an axe, but considering the best tank weapons aren't always axes I could see Troll threat pulling ahead, especially with berzerking. I didn't know I wanted a troll warrior until now.
---
What if I have a different battle.net ID now?
---
and we LIKED it!
---
I haven't seen it, and it's been talked about a great deal in world chat. I'm not sure what's going on there we haven't had any word from Blizz afaik.
---
Ironforge
---
Much empty
---
Much sad
---
A huge thing that people don't seem to understand about classic (from what I've observed) is that nominal spec needn't dictate actual role in the way that it does on live. Going 31 Ret and hoping you're going to get to whack the boss is very bad. But going 31 Ret and playing your healing role during raid nights really is not *that* bad. Especially because I think Classic is going to have some very long farm status periods and content droughts, and who cares what people are specced during these periods?
---
Max level dungeons:
---
- Scholomance
---
- Strat Live/Dead
---
- LBRS
---
- UBRS
---
- BRD
---
Total: 5
---
Max level raids:
---
- ZG
---
- MC
---
- Ony
---
- BWL
---
- AQ20/40
---
- Naxx
---
Total: 6
---
So out of 11, you have 5 dungeons and 1 raid (6), just over 50%.
---
**EDIT**: Formatting
---
I think it's just a semantic difference. Summoning/Meeting stone. It's been a loooong time, I'm rusty.
---
It's actually 10% of the base value more than nothing.
---
The deadzone is just two yards further out. It means as a Hunter you have to get an additional 2 yards away before you can use ranged attacks. Taurens are honestly pretty bad Hunters, though there is a silver lining in that you get an extra 2 yards in range.
---
No lol definitely not. Asmon did some raid event with 5-6 raids against an equally large horde army led by your standard stream armies. Kalimdor crashed over and over and over. The entire server went down at one point. Granted this was before stress tests 1 and 2.
---
But....you ARE saying that.
---
He said
---
&gt;If you think they are going to remake expansions differently, they wont.
---
you said
---
&gt;I'm not saying that they will remake them differently....just that they will remake them differently.
---
"Developing stuff for it" as you put, requires effort.  It requires hundreds of people and millions of dollars leading to an unexpected result.  A risky result.  People could love it, people could hate it.
---
Or you spend far, far less money and just re-release BC and WOTLK exactly as it was with the knowledge of exactly how it will turn out.
---
Which do you think is more likely?
---
The more the merrier I say
---
You’ll easily get a raidspot somewhere. It’s just very possible that a few of the more serious guilds on the server would not have you. And it is very likely that people like me (many very serious and a bit serious guilds) will be prejudiced against you.
---
I must admit I am a racist in WoW. I would still do stuff with you but I will be super biased.
---
They can merge accounts.
---
A single glance on the preview (didn't even need to open the whole thing) shows how clueless you are about Pre-raid bis itemization, progress, stats you require and other things.
---
Agreed. By 1.12, you only needed 1 dwarf priest for any fight that uses fear.  Out of theoretically 5 priest slots minimum, that leaves 3 other spots. But the reality is that if you were a warm body that healed, you'd probably get a spot.
---
I loved the barrens. The barrens chat, fishing for deviat fish to make money, the buggy buffs quest.
---
But I'll never forget the moment I entered the Un'goro crater. I were a few levels ahead of my dad (who started playing when I was like 15/16 levels in after I gave him a guest pass). I was amazed and scared as shit, T-Rexes running around etc. I remember running down the stairs to tell my father what I've just discovered and how insane it was. Good times.
---
Barrens chat is amazing. It's like the Reddit of low level horde Vanilla.
---
I'm thinking of coming back but can't figure out something. How do I get the client? Do I have to buy the disc?
---
I have some mythic, not pvp, just don't like pvp.
---
It's not the same fun as before.
---
I'm not saying the game today has nothing to offer, I'm just saying that what it has to offer is not as rewarding and fun as before.  
---
Anyone who found himself flying around Orgrimmar, waiting for something to happen, while in the Shattarath era just wasn't the case.
---
Then, even the ones who killed Kiljahedin HC would still log on, either leveling alts or making money for WOTLK. Today, just leveling a demon hunter to 120 yields enough money for an alt to buy all flying mounts as soon as the level permits.
---
Where is all that in BFA?   
---
When was the last time you had to fish in order to make yourself a buff so you can level faster? 
---
You can attack anything you want today, the mobs are tuned to your level anyway.
---
So mythic has some of the challenge and rewards from the past, but still, everything had it back then. 
---
There is a good reason for classic wow to be the strongest hype today, and probably will be the most popular launch of 2019, even if EA are to fix FIFA.
---
Can confirm I'll take the 30 min to hour long queues any day over cross-realms.
---
But if you literally look at the article when they announced release dates, the US gets it on the 26th. But you know, let ignorant people be ignorant
---
Enjoy Gnomeregan
---
Not when there's tons of people around
---
The feral as well, most of the time is an off tank. The DPS is a joke. Even then, LOTP is mediocre at best, as there's better buffs that are group wide.
---
Seems like he’s... u/offhisgame
---
In the past Blizzard has offered free character transfers off full realms and nobody took them (Tichondrius anyone?). They aren't a solution. Killing their subscriber base with massive queues isn't going to be a workable solution for Blizzard either.  I think what is most likely is Blizzard will reneg and keep layering into phase 2 and beyond; at least for the crowded servers. They will also offer free character transfers to servers that don't need layering. At that point it will be up to each individual player to decide whether they prefer layering or a small server population.
---
It's  an offhand
---
Eye of Kilrogg - Warlock ability.  basically the same shit but a big summoned eye and it runs faster than normal run speed and is stealthed sooo...
---
I’ll be looking for a day time raiding guild also.  I’m sure there will be atleast a couple.  May just have to served transfer unfortunately.
---
Side question.  Do you use your pets in raids?   Heard you don't summon your pet at all
---
&gt; Server cap used to be 2.5-3K. If you have 4 layers of active subs now all on one server it’s going to be a problem.
---
Its not 4 layers of 3k players each. Its 4 layers of 3k players total. So 750 per layer. 
---
&gt; Good luck getting black lotus when there are literally 100s of other dudes farming the same nodes in the same zone. If they don’t offer transfers off of mega servers it’s going to be a problem.
---
Okay? Not sure what that has to do with this really. Didn't say we shouldn't have server transfers but It was like that in vanilla as well. 
---
&gt; I’m fine with same server layering for phase 1. But what happens to an 8 layer server that doesn’t have major player drop off before phase 2? 2 hour queue times? Even if you double the max server cap you are still going to have massive queue times. That’s a problem that I haven’t seen a blue post on it yet.
---
Because its kind of a made up problem because you're assuming the server cap is increasing with layers. It doesn't. The server layers are only there to help manage the exact problem you described regarding black lotus but with quest in the release when literally every player is in 1 of 6 areas. Thats all layers do.
---
Considering the only tanking axe is r14..But really, It just means that your add pick up OT is better as a troll compared to an Orc.. also If you're a crafty enough linguist, you could convince your guild to give you the first Thunderfury
---
Pallys can do 5 mans but are still inferior and have more downtime. They’re the only tank class that requires mana and this causes problems. They also are inferior to warrior tanks in AoE threat, which most people cling to as pallys strength over the other two classes. All in all a list of reasons they’re the weakest tank class and to have one is to intentionally handicap your group. Not raid, cause they’d do miserably there lmao
---
I'll have a rumsey rum black label. Noice.
---
It's pretty relevant to the conversation,  You mentioned that M16Born might not know how ranks work when he mentioned ganking lowbies gives you no honor. He's right Ganking them gives no honor at 60 unless they are in the mid 40s. So someone running around at level 60 killing people leveling outside of the 45+ zones is pointless because does not work for your honor rank or honor for the kill itself. 
---
Also after 10 kills of the same person that grants honor in the first place ( I had to double check 1.12 changed it to that ) also means you stop gettin honor from them for a set amount of time outside of a BG. 
---
Yes, world PVP will be going on just like it will be in Phase 1-x and figuring out where to quest will be based on where people are ganking at. 
---
( Oh and Ranking doesnt really start until BGs are out. So until then its just killing for the sake of honor kills. ) I am fine with World PVP but thinking that theres going to be some major slowdown / Not possible to Level is just someone that has no idea of how the PVP honor system worked in Vanilla.
---
I love how everyone is pro lowbie ganking in here. You will all change your tune if you gank locked out an area for two days straight. Your salt will flow.
---
This reminded me of the YouTuber Hayven Games (R.i.P)
---
Sooo time consuming but not hard right?
---
I’m definitely going to look into this. I tried to talking Support a few years ago and got frustrated and gave up it would be nice to have my old diablo CD keys back and my old WoW account
---
I fully agree when it's to acquire a particular/useful talent such as when BoK was deep down in the retnub tree. Othewise? Get the most efficient spec. 
---
And you have to understand, when I spec of a ret pally, I mean someone who's SPECCED ret and demands to play as ret, in this scenario at least. 
---
I have no issues with someone who has 31 ret points and can heal fine in raids.
---
As a casual player just looking to get on and do some solo BG's, kill some people and have a fun time, what would be better for me. A hunter or a Shadow Priest?
---
Warlock leveling is awesome.  Gear up with free healthstones, SS yourself, go have you pet do all the hard work and have fun throwing dots and messing around with your many forms of CC.
---
They seem to be more willing to work it out now. I tried multiple times in the past and was turned down. Even though the account is in my name. 
---
They wanted info I just didn’t have, or didn’t want info I did have. Got it last time I tried though and it left me wondering why I was turned down before.
---
Whose name is... ? Do you have a clip... ?
---
When was the last time i had to fish to level up faster? Literally never did that. I never once said “ok enough leveling and quest. Let’s fish tonspeed things up.”
---
You have yet to clear the most difficult content in the game but still sit there saying there’s nothing left. That everything is too easy
---
Well no shit everything is too easy. Stop walking around the open world and do a raid. Do something actually difficult.
---
Yeah but that really wasn’t the case then. Maybe towards the end of vanilla but definitely not at the start.
---
Ew.
---
StaysafeTV, no clip I don’t remember the date I was just watching at the time
---
You only need efficiency to do 10k dmg to be good in PvP. You need efficiency to do 100k dmg to be good in PvE. Also you need +16 hit to be good in PvE.
---
Where does one find Butt Pirates? Those are my fav.
---
Nope.. in beta. every one is in SW because the AH there is linked with IF.
---
someone did this on ony and didnt pull her so i tried running into her myself and pulled and got everyone killed
---
...orc?....warlock?...
---
Did I win?
---
What can a lock do at 45 that they can't do at say, 39? I read they can summon max level as early as 20.
---
1, appeal to authority  
---
and 2,  
---
it's a very simple three step process that involves:
---
1. Grinding in an area of normal mob density (aka not running into a pack of 5 murlocs)
---
2. Pulling a single mob and auto attacking it to death (literally the simplest thing in the world)
---
3. Pulling two mobs and mashing your cleave button
---
Literally simple enough that a small child can manage it. My son, age 9, can manage it.
---
Also, sweeping strikes is a level 30 talent.
---
Guy, the .5 set was catch-up gear. Of course it's going to be useless if you don't need to catch up. That's common sense.
---
Lots of people will still do them though.
---
Yes, because people played for fun and didn't worry about maximizing efficient
---
Sure, especially if you're in AQ but still finishing up things people need in MC. Seems like everything was immune to fire in BWL too for the most part. It is definitely fair to say that mage is in a similar situation to hybrids where the tier basically dictates the spec.
---
awesome! this is going to be super useful.
---
Just picking up what you're putting down, bud.
---
Be feral or shadow you can raid fine and the people you raid with will probably be friendlier
---
As explained above, the stats are great. Armor &gt; stamina in PvP. The nature of Druids is that if they can mitigate damage, then they will live exponentially longer because of their heals over time. Stamina only helps against max burst, but won't add any survivability beyond that initial burst.
---
Just a few days there was a new video series posted here demonstrating some hunter class mechanics.
---
The name of the creator was Kork. You can check my comment history to find the direct link!
---
True, but this clip is generating anger rather then laughs. Nothing wrong with finding the clip funny. I mean seeing people rage quit games is funny, its sometimes fun to womp your friends so hard they refuse to play anymore lol. But hurling sincere vitriol their way isn't about comedy.
---
My first guild that did MC was such a smorgasbord of classes.  Pretty sure there were hardly any warrior dps and like 7 hunters and some feral druids and ret paladins.  We still managed to clear MC back then, but goddamn it was a mess for awhile there. 
---
Great times.

^^Shhht, ^^dont ^^spread ^^the ^^secret

Found the sweat Lord frost mage

Efficient questing is the fastest method. Pure grinding according to OP's calculations is almost a full day behind Joana's.
---
Got a link for talent tree?
---
No it's not sadly... a summoning stone lets you summon people. A meeting stone doesn't do anything.
---
Summoning stones replaced meeting stones in tbc or prepatch. If you want to summon someone to an instance now you need a lock and 2 others.
---
Can you fill that hp though? Otherwise you are just changing water with food,
---
All they have to do is delete the 1 in 1.12 and it will work like 1.2 trust me I'm a programmer.
---
&gt;also means you stop gettin honor from them for a set amount of time outside of a BG. 
---
If you are only killing the same people, sure does.
---
&gt; Oh and Ranking doesnt really start until BGs are out. So until then its just killing for the sake of honor kills.
---
Starts at phase 2, bgs are phase 3 - again - the entire reason behind the post...
---
Definitely should I have been turned down before but got my original vanilla account back without issue last week. Was so easy I couldn’t  believe I got turned down before.
---
BUT... STREAMERS SAID SHARDING IS A GOOD THING. They are like GODS AT THE GAME. YOU'RE JUST A HATER.
---
Still in my bank to this day.
---
It's almost a day behind his times.
---
Not asking, just saying that if they were different, they wouldn't be enforced like you describe :)
---
You only need physical damage reduction as a Druid in Classic. Mages need to stand still and cast to do any significant damage (which they can't do while you're running away), while Warlock and Priest damage over time is get countered by a set of your heals over time. The only damage you can't avoid through your abilities is physical damage. You need to be in Bear Form any time that there is a melee attacking you, and armor is far and away the best stat when you're in Bear Form.
---
Deathwing?
---
Yup have a healer friend.
---
I don't really understand the distinction. With that line of thinking getting a PHD, becoming fluent in another language and becoming a master piano player isn't "hard", it's just "time consuming".
---
Well you've spent more time by now defending why you shouldn't have to make an argument than it'd take you to actually make the argument as to why the market of golf/football is not comparable to the market of mobile/pc, right?
---
And yes, you were very obviously trying to put him down for being unable to refute your argument. The reason you're doing that might not be because you can't make an argument, and instead be that you didn't want to, but the end goal doesn't change what you're doing.
---
So you basically a spectator who not only has little knowledge but also little interest in raiding yet you think you have a valid opinion on the matter? Guild are nothing but a coalition of people who come together to raid or pvp or do whatever the fuck they want to do, they have every right to say who they do and don't want in their guild there is no right or wrong..
---
What is this waffle
---
Never got the lone wolf mentality in vanilla. Its funny how peoples race choices in vanilla actually does say something about personality. You'll find orcs and undead all the time that wanna be op as fuck 1v3 you. Then when people pick tauren i remember back in the day they usually loved to squad up, and be a sort of leader. Like i remember orcs trying to charge me to tank which is ok but...legit never seen a tauren without a one for all and all for one mentality. The type of race that will rarely charge you to tank but might travel across a continent to help a few lowbies or troubeled horde. Plus all the druids and shamans we meet in mulgore give us healer partners for LYFE.
---
You come to a sub for game and call people nerds and childish for playing it. What's your problem?
---
What life?
---
I'm in the same boat. I'm excited to experience this nostalgic game from the other factions perspective. It'll be like a new game to me. I've seen it all but I never experienced lvl 60 raiding.
---
Fair enough. Was DM considered a max level dungeon? Shit, it's been so long... 
---
But yeah, it sounds like I overestimated. Maybe closer to 65%.
---
Either way, viable for 100% of the non-raid content.
---
You made me realize I pay money to drink and eat, its not efficient, I failed to min-max life.
---
Streamers can cry me  a fucking river
---
The game literally releases 3PM pacific time on the 26th lmao
---
Just roll a female horde character. Why you’d want to be a male horde anyways is beyond me.
---
Excellent reply IMO
---
Downvoted this one... never saw the two you linked, but just downvoted those as well.
---
Why?  You seem like a massive tool in each of them.
---
Also fire is quite good for pvp.
---
It's not just hybrid specs that have the issue. For many classes, the best raiding spec isn't the best pvp spec, and re-speccing gets expensive in classic until later on when people have more gold.
---
But yeah, fire was definitely pretty sub-optimal for both MC and BWL.
---
BoF does not have 100% uptime, but I do know it exists.
---
If the mage is anything other than frost I have no idea, but I would think frost would have a small advantage here.
---
Most people still recognize combat daggers as a top PvE spec, in fact some cite it as the top dps rogue spec over swords sometimes.
---
There's videos of pat crushing it in gear that's from what will now be phase one gear btw..
---
I don't mean my own character.
---
But then does it make up in terms of spell range???
---
It should be obvious to anyone that swirly balls is one of the best spells that mages have.
---
I mean, it's never going to be the same, you are going to like the game or not. It's easy to like retail wow and classic since they both bring different things to the table.
---
Classic is slower, not harder. Your bread and butter rpg.
---
Mounts aren't "content"
---
The heroics were farmable considering the normals gave rep.
---
Arena weekly cap? Surely we're just reaching now?
---
Also sub numbers peaked after TBC during wrath so there's that as well.
---
Shit is that how it is in classic? Thanks for the heads up
---
Meanwhile, I’ve got my account but my potato can’t run BFA.
---
I mean yea it kinda isn't up for discussion. Saying the chance to get 7 flips in a row is 1/5^(6) is just sloppy math.
---
You're still trying to get 7 in a row, it wouldn't make sense to stop the count every time you don't get the flip in first try, because you're still jumping and TRYING to start the sequence that will eventually lead to 7 flips, and the first flip is STILL 1/5 regardless if you're actually counting or not.
---
Bah, kindly don't do this crap
---
&gt; No addon
---
No raiding
---
Have you played retail since Cata?
---
Hmmm...

AUGUST... 1+21+7+21+19+20 = 89

12 Weeks until Wow Classic Release

Also pretty useful for AQ40 trash mobs.

Any way you would consider playing horde? I think we could be a great fit.

---
Always forget about that, good guide for some short time then.
---
You're right that the list of games equals only "games with added Stadia support" - they will be available for sale, or be included in the Pro subscription, or be included with other subscriptions (from other manufacturers) or you can stream them if you already own them.
---
However, we **do not** currently have a list of games that are included in the Pro subscription - if all the other game subscriptions from other developers are an example, we would eventually see stuff such as "100+ included games" (which would most likel not include any new AAA game, but atleast will include older games AND the current, free to play ones).
---
My guess is that the 30+ games announced are only games for which the developers managed to add Stadia support so far - but this list will grow **a lot** until november. Perhaps we'll see the list of games included in Pro before the november release, together with more details about the store itself and eventual license equivalation between stores (ie: if I own Division 2 in Uplay would I need to buy it again in Stadia's store? this doesn't make sense, we'll need to wait and see how Ubisoft handles the Ubi accounts).
---
On a side note, tonight at the E3 keynote, Ubisoft just announced their 15$/mo game subscription, includes 100+ games, many of them being recent ones that are still selling for 60$. They've said about this 15$/mo subscription that it will be integrated with Stadia - in the way that if you buy this subscription from Ubi, you could then stream all the games in Stadia, which is fantastic. And speaking of this, this hits on the model we've been given hints about - Stadia is a platform, the Pro subscription has a package chosen by Google, but inside Stadia there will exist different subscriptions of game packages from different publishers, ie: the Ubisoft subscription, the EA subscription and so on - so owning any such subscriptins means you can then stream your games through Stadia for free at 1080/60 or at 4K HDR if you also own the Pro subscription.
---
Have you not read what I wrote??  
---
WITHOUT killing a single mob.
---
Doesn't matter how many people are around. 
---
With killing mobs you can probably do 20-30 minute level 5 I don't know, the point of the no mob killing route is to level when there's tons of people around and with that level 5 can be done in less than an hour.
---
The majority of women who play WoW are batshit crazy or play with their bfs/husbands, so you won’t miss out on anything.
---
It means it launches on the 26th in North America
---
I'm saying they would be fire for pvp, since it's quite a good pvp spec, but in MC and BWL fire does so little damage(or none at all, depending on the mob) that they'd just be casting frostbolt instead.
---
Like I said, I'm not talking about someone taking a sub-optimal spec with plans to specifically and only be a raider. I'm talking about people who are doing both raiding and pvp.
---
Later on when everyone has plenty of gold this probably won't really be an issue, because you can just re-spec whenever you need to.
---
Something being slower, or not as instantly gratifying doesn't make it a second job. By all means, if you dont like classic, and that opinion is totally fine, dont play it. But I think a lot of the not understanding part is due to viewing this as a second job or a chore. I love playing classic wow. I do not like retail. I can assure you classic wow feels nothing like a chore.
---
I do not find instant gratification... Gratifying. In any way. Its much more gratifying having to actually try and give something effort.
---
Well, now you are changing your mana for your friends mana. Mage masterclass is getting the sustenance for free at least.
---
Which customer support should I contact? How did you start the process?
---
There's bear form quest at level 10, then acquatic form at level 16. It's not uncommon for players to opt out of doing that quest until level 40 or sometimes even level 60.
---
Druids have one of the smoothest leveling experiences out of all the classes in my experience.
---
Maybe in retail, but I vividly remember there being quite the selection of semen demons back in the day.
---
See how viable that undead shadow priest is when a pally dispels all his shit. You'll be able to dispel devouring and he'll have used a shitload of mana for nothing.
---
I'm thinking of going Nelf priest, just to shadowmeld in the bushes at lumbermill. I'll mind control one off the cliff and melt his friend's face. 78 days.
---
My pucker factor was through the roof when I saw that Alliance and Horde can both use Ratchet.
---
Sry bro, Goblin Mage is Cata.
---
Our dude who's repping the modern spellpower set, Mourtagh, doesnt have enough logs to really show off high end ret. Nobody else is even trying to play the build, look at the gap between the top ret and the runner up on a lot of individual fights, the big dude is what other paladins will look like when they adapt the SP build. Look at specific fights. Look at his gear and setups too. Mourtagh has more logs from before the new build as well. Sadly, he's one of only a couple naxx paladins who can even test the build, and he frankly doesnt have enough logs to show off ret's high end on most encounters.
---
You also need to take into account many of the top meta spec players are in guilds like Salad Bakers and other speedrunning guilds. From my understanding Mourtagh isn't in nearly the same level of guild as the others. Naturally his DPS will be lower, because fight time will be longer and he can't go nearly as ham with his mana and consumables. The top logs are sub 2m fights most of the time, and the amount of time coolies are up is a much higher percentage than in other guilds. Salad Bakers and similar guilds distort the top logs quite a bit.
---
Esfand's build is fucking garbage compared to what we've got going on now and it shows on just about every fight where Mourtagh has outpaced him.
---
Ret is beating Hunter, Shadow, and non-ignite mages relaibly with the new build. We just don't have many logs with the new SP build to show it off, it's been developed over the past couple months. Ret is a tier 2 dps spec. Warlocks, Warriors, and Rogues are t1 in Naxx and Pal cannot beat them in damage. It can beat the average mage, hunter, priest, or druid at similar gear and experience.
---
We have 1 dude, 1, logging with the correct spec, and he doesnt have full logs. Its not fully indicative of the spec at large.
---
Casual is someone who is not committed to the game. Even if you play only 1 hour a day, if you got great pve gear by some luck and you are a pro at your class for pvp and know your shit in pve, you are a min-max no lifer.
---
While if you play every hour of the game and you still suck dont know how to play your class or your gear is trash, you are a casual.
---
It just depended on the server your were on.
---
Honestly wow saved me money. $15 a month for one game instead of $10 here, $60 there for games that hold my attention for 1-3 weeks.
---
They are in the beta. I was watching Venruki do some world pvp and he purposely didn’t kill npcs that were dishonorable.
---
The other issue is that for later tiers, once one mage goes fire, they all have to at the same time, because of the way Ignite works.
---
Does wf (not totem but weapon buff) stack with crusader? Is there a rule i can apply when deciding to enchant my weapon?
---
Wrong. All my specs are viable.
---
&gt; Well you've spent more time by now defending why you shouldn't have to make an argument than it'd take you to actually make the argument as to why the market of golf/football is not comparable to the market of mobile/pc, right?
---
I guess you are right at this point, sadly. 
---
&gt; And yes, you were very obviously trying to put him down for being unable to refute your argument. 
---
Sure - you know my intentions more than I do.
---
\&gt; rolls on a PvP server
---
\&gt; upset about PvP
---
I played on PvE and alliance always complained of hour waits for BGs and on horde it was instant... yet they also always claimed they were outnumbered... hmmm.
---
a reasonable person? what are you doing here? :D
---
in all seriousness tough, im so happy classic is gaining so much traction. i agree with you 100%

---
I stand corrected. I originally got into it as tbc was launching, so this makes sense.
---
Because raid groups want stability and it's honestly just not realistic.  If a guild has multiple empty raid spots, it's really unlikely that they are going to be unable to fill them with real dps.  
---
This whole idea is contingent on a guild that somehow doesn't have enough rogues/warlocks/hunters/warriors to fill out their raid, and the only people left being spriests and boomkin and rets.  It just doesn't work out that way.  
---
Furthermore, if your raid guild doesn't field a full raid most often, then people will start to move to guilds that do.  Yes, sometimes there are openings even in reliable guilds.  But do you want to stake your ability to raid on someone else being sick/not showing up?
---
I think they canabalized it for increasing main bag size. Not t certain though
---
Also, if you're looking for someone who's an authority on the subject of Warriors you could always check out Tipsout's class guide video with Monkeynews over on TO's youtube channel.
---
I don't usually recommend TO's channel very often but Monkeynews is an exceptional player and he gives valuable advice.
---
I sold my account at the high point of BC. Made $700. I'm terrified to even try and recover that account. I'm sure the guy doesn't play it anymore. But all the info was changed.
---
&gt;1, appeal to authority
---
Yes, that's what you tried to do when you said "actually people have figured out better ways." It's an appeal to authority that doesn't even point out who the authority is supposed to be. And when I looked, it looks like they don't exist.
---
&gt;it's a very simple three step process that involves:
---
Nothing incompatible with getting Improved Bloodrage if you're new to warrior.
---
34 gold you are a legit vanilla player
---
Please guys stay in ironforge I know storm wind is cool but if you want to restore vanilla experience you have to stay in IF.
---
maybe a hunter can also destroy shadow priests?
---
r/iamverysmart
---
Lupos does 0 shadow damage.
---
Kind of, I didn't include it (my mistake) as it is not being released for a while.
---
But 5-mans I can see paladin tanks, speed farming UD Strat is no problem for a paladin tank, especially while being overgeared for it.
---
The problem is, which others have pointed out... fall flat in terms of A: no taunt and B: outside of AOE, TPS isn't the strongest. Which means that for actual raids (even some ZG fights), it's risky.
---
Again paladin tanks for 5-mans aren't terrible, they are akin to a feral druid in a lot of respects (AOE threat), but lack of taunt does make it a bit harder. More damage = more TPS yes, but we need to remember DPS aren't going to wait for tank threat. DPS want to zerg their buttons and not wait for 5 sunders+ before blowing everything.
---
Wrong link. that's for the private server clients. You want 
---
Why isn’t your aq mace equipped? No exalted AV OH????
---
For me personally, it's because I literally do believe that people should play what they will have most fun playing.
---
However, what I personally consider fun is figuring out what's good. So I spend a lot of my time doing that.
---
The flip side of what you're saying is that every time I say "I think this thing will be the best thing for this" people who want to do something else take that as me wanting to reach through their screens and murder them personally for not using the thing.
---
So if I tell a balance druid that he's probably going to do bad dps if he asks, that's taken as me saying he's a pile of shit and should go kill himself, when what I mean is literally that he will probably do bad dps, nothing more and nothing less. It's not trying to answer if he should go balance druid or not; he should do that if he considers balance druid fun.
---
BLESSING OF KINGS - DUH!
---
Unfortunately this isn't working on beta right now. Hopefully they intend to fix it before release though.
---
Self esteem issues
---
doesn't look like a 50/50 vote helps
---
It's been a long time but as far as I remember it was a little button down on the bottom row next to Character, skills, etc. Either that or it was a little button on the bottom of your bag. Click it and it showed you a list of keys.
---
If you want to be viable, especially for premades play a Warlock or a healing Priest.
---
It's really that bad. Plus priest is boring and slow
---
&gt;How are the people making world firsts playing? 
---
A lot + a lot of preparation.
---
&gt;How are the power-levelers playing?
---
&gt;How are the gold farmers playing?
---
A lot.
---
And your party? Levitate is only self cast.
---
But regardless, everyone can just jump into the lava, no need for any slow fall.
---
For hunters
---
That's not the slightest bit true...
---
Lots of guilds that aren't total neets still take raidng serious enough that they don't allow meme specs unless they are absolutely unable to get anyone else. When warriors/rogues/mages are the 3 most popular classes it's usually not an issue finding a few more of them rather than taking a moonkin.
---
I’ve followed this exactly so far. Currently at the mage stage.
---
Yeah that's true too. I remember destro lock being similar in TBC I think it was, where it was better for the locks to just all be destro rather than a mix of destro and affliction.
---
A lot of classes back in vanilla/tbc were limited to basically one spec each raid tier.
---
Yes, I resubbed at 7.2, and played almost through 8.1. 
---
Legion was a good game. lacking the challenge of the journey that TBC had, since the journey was real easy, but a very good game.
---
I wasn't able to commit to a raiding guild/group of any sort since I moved to the US this year and will definitely join one come classic.
---
Yea, I usually see a lot of these threads complaining about the game being too easy, no effort needed, etc. Most of those people haven't cleared much in retail, they shut themselves out of it because it's easy to do that.
---
the staff you get from one of the drops in AQ40 is better, but it's pretty much 3rd or 4th best through Naxx.
---
I have been searching "hunter" in this sub for a few days and totally missed that one. But thats the one! Thank you so so much for this! Really!
---
WaIt DiS mY oRc
---
Shhhhh, you'll fracture his reality
---
Ive been having a hard time with this as well. Ive been practicing with pservers and swtor (it sucks, but its star wars) and cant help from clicking, especially 7-0. Its the, "if im keying in 5, i cant be moving backwards at the same time." Guess ill just need to practice more. Also, watching the tips 1v1 tourney made me feel more inferior. They seemed to be maintaining a birds eye view with mouse, always reacting to position of enemy instantly, while moving accordingly, while keyboarding abilities. I feel like i need to be shiva or something
---
It was frankly never truly the case 15 years ago. People might have realized they miss out. But it didn’t matter if you were experienced and geared.
---
Heck, I was happy until good raid alliances formed to have healing specced healers to begin with.
---
You're entertaining, I'll give you that. Even if your understanding of the game is a bit lacking.
---
that is disgusting im going to throw up
---
ShAmAn WiTh SiLlYhAt
---
discombobulator ray. Instantly knock someone off their mount, and most people think they've been poly'd or something so don't realize they can still do things. I never ran into anyone else that used them back when I played vanilla (well, besides the handful of people that I converted).
---
If I remember correctly we killed the molten giants, firelords and a dog, but we couldn't keep up a fast enough pace to not get respawns on top of us.  Was still fun, though.  Fun side note - our main tank was actually the pally who one-shot Kazzak.
---
It's VC not DM
---
Can you add grief low level players till they quit as an option? Because that's what I'll be doing...then again that's probably just casual pvp
---
Spell hit still exists, independent of damage type. Holy dps needs 16% to cap, shadow only needs 6%.
---
But hey, at least you don't get partial resists.
---
Not helpful bro
---
So is this the total server pop or just your layer?
---
legit get used to it by starting at level 1 and key binding one spell to E, then your other spell to Shift E, youll get used to clicking them and as you level, you can add more important spells to F, shift F, G, shift G, R, shift R, T, G, Q, Shift Q
---
I keep saying, is it really an authentic vanilla experience without constant Chuck Norris jokes in barrens? I know I will be carrying the torch showing these youngsters what vanilla is all about.
---
If they're off the GCD, couldn't you have a one-button macro for it to make a NE-only hunter-Vanish?
---
I'd add macros to the list, and the ability to determine what it is you need. For instance, on warrior, you might want to sword and board in a jam, you can get the gear out in a keypress. Maybe you're a rogue and you keep getting interrupted by a second party running into the fight; get that blind on a mouseover. 
---
These are learned things and being open to increasing your efficiency. Looking at something you either want to do or already do and try to do it better. 
---
When vanilla was first out, half the players didn't even know what a macro was. Using them to your advantage put you on a new level. Think instant ripostes, charges in combat, and the aforementioned mouseovers.
---
I can tell youre shit at the game and has no knowledge about it. Just about *everyone* was grinding, and still is to this day
---
This is embarrassing, really.
---
You heard it here first, pros keyboard turn.
---
Basically. Oh you actually want to heal. Hell yeah come along.
---
I don't think it's even possible to change the original name you registered it with - email yes, but not name. More than likely the account was hacked at some point and the dude you sold it to was unable to recover it because he couldn't prove identity.
---
Skinning is probably the best money maker. Dont forget that if you plan to sell tailoring items for profit you are cutting into your first aid leveling which can be quite important
---
Info:
---
The Quest [The God Hakkar](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=3528) is completed after killing the Avatar of Hakkar in the Sunken Temple. The quest rewards a plate and cloth helmet also. 
---
Avatar of Hakkar drops lvl 49+ rare items but since the quest reward requires no level lots of beta players are trying to grab it at 40.
---
Mage is in a very good spot in Classic. You have incredibly lopsided matchups against some the classes (in your favor). Like you should win 80-90% of the time 1v1 against warriors/rogues/hunters. You're pretty evenly matched against the other classes, with your only bad matchups being Shadow Priest and SL Warlock, though you can roll Undead to make them more manageable.
---
Mage is like the jack-of-trades when it comes to PvP, they're just generally good in all situations. World PvP, BGs, duels, group fights, base defense, and even flag running. You'll always be able to find a place in groups.
---
The only downside is that since Mages scale really well with gear, they're at their weakest early on in the MC/BWL era. They don't really start coming into their own until ZG hits. But once the true endgame hits and they have gear from AQ/Naxx they'll be monsters.

Personally, my end goal is to PvP on a mage too, but to start off Classic I'm actually rolling a Hunter. Hunters are really strong in the MC/BWL phases, not just in PvP but also for gold farming. So I'll main a Hunter for bit, beat people up and get rich farming gold. Then I'll transition over to a Mage once ZG hits.
---
I don’t understand you said it does not mitigate high amount of resists but then you say shadowpriests go 5/5 into a talent when they only need 2 (if it doesn’t mitigate high resists). Confused!
---
Aka you don’t like the sense of achievement that is in retail. What’s satisfying is finally downing that Mythic boss that your guild has been stuck on. Or timing a high level M+ key with your friends. It’s true that the open world is basically meaningless in retail, but instances are millions of degrees more difficult. That in itself is more rewarding for some. 
---
Just because you don’t like what is challenging in retail doesn’t mean you have to shit on the game. The game is shit for other reasons right now, which is due to Azerite Gear and how easy it is to get gear.
---
Tab for targets too. Also polymorph and fear make great mouseovers.
---
May God have mercy upon your soul, brother
---
&gt; By the way, I have my doubts that you've cleared Naxx, Sunwell or have multiple gladiator title with your mindset. Do you have any proof? It sure would help your credibility.
---
The people I am pretty sure are liars are the ones posing as retail Naxx progression raiders who are also pretending to be massively gung-ho about progression and raiding in 2019. If you're the real deal you don't need that badly to brag about stuff you did nearly fifteen years ago.
---
I just did a web ticket on blizzard.com maybe via the wow page, can’t remember.
---
Try to have as much info as possible to help but ultimately I only had the account name, character name/race/class/level, and my ID.
---
Dude, I had a guy building a group for *Wailing Fucking Caverns* that refused a dps slot to a priest. Like, he sat there in chat, spamming "LF1M", wasting his and 3 more people's time, all because "shadow priests are trash dps". Yeah, at lvl 19, when most of your caster dps comes from your fucking *wand*. 
---
Meanwhile, my group finished WC with just 4 people, without a tank. We had a sheep, a couple of pets to offtank and just went HAM on the primary target. Maybe LoS cheesed a few mobs, or feared something. Piss easy, mate, all the way through, including Mutantis. That shit crushed groups back in the day. 
---
That said, even back in vanilla, I remember my buds and I running 10-man content with just whoever we had. Often that meant 6-7 people, some of them in quest greens. We did the 45 minute Baron run with a feral tank and a feral dps. I pugged MC and distinctly remember many people just not doing anything or getting killed in stupid stupid ways. Yea, I never did Naxx or AQ, but then neither did a lot of other people. 
---
My point is that a lot of people try to apply the super-endgame meta to the entire vanilla experience, when in reality not everybody even wants to do that stuff. Yea, if you want to raid endgame, you'll need to roll the meta heroes and spec them "right". But if you're just interested in doing sub-40 stuff, you can literally roll whatever.
---
Agreed, that’s why I want to find a casual guild that are serious when it comes to showing up to raids ready to make the best of it
---
&gt; Some players will hunt unconventional specced ppl just for the sake of loling through ~~MC~~  BGs/PvP with weird specs.
---
The most fun I've ever had in WoW, bar none, was PvPing in weird unexpected specs. It goes like this: 
---
*Two warriors meet out in the wilds of the Hinterlands. One of them is typical Fury/Arms, proudly wearing his Whirlwind Axe. He's used to melting the face of anything he gets near. Basically the only way he loses in PvP is when he's CC'd or kited to death, and he knows if he can stay on you, you're dead. With two warriors it's basically a contest of who can kill the other the fastest.*
---
*But this time it's different. This time the other warrior has a shield. Is he protection? "Oh well it'll just take a little longer to melt him down," he thinks. He charges and proceeds to go through his face-melt ability routine as usual.*
---
*Two solid minutes into the fight... two solid minutes of Concussion Blow stuns, Improved Revenge Stuns, and Improved Shield slams debuffing all his shouts... that this poor Fury Warrior realizes he's in trouble. This isn't a PvE protection warrior, this guy is a pure PvP Protection spec. He's not talented for threat/taunts; he's all about stuns and survivability. After those two minutes, Mr. Fury realizes he might lose, and in desperation he pops his Retaliation. What does the protection warrior do? He pops his Shield Wall. However, he doesn't stop attacking?!! He deliberately keeps attacking* ***through*** *the Retaliation because all of those extra swings just mean more procs for Revenge, which is the bread and butter of his DPS. He's now mitigating some 90% of the Retalliation DPS anyway (Flat 75% from Shield Wall, plus he's blocking every other swing). It also means that poor Fury warrior is absolutely shredding himself on their mithril shield spike, since their block rating stays at ~40% as he's spamming Shield Block every cooldown.*
---
*The protection warrior will either win, or the Fury warrior will run before it's too late.*
---
Just buy one from a vendor or the AH
---
1. There is no layering on the beta realm afaik
---
2. Its based on /who which isn't layered afaik
---
shaman tanks are squishy, but damn could they sure hold aggro
---
ROCK BITTER AND EARTH SHOCK, the taunt of taunts
---
I fucking  fucking egotistical streamers so much. I will not be playing at their servers but I sincerely hope someone has the balls to make their life as miserable as possible when classic comes out to the point of making them so upset they'll have to complain to BLIZZARD ( you think they won't). I'll pray until then. Grief them, camp them, troll them; whatever it fucking takes to put these fuckers egos in check. We already saw a gimple of what they're willing to do.
---
I always rebind a and d to strafe and use q and shift q and e and shift e as binds. 4 free easy binds. Some people say to unbind your backpedal key but as a healer I use it to spell cancel. I personally feel it’s always safer to just back up a hair vs moving left right or forward which could potentially put you in a bad situation positioning wise. 
---
The majority of top tier players do 1-6, shift1-6, alt1-6, e q r t f g z x(also with alt/shift) more then enough binds. All depends on what your hands are comfortable with, practice makes perfect. 
---
As for gold farmers and power-levelers, they could click for all we know. They don’t do anything special and any normal person wouldn’t consider them legitimate wow players.
---
Fishing is far and away the easiest way to level cooking
---
Check the video I linked. It's my old pvp movie and shows all the gear. I sacrificed some to go hard on stamina but it wasn't the best possible set i had theorycrafted back in the day. Optimal outcome had more of everything.
---
Would be nice if there was an option for the middle ground. Lumping everyone into two categories is not going to produce accurate results.
---
Glad you think one shotting lowbies is quality or skill based pvp.
---
Ya armour is good in bear form but you need stamina. I'm not saying "don't bother with armour" I'm saying that set specifically sucks for health which makes it bad. It doesn't compensate with enough armour. You use three pieces of it for the 2 piece and 3 piece bonuses. After that each piece is worse than the mage blue PvP gear for both Stam and int.
---
&gt; You keep equating PVP'ing (which I like and support) with griefing. 
---
No, you do. Up until this very sentence I have not used the word "grief" in this conversation, whereas by my count you have done so 5 times.
---
&gt; There is just a small minority of people on PVP servers that don't do PVP, they grief. It's a hack, an abuse, of a system that is meant to add value, challenge and fun to the game.
---
Fairly certain that killing flagged enemy faction players is within the rules of the game, and is something that players sign up for when they roll on a PvP server. Can it be imbalanced? Sure. Annoying? Yes. Really bloody frustrating at times? Certainly. That doesn't make it griefing, and nor is it a hack. Also I'd wager that Angwe's antics in Menethil added both challenge and fun to the game.
---
I think you've made the right choice to roll on a PvE server.
---
Love the style
---
&gt; 1. the chances of ninja looters drop down when people commit to your team.
---
&gt; 2. you don't get rage quitters the first time their health drops below 30%.
---
&gt; 3. you don't have ninja pullers (hunters mainly) pulling the entire dungeon mindlessly and blaming the tank for not keeping up.
---
&gt; 4. you don't have ninja pullers blaming healers for not keeping them up.
---
You are in for some disappointment, all of those happen constantly on pservers and will happen on Classic as well.
---
Is this how the meme started?
---
This is how most people think.  They can tank 5 mans, no good for raids.  When people talk about whats viable and what isnt they are talking about raids.  Prot pallies are no good as raid tanks.
---
Maybe I could recover it then 🤷‍♂️ worth a shot

# [A] Seven Sins Late Night Guild EU
---
Started by a bunch of irl friends (**and already at 50 members**) with top tier experience through all expansions. (**including world 8th kill TOTC**), Seven Sins is here for all the nostalgic nerds out there that wanna play Classic and cannot do so the normal raiding hours.
---
***General info***
---
* We want to make a **semi-hardcore PVE** guild that will raid 2 times per week(3 on progress) and rest nights run dungeons,world PVP and all the good classic stuff.
---
* If you dont wanna go hard on launch and just wanna chill out but night is your time of the day you can play you can still join the guild as a social and play with more people at night!
---
Raiding info
---
* We aim to clear all content available at the highest pace as we can for a late night guild.
---
* We wanna give everyone a fair chance so if you wanna be Role officers or Raid leader the challenge is here and we will make you feel at home.

---
* We plan to raid  00.00 CEST (Server time) for 3 hours max Wed/Thu(+Sunday on progress).
---
* We will use Loot Council.

* Raiders should have 100% attendance especially when we raid 2 days only and be ready with consumables, enchanted gear.
---
* We will be a fun late night community but on raid times we expect everyone to be serious and focused so we are done with raids in 2 days max and have some world fun the rest of the days.

He can hope! 
---
I’m speaking about FIFA. A legit career mode could be the RPG of sports games.
---
Hunter complaining about anyone else doing something wrong, lel
---
Threats the scary part. Roaming packs catch the mage off guard. Then you just hope he got consecrate from the holy tree. Even then, your healer is going to die and I spend half the pull doing white damage, letting my energy cap and SnD die, then I still pull aggro and get called a noob by our already dead-from-aggro healer.
---
Bears are legit though.
---
im probably a hipster but i really miss csgo before weapon skins
---
You gotta bait out the noobs by having a low level partied with you /evil.
---
I'm hollering
---
You'll have a fairly easy time getting weapons if you're not too picky, there's not a lot of demand for big two-handers outside of a few specific ones that hunters want. There'll be some competition from warriors and shamans and stuff who also want them for pvp, but hey, you wanting something for pvp is just as legitimate as them wanting it for pvp.
---
As for the rest of the gear, if it's not specifically weighted for paladins, I'd personally expect most guilds to tell you to go get fucked, in no uncertain terms. But if you use DKP that might work if you're comfortable being a borderline ninja. Although there's probably still limits to how long a guild will bring a paladin who keeps bidding on dps gear he's not actually going to use to benefit the raid.
---
So either limit yourself to weapons, or find a guild that uses dkp and adopt a cutthroat attitude,
---
But the stats aren't great. It has an ok amount of armour but there's better gear for that + Stam along with it. You use it because of the 2 piece and 3 piece bonuses. You don't use the whole set.
---
I never said "don't use any of that set" you sacrifice the stats to use three pieces of it. After that there's better items for the other slots.
---
Also a good blessing for tanks if you have excess paladins after Kings, sanc and might.
---
I really hope we will, I was never into RP but the “PvP” aspect of RP-PvP was mostly WPvP crazyness and toxic forum drama which I absolutely loved when I used to play on Defias Brotherhood.
---
Warrior has ZERO cc and only 1 escape and will easily die when pulling 2-3 mobs.
---
They are also seriously lacking in cooldowns making harder quests etc hard.
---
Paly might be boring, bit it's not hard. Rogues have a shit tone of CDs in the 3-5 min range which helps a lot, and are less dependent on weapons because finishers are flat damage.
---
Warriors also dont get an instant attack until 34/36 with Whirlwind. 
---
Warrior is still hardest to level
---
I will when I get stress test access again
---
Would a resto druid or a holy paladin have an easier time getting into PuG raids/ getting gear? Or is the difference very minimal that it doesnt really matter
---
I know man. My fondest memories of Vanilla were all pre-raid content. Even in TBC, I felt that Kharazan was way more memorable than anything else.
---
sentry totem*?
---
Lovely mudhuts, peak Horde architecture.
---
&gt; I love how everyone is pro lowbie ganking in here.
---
The way I see it, PvP servers are explicitly designed for ganking, lowbie and otherwise.  That's why I'm playing on PvE... though this thread might convince me to roll a night elf hunter on PvP server just to try out some of these troll moves.
---
There is a petition on change.org and a post on the WoW classic discussion forums.
---
Show your support. Blizzard needs to know how many people really want it. On the forums there is talk that if there isn’t a RP PVP realm at launch they will choose a server to be the “RP-PVP” one. While that’s awesome for a back up plan. It shouldn’t ultimately come to that.
---
Raid markers weren't in the game for a good chunk of Vanilla.
---
dang what a vanilla af trick that isn't in any other expansion! can't wait to get back into vanilla and try it!
---
Running ZG with a prot pally is a giant headache, a fury warrior with pre-bis tanking gear is a better choice by a long shot.
---
I hear some people saying shadow priest is a monster in pvp, and others saying it isnt goodm i was planning on dwarf shadow priest but i need a difinitive answer!
---
The attempt was to point out that when he first started playing console games he likely had to look at the controller to know where buttons were, but overtime muscle memory kicked in. You don't need to know how to type to use a keyboard as a controller, you just need to know where the buttons are relative to your normal hand/finger position. You do that by first looking down at where the buttons are each time, eventually muscle memory takes over.
---
Np thanks anw it will bring back good memories!
---
Dangerous is very much the correct word to describe Vanilla/Classic. People need to realize that dangerous != challenge.
---
They were added in [1.11](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.11.0)
---
&gt; Parties and Raids now can mark targets for their party/raid in the gamefield. A party leader or raid leader/assistant can right-click the portrait of their target to select a symbol to associate with that target. All players in the party/raid will see the selected symbol over the head of the target as well as on the portrait of that target.
---
Hunters are fine without a pet. The reason 50% of hunters are awful is because they spend 1-60 tanking a single mom with the pet while they stand still and shoot. 
---
Turn off growl. Learn to kite and to stutter step for your autoshots, and to FD/trap and to melee weave.
---
...lol?
---
24 is 24 dmg. And I believe that is applied before critical is calculated. Could be wrong.
---
Okay thanks! :)
---
You need more green for Silverpine Forest...
---
Like I said I doubt it will work because it's not an instant ability like Vanish is.
---
All of these things WERE pretty great. What killed the game is blizz's FOCUS on those things, rather then everything else. Then revamping those things into worse versions.
---
If it's a guild full of joyless tryhards maybe. Vanilla raid difficulty is a joke compared to retail. A raid could be 10 people short with 10 extra chromosomes and still clear MC. If a guild can't carry some meme specs around for fun it's just embarrassing.
---
Depends if it's horde or alliance though.
---
With holy paladins on alliance side, its much easier to get into a group as an spriest. Horde probably less willing to use up a spot in a premade for any priest that isn't healing.
---
On my original vanilla server, most of the top spriests were on alliance and most of the good alliance premades had a shadow priest.
---
11 trash days is my favorite way to think about time
---
Strong disagree. Mitigation is much more important for health than a Druid because of heals over time + running away. Mages don't really have a choice but to stack stamina for survivability because they don't have any healing or mitigation. Druids do. Different classes, different stat priorities.
---
Technically you only need one, but having more is always a good thing. The tank not having to stancedance means more threat and less chance of getting smacked by a crush/crit during that brief window in berserker stance.
---
Or just fear warding DPS to get some extra damage. If given the choice between a Dwarf and a non-Dwarf, all other things equal, there's no reason not to go with the Dwarf.
---

#NO CHANGES /s
---
There are a lot of different versions of it. [This](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bqMhshboZbxxccbVZx) is what it looks like when I ding 60. You can swap Spiritual Guidance for Power Infusion and Force of Will, but imo Spiritual Guidance makes more sense for a fresh 60 wearing greens. Priest T0 and a lot of the dungeon drops have tons of spirit. You'll get a bit of side-eye rolling for +dmg items as the healer, so it's easier to stack spirit and turn that into +dmg via Spiritual Guidance.
---
When I start raiding I'll put those 5 points in Spirit Tap into Spiritual Healing, as needed.
---
So to make it the same.. we have to change it?...
---
If you jump while moving you can maintain your momentum and use an instant cast ability in the air. Effectively allowing you to move and use abilities at the same time.  You can also click both mouse buttons simultaneously to walk forward therefore freeing up your middle finger from the W button. 
---
Like I said it just comes with practice. The guys you were watching in the tournament have been playing for years and probably using the same keybinds the whole time so it’s just muscle memory.
---
Lol.
---
You want to play on PVE? Go right ahead.
---
If it makes you feel better to *pretend* PVE Servers will be more populated because you're worried about being on a medium or low population server than by all means tell yourself what you want to hear.
---
But make no mistake. PVP serves will be and always have been higher population servers where the real hardcore players go.
---
Nothing wrong with a PVE server friend, but if you're worried about population on a PVE vs PVP server the PVP server will win every time.
---
Just enjoy your low pop PVE server and gripe about how you thought less people would go PVP.
---
Did you reply to the right comment? Am I missing something?
---
Grats on discovering twinking.
---
Why is that? I have 2 boys, wife, and run a business and play 2-3 hours a night usually. I work 8-10 hours 7 days a week, spend an hour or two playing with my kids, spend some time with my wife, lay with them when they go to bed, and then game. On my workout nights I play about 2 hours. On every other night I get about 3.
---
 I'd say I'm busy from start to finish of my day, but don't really have an issue getting on to game unless I have a day where I work 14 hours or so.
---
On mega servers all proceeds are donated to streamers, so resource scarcity won't exist because the peasants will be paying homage to their lords.
---
Yeah but why is nobody talking about it?
---
I contantly hear streamers say stuff like "my mouse is fucked" etc. But nobody reporting it.
---
Even doing the twitch pvp turnement the mouse movement looked scuffed af.
---
Is that a well known guild? Ive seen some of them running around the beta
---
I know I already signed it!
---
fuck it?
---
I’m legitimately scared. I’m just trying to accept that I don’t need to play end game and can just quest and enjoy the experience of leveling
---
Replying to people who think buffs and heals dont make PvP fair. PVP is just as group as raiding. You dont say "psh that wasnt a real clear..buffs and heals im not impressed". I mean come on not everybody is a dirtball rogue lolll
---
sTaRsHaRDs
---
EU - Horde - Warlock
---
I'm LF Danish players/guild to level with, who plans on leveling to 60. Don't mind if it's a PvP or PvE server. 
---
I know chances are slim of finding anyone on this subreddit, but playing consistently with a group of 4, 10 or an entire guild would be a lot of fun.
---
Lol...what?!
---
Locks weren't really the meta tbh. You brought 1 or 2 for curse(s) that's it. The idea of bringing a stack or warlocks with an Spriest is pretty unique to private servers, as far as I'm aware.
---
Sign me up jabroni! I've been looking for a fun guild and your raid time works perfect for me. Planning on going warlock.
---
Just providing extra context for the clip.
---
I usually hop on for 2-3 hours and try to hit the ground running. Jump straight into a BG, a dungeon, etc. Idk if I'll be able to raid with that much time.
---
The issue was also that you needed 3-4 geared tanks and a lot of guilds had gotten by with 1 up to that point.
---
Hold my beer
---
Just letting everyone who posts about RP-PvP know. Ain’t gonna get a server if we don’t spread the word.
---
on a pvp server racials will decide your fights consistently.  the constant brigade of people on here who downplay the impact WOTF or a well timed stun resist honestly surprises me. by picking a favourable class race matchup you will save yourself alot of graveyard running
---
There are more years that have passed since classic than weeks to go until... classic
---
I was 15 or 16 when WoW came out and I had no clue. I originally raided with Soul Link as Warlock because I heard you die a lot.
---
I'm hoping the influx of new players will support a varied, and healthy, playerbase.
---
TBC dailies were awful. It was literally just the same 5 quests every day.
---
I reckon it will be the same crap as has already happened- free transfers leaving some servers completely dead and fucking up the balance on others.
---
Right - And what do you think that means for world group PvP to farm honor?
---
It took forever to rank in BGs and that was with both of the aforementioned gates as well as honor from matches.
---
Folks thinking they will get geared from WPvP in a hot minute are in for a surprise.
---
Thank you for your work. Looking forward to the wand support.
---
&gt; I can't wait for the people to dropoff after a few months
---
I was always expecting the majority of people to leave after a month or two (because a million tourists from BFA would show up).  But honestly I'm starting to wonder if the majority might stick around.  r/wow has regular threads about how people aren't getting a feeling of satisfaction with the modern game, and the way Classic leveling/upgrading feels meaningful might hook them, especially if they start on a PvE server.
---
Yeah as soon as it's live for na est I am getting on. Grinding tirisfal to 12 then Silverpine to 15 then barrens to 20. Probably will straight shot that before sleeping then wake and head to stonetalon. Hoping to push through the early mob and get ahead by being away from the largest mass of horde heading to the barrens right after their start.
---
Thanks! It seems like it could be BiS
---
We'd usually do Blessing of Light before BoSac, but we used it when we could. 
---
As a joke I actually made it reasonably high onto the damage meter as a holy paladin in MC. I chain-cast Blessing of Sacrifice on the raid in an AoE heavy fight, and the damage meter gave me credit for all of the damage I did to myself. (I bet the raid leader 100g that I could beat his ret paladin alt on the dmg meter.)
---
saw 10 seconds of my friend playing with his orc hunter in barrens with a musket. before that i was a diablo 2 fanboy and i remember i had this thing where you mail a high schooler and was telling him how lame he was for playing wow and he should play diablo 2 instead
---
Cool thanks! I like it a lot!
---
Thanks that's pretty helpful now I can level all my tools to the mid 30's just like the good old days
---
Classic is harder, if you define harder as in you can’t pull 4 mobs at any level and escape relatively unharmed. I dare anyone to try that once classic launches. Slower basically entails a harder difficulty.
---
Awesome post
---
It’s nice for farming. If you’re just clearing the same area over and over again it pays off as you you can just find a central spot. I know we’re talking about leveling here, but farming is certainly a part of the process. It really comes in handy farming for your mount. Bonus points if you can find a relatively empty spot to own.
---
if your interested in pvp as a warlock do yourself a great favour and roll horde. not facing the torrent of undead will make your life alot easier
---
No those are hard because you have to train, learn, and memorize.
---
Not the same to just getting on a boat and running across a zone in a video game..which is just time consuming.
---
How is that hard? You can auto walk most of the way anyway which only takes time.
---
No! Everyone has to have an equal chance at getting loot and a fair chance at getting a raid spot, regardless of performance, class and spec. This is rainbow land where everyone is happy, equal and gets along #stopracismaganstowls
---
Do you have a source? As far as I'm aware they've only said it will be a shared sub, they haven't said anything about there not being a cost for the actual game but I'm sure I could have missed some news.
---
I'll likely only have two or three days a week to play, for a few hours each. (Give or take depending on work and family stuff.) So I'm definitely casual.
---
As for your question? Eight hours a day is most definitely NOT casual. Doing ANY kind of hobby for eight hours a day is not casual. Three hours? I don't know. I think of it like this: if you can justify X amount of time doing Y activity to your buddies who don't also do it, it's casual. (WoW or another game, watching TV, going to the gym, reading, building a boat like in your basement like Gibbs, whatever.) If you can picture them saying, "You spend HOW much time building model planes every day???", then it's probably hardcore.
---
I'm aware that "casual and hardcore" mean different things to the WoW community. I guess I use them in a more general sense.
---
Looks frustrating.
---
Just do what I do and use the time to think about your poor life choices!
---
There's no punishment for ganking low levels on a PvP server. It's an intended part of the game, people can fight whoever they want in contested areas.
---
And will save me from getting "one or two" beers after work with the crew too often!
---
Once they feel the time commitment most will whither though :)
---
This right here is why I never understood all those freakouts and panic attacks on YouTube and other media over lost or deleted characters and accounts.
---
Blizzard has always been excellent and right on point with restoration. Just a mail or a ticket and you will get your shit back in days or even hours.
---
More of this plz
---
Everybody has equal opportunity to get to max level and to get gear.

For the most part, Warocks can juggle the two resources for incredibly long periods of time before having to Eat/Drink again while leveling.
---
You don't seem to understand. There's better gear for Armour than that set.

Even if that was the only stat you cared about, which is most definitely shouldnt be, that set would still fall short.
---
Then I’d probably say casual both as you spend just a bit of time doing both
---
I’m going to save you 5 minutes of watching pointless youtube videos:
---
Lvl 5: Lesser Magic Wand (AH)
---
Lvl 13: Greater Magic Wand (AH)
---
Lvl 19: BFD quest wand
---
After these you mostly rely on AH/Dungeon drops for a while.
---
You can get Goblin Igniter at lvl 31+ in STV which is a decent option if you got no upgrades for your BFD Wand.
---
If you happen to hace enough gold for your Wand, buy a blue wand from the AH in the late 30s/early 40s.
---
Horde can get a lvl 41+ Wand from Hinterlands, Ally a lvl 42+ from Feralas (Feathermoon stronghold).
---
Priest can get a pretty nice one from their lvl 50 quest.
---
Play them all to 10 and then go from there.
---
agreed you shouldnt be downvoted. i love having same realm bgs but at the same time after experiencing years of aids premades vs non premades on private servers i wouldnt mind crossrealm to much if it fixes that. its just not fun when you cant get a fair game and its just premades smashing
---
We don’t know if camp scripts don’t work yet lol. Have you tested it? Farm a dungeon, ask a guild to join your group, use your script?
---
I guess I can try pve too, but world pvp is pretty fun when your close level.
---
I’ll definitely make sure to get that all down only problem I can think omg is when I got the professor title I changed my name to “Oak” with an accent over one of the letters but I know the original character name and I believe I remember my alts name
---
after looking a little more, the quiver totally shows up. it can be hard to see on certain races and with certain cloaks.
---
as well, sometimes a hunter's melee weapon(s) don't show up (i think it happens when they transition from autoattacking to autoshotting, which was also a problem hunters were having in the beta) but the quiver still does. this video is pretty undeniable proof - a troll hunter (where quivers are most visible, high on the back) and.... well, just watch-
---
https://youtu.be/XYCH1PCd5Ag?t=806
---
so if the melee weapons NEVER show up while autoshotting, it's a bug. if they only do sometimes.... that's vanilla!
---
Its cause gear is only part of it. The geared ret has to go against a bad mage who is afk and the ret HAS to use engineering.
---
#viable until they get to a boss
---
How enlightening.
---
I mean to some people having to slow things down means harder, but for a lot of us it isn't.
---
Like what? The exalted AB shoulders? Yes, that's a reasonable alternative, though I'd still wear the PvP gear for the 6 piece bonus if I was playing 30/21 Feral/Resto.
---
I disagree with you in pretty much every comment on this thread. 
---
However, it is pretty awesome that we will both get to enjoy Classic here pretty soon. And hopefully TBC after that!
---
I’d have to say Gadgetzan for me, I spent so much time running ZF.
---
Damn it’s self cast in vanilla? That’s no fun.
---
Playing a Mage is like being Irish. Fight and drink, fight and drink.
---
But generally speaking you have it a lot better than most other classes. With your slows, roots, mana shield, and ice barrier you almost never take HP damage while grinding. So if someone tries to gank you when you're OOM you can still mana pot + sheep into Evocate and be good to go. Also your food and water is free.
---
All other classes have similar issues, except they also lose health when fighting mobs. And they have to pay for food/water.
---
Except Hunters. Hunters are the only class in the game with good uptime, they can grind pretty much forever without having to stop to eat or drink. They do require more maintenance though with having to buy ammo and feed their pet. But they are the most efficient grinders when it comes to single mobs.
---
But really, Mages are the best grinders because they can pull AoE packs. That's the real secret to being efficient as a Mage. Because you can spend your entire mana bar to kill 2-3 solo mobs, or you can spend your entire mana bar to kill 1 pull of 20-30 mobs. If you can find good spots to AoE grind and learn to do it well then you'll be the most efficient class in the game.
---
Feral has a wierd-ass gear curve, but they're definitely worth it to bring to MC.
---
BWL is pretty fucking debateable, but if you tough it out there's some good gear past that.
---
Also from what I hear from people that healed back then, they hated ferals because they were just sponges. No block, so their primary way of dealing with crits and crushes was to fucking eat it. 
---
That's pretty appropriate as far as class fantasy for a literal bear goes, but it did make them unpopular with the guys who had to heal them.
---
That might or might not be a legitimate complaint for them to make; if they increase raid performance, then the healers just need to get their shit together and eat a mana pot. But it might be that that approach isn't feasible, and then feral is bad.
---
LUL I'm totally going to waste all of them
---
&gt; wierd ass-gear curve
---
You reroll priest ;)
---
Yes. Theyre the highest DPS class in the game.
---
[Mrrglglrglrgglgrlgrlglrlgllll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMPpnCvCZvw)
---
Survivability and mobility; same things that make them good in WSG. A druid that knows their role can be a great defender and annoying for the opponent.
---
And people are still mad they had to corpse run for 6 hours... but sure dungeons are so easy right...
---
Truly 5head 200iq
---
if your min maxing on a pvp server its true. orc is king. for a mage i think its a tossup for gnome and undead
---
No. Other classes do higher dps
---
They are not by far.
---
Rogues are always popular, no matter what the meta is supposed to show otherwise.
---
Key Ring should appear for the Scarlet key. I dont have proof I can show, but I am dead certain that was a key that went in the bag.
---
I havent been on beta since the level increase, but I got a temporary key in my 20s and it never triggered the bag, and I seem to recall temporary keys doing so.
---
Lol okay
---
Having to slow yourself down really entails that it is harder. Because you slow yourself down because you know that if you don’t, and try to do big pulls while questing, that you will die.
---
Nope.   
---
I think you might be even more vulnerable to targeted AoEs and grenades..so there's another shitty reason.
---
Where's GM Island? Fake news
---
Or what they usually do is stand on the flight master hoping to accidentally attack them when trying to click on the flight master
---
500 players top. I wonder if that's what they aiming for each layers on first day.
---
i posted this as a reply below, but it seems that when hunters transition from autoattack to autoshot, their melee weapons disappear, but the quiver stays. there's 100% quivers, check out this video
---
Why take 10 whole minutes when i got ny handy shit sock?
---
i dont understand what you mean. Rogues are consistently top in most raid encounters in vanilla, they have awesome utilities, are strokg in pvp from 1-60 and next to warriors will be the most played class in Classic. PVP/PvE server wont make a difference.
---
Hate to break it to you, but there are no rules on an RP or RP-PVP realm that requires anyone to respect your RP. The Roleplaying Realm policy is completely gone and no longer enforced by Blizzard (costs too much). The only policy still in effect is the naming policy.
---
You do need to be at a moonwell to do Mooncloth transmutes.
---
But really, just make a druid since travel form is free.
---
Yeah that makes sense
---
There is no better gear with that balance of armor + stamina + intellect in the game with the exception of the exalted AB shoulders + exalted WSG legs. Those are reasonable alternatives, although the 6 piece set bonus makes it a wash between those pieces if you're playing 30 Feral 21 Resto.
---
The PvP set is very, very good for Druids.
---
Was it actually playable? Like could you kill mobs? Or was the lag so bad it was pretty much unplayable?
---
Rogues are popular no matter which faction or which server type.
---
10/10 female Nelf priest name
---
At no point in classic were they top dog, so...
---
You’re right, thanks for the reminder.
---
This looks like it was made in Inkarnate
---
No but I can read. Are you really going to deny doing what you're doing, when your entire argument rests on an appeal to common sense?
---
You want to be able to not have to make any arguments because the answer is obvious, while simultaneously maintaining that I couldn't possibly tell what you're doing just by reading your messages because you're such a mystical special snowflake that doesn't behave like anyone else.
---
Arguing common sense while denying it to your opponent seems hypocritical to me.
---
They are still fine. Not great by any means but not so bad that you would feel bad for being there
---
Good post but you do not strike me as a casual.
---
That's really sad.
---
I’ve got about 100 screenshots that say otherwise.
---
He means they aren’t the highest dps class, it was pretty clear.
---
You know... we just really need that audio sample...
---
I feel like you are the most correct. I remember at 60 I had all the keys, but only like 6 in my keyring. The little ones like Gnomeregan didn't go in the keyring at all, only the higher lvl ones.
---
You mean you’ve got a bunch of screenshots of a rogue leading **your raid** in dps?
---
Honestly been thinking about master demonologist as warlock. 
---
1) warlocks are known to have threat issues. MD/imp, 20% is 20%, not to include salvation if you're into alliance. You're also going to have imp out anyways.
---
2) in raid, you curse ele, shadow, reck, and then spam bolts. Unless you're the lucky one to get a corruption slot, SM/ruin is a waste of talents in raid. However, it's a great dungeon/PvP/farming (all around) build.
---
3) MD/ruin for bolt spam seems good, and potential for more DPS earlier game instead of slowing down for threat.
---
4) if you PvP and don't play conflag, take soul link over ruin and laugh in demonic
---
Why are people saying rogues aren't highest dps? Only things that beat that compete with them are mages and warriors.
---
Because he deleted his post I can’t reply so I’ll use yours and quote his:
---
&gt; And my personal experience raiding with ferals is that they take way more damage than Warriors and thus are harder to heal, plus they don't have the useful cooldowns Warriors do (shield wall, last stand, lifegiving gem) and they cannot use potions/healthstones/etc because it drops bear form.
---
That’s down to you being a bad healer or your feral being an absolute moron with his gearing.  Likely both based on your “rankings” above.
---
**&lt;Moist&gt; PvE Horde NA Casual Raiding**
---
We are Moist, a collection of friends (and some significant others) having come together through the ages of playing WoW and still staying loosely in touch with one another. The goal is to find other fellow mature players with limited schedules wanting to make the most of a single organized raid night without the pressure to fully min/max. The core of us are laid back, mature players with busy schedules, but who have raided since vanilla. 
---
We are all excited for this release.  For some it’s about nostalgia, for others it’s about experiencing classic for the first time.  Regardless of why we are here we can all agree we are here to have fun. We are a casual guild but that does not mean we aren’t aiming to succeed.  We want to create a comfortable atmosphere so we can all experience the game in a positive way. Play what you want, play how you want, play when you want.  We are accepting and open to players of all types.
---
Classic WoW relied heavily on individual and guild reputation.  We will strive to make Moist synonymous with quality: quality players, quality attitudes, quality experiences.  Anyone who encounters a member of Moist should leave thinking that we are knowledgeable, respectful, fun, and all around awesome!
---
**Expectations:** 
---
Members should have a desire to learn and share knowledge to improve the guild. Seeing as we will operate on minimal organized raid time it is important that members be prepared and prompt for raid. The goal is to at least be farming BWL and 20 player content and pretty much see what motivation levels are like beyond that. We run a loot council but we try to be fair and transparent as well. We’re looking for people to help share the responsibility of running our guild community rather than focus too heavily on progression. 
---
**Raid Schedule:** 
---
We are planning to run two separate 3 hour raid IDs, one on Thursdays at 6 pm PST (9 pm EST) and the other on Saturdays 5 pm PST (8 pm EST), for targeting 40 player content. By having two raid groups, we hope to be flexible for people’s schedules while also providing a large player base for smaller group content. Other nights there may be optional 20 player content scheduled as interest dictates given the shorter lock out schedule. 
---
**Contact:**
---
If you are interested and want to be part of our discord for release day organization, then please message Slaugth#9941 on discord or even a DM here on reddit with a discord contact (I don't check reddit as often so please be patient).
---
well, multiply that by 2 at least (ally and horde will be on the same layer)
---
You can’t really say it about Legion and in BfA it is barely an issue. The issue now is though that your gear barely matters.
---
But they are? and if not its certainly not ‘by far’. Obviously there are exceptions but rogues are generally at the top in vanilla, unless you have a high geared warrior or a mage on certain bosses.
---
&gt; We live in a society
---
If they have multiple pvp servers without at least one rp-pvp i'm going to be salt.
---
Improved souldrain
---
No, they aren’t lol. At no point in vanilla were rogues the #1 dps, which is what you asserted. There was always something else doing more damage.
---
Another TBC baby talking aboit the greatness of vanilla.
---
Man I can't wait for all the forum posts of people demanding the same things they demanded all those years ago because classic will inevitably start fucking with them.
---
elaborate? Rogues/mages/warriors are always top.
---
Both are good for leveling. As a priest you just need to shield yourself and wand everything dead. For raiding later most guilds take just 1 or 2 druids for Mt heal and rest is split among priest and Pala. Priests are in some situations stronger because of group heal. Druids are better for single target heals like Mt heal.
---
If you're 30 points feral that set is even worse for you because you're getting a 20% int and Stam talent. You are now avoiding the stats you get a bonus to. 
---
Even some of the tier 1 and 2 has so much more int, stamina and resistances on it, it's better. Not to mention the odd tanking druid pieces in bwl.
---
Now tell me whatchu gonna do
---
Wanna go WC? LF2m healer and tank
---
It's wow classic, play whatever you want but don't expect people to accept you as you want to play the game if it's totally nonsensical.
---
You could raid as a healer with a prot spec (putting forward as a benefit the blessing of sanctuary) but only in an average guild in desesperate need of a healer.
---
Sure, if the respec cost were low you could switch spec, man everyone has some fetish but with the 50g respec cost it's more like being a masochist.
---
Elaborate? Stop lumping all 3 specs together lol. Just because they were good doesn’t mean they were the best. You said they were the best(they weren’t), he corrected you. That’s it.
---
It’s literally a scientific fact, not feelycraft.
---
They asked for any name of any character. So... if it’s been long enough the race/class/lvl matters more or it seemed to. Cause they flag characters for rename after x time.
---
INTRUDER ALERT INTRUDER ALERT
---
For pvp hands down undead. With pvp trinket you can get out of two fears and cannibalize for hp for world pvp situations. I’ve played orc, human, gnome rogues and undead was my favorite by far. Humans are most pve dps but for pvp undead is the superior.
---
You don't really sound casual, dude.
---
Like, I don't want to be some sort of casual gatekeeper or anything, and 'casual' means different things for different people, but everything you've posted is just the standard 'you have to work harder for things' that gets posted repeatedly as one of the reasons people liked vanilla. If you prefer vanilla because you have to work harder for things, more power to you, but that doesn't sound very casual to me.
---
I've literally never seen a single streamer say sharding is a good thing
---
scientific! im not replying to you any more, you never played classic.
---
Are you trying to say that dungeons are hard because it took level 40s 6 hours to clear a level 50 dungeons?
---
What's with the one hour where everyone stop playing?
---
Yes but they will be behind following classes later.
---
Ignite mage &gt; warrior &gt; warlocks &gt; rogues....
---
Believe it or not, sometimes the hunter isn't the worst player in the group.
---
I think they are good in wpvp and your random bgs but i think I’ve seen a lot of people saying they aren’t good for premades
---
im really debating just playing for my friends subscriptions if they actually play, I just want to play with my friends and feel like im 9 again.
---
When battle.net integration first happened you could change the name on the account.  I got my name on my account changed to my actual name, you could add any act to your battle.net including ones with different names.
---
Is that legit? I'm in no beta club, but I've played a few PS, and even they aren't that difficult.
---
Not to mention all the shields "of shadow wrath"
---
Well.. If you care about that.
---
For me, choosing a faction was easy. I like to play the good guys, so for the Horde it is. Lok-tar Ogar!
---
The PvP set is not very good for druids. The first three pieces you put on are very good for druids. After than there are plenty of better choices in BWL and AQ depending on which pieces you're using.
---
I do S for strafe left, D for move forward, F for strafe right. Gives you access to more keys, instead of having your hand cramped up on the left side.
---
Some basics:
---
Take Engineering. Grenades, bombs, sapper charges, etc. give you a huge edge in PvP. Some guilds even require every member to have Gnomish Battle Chickens for the buff.
---
Use a deranking macro so you can cast multiple ranks of the same spell from a single hotkey.
---
Fake casting is really important in PvP. This is when you start casting a spell, but intentionally interrupt it to bait your opponent into wasting their interrupts or counterspell. It becomes a huge chess match of trying to predict whether your opponent is fake casting and how soon you should burn your interrupt. This kind of stuff is why people don't like cross-realm battlegrounds since you start to learn each individual player's preferences for interrupts and you can become better at facing specific opponents. Shamans and Druids can fake cast with their Hearthstone since the casting animation is similar to their heal.
