Perfect re-creation of the WoW logo in 640x480 res.  It doesn't get more Vanilla than that.  Take my pixelated upvote.
---
---
---
Oh wow I think you're right. Vanilla demo seems boring now. Sure it has its uses though.
---
So you don't understand the difference between depending upon and keeping your options open?
---
A good Rogue can completely change the tide in a WSG premade, make great defenders in AB, and can backdoor objectives in AV.
---

---
There isn't really any class that can't find success as a solo player, as a BG player, as a world PVPer, or that has trouble with itemization. Some classes might be better suited to one aspect over another, but the difference isn't so major as to completely nullify the other class.
---
I have that same one on my wall I bought it from amazon
---
Why are warriors so god damn whiny?
---
All class groups can agree to do this. DKP doesn't reward based on efficient distribution of items but rather rewards loyal players who show up.
---
Yes, like everything in life it's All or Nothing. I thought you have so much fun you gain an extra life or you have a stroke on the spot from getting wrecked.
---
Im hoping to stay in control this time and I think it will be a hell of a lot more manageable for several very key reasons. I almost found myself divorced and paying child support last time during Vanilla because I allowed it to consume me, I neglected my wife and newborn children utterly for years and still breath a sigh of relief my wife stuck around until my shore duty ended which basically snapped me back to reality but even then it was an uphill battle to rebuild our marriage and responsibly play retail WoW (kind of easy when it's sucked dick since Cataclysm)              
---
             
---
The magic and mystery is gone, yes I will have a blast playing the great original but i'm no longer left wondering whats the best spec, wheres the best gear, how to effectively perform my rotations and just whats at the end of the rabbit hole. Unless "Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind" is a documentary there is no chance in hell any of us will slip back into that mindset with even just a small amount of will power.                
---
               
---
Also again not to be dramatic but WoW really did come insanely close to ruining my life, I was uncontrollably drinking and playing and at one point contemplating suicide. Once agian I have this key component called memory and would have to be insane to allow it to get that bad again and with all the information avaliable on here, youtube and just common knowledge if you played Vanilla theres not a giant reason to sink 100 hours a week into the game. Wana raid well there 500x videos telling you where the best gear is and what the best strategy is and what consumes to bring and lets be perfectly for god damn real, the real raid boss in WoW was a super shitty internet.              
---
              
---
Retail may be trash and getting 40 people to pay attention and show up is a chore but if you can stomach LFR's nonstop shit show and your not still playing on a 56k modem Vanilla Raids are not going stress anything.
---
For me its starting over that im excited about. Cant wait to start with the name and class ive always wanted. Im the epic troll shaman Thex!!!
---
I share that feeling.
---
&gt;Can you please explain to me how I misinterpreted the message I quoted?
---
I can't know why you are misinterpreting something because that happens inside your head. My best guess is you are reading it like it's a stand alone statement without reading what I responded to. Context matters so if you aren't paying attention to it you won't understand most things you read.
---
&gt;And if it was all about your personal choice, then why are you even trying to support it with arguments like "the only sets for warriors in the game are plate"?
---
I guess because it's a fact and it supports my personal understanding the game. I like to use facts to support my world view.
---
Craft the Community experience you want to see.
---
College schmollege.  Classic WoW &gt; education!
---
Your vulgarity and insults does not strengthen your arguments.  
---
Layering proves that the game is hyped and people will be leaving in mass.  
---
People will be leaving unfortunately because of the lack of content at level 60. 
---
There's no skill needed to play this game, like every old MMORPG this game is about grinding. I would be curious what you consider difficult in Vanilla?
---
I remember when hunter 1-10 pre pet quest was sooo boring, then i tried a paladin for a few then decided fuck it ill be hunter and never looked back.
---
Someone get that bingo thing so we can cross this one off
---
Troll or undead? ^_^
---
K, dude
---
If a guild actually gives a boomkin caster gear over a mage, that's a massive red flag.
---
Get outta there.
---
Wow, really? You managed to cap, get attuned, and make it to Ony all in one day?
---
Impressive...
---
I've seen several Boomkins on Pservers in raids.  Once you're AQ+ gear and you melt through BWL and MC, all those specs that suck because they run out of mana don't have worry so much because every fight is over quick.
---
Phase 1 in Classic?  Yeah, probably not that many.
---
Stress test has nothing for WoW classic total servers.  This is a global release, they're testing it during Blizzard's office hours.  
---
How many servers were in the last stress test?  They make a server that has 3500 slots available, they get 30k people trying to log on worldwide, great success for them.

---
That guide is ok, but it's based on private server experience where voidwalker dps was overtuned.
---
The most standard way to level a warlock is to go affliction straight to shadow mastery something like this https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IA0bVRbkA 
---
Warlocks are very flexible though. The core talents are 5/5 improved corruption and 2/2 improved life tap, after these you can go with whatever you want.
---
Mage.
---
I would really not recommend this unless you're purely in it for the questing/lore. So much of what makes the experience is the world pvp.
---
Swapping shields is really easy:
---
&gt;/equip Nameofyour2Hweapon  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;/equip Nameofyour1Hweapon  
---
&gt;/equip Nameofyourshield
---
This was made with Arms in mind. If you play Fury, and if you use an off-hand weapon that can be equipped in either hand, then you will need some more lines in there. (Otherwise it will just replace your mainhand with your off-hand instead of taking off your shield.)

This is a Chinese song called I'm Still Young, I'm Still Young by Lao Wang Band. Here are the lyrics in English:
---
In this world
---
You seek your dream.
---
You ask me where the dream is
---
I'm still young; I'm still young
---
They all say
---
We leave our ideals
---
in those wild days
---
I don't cry
---
I don't escape
---
Give me a bottle of beer
---
And give me a cigarette
---
Let's go now
---
I have more than enough time
---
I don't want to cry alone in the the days to come
---
that I won't be able to go ahead
---
I'm struggling on the edge of youth
---
I'm gazing from the end of freedom
---
I'm wandering on the desolate grasslands
---
Looking for ideals
---
Looking for, looking for ideals.
---
Your bis chests for Phase 1 to phase 3, and phase 4 to 5 are both  tailoring you twit. Robe of the Void and Bloodvine chest. I think a guild might care that their raider is too lazy to get full on bis chest items for 50% of the game because he's a stubborn fool. 
---
Any guild in the top 25% will absolutely care about tailoring on their casters. I'm sure your guild wouldn't care if a warrior never got lionheart? Rogue didn't get devilsaur set? 
---
Tailoring is incredibly powerful in vanilla for clothies and you are doing yourself and your guild a disservice in cheaping out.
---
Because the burden of carrying everyone through the entire game takes a toll.
---
I mean this is prolly not even the first ‘Battle Station’ post today even...
---
Hopefully the day/night cycle actually works on Oceanic servers. Retail OCE is always dark during peak hours.
---
Did you raid before 1.7? Before that limit was 8 and you had to be careful. When it went up to 16 iirc we stopped caring.
---
one thing to note, you sometimes sunder in battle or zerker stance as a dps warrior
---
No, thanks tho. The one I'm looking for has mob levels for each area of each zone. Like very detailed, each little section of each zone labeled with what level the mobs are that spawn in that area.
---
Thanks everyone for all the love from the last one! This week to make things easier, I figure'd id make a strawpoll for everyone to vote for the next class they want to see

And, as it was brought up alot, my wife's (the artists) website is found here http://dawndragonart.webstarts.com/index.html , incase you love her art and wanted a comission or to just see some awesome art! 
---
and, if you wanted to support her art in other ways(another common question from last time), her patreon is here https://www.patreon.com/dawndragonart
---
So why dont they just ask blizz to buff the other classes or nerf them?
---
Hmm, I don't have this problem. On PC where I have Retail and Classic installed, I can swap between versions using the dropdown. On Mac where I only have Classic installed, there was no configuration necessary.
---
Though, right now, there is no way to filter game versions to Classic-only when browsing or searching for addons.
---
did you mostly click? The things you have keybound are some of the last things i would think to keybind if I was mainly a clicker
---
Great guide!  
---
Typo correction:  
---
**Why you should play a Hunter**  
---
A good hunter is a **devastating** foe in all types of PvP.
---
At first glance I swore you wrote "Stress test Thex".  Damn memes.
---
I don't think it's for raids lmao
---
*Classic rain / Some stay dry and others feel the pain / Classic rain*
---
Hey,  I'm looking for a EU Alliance pvp server semi-hardcore raiding with a hearty mix of PVP. I'm very flexible on raid days, my plans are to roll a dwarf priest and play an average of 8 to 12 hours a day. 
---
I played back in vanilla and tbc, looking forward to doing it again now I'm not 14! Feel free to ask for further details or what guild you've got!
---
The irony of saying meditation doesn't work but then ending your post with alcohol and benadryl give temporary relief.. feels just a tad biased.
---
I find most people who can't handle meditation are the ones who desperately need to do it the most. IE  if you can't sit with your thoughts in silence for 15-20min there's something very wrong
---
Dwarf or Tauren hunter!
---
Shadowmeld + Mind Control in Blackrock... fuck some days up.
---
The fact you don't have a monitor directly facing your resting keyboard position gives me so much pain. Otherwise looks nice!
---
&gt; Would having a main that can get better gear, have an effect on how much gold I can farm? Or should I just focus on alts and farming unless I want to raid?
---
You should focus on establishing relationships with other people on your server (your 'main' is a good way to do this, but you can do it via alts as well) and from there derive benefits. As far as 'gold farming' is concerned a lot of people seem to forget that your actual income/hour is significantly higher if you're in a group, rather than solo farming (which is what people tend to think of when gold farming). That and the fact that just having people who are willing to play with you (no matter what the content is) makes the game a hell of a lot easier.
---
Unless they've said something i missed, blizz' current stance is that there won't be any rp-pvp servers for classic, unfortunately.
---
What’re you naming it?
---
I 100% did this with my vanilla wow guild on mannoroth. Was 3 or 4 guilds mixed and first few times we did MC took a some under 60 cap. MOST had blues and some greens. Never once did a full 40 man guild run the whole time i played classic.
---
No? Why would it? It has 0 Spellpower. 30 Stamina, 20 Spirit and a pretty mediocre Buff to your Group.
---
Roll hunter, get level 60 in 5 days... have nothing to do while everyone else catches up. At least you have time to work on those professions you neglected.
---
    So much pussy-posting in this thread, man. 
---
I say fuck it bro, lets throw our lives away. 
---
    I can understand those of you that have wives and children, but theres no way those people are the majority of the playerbase.
---
    For those like me - the dead ends with no future or family of their own, who have no place and want no place in society, disgruntled with the modern world, the faithless with nothing to live for - this is our moment. This is our chance to fill the gaping void of fulfillment in our lives with the purest form of escapism.
---
    I'm talking FUCK IT bro, let your bills pile up, stop showing up to work, save a few weeks and pay nothing but the internet, live like a fucking cave rat, talk to only to your immediate family, lie to them and reassure them that you're just taking a break. FULL SOCIETAL SUICIDE UNTIL THE FUCKING FEDS KNOCK ON YOU'RE DOOR, PULL YOU OUT AND SIEZE YOU'RE PLACE OF LIVING.
---
BITCH IM RANK 14 AND HAVE KILLED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF THE OPPOSING FACTION, I AM A FUCKING GOD WHO HAS EXPERIENCED THE PEAK OF HUMAN PLEASURE, THE SERVER TREMBLES WHEN I LOG IN, I AM/WAS A LIVING LEGEND.
---
    Let them come brothers. Fuck it. FUCK IT. We shall go start a nomadic tribe in the mountains of some national park and live the rest of our lives telling stories of conquest around the campfire. This is it, THROW UR FUCKING LIVES AWAY.
---
OOTL: what's "Thex" all aboot?
---
Words also have context.
---
Fire mage isn't viable DPS in Phase 1 for world first.
---
As I stated before, once we are debating the impact of 1% hit and shit like that we are well past the range of "OMG we managed to down Golemagg!!!!".
---
There are videos that shows an all Druid Onyxia is "VIABLE", and I'm sure the same could be done in MC
---
It’s healthstones and soul stones that disappear I believe
---
This is an automatic response because the poster doesn't have enough mana too reply.
---
&gt;I just got done doing AQ on a private server
---
Dude. AQ is not classic, you retard. The only classic raids are MC and the lizards that some dude ran into.
---
Repeat: Ahn'Qiraj is not classic WOW.
---
Ok Trump
---
FAKE NEWS!!!
---
Undecided
---
&gt; PLAY THE RACE AND CLASS YOU LOVE. PLAY IT WELL. **SHOW UP ON TIME AND BE RESPECTFUL.** YOU. WILL. GET. A. RAID. SPOT.
---
QFT - Reliable players have always been the most important asset to a raid group.
---
If I had the choice of an obnoxious, unreliable, melodramatic player that tops charts or a subpar DPS/hybrid that shows up on time and is fun to be around I will **always** take a subpar DPS that shows up on time and is fun to be around.  Every goddam time.
---
No it hasn't. Your secondaries may make you weaker than being BIS from the last 10 levels but the same mobs don't get stronger with you, lvl 82 mob never got stronger it was always lvl 82. In BfA the same camp of mobs gets harder the more you level.
---
Except warriors, who sacrifice solo play for the sake of being an absolute monster in group PvP.
---
A guy made a big thread about how he was excited to make a character, and specifically said he'd make a shaman named Thex
---
This lead to the entire subreddit deciding they would also be making a shaman named thex and thus a small meme about stealing his name was born!
---
Remembering that this is your chance to have fun so you have to decide which of those options sounds more fun
---
What about Kungen? will he be playing classic? he had a big following I think
---
5 druids are ideal, can lfg in one city, you get flex roles for days, and you can take turns playing petting zoo.
---
Warrior dps in 5 man is dumb, any warrior can tank 5 man content. Warrior dps is very much wanted in 40 man content though.
---
reappling the hots that are being dispelled
---
Might want to browse all comments, I clarified some things farther down.
---
What would a good druid pvp spec look like, something like [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/0140003-50015013030201-05522310031)?  I've never played druid before but they sound very interesting in pvp.
---
did you have a source on the 24%? I was under the impression it reset the swing timer completely. (That’s how it works on my pserver, from which we’ve seen is inaccurate af).
---
I've got the G600 by Logitech in White.
---
Only cost me like 42€ back then in WoD, and I've been using ever since. It is quite bulky, but I love it quite a lot for MMORPGs.
---
Can only recommend it for MMORPGs
---
you are looking at shaman, so easy to gear in MC, good solo, good in bgs, good in wPVP, very self efficient class
---
 
---
  ..  
---
n
---
&gt; hunters playing in retail right now that don't have traps.
---
Fuck off.  I refuse to believe this.
---
Nice! Can't wait for more!!
---
TSM isn't available Classic and unless Blizzard launches a web API for Classic, it won't be happening. Since they're the ones that run /r/woweconomy, they've had no reason to push any support for Classic. The Discord server has a Classic-Beta channel, but that's it.
---
Awesome! This was exactly what I wanted to hear. Was the lag noticeable?
---
If I roll human, does my rep racial help at all?
---
I found it a tad weird at first, but I've grown very used to it. You can use it as a modifier button for the thumbbuttons, meaning in theory 24 buttons with one hand if you have the dexterity for it.
---
This one stings.  I had forgotten about that.
---
U know graveyard locations are not inside dungeons in classic right?
---
I got mine back in early WoD and been using it ever since. It's an awesome mouse and I can only recommend it, especially for MMOs or other games with loads of keybinds.
---
Don't tell me how to live my life.
---
Less gear competition?
---
its also the same tick rate as energy. and the same is used for food/drink ticks
---
Question: I heard the the old raids, like classic AQ40 are actually easier mechanically than say, HC TOS for dodging/AOE/positioning etc. Ive head people say that what made old AQ40 hard was that it was new, you were trying to coordinate 40 people over headset in an age where everyone had massive lag on dialup and old computers... What are your throughts on this? (I never played Classic, just curious to hear from someone who has)
---
THAT. ROCKS. Thoroughly enjoyed.
---
Does the hit thing change anything really? As far as I'm aware pservers used 9% as the hit cap which is only (I think) semantically different to 8%-1% on bosses when it comes to gearing
---
no source, just what i remember.
---
I can't wait to play my Night Elf Mayonnaise.
---
I am one of the people "here posting about min/maxing" 
---
I don't disagree with your stance at all, I think everyone should do what is fun for them, and a lot of people will spend a lot more time leveling and wearing quest gear than they do anything else.
---
I don't have any problem with that and encourage people to have fun however they like.
---
Even when I purely, literally no lifed vanilla and was a hard-core raider, I spent more of my time on my non-raider characters doing silly things with bad specs and had loads of fun.
---
Everyone acts like people telling the plain truth are trying to go out of our way to 'spoil everyone's fun'    I haven't I haven't seen many people saying "haha you will suck and cry and be miserable forever if you try that"
---
We very directly counter bullshit liars who say "you can play that silly meme spec AND also a great raid will beg you to play with them"   because it's creating absurd expectations.
---
Or just +spells and +healing.
---
I have a collection of human skin bags
---
Thank you so much! It really means a lot to me :D
---
Link?
---
Yes, but the 1-40 part of that has been beaten by many in the beta.  By as much as 10 hours.  Expect the fastest hunters, druids, and warlocks to beat that record.
---
Yea shaman seem over represented in this poll. Assuming equal split:

Looks good, can't wait to try it
---
That WC3 addon allows for like, no keybinds, has a huge brown bar in the bottom just like the original and sucks out a lot of space.
---
Yet the insane nostalgia for WC3 makes me scream "Gimme gimme" in my head. 
---
Also, fun fact, did you know that WC3 didn't render anytthing underneath the UI before the modernization updates recently, which prepare it for WC3 Reforged's release? Made the game run way better, since you only used 2/3 of your screen.
---
The best example of this is if you’re out in the world and turn a corner or come across a lock in the distance where you both see each other and he immediately goes into stealth. Given stealth has substantially slower movement speed what I do is run in their general direction then after a few seconds pop perception and yes you’d be surprised how far you’re able to stop them away from you and target and dot  and enjoy the free kill :)
---
Never ever seen a new player be collectively shit on in dungeons, even running with big dick minmaxers on pservers. People are exceptionally nice in pre-60 dungeons, and salty players are singled out.
---
If you have no idea what you're doing, just communicate that to your group. People will most likely be friendly and tell you what to do.
---
As long as you're not backpedaling into 4 elite packs during a boss fight, you'll be fine.
---
&gt;Their spawns are so dense that you'll never run out of spiders to kill. There are thirty spawn points packed closely together and they have a 5 minute respawn timer.
---
So you think you'll never run out of spiders to kill even if there's 30+ other people competing for the same 30 spawns? You literally didn't see a single person in your demo video.
---
What... Man add up the numbers you're working with.
---
ANGRYREACT!
---
No idea people would be so indecisive.
---
I just know at some point actual scores were added, like if you're at 60 and got a good piece of gear it'd say it was the equivalent of lvl 73 or whatever, can't remember.
---
In your all green gear because you had no one to group dungeons with.
---
&gt; I’ve leveled through multiple 10k person launches without issue by just grinding fast
---
On pservers which turned up dynamic respawns to 1000 LUL
---
Thanks for the valuable insight. We’ll cross that bridge when we get there. And make that decision as a guild.
---
Did they change it at some point? I swear it was good at one point
---
You mean when you go afk to the loo, and come back and find he's managed to get you down 90% of your hp in the past 5 minutes?
---
SexyMap and Adibags are confirmed to eventually be updated for Classic by their owners.
---
Yeah most of the "shitting on me" was done through whispers, not as a group.  Glad to hear you think it'll be a good environment.  I'm sure pservers and forums are a tad more toxic than the game environment on Blizz servers.
---
But sadly the grinding method won't be viable at launch.
---
It's somewhat comparable to enhance at later levels, but it's definitely not "better" like he's suggesting.
---
Your rankings seem fine - people are just doing their best to nitpick here.
---
Thanks!
---
I’m a vet and I’m going to get steamrolled by noobs.
---
Love the dwarfs voice. This is hilarious.
---
Are you recruiting? People all seem to have their guilds all sewn up. Im not even sure what server to roll on except for not one with streamers.
---
Mace spec is not a PVP meme spec!! Especially for Horde rogues who dont have to put up with Orc racials!
---
Generally raids carry 2 full time tanks. If other tanks are needed, they’ll be Fury Warriors.
---
I'm not saying it's a good thing. I'm just saying it's basically the average.
---
Thanks
---
Black Crow and Satyr's both have +hit, along with 3 agi....
---
It's not even that the class scales *that* badly, the issue is there's like 4 weapon upgrades from PvE across the entire game. 3 crossbows and a bow.
---
Meanwhile melee have swords, daggers and mace upgrades up to their ears...
---
If Blizzard goes with dynamic respawns, otherwise by default it is a 5 minute respawn timer. On beta streams / clips people were layered so heavily that mob spawns in the starter zones were never a problem.
---
I just asked a lot of questions on pservers.  I think people were annoyed lol.  I'm glad to hear your experience was different, though.  Most of the toxicity I received was through whispers.  I don't think the group setting will allow for anything too crazy.  Overall, I'm optimistic but I just wanted to give my 2 cents.
---
You need 25 points in the Combat tree to make Maces viable. No competitive PVP spec puts 25 points in Combat.
---
It's the exact solution to having to wait in line if your layer has too many dudes questing though. If grinding isn't viable then questing wouldn't be viable at all. This guide is the exact solution to free yourself of frozen progression in case of a bad layer.
---
&gt; On beta streams / clips people were layered so heavily that mob spawns in the starter zones were never a problem.
---
Yes, they were super layered, which they specifically said was on purpose to test layering. It will not be like that when the game goes live.
---
They would not do maintenance right as servers come online...
---
I started playing Vanilla Wow back in 2005 with a group of players from my PlanetSide1 outfit. I knew absolutely nothing about WoW and proceeded to make a Troll Rogue and follow the other guild members about The Barrens in a vein attempt to learn the game.  I always used to feel like others players were way ahead of me and that I'd chosen the wrong class and needed to re-roll. Fast forward 14 years and I've got a lot of experience now to know that you can play WoW at your own pace and you'll make acquaintances and maybe even good friends along your journey. Indeed, you should go for it, get stuck into WoW.
---
I usually buy those early bags once I get the cash, feel like Im missing out on a lot of vendortrash if I don't!
---
The DPS is necessary to a raid too. You can't kill shit just with tanks and healers, it's not like DPS just magically shows up when you enter the instance. So because he's not rerolling or playing resto, he's a detriment, that makes sense only as long as you're constantly stacking the highest DPS.
---
Your argument is that enhancement DPS &lt; most other DPS, but there is a ranking within pure dps as well. By your own logic, hunters that are doing their crazy burst DPS during T1 progression are contributing more than the warlocks, thus the warlocks are slowing down the run by not playing hunters, or whatever else is on top. The high carrying the low is **always** happening, it's not introduced suddenly with a hybrid. What about your druid healers? You only need 1 for MoTW and they suck dick at healing. They're going to be blown away by priests and shamans, so why don't they just reroll? Why should shaman and priests be carrying the extra druids just because they want to play their snowflake class?
---
Yes.. nobody play a druid.. let me gear up fast
---
I now have anal cancer thanks brother was good
---
Great find! I wish it had damage reduction on armor but I guess it's minor.
---
beta was also cross realm
---
Thex would approve!
---
Thex.
---
I still use GameFAQs weekly.
---
Lol a good warrior with pretty decent gear... watch out. From what i remember if they crit more than once you are dead.
---
Rick rolled again D:
---
because beta had very fast respawns, nearly instant when I was leveling as well as much easier pve making for much faster leveling than even pservers
---
Well the ping was around 100-200, so it was maybe a bit noticeable but definitely not gamebreaking.
---
I didn't have beta access but a lot of stuff from this guide is data I gathered when I played vanilla back in the day. (Since day 1 in 2004.). It was tested on several fresh private servers for sure, and I analyzed countless hours of beta streamers and footage, coordinated across 20+ Discords, forums, etc. I've been devoting the past 5 months, 16+ hours a day for gathering data and forming the perfect plans.
---
TBH you should 100% horde your white items until the AQ40 war effort if you can help it. I'll be using a 2nd account just for 10 more bank alts, as I did in vanilla.
---
As far as gold goes, I'm getting well over 100+ from vendoring. I did a 1-10 grind livestream run where I vendored everything to prove from the last thread you can afford sword training, rogue abilities, and 2x cutlass by the time you hit 10 quite easily if you know which mobs to grind that die the quickest as well as drop the highest return in greys.
---
&gt; If grinding isn't viable then questing wouldn't be viable at all.
---
This isn't true at all. If you have a plan of questing you give yourself the opportunity to grind while you quest. At worst it's the same. At best you gain additional experience.
---
If you have a single path forwards and it doesn't work you're just completely fucked.
---
Flexibility is going to be key early on, and grinding one mob with no contingency whatsoever is asking for problems.
---
Both need 9% to hit cap, the reason for that is yellow hits cap at 9% and that’s the lion’s share of your damage as either spec. A 2h Warrior also caps white hits with 9% hit, whereas a DW Warrior needs 24%. That being said, after 9% hit, each additional hit a DW Warrior gains is worth as little as 8-16 Attack Power. So, even with 15% chance to miss White hits, you’re better off stacking Attack Power and Crit, especially if you have less than 100% flurry up time.
---
I don’t know if you’re up for requests but your play by play for the Soni was great. 
---
There’s not a lot content on pvp thought processes against classes like that, Ebbn has some game plan but doesn’t explain what he’s doing. As a player who was mostly PVE focused back in the it’d be interesting to get your thought process against different classes and how you deal with them.

---
I stopped playing WOTLK - but started in Vanilla.
---
Basically the big problem with Vanilla is the terrible balance. No idea if Blizzard ever fixed this with later expansions, but Vanilla wow was not balanced at all. In Vanilla certain specs will be hands down better than others in raids. Some specs will totally cheese PVP (fear locks used to be able to use fear as a quasi stun, then just burn people down with no counter play available). Enchance Shamans were a total joke, rubbish 66% of the time, randomly one shot people the other 34%. And the QOL factors you might expect from modern games won't exist in Vanilla WoW. The big issue here is - you have no hope of it improving as the patch time lines have already been released. At least back in those days, you sort of always hoped Blizzard would fix your spec / class in a new patch.
---
That said, Vanilla WoW was a fun experience for its time. I also think it will play better than the modern game, which has a lot of design flaws. Just make sure you do your research and don't fall for a noobtrap spec or class.
---
Paladins generate crazy amounts of threat when their being attacked.
---
But . . . They don't have a taunt so once a Paladin loses aggro, he can't get it back quickly.
---
We have it planned out so every race will be represented in all the classes (with human being represented twice, as thats the most popular race)
---
...and yea we are definetly making rogue undead ^_^
---
This is how I'll be going about it;

Imp Corruption (3/5)
---
Demonology
---
Imp Healthstone (2/2)
---
Demonic Embrace (3/5)
---
Imp Voidwalker (3/3)

Imp Corruption (5/5)
---
Imp Lifetap (2/2)
---
Surpression (3/5)

Siphon Life (1/1)
---
Imp Curse of Weakness (3/3)
---

After this point it's pretty much smooth sailing to 60, fluff around the rest in demonology

---
Fel Domination (1/1)
---
Fel Intellect (4/5)
---
Unholy Power (5/5)
---
Demonic Sacrifice (1/1)
---
You're being pedantic, and as was said, this is speaking comparatively and is covering the whole class experience, not just raiding.
---
On a Classpicking Guide I saw pretty much the same. Back when I decided to play Warlock it was pretty low in the Polls and Warrior, Mage and Huntere were all prett yhigh up.

I envy you, just get in there and enjoy it.

60 lmfao way 2 much but i sold my switch to upgrade my equipment so i went all out
---
[There's an equation here](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Armor) but I have no idea how accurate it is (use at own risk).
---
How many people here think warlock is mage but less played so you'll get Tier pieces in raids faster?
---
I know everyone is thinking Warlock is that dark horse you'll ride to victory on.
---
Don’t think I’m being pedantic at all actually. And as a “whole class experience”, you are contesting leather and cloth healing pieces, similar to paladins on alliance. So no, pointing out something clearly wrong about this guy’s post isn’t “being pedantic”. Give me a break.
---
That's fine. He's going to be carried hard, but as long as the raid is okay with carrying a DPS slot, then it should be fine.
---
Retri DPS is the lowest sustained damage in the game.
---
Moonfire is faster than autoshot!

I aim to please.

In my xp getting rep. by the time I got a cat mount for my gnome mage I hadn't even realized I had earned enough rep. 
---
Earn rep, play
---
Nice taunt
---
I mean i nudge shit around a bit when i play my head is barely turned. Idk im used to it. And my chair is turned towards the left main monitor
---
I got my first raid spot because I was a dwarf priest. I was good, but was on a good server and it was difficult to even get looked at without a long resume. 
---
I ended vanilla in naxx with great gear. So sure while you will find a spot if I was not a dwarf priest my entire experience would have been different. 
---
This experience led me into BC and continued to be in all the newest raids as they came out
---
So paladin is just overall awful unless he goes healer...
---
only if the tauren dance enough
---
the rain god likes to boogie
---
Only if your toon is named Thex will you get a raid spot!
---
Coming from popular page. This makes me miss WoW.
---
Yes the nice thing is that good guilds will exist for both systems.  Good luck in your future adventures in Azeroth.
---
will my moldy POS run it? https://www.cnet.com/products/lenovo-ideapad-z575/
---
Definitely. Didn't get into keybinding or gui enhancements until at least a couple/few months after I took this screen
---
For raiding, yes.
---
Same here mate

I love that I can't understand one word from the whole thing, but a person of a different language and whole different culture has the same nostalgia as me.
---
If it happens in the first 40% of a swing, it’s a 40% reduction. In the next 40%, it’s a 20% reduction, in the last 20%, it’s 0% reduction. My math might be a bit off, but it comes out to a swing speed reduction between 20 and 30%.
---
Great thanks!!!!
---
Nice. Except WoW's fame contradict every single point of your post. Now maybe you're right and I hope so. But millions seem to have complained about the opposite. (Hint: with lots of hate for 12 year old players)
---
Obviously there aren't Horde Paladins so that's not the same comparison.
---
Onyxia has been killed by an all-priest raid. I don't think it's too far-fetched that shaman could clear MC.
---
Wish I had the time!

God bless you. No more doubts in my mind
---
Their main issue is that they go oom easily
---
I played a gnome warrior that ended up being like the 10th person on our server to get one.  My guild was awesome though, shout out to &lt;shar hellven&gt;
---
If we are talking about leveling, then everyone can need on the shit they need to level.  If we are talking about preraid, then the warrior doesn't need the 2h.
---
Ah yes the famous Thex
---
Great guide, but you might want to have a hotkey for sunder armor while you're leveling. Especially when playing solo. Sunder Armor Rank 2 deals more effective damage than heroic strike for enemies above 30-70% hp. By the time you get Rank 3, the health of mobs is so high that it's deals more effective damage until 30-50% hp.
---
Though if you're leveling as arms then once you reach your mid 30s then cleave/ms/sweeping strikes is pretty decent.
---
The math: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ul22Fbi-ZQvdLSEZ62bxNS8wzgdcp6np-FH8rxkEq7E/edit#gid=0
---
check for the manage message permissions, this is the one needed so the bot can edit his messages, remove messages and reactions.
---
I raided with a casual guild back in the days.  We cleared MC, BWL and Ony.  Was working on Naxx when TBC came out.  We had a dwarf rogue and a gnome warrior, probably 2 of the worst race/class combos in the game at the time.  One was a telecom guy (I think) in his 40's and the other was a high school teenager.  Both did their jobs and were great guildies.  Classic wow was the most fun I ever had playing anything.  I still miss them and wonder what they are up to today.
---
Thanks for sharing your story. I too deal with the same issues. I have a very limited social life because it, therefore I am looking forward to the social aspect of Classic that no other video game has ever provided for me. Jiu jitsu hasn’t provided. Work hasn’t provided. Bars haven’t provided. Nothing has that same level of socialization and community. 
---
As far as game addiction, I lost my girlfriend of five years right before Wrath came out. I played since December ‘04 and finally got her into it right before BC launched. She got way more addicted than i ever was, joined the hardest core guild on our server, never left her keyboard, met some stranger in-game, he flew from cali to florida to see her behind my back. It was a whole thing and she was ADDICTED. So i see your point there. 
---
However, as far as the ‘ruining my life all over again’ jokes go, i think they are just that. Jokes. My bi polar depression has ruined my life enough and i only see Classic as a way to help meet fellow nerds (RIP RP PVP server option), helping noobs, finally finishing AQ and doing OG Naxx for the first time. 
---
Getting lost in Azeroth again, wether it be severe or mild addiction, is better than what im doing now. Nothing. And browsing reddit. 
---
LESS THAN A MONTH GET HYPE!
---
They manage. Some classes are better, some classes are about even, some classes are worse off. The only Warrior spec that really struggles in solo play is Protection.
---
It looks like you literally used my character as a reference for this drawing...

could be done, but technically there is already overflow since you dont need to lock the signups at the specified cap (its an option) and coupled with the number assigned when signing up, you can see who is overflow and who isnt't
---
No, OP means this one. [https://imgur.com/a/hg6VI](https://imgur.com/a/hg6VI)
---
One Ret pally in a raid isn't bad. They provide some utility, but the player has to understand that they are playing a support role and not DPS
---
It's more of a question of how narrow minded the raid group is, rather than it being anything to do with the Paladin itself. Hell, one of the strats for beating Twins (AQ40) is with a Paladin tank (and that obviously suggests some level of gear requirement to satisfy that fight).
---
***
---
If all you find are pseudo-elitists (who just parrot what other people say) then the answer is always going to be no (and you'd generally not be wanting to stick with those people long term anyway). The problem after that is simply peer-pressure.
---
+ If you end up with a bunch of people who only care for loot, your buddy will never have a chance to live their dream
---
+ If you end up with a bunch of people who value you (as a person) as a new friendship/relationship, your buddy will be able to tank in all content.
---
Put somethings into perspective
---
+ Let's say 3 epics per boss
---
+ 40 people in a raid
---
+ x amount of bosses per week (MC: 10, Ony: 1, BWL: 8, AQ40: 9, Nax: 15)
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Let's say you only Clear MC (10 bosses), 3 epics per boss
---
+ At best, you get 30 epics to share between 40 people
---
+ Realistically, not all 30 epics are going to be claimed (unwanted or duplicates)
---
+ Unless your 'loot' drops, you're not going to be able to claim anyway
---
Now think about
---
+ How many slots each character has
---
+ How many people will compete for the same items
---
+ **How many weeks** it'd take to equip everyone.
---
If you're happy to commit yourself to a group that says you can't do this and you must do that then crush your friends dreams (it'll also probably kill your enthusiasm for classic in any long term capacity).
---
If you're not planning to be that rigid then let your friend do what they want (live their dream). There will be plenty of opportunity for Paladins to Tank raids (because it's never been a question as to whether a Paladin could do it or not, and always a question of whether people would be willing to attempt it in the first place). There are very few (if any) fights that would be outright impossible with a Paladin as one of the tanks (and even then, it usually comes down to the tactics and strategy employed, rather than being something outright impossible, like how Method used 2 healers instead of 3 for Azshara).
---
&gt;You actually are making people think that a Classic Wow Raid is 8 Mages 8 Locks 8 Warriors 8 Rogues and 8 Priests and the Utility Classes get fucked. THEY DON'T
---
Ofc it's not. It's just that nothing beats 6-8 healers and 32-34 fury warriors. Maybe a prot warrior.  The game is really busted and warriors ruin the fun. 
---
Everyone will find a place no matter what they play. But you can't expect to get into the most hard-core guilds with the least viable specs.
---
Honestly I think it'll go to DPS warriors first -  they'll be needed to tank at some point, 4 horsemen if nothing else.
---
But then it's not that much better on them. IF you suck up to your dm or game the dkp system a bit it could work out.
---
Completely unrelated, but I like to tell my wife's (adult) sons that I'm camping their spawn point. Heh.
---
Honestly, in 5 man's paladins might be the best for aoe tanking. Perfect for farming 5 mans. That said it's hard to get to threat and mitigation up at the same time, so it's hard to scale late into raids.
---
I'd roll a warlock except I want to do more in raids than cast Shadowbolt and Healthstone. They're really fun for BGs and wPvP
---
Interesting read, thx for sharing!
---
Real talk, i love you fam. See you in classic.
---
The important thing is total tank value and while yes the other bows have 3 agi, it is never worth more than the AP from strikers. If you need more defensive stats then you swap another item.
---
It's super dependent on gear. Rage works based on your damage so the more you swing for the more rage your generating (from what I remember)
---
There will be plenty like you
---
Except all that support can be provided by holy paladins while also providing some top tier healing
---
PvE still allows PvP, but at your discretion, rather than "whenever the other guy thinks you're an easy target."
---
Then by your own logic shamans still have less gear competition compartively. Merely having the uncontested option of int mail gear means they have less gear to compete with than say, a mage who must wear cloth
---
Prot pallies is probably the one truly absolutely unviable hybrid. Where as a shadow priest can atleast do some good damage, a prot pally just can not by the design of their class function in their role. 
---
Blizzard had a very bizarre vision for hybrids on wow release in that they were designed with the expectation that they could and would function in all roles that their class was capable of at the same time. (Ie: a feral Druid would offtank then stop and heal, and then begin to dps). But this isn’t how the game played out and it’s really not how any mmo of the era logically played out. They realized this era and gave hybrids more defined roles and itemization in tbc.
---
In case you are interested in meme shaman tanking, Tauren also have an HP bonus too
---
Embrace it my friend. Embrace the new world of adventures and questions. I almost wish I was a classic virgin too. Enjoy :)
---
Because dwarf paladins have been a thing since paper rpgs so they said fuck it dwarfs are paladins and priests.
---
Wow that's depressing.
---
Not really accurate and mostly antecdotal experience ranking and not factual numbers generating. 
---
ie you state mage is the best pure damage class when in fact is lower than both rogue and warlock as classes and fury warrior as a spec. 
---
You also say Druid is the best flag carrier when it’s not.
---
That was nice.
---
2nd post is that
---
Uh no. Shamans have MORE shamans than, say, a Druid to compete with or even a priest. They also all share loot. Use your brain. Jesus.
---
Actually it is if you’re going to discuss it like any other reciprocal interaction in our lives. It’s courtesy to greet the cashier, and if they don’t greet you back then the reciprocation is lost and you are less full in your proverbial ‘bucket’. It’s up to you to be able to accept the loss. This person is unable to. 
---
This has been explained many times to me by my psych who’s discussed the hell out of boundaries and reciprocal relationships as small as shop interactions recently.
---
or people just like playing Warlock?
---
Let me know if you figure out how to grow horns
---
I can never remember what RNG stands for.
---
I don't think WoW Classic / Vanilla is that kind of game. This isn't Hunt, League of Legends, or Rocket League, this is an MMO. You are largely sheltered from PvP when the game begins and the game brilliantly and subtlety teaches you your class as you level. You will then slowly be introduced in PvP in the world - if on a PvP realm and that will give you time to hone your skills. You will die, you will get stomped, but that happens to anyone, whether they have 10 hours of /played or 5000 hours.
---
Don't be afraid, join the fun. Can't wait to see ya there!
---
This is a Shaman one. Of course its going to be a Horde race shown in the graphic but that leaves Paladin for the alliance and 7 classes left for both factions.   
---
So that would be 4/9 that should at least be Alliance all together. If you're horde biased, give 5 to the Horde and 4 to the Alliance... At least be that fair lol.   
---
This is really good though. Keep up the work.
---
I would NEVER invite a paladin tank t a raid.  They are totally useless.
---
Druids, Hunters, Mages, Shadow Priests (or Holy Nova AoE farming), and Warlocks all have an easier time farming by themselves than Warriors. Rogues are about the same as Warriors in pure killing potential, but they can escape if things get dicey and Stealth lets them solo things that Warriors cannot. There are also some scenarios where a Protection Paladin can farm better than a Warrior.
---
Gnome hidden racial is they can fit in places other races can't. And they have the best /train emote in the game.
---
If your focus is PvP, you're not rolling Human. Gnomes are the best, with Dwarves being a close second. 
---
If your focus is PvE, then sure go ahead and roll Human. But that +5 weapon skill isn't gonna be anywhere near a 10% dmg increase.
---
Yes. But.... What? Everyone has just told him that Prot is not viable, I have told him Retri is not raid viable, they're mostly used as off-healers.
---
I think you could do something interesting stacking paladins and smite priests, downranked seals of the crusader stack, and there's the ret holy damage aura.
---
From my experience mob density on the beta is very close to what it is on private servers in most areas. The biggest difference in terms of grinding is respawn rate.
---
Helpful information, thank you. I vaguely remember being around rank 7 myself - I liked BG's and did a lot of them, but I don't think I was making a concerted effort to push for a higher rank than that. 
---
I guess we can't't really know just how time-consuming different ranks will be, since it's graded on a curve, sort of.
---
Did you even read the thread? "Confirmed to work" was clearly outlined, most of what you listed does not match that criteria.
---
Probably earned yourself a spot on the forever-ignore list of the 3 innocent dudes you killed, not sure there's any net gain here.
---
Sure, hey have more options if all they do is 5 man dungeons because there is the extra option in mail gear. But HOLISTICALLY they have more gear competition when you include raids because they are competitive for cloth/leather against druids and priests ON TOP OF competitions against more of their own class than druids and priests. Use your brain.
---
Random number generation.
---
oh sorry, thought you were saying that ret is the greatest support champion
---
I mean laser chicken is way too badass for vanilla.
---
random number generator. Enhancement shamans are very reliant on a 20% proc chance (which can proc off itself) that swings their weapon twice. If they get lucky, that can absolutely detonate someone, and if they are unlucky they can go an entire battle without it proccing, hence RNG!
---
I was using every single one of these addons in the Beta. There's your confirmation kid.
---
Official? Or..

You hate someone for mining thorium? That's probably the highest pettiness level ITT lol
---
Our guild's main tank in TBC used it still at least through BT I believe.
---
It's always funny to me when I see total vanilla newbies talk about hitting rank 13 or 14. 
---
They dont even know how bad it is in reality. 
---
Running the same BGs over and over, I like pvp too and it's one of the main reasons I am looking forward to classic. 
---
But after 5 hours? 6 hours? 12 hours? 
---
Ill have some 12 hour sessions I am sure. But it's the day in and day our every fucking day the same BGs over and over. Week after week after week.
---
You dont even really world pvp because you're too afraid of dishonorable kills, you just stick with your premade and steamroll people in warsong. 
---
I literally dont think I have the mental stamina for that kind of grind anymore. Even When I was 14 years old I felt ill after reaching the upper ranks and barely even PVPed till TBC.
---
&gt;Everyone acts like people telling the plain truth
---
&gt;haha you will suck and cry and barely get to level 60 if at all forever 
---
I feel like no one IS telling the plain truth.  Everyone asking for advice 90% of you will suck, you'll cry, and you'll quit before lvl 60.
---
Somewhere hidden out on the internet!
---
You'll totally get steamrolled. 60+% of the actual vets will get steamrolled, me included.
---
that said, it can still be a very fun game to play. Try it and see if you like it.

Ah, thanks for your anecdote, kid.
---
Thats the ~~vanilla~~ classic spirit. Keep em comming
---
Nothing wrong with people showing their setup. Only so much different content can be postrd on a old game before release.
---
Well there is no info to be had before release and probably a few weeks after release is the first good data you will see. Waiting that long to level seems kinda silly.
---
Usually most servers stabilize pretty evenly. Just gonna pick the pvp server with the coolest name
---
That is a cool name.  click
---
Gearscore was literally just a player-made addon that added the item level of all your gear up.
---
You might be thinking of current retail that averages your item level?
---
It's unlikely that after filtering for your language, region, and timezone, that you'll have more than one server of each type to choose from.
---
Wild to think that people ranked this high with only clicking! Props to you.
---
I was mainly a clicker back too then but I always used 1-4 keybinds
---
What are you doing instead of spamming lightning bolt? Searing totem and flametounge weapon autoattacking?
---
undead rogue please!
---
I clicked my spells and the guild thought enough of me that i was the first mage on the server to get fully geared in purples. It's all about being on time with consumables
---
Awesome! And I get to join that trash fire when I sub next week too!
---
Is that Thex?
---
Hunters are awesome all the way through to Naxx, and even then, while they technically drop off a little, how good/bad they are is far more down to the player than the class.  Play what you want and learn to play it well and you will be fine.
---
It does way too much threat to be used outside of tanking, atleast before you have a tank and ideally a backup tank with it.
---
No there was definitely something added that gave items their "equivalent" level and it would add up your equivalent level.
---
Seriously. We need to end the min/maxing sentiment and get back to good old fashioned gaming and having fun. Occasionally trolling the other faction and being ready to go out of your way to help a nearby friendly finish clearing their quest kills even if you are already done.
---
The deadzone is also larger...
---
Ran into this on Thadius, my tauren could not stand with the charge group and still shoot, while the female orc hunter could, the only way it worked was with a deviate.
---
with good gear, they do extremely well.
---
This is more or less spot on.
---
Rivalry and rivalry... Nobody playing BFA really cares too much about the Classic crowd, but on here everyone seems to go out of their way to flame people playing both versions. Really toxic crowd that gets defensive over nothing.
---
I don’t think Blizzard thinks of any rivalry between the games either, seeing how heavily they favour BFA over Classic when it comes to attention and advertisement (and anything else, really). Which is probably why some people are so salty about it. I don’t know.
---
Druids don't really have a place in BGs imo. the WSG flag carry is a given but aside from AV stealth "missions" there is rarely a time where you wouldn't rather have another priest/pala/shaman instead.
---
Really well put together. Liked the video component.
---
Would you say this works for duo leveling? Or is the xp hit too crazy? Probably depends on how fast the mobs spawn I would assume.
---
No. I don't know what those numbers are or where you're pulling them from, but I know from common sense that the only way it's possible for swords to give less damage than axes *before* impale is if you have 0% crit.

I know there's been one or two of these posts already, but thanks for making another one. It's good to make sure as many people understand this message as possible and aren't dissuaded from playing a race/class they really want to because Reddit told them it would stop them from getting a raid spot. GJ :-)
---
Lol yeah. Don't have to farm? hahahahahahahah
---
Why do rogue not do much in Bg’s again? They offer great CC, sometimes of multiple targets, can set up kills, can defend / stall, can gather info and set up plays, can hold someone in place to set up bursts, and do general damage.
---
The only blacklist that really matters
---
Or you can look at it in terms of overall Raid value.
---
Striker's Mark never gets replaced, whereas a tank will replace it next Tier with Dragonbreath ...
---
You only get so many Striker's Marks and using one on trivial content for a couple AP on tanks is a waste when it can be used by a DPS all the way through Naxx...
---
This is a shortsighted mistake...
---
Pally is a viable as a raid tank like a bicycle is viable on the highway.
---
Earthen Ring - US? I was in Dark Legend for a time, Sayori is in a couple of your screens, he was awesome and was a good friend. I was Celica - Dwarf Hunter. The nostalgia hit me hard seeing Vanilla ER.
---
What happened to "the game is about more than raiding"?
---
Technically there are Forsaken Paladins, they just hung up their hammers for a different profession because using the Light with such zeal would literally tear them apart. And the whole pledging to hate and murder all undead doesn't really track once you die and resurrect yourself.
---
Whatever pvp server my guild picks.
---
&gt; You will die, you will get stomped, but that happens to anyone, whether they have 10 hours of /played or 5000 hours
---
Of course they'll die if they're new or slightly less new.
---
Very cool to have an official forum. Still really think [Vanilla Friends](https://www.vanillafriends.com)  
---
is a tad easier to find people, because you don’t need to be subbed to post (I believe that’s the case for the forums)
---
Hey, cool name! And it's pvp? No way.
---
Click.
---
It depends on the class. I main rogue and if I could backstab every mob down and give up 1/2 the exp I totally would. You'd have to fight your partner over the BoE blue drops though.
---
It's not just that event. The Alliance reviles the undead- they can't see past their faults, the rotting and the blunted feelings and the cannibalism. And perhaps most of all, past memories of their loved ones turned by the Scourge into mindless monsters that looked just like the Forsaken.
---
Much of the Horde is uneasy about the Forsaken for similar reasons. But even if they have distrust, they see the lost and outcast and see themselves in it, and they give the Forsaken the chance they deserve. The Alliance, by and large, can't bring themselves to do the same.
---
Warlock has so much fucking flavor. The class quests for pets are cool, the quest for the epic mount is cool, the lesser used summons are cool, you have random af spells like eye of kilrog, underwater breathing, detect invisible, etc. which all add to class flavor and the tier sets look amazing. Debuff limit and threat issues(play alliance for easier time there) make pve pretty boring sometimes and farming soul shards sucks balls but overall a pretty solid class.
---
At the beginning of this expansion i didnt had to study and put 2 weeks straight into wow. I was the best pala heal on the realm until the raids opened and in my guild i outhealed every other healer by far in efficiency and everything. I min maxed everything and analysed the statistics after every dungeon and later raid. But because my guild couldnt get the Bosses on mythic i didnt had the mythic experience. I tried to find mythic guilds BUT EVERYONE was like „uhh you didnt raided in burning crusade? Sad, no experience, go away.“ 
---
This attitude is a shame. This ruined wow for me. 
---
People just look at the statistics and see that i dont have 99% performance but they dont understand that it is not possible to get 100% performance if your team just dont get the raid boss or is bad. A healer cant outperform his team, hes not a dd. 
---
If wow would get a real community or way for people to prove there performance it would be the best multiplayer on here, but nope.
---
Whaaaa?!? 
---
Easily a perfect 9/11.

Cold snap pog champ!
---
Go priest that’s the real troll. Seeing a pally bubble hearth back in the day was always a sure sign you won that fight, or had camped them into submission
---
I did brd on a pserver the other night. The group was LF tank have summons. I joined stating that I just had to quickly go to org to train first. 
---
After training I hearthed to gromgol and fly up, ran to the instance and helped summon the final two. Only the warlock and one other had bothered to go there while I was training.
---
This is what we have to look forward to.
---
You seem a bit biased.
---
You don't like hunters, paladins, gnomes, non-shadow priests, and you want to play human over races with pvp racials for the pve dps increase, yet you only compare pvp racials.
---
You count elemental shaman as bad matchup for alliance mages, but forget enemy team having paladins with dispell and freedom will also be a pain.
---
I just got a corsair scimitar pro. Fucking love it.
---
take the sword and go fury 2h   ( :
---
&gt; You can put this button on each of  your stances' bars. The last line shows it will activate a different  ability depending on the stance you are in. Because stance changes  aren't on the GCD, and they are on separate /use commands in this macro,  holding the appropriate modifier will switch stances and immediately  use the relevant ability. It is important to note: this is dramatically faster than pressing a keybind to switch stances then activating an ability. At a minimum, only using keybinds is two separate button presses, while the macro does it in a single press.
---
While your modifiers are nice and all, aren't you misrepresenting it a bit by insinuating it's the modifer who make the macro fast? 
---
Isn't this just as fast, with no need to press a modifier?
---
/use [nostance:1]Battle Stance
---
/use Overpower
---
Does the crit buff stack?
---
That hit me right in the corpse run.
---
Nice, good for you - plenty of people will just fish and cook, do what you love.
---
Fake. If you actually played vanilla into BC, T2.5 + wasn't even replaced until 70 items.
---
Druidic ritual sacrifice or Shamanic bone reading.
---
One of those should lead the way.
---
I remember a "suggest a server" button. I wonder if they'll have it again?
---
You can look at the beta composition too, that's probably the best data we have.
---
Yea, each rank has a threshold of % of total population participating in PvP.
---
So if you have 9 people going balls to the wall on a 1500 people server, there could be a big gap in the effort needed between ranks e.g R14(0.1% or 1 person) could be 500k, R13 (0.2% or 2 people) could be 490-495k, and R12(0.5% or 7 people) could be 485-300k if there is a big gap in effort and the right amount of people playing
---
not mocking him for posting here
---
mocking him for divorcing his wife to play a video game
---
do try and keep up, i know its hard
---
No if you are worried about population balance, you already concerned about the wrong shit... just pick pvp or PvE or Rp and just level.
---
A week one Ragnaros team will not have the time nor the money to level any crafting profession to 300, let alone specialize it. And then farm 22 Devilsaurs? Just no.
---
If you grind for Unstoppable Force from AV combined with good boe stuff you can be competitive
---
No worries, glad to help.
---
I second this
---
Have him roll Dwarf Warrior and pretend First Aid is the Holy Light ;)
---
One that stands out for me was in back in vanilla, I had rank 10 pvp gear and decided to solo pvp Black Rock mountain as an enhance shaman. I ended up winning a 2v1 against two gnome rogues with blood fang pieces. I got a good lucky WF crit with my unstoppable Force and was able to finish off the first before the other was able to come help his friend, but I wasn't so lucky on my second opponent. He had over half my health gone without breaking a sweat and to make matters worse he popped evasion to prevent sharing a similar fate of his brethren. Thinking fast I war stomped and was able to get a storm strike that proc'd a triple wind fury crit. The gnomes face was crushed beneath my mace in mere seconds. I've never been able to have as much fun in world pvp since and that's what I'm looking forward to most in vanilla.
---
Is stance dancing really a necessity.
---
Maybe I was just privileged, but dial up was old by the time vanilla launched.
---
Thank you so much for the details!
---
Enh shaman
---
yeah that's what i meant, slightly fuzzy memory on the 30% thing but yeah. I just remember in 2.0 it didn't exist yet, but later they did it to help healers do a little more damage
---
It's slightly better than paladin in terms of just auto attacking. Elemental uses a lot of mana.
---
Ever since your last post I was waiting for the next WoW character sheet 
---
Wasn’t disappointed in the least
---
I guess my memory must be foggy - MC and BWL were not ‘easy’? Can you explain?
---
Well you could always take the half measure and roll Dwarf. (both in literal stature and PvE/PvP racials.)
---
Love the artwork! Keep them coming
---

I wish I had took the time for a better title for this. I found this masterpiece on YouTube this morning by searching "Classic Wow" and filtering by new. It was 48 mins old at the time with zero views. I was just excited and wanted to share it asap lol. I cannot wait for Classic. It's going to glorious.
---
wouldnt you have to scale paladins and shamans votes in respect to total number of people playing that faction to get a better percentile?
---
Accurate AF
---
I miss Blackrock Mountain far more than I miss Stranglethorn Vale.
---
wow what an original post
---
It was a mixture of feelings for me. Absolutely hated it while I was leveling, but had so much fun once I finished leveling.
---
PvP, probably will get rolled w/ min-maxers showing off how OP engineering is.   
---
Otherwise, you'll be perfectly fine.
---
Fun as a stealther, and I always play a stealther in that zone. Usually a druid but even a nelf hunter is fun as cat gets prowl by 32.
---
Rogue that low? Really? Especially warlock being higher than rogue? Thats kinda hard to believe
---
Classic wow is a lot of fun regardless if you are new or a veteran. The game is all yours and doesn't demand anything of you unless you want to pursue it. Whatever aspect of the game you enjoy and want to immerse yourself is also easy to excel at, the game isn't  complex.
---
I think you can find them on YT....
---
There's only two and they've both been uploaded by Blizzard. [Original](https://youtu.be/vlVSJ0AvZe0) and [Classic](https://youtu.be/TcZyiYOzsSw).

Because they have the most Human-like body.
---
That song was great too! I hope someone translates it eventually.
---
Desperate times
---
Gonna be tricky to effectively use a gathering profession on an alt unless you get them to 60. Can’t have a level 25 running around EPL trying to get thorium
---
With few exceptions, raw materials are always worth more than the products they create.

---
Because for some reason people don't seem to think a fee for the crafting is appropriate
---
Those are probably not the ingame cinematic. Are they?
---
Great sounding song, and deep lyrics to boot! Thanks!
---
Reminds me of Dragons Dogma.
---
Definitely what I am planning to do but I won’t drop my gathering profession on my main until I have an alt capable of running around higher leveled zones
---
O have 3500+ hours in clicker heroes. But it's been basically automated since about hour 5. I just spend 2-3min a week on it now, but it runs constantly.
---
It can't proc off itself anymore, that was removed in an early vanilla patch.
---
There are no in-game cinematics in Classic/Vanilla.
---
I would expect potions to sell for more than their component herbs, no? So a raider with out alchemy can just buy them and go.
---
I think that baking lots of spells together does make you better able to response correctly to niche circumstances. If Mocking Blow isn't within hotkey reach, then you'll be slower in the event that your Taunt is resisted, for example.
---
With Warrior, you're going to have to memorize 3 different hot bars no matter what. You'll need to have the muscle memory to switch to the correct stance and activate the correct ability. My goal in baking those abilities together into one macro was to simplify the process to one button press, and make those button presses consistent across all stances. 
---
The difference is that your macro is now an extraneous button. Do you have a separate keybind dedicated to just Overpower? If you have that macro, but it isn't keybound, then you've only solved half the problem.
---
By contrast, I know that Overpower is my 2 key in Battle Stance, and I know that shift always activates my Battle Stance abilities.
---
I don't want people to merely copy-paste my macro suite, which is why I didn't post every single button. But I did want to give them the tools and inspiration to build their own suite.
---
enhance is a great world pvp spec.. also why do you have to taint something so nice and informative and succinct with that stupid meme
---
I played warrior like this in BC and Wrath. It's really making things more complicated than they need to be. Just keybind the 3 stances and make a 4th keybind to use a macro to swap between 2hander and sword and board.
---
makes sense, thanks a bunch
---
does ur 1h need to be good at all? if you have some garbage u got 10 levels ago are your threat generating abilities enough to hold aggro?
---
I’d love if you made an Alliance version as well. I love grinding in WoW. Favorite thing to do. So relaxing.
---
Nah Warlock is the cool Mage.
---
I will ride on my literal dark horse though, that's a class feature.
---
Model what you can model, preface its limitations, label your shit, and don't be a punk acting like your sloppiness was a special trap you set. You sound like a complete jackass. Try to contribute constructively next time.
---
A fresh 60 can solo dungeons and zones up to a certain level
---
No, that really isn't the reason. Most raw materials have multiple uses and allow for players to get their own skill ups. That flexibility gives them more value than the finished products.
---
Oh ok nice. I’m going shaman this time. But when I leveled my shaman in tbc I went enhance. Was considering elemental for the advantage of healing dungeons too. But was on the fence. I think I’ll do this.
---
Interesting. I guess that kills any chance of an arms pve build.
---
Its not too bad a requirement at all, unless you get unlucky with drops. 
---
Enhance is still fine for leveling, all I'm saying is that elemental (if played correctly) can be more consistent and less gear dependent and has other advantages as well (better for pvp if you get ganked).
---
What type of server, realmtime, and faction are you aiming for?
---
Yes, Paladin and Shaman are likely going to be 3rd or 4th most played
---
Rogues as well
---
So people that have herbalism 300 or normally level 60s?
---
true, elemental with cost reduction and clearcasting is way faster when you can still use a staff for juicy melee hits.
---
"Warcraft"
---
I look forward to being saved by a ding lol no better feeling!
---
Well, it would be difficult to collect high level herbs in high level zones if you are not level 60. So it would be practical to make your main character a herbalist
---
There are a few ways to do that. It's no problem to add modifiers to abilities that don't require a stance, such as Demoralizing Shout with a mod:shift Battle Shout. 
---
If you want to add another ability to the 1-5 keybinds, you can do what I did with the HS/Cleave button 1. My macro suite leaves open the modifier associated with your current stance; that is to say shift while in Battle Stance, alt while in Defensive Stance, and ctrl while in Berserker Stance can activate a different ability.
---
If a crafter only has the Trainer recipes, then literally every other crafter has it too. That means there will be plenty of people in his guild that will do it for free. 
---
But if the crafter has some rare recipes then he can demand a fee. It's just supply and demand like everything else.
---
I see it like someone playing an old FF game and being like, "oh, no, you can't fight the last boss unless you've maxed your level and all of your stats are 255/255/255/255/255/255."
---
Yeah, you *can* play the game that way, you can also win the game at level 20 and just have fun without worrying about min/maxing every little thing.
---
barrens,chat is the true enlightened forum discussion site.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=flair%3ALFG%2BMonday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all
---
Once they get some spell crit stacking and +healing power going on they are the best single target healers in the game bar none.
---
It's actually just fun to have an alt. Which will eventually be 60.
---
they're probably the best class at using tranquilizing shot in the game
---
Level 40, it's halfway to lvl 60. I don't think you will see much uniform attrition from 40-60 that would skew rankings on class popularity.
---
warlocks get their mounts for next to nothing too.  The cost of the epic can be split!
---
You can also pop lightning shield to kill mobs quicker but if you do this too much you will have to stop and drink, so use when you are &gt;50% mana.
---
That's true, you can see in my Druid guide I fit all my abilities in 10 keybinds: 1-6, Q, E, R, F. I've found that every class can get every ability comfortably within 12 buttons.
---
It's a shame they didn't work on integrating with Vanilla Friends. There's like 50k worth of people registered there. But this is a good start.
---
Oh, so then would people that have a gathering profession go engineering as their secondary while having alchemy on an alt maybe? Or would it be better to have alchemy and herbalism together at level 60 since they go hand in hand?
---
I'm an adult so if I want to play 18 hours a day I will.
---
Nah everyone posts about how you get up to 8 shamans in a horde raid and paladins are just about the best healer. It's just druids that are shit on here and hunters to a lesser extent which makes sense because druids kinda do suck in just about every aspect but at least they can run away from their problems in travel form.
---
Every guild I was in pre 1.7 planned debuffs.  It makes a very big difference when it was only 8.  If warrior's fractured armor stacks roll off for a damn rend or something, every physical damage dealer in the raid is doing less damage.
---
Please do Priest!
---
I’m almost surprised mayonnaise got fewer voted than Paladin
---
Engineering items require engineering to use. So I would recommend engineering and herb on your main character. Alchemy, tailoring, etc on your alts
---
Viable? Maybe. Optimal? Meh.
---
Maybe if its a pure druid team otherwise no. NEVER on Horde.
---
&gt;There is a reason they never did 40 man raiding again and it's because even at the height of Vanilla's popularity it was fucking hard to fill a group.
---
I can't help but think of 40 mans as a net benefit though. Since you are allowed so many free slots, you can easily take people who fill the "life of the party" role yet can still be shit at the game and have fun with everything. You don't have to feel bad by leaving people out even if they're bad, as long as they're good company. Kind of in the spirit of what MMOs in general should be. Getting together with people and uniting to complete a common goal.
---
Smaller and smaller raid sizes are easier to fill but push a super hard min/max mindset because you can only do so much with the slots you're given. But when you're given enough to just take anyone who can waggle their dick on the keyboard you actually get a super fun time as opposed to super serious progression business.
---
W8 if this is true, why would anyone even roll a crafting profession outside of engineering?
---
For example: I can go herbalism and engineering and just buy potions outright. It'd be cheaper to do that VS going herbalism and alchemy and make my own potions since the mats im using is worth more than the product (the potion I make).
---
There are going to be a lot of new players, and a lot of the experienced ones will be on unfamiliar classes.
---
Will you get steamrolled? Yes.
---
Will it be much more often than anyone else? Not really, no.
---
If you have some time you want to invest in a game and you're interested, you should try it out for a few months. If it's the game for you, you'll probably know within a few days. I knew after about an hour.
---
Thex cant be taken because I'll be Thex :)
---
Your Thex? I'm Thex.
---
Just need one survivor and they can chain-rebirth the whole line back to life 1 at a time!
---
Is that really surprising? Shamans seem pretty popular around here. The only thing that struck me is how high up Warlocks are and how low, compared to pservers anyways, Warriors are.
---
Crit chicken for the win
---
You can tank all five man content with a standard fury raiding spec as long as you have the gear for it.
---
You have mana, it’s just not your main resource. I think Monk is the only odd one out.
---
Seeking dungeon leveling group for first few days, can commit 18+ hours per day. Prefer to play warrior, open to other classes.
---
DPS should generally be prioritized over healers.
---
Gearing DPS always has value- bosses die quicker which is an indirect buff to healers. but gearing already adequately geared healers provides no extra value to the raid, that's just healers ending fights with extra mana.
---
Ofc it's a balance, but I would say Tank &gt; DPS &gt; Healer default priority.
---
That was a pretty big miss by me, when using a new weapon class or facing enemies of a higher level that can be huge and can influence gear/enchant choices.
---
Still would argue Shammys got the short end of the stick though.
---

---
“over a decade ago”... and still downloading
---
Seriously that was the moment I'm like "oh shit"
---
I read your comment, then I scrolled down until I found it.  Yeah, that one was rough.
---
Looking back I'm glad that my first character was a warlock. I gradually leveled every class to 60 over the years and I was surprised that some classes barely even had any class quests at all. At the time when I leveled my first character I just assumed that every class had their own class quests, but for some that's just not the case.
---
What else is there at max level that actually matters? Farming herbs?
---
My realm must be Eastern Time zone "because I live in NY" and player versus environment 
---
Ideally the realm will have a healthy population of 2000 ,not crowded or empty
---
Have a nice name like "stone talon" 
---
Slight alliance majority for short BG que times 
---
And everyone is fluent in English
---
Consider joining a server in a different time zone. As long as your ping doesn't take too much of a hit, you might have better luck finding a guild that matches your hours.
---
Thexter
---
It's kind of hard to see cause I spend up footage / shrinked it down for text memes but that's with white gear / leatherworking greens / vendor bought greens. Also I afk a ton / take food breaks / etc. Imagine a rogue doing it with actual gear.
---
Can't forget to mention DS/Ruin is the more squishy of the two and relys on more gear to put out numbers.
---
So depending on the phase/gearstate of the lock.
---
Although generally, accurate.
---
Basically every Hunter post I see nowadays are along the lines of **are Hunters viable in raids**, **how many hunters do you need in raids**, **are hunters needed in premades**, etc. 
---
I think that the type of people who frequent this and similar subs are leaning towards the min/max mentality. When the legitimate casuals, the people who aren't counting down the days, start playing you'll see a lot more Hunters.
---
Ok, hear me out here... what if they never learned cat form?

Whichever server the rest of the RP-PvP people choose.

---
Why do you have so many single bits of lego in different colours...
---
I think this is an unpopular opinion, but that's why I like the idea of resets for every expansion. I think a huge problem in retail WoW is the over inflation of gold and damage numbers. I understand people like access to legacy content from previous expansions, however I really think it's impractical from a gameplay perspective to keep everything relevant. I thinj that's a big part of how we've ended with bfa.. Along side with lfr/lfd/no end in site dungeon design/transmog/flying/time gated content/previous raid tiers becoming irrelevant with new patches/players are literal gods/pruning classes... The list could go on a lot more.
---
Damn so many shamans
---
Nope.
---
UwU
---
Sure, *one* of the reasons goes away for *some* players, but there's always going to be someone leveling a profession and those raw materials always have multiple uses.
---
If being within reach is the main problem, then all you have to do is move your movement keys a few steps to the right to something like rdfg. Then you have +20 keys within reach because now your pinky and ring finger have +10 keys available, instead of only a few. wasd is wasting so much potential. Try seeing how far your pinky can reach OFF your keyboard and out into thin air when you use wasd.
---
Add the fact that some people have those insane mmo mice with lots of buttons, and it's pretty obvious that lacking keys within reach is never a good reason.
---
Using your Overpower/WW example.
---
* You need to press shift (very importantly, BEFORE you press Overpower)
---
* and then your (Now) Overpower key.
---
* Then you need to move your pinky to ctrl (very importantly, BEFORE you press WW)
---
*and then your (Now) WW key. 
---
You need to move your pinky multiple times, and very importantly, you need to do it BEFORE you press your ability key, or your keypress will cast an unintended ability because you never change stances. Ironically, you slow yourself down because of the modifier, because you HAVE to press/hold the modifier BEFORE the ability key. If you press the modifier too late, it will cast a spell you didn't intend to. You are introducing a very real chance of casting  unintentional spells whenever you are in a hurry.
---
Compare that to having an Overpower and a WW key:
---
* Press your Overpower key.
---
* Press your WW key.
---
That's it.
---
That's why players need to talk to eachother.  One druid can go a more HoT-centric build for the MT healing, while the others spec more into Healing Touch for raid healing
---
Honestly knowing blizzard and vanilla / classic the game would probably just glitch out and crash.
---
Whole reason ill be on classic is to enjoy old school enh. really didn't like where it went in cata and pretty much quit at that point.
---
I knew you didn't mean it literally, but even on a more macro-level shareholders are never getting involved in game decisions in anything other than the most exceptional circumstances.
---
Agreed 100% on RMAH - which is the same reason they ban bots and gold sellers in wow, sure they lose a few subs but it keeps the game healthy and the player base happy.
---
Practically, I recognise they're not going to be able to crack down on the "You can have 10 of my gold for a slice of your pizza that just got delivered" transactions, but if there's consistently gold swapping between classic and BFA they might well issue a warning, or in gold-trading quantities, a temp suspension.
---
As a shaman this upsets me greatly
---
Oh gosh I remember downloading updates overnight and just praying you didn't wake up with the color other than green on that dot. Never slept easy those nights.
---
LOL NOPE
---
Rogues have to go out into the world and physically... Level.... Lock Picking....
---
Brace yourself for this pain, young Rogue.
---
I think we're talking about different things. If you're an enchanter, and a customer (not in your guild) comes to you for an enchant, then obviously the customer should pay a fee.
---
But if you only have trainer recipes, then you offer nothing special and you have no leverage. Heck, there will probably always be an enchanter spamming "284/300 ENCHANTER GIVING FREE ENCHANTS IF YOU BRING MATS!"
---
And that's also one of the reasons why mats are more expensive than (trainer) crafted items. You need rare recipes to make money, because everyone else has the trainer recipes, and a lot of other crafters will do them for free, either for skillups, or for guildies.
---
Fixed, TY.  The exact kind of feedback I was looking for, some of the items started blending together after a few hours.
---
If anything, I'm underestimating the grind, especially the last couple ranks. I've been playing MMORPGs since UO, and I've never experienced a more brutal grind than the vanilla rank grind.
---
Yeah, I totally agree. And at 60 they have the will be a core part of any raid -- but most people who want to play a DPS character don't want to settle for a class that falls in the lower half of the dps meter. And with no balancing patches to look forward to, people know where Hunters are going to place in every phase. I don't enjoy the dps rat race so I pretty much exclusively play tank or heals, but I can't fault the logic I suppose.
---
Fondly remember the days....
---
“LF1M anyone WC” knowing I could fill any role needed.
---
And offtanking later in dungeons like tribute runs or tough pulls in UBRS.
---
Lmao this is exactly what OP is talking about. 🙄
---
Yeah Warlocks!
---
Love it when people criticize and dismiss massive effort for one small point. If it takes a few extra minutes to leave the starting zone it’s basically irrelevant to the overall time. 1-5 is like...30-40 min on average?
---
The rain in Spain stays mainly in the Mulgore plain
---
Well not only did rogues have to create and carry their own poisons. But they lasted a set amount of charges and not just a duration. Unless that was changed by the time that patch hits which I believe it didnt.
---
its more compared to other classes/specs. If you find the raidgroup that wants a nightfall shaman then definetly go for it! 
---
I rated it poor because the average shaman player who may have never played classic certainly wont be getting the damage they would expect, and should know that its a less desirable dps spec than others
---
Botting*
---
Go for it then! they can be quite good in basically every setting except raiding (and even then you might be able to find a one off spot as a nightfall user). Just because its not exceptional at a roll doesn't mean they are bad!
---
Ooh thanks!
---
As we can see plenty of room for more shamans on the horde.
---
The design philosophy back then was such that Hybrids gained a huge advantage by being able to play in "any" role, therefore they had to be weaker at all roles vs the more pure classes. Blizzard were happy with a solid 20% difference in output between DPS hybrids and pure classes.
---
However even with that philosophy, some of the hybrids got screwed even more than the others. Paladin tanks were really bad in Vanilla. Crush your friends dream. You have to take the good and the bad with Vanilla I guess lol.
---
Hey, this guy is a nark! =P JK, game responsibly everyone!
---
Honestly, don't. This poll is nowhere near accurate. 
---
Hunters will not be one of the least played classes lmfao, nor are there going to be a million warlocks running around.
---

---
Used a similar web-based system back then.
---
I think aside from the absolute memest of specs, anything and everything is perfectly viable and will definetly see raid play. And even the absolute meme tier stuff often can find a one off slot in some aspect or another
---
Cool. Now I kinda wanna be a Thexoffender, too.
---
you're unlikely to reach the debuff limit in a dungeon since they're maxed at 5 people
---
A LOT of people are underestimating it because of the matchmaking in modern i'd imagine. in modern you can afford to be picky because you have a giant disposable army of people who sometimes will literally beg to join your raid, while in classic that pool is much smaller
---
You WILL be griefed in a neutral town, on a boat, or a Zeppelin if you are on a PvP server.
---
Also, exploration of areas actually yields a fairly good amount of EXP.  If you are leveling and feel like you are about to leave a zone, check your map and see if everything is uncovered.  It's probably worth it, even if you just find out whats there.
---
Thanks. Think I'll play my Hunter solo (most of the time) and warlock for leveling with my friend.
---
Same with druids, the form quests were cool (although seal was a pain in the ass).
---
Seems like rogue had some cool ones as well, pickpocket, lockpick and poisons.
---
The stance forms for warrior had cool flavor as well.  Never understood why those were pruned, my pipedream is they get rolled back in and class Halls are accessed sooner.
---
if you're not in my guild then i have no reason to care about your gear tbh.
---
He can reduce the resolution ingame, that wilo give him 60fps
---
Its really too bad that shaman was never devloped fully into a real tank spec, i'd love to tank and have all those sexy sexy utility spells
---
I remember when I switched to wildhammer when it opened, druids were so scarce you knew almost all of them by name, both factions.
---
There’s more to the game than raiding, it’s true.
---
His wording was a bit odd, he meant its the same reason why all the races that can be shaman, can be shaman
---
Which is fair when you consider Goblin Shaman in Cataclysm, though lorewise they literally make contracts with the elements. Shaman make deals, they aid the elements the elements aid them back. Not too strange to consider a goblin realizing how beneficial that would be to them
---
Can you also recommend a race for the classes for both factions (if applicable). I really never know which race works best with each class.
---
I'm pretty sure the light would have left them as soon as they became undead. Kinda like what happened to arthas.
---
These are great! Can’t wait to see the warlock some day :3
---
There's something like 6 dungeon levelling discords depending on your region and so on where you can easily find a group. I'm on phone so it's difficult to search for the groups, but I'm sure you can find them.
---
Im gonna activate this for my own fun. I wanna see how much im actually playing during classic.
---
Really cool^^
---
No, the Light is not opposed to undeath, only the Alliance users that wield it are, otherwise there would be no Forsaken Priests.
---
honestly if the game looked like this it'd be sick.
---
7&lt;40
---
There are 3 ways to do it:
---
1. Gather a crap-ton of gold pre-switching to Engineering (the tips/tricks are pretty damn good for PvP)
---
2. Mining/Engi on main, alch/herb on alt.
---
3. Alt with dual gathering.
---
For this exact situation I'm probably going to do an alt ASAP (my guild is planning 5 weeks for 1-60 for raid purposes) and get mining/X (tailoring or blacksmith for the cooldowns). 
---
I guess a question is why do you feel bent on having your main having the double production profs? In Vanilla the talents/bonuses don't exist (minus engineering needing specific engineering breakpoints to use).
---
With my troll Shaman named Thex.
---
Please keep making these, I need help sorry lol
---
Good point.
---
You can eat and drink at the same time
---
All specs are viable in pvp.. ele is just way harder to gear and to play..
---
It depends what your talking about, you seem to be trying to make an argument for healing dungeons as shadow?
---
RemindMe! 24 days
---
im not entirely sure if you're tryna shit on me or not...but its not like i'm speedrunning baron runs as shadow and I won't claim to have done that as shadow healing. I'm not advising raid healing as deep shadow, and I'm not telling people that gear doesn't matter. 
---
It is 100% viable to be shadow and still heal 5 and 10 mans at 60. I can say that confidently, i did that shit in 8/8 devout (far from ideal gear) with shit internet and no ts or vent. Certainly, before I learned the dungeons or when we had a cascade failure of CC and whatnot we wiped--but that shit is gonna happen no matter how _properly_ you are specced. Vanilla isn't a game of necessary min-max. You can be non-optimal specs and still succeed without issue.
---
The Holy tree provides 5% healing crit, half a second off your slow heals, a boost to your renew, decent mana reduction on those heals, and a decent +healing boost from Spiritual Guidance. I did not claim Shadow heals better than Holy/Disc. But all in all, it isn't that impactful when you're running 5-mans; it doesn't matter as much as having a competent tank who knows the pulls or dps who knows how to CC and not break it. 
---
Vanilla isn't that hard. It is an entirely different sort of game as modern wow that is more about mechanical understanding for gearing and skill usage than it is rotation or boss mechanics. I was a punk fuckin teenager when i healed BWL, Aq40 and Naxx. It is really not that hard, as long as your party pays attention and knows how to play.
---
Nice. What mouse and keyboard do you have?
---
i love this
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
races are drawn so cute, i love it
---
I take offense to this. I Shit all over people as resto in pvp
---
I expected it. The target audience here isn't the most ideal for a message like this. If I wanted better reception, I would have tried a sub like /noWoW. Appreciate your comment, and your welcome
---
Looks like hunter grand Marshall gear to me
---
Pretty much this, depends entirely on what you actually had in mind.  
---
Healing and DPS at the same time is extremely mana intensive in a game where healers are already very tied down by mana usage.
---
/e has reported you AFK. Please type /AFK within 10 seconds to remain in the instance!
---
Pm me the link I test it.
---
Oh just thinking.    
---
5 healers standing around waiting to heal seems inefficient.  
---
Adding 1500 DPS to a raid by having them DPS seem appropriate and fun.
---
Thex? Is that you?
---
They will even call you a noob when u have WF totem down because they LOS it and don't get the buff but that's your fault lol
---
I have memories of enhance in PvP.  Those shamans whooped my ass. Of course I was 12...and barely understood the game but still.
---
Nope
---
Shamans have to carry all for totems in there inventory
---
One of the major problems with raiding as shadow it the debuff limit on enemies being 16. As a priest you will be taking up 2-4 of those with swp, shadow vulnerability, vampiric embrace, and mind flay. And if your raid isn't strict about what debuffs are out, your spells will get knocked off by a warriors bleed or some shit.
---
Agree. Especially on a new server where you have no gold or possibility to buy items you will be oom in most dungeons up to 60 if your trying to heal and play shadow at the same time. 
---
In my experience you can, as a holy spec anyways, work fairly well in a dungeon using holy fire and smite in between heals is the beat way to heal while leveling and doing dungeons. Improved wand with holy fire and smite let’s you kill mort mobs pretty easy, it’s not the fastest leveling class but it’s doable.
---
You can tank all the dungeons as fury, you will rarely have a smooth run unless you know all 3 dps have tanked in vanilla before or your gear is a fair bit better than all of theirs, you will die a lot more, and you will be far busier. Still a perfectly good choice.
---
Hunter
---
Have an upvote for mentioning SWG. :)
---
are paladin tanks viable for dungeons (5 man)and ubrs (10 man dungeon) right?not talking about raids (20 and 40 man)
---
If you’re talking about endgame that’s another story.
---
Kanto
---
I agree silly! Neutral doesnt mean bad, it means it doesnt stand out to the truly exceptional pvp classes.
---
oh true sorry it was serpent sting. My buddy was complaining while he was leveling a hunter recently, i never played the class. my mistake
---
Paladins usually destroy other healers in terms of HPS in basically every patch, not just very late game. Maybe something changed during vanilla's timeline but on 1.12 holy paladin is very strong from the get-go.
---
After we do these little "brief look" style things we were thinking of making a racial pros/cons list, depending on demand!
---
A dungeon run, even at low levels can take hours... die half way through and you will have a lengthy corpse run and potentially have to deal with red pawns... also, if someone leaves half way through it can be a nightmare to find a replacement...
---
Dont go feral, power shifting sounds like hell
---
Yea vanilla wow is so much harder than mythic raids.
---
Thex
---
&gt;I preferred mutilate in arena 
---
I never had good enough daggers to make mutilate worth it, but I remember that for the longest time the highest ranking 5v5 team had a mutilate rogue.
---
But yea for TBC it was combat-sub or bust, at least in my experience lol.
---
Please tell me we get them all before release! I just want to see them all now 😅
---
I'm thinking of attempting something like this but with paladin.
---
Good Warlocks are using demonic runes and mageblood potions.
---
Great post but the title saying it's 2 days and then you drop that its actually 2 days 13 hours at the end... real disappointment.
---
Don't rush to 60. It isn't retail and you will have plenty of time at max level to do all the things. Enjoy the leveling ride and go out and explore and take your time.
---
The ping time between most of Japan and Los Angeles is nearly identical to the ping time to Sydney, but you should play on the Sydney realms in any case because of the timezone difference.
---
I do not believe, at all, that druid will be in the bottom 2 classes played. I do believe Warriors will be the most played, even if barely.
---
well I'll be the bad warlock that's doing 10 less dps, but doesn't have to farm demonic runes.
---
This reeks of delusion. Meme specs are carriable, not viable. Huge difference, yes you can kill Ragnaros with 2 retribution paladins but you can also kill Ragnaros with 38 people. It's not optimal to bring these specs just as it isn't optimal, no matter how much people cry and tell themselves so, to bring a protection paladin instead of a warrior to a 5-man.
---
Classic is about give and take, you can finish the content with any spec and composition but how much more difficult and tiresome are you willing to make it for others? Because it might be fine after the first 2 wipes but after a night of wiping because you can't get past 5% boss hp you'll see guilds disband. Stop with this delusion and understand the game you're playing, this **is not retail**.
---
Check out Joanas guide, still the best!
---
They dont. 30/40 people in my pserver raiding guild had engi. Alchemy is for alts a d 2-3 guild flask crafters. Guild leader/MT had BS and all relavent recipes. Guild officer druid had lw for mandatory crafted resist gear. Most caster dps were tailoring/engi. Melee were often herb/engi or minjng/engi. Heavy use of level 35 alts for arcanite xmutes
---
Generally what level do you have to be to make arcanite bars/transmute? Can I make them as early as level 35?
---
Didnt even think about the time difference. Ocianic it is then. Thanks
---
you have clearly never lead a vanilla guild good luck and hope you don't quit when you have a rude awakening in BWL

I have gotten just about all classes to 110+ except hunter and druid.  My hunter was 67 and druid 98.

As far as I know there's still no official RP-PvP servers.  So hopefully as many RP-PvP people as possible coordinate using the discord server and we can pick an unofficial RP-PvP realm to concentrate ourselves on.  But, it's only going to work if the word gets out, so here I am. =)
---
Also, I have both the Classic Beta version of TukUI installed and the Retail version of ElvUI installed because that was the only way to get ElvUI working on the Beta. You clearly have no fucking idea what you're talking about.
---
Acktchually!
---
Downloaded it, opened the sandbox client for classic beta and logged on my character. 9 errors poped up. Is there a specific version I need to download?
---
Warstomp will save you once and you'll know you chose correctly.
---
Sounds good. I know it usually doesn't matter that much but is there a specific race that goes well with hunter? Or one that should be avoided?
---
What? You cannot login to Classic right now...
---
It happened alot on beta though.
---
Rank 14 takes zero skill. It still baffles me ppl are willing to play 12 hours of pvp when pvp in the game is average at best.
---
[http://classicmaps.xyz/sandbox/](http://classicmaps.xyz/sandbox/)
---
Yep.  But a decent group shouldn't be losing people again and again.  A death or two might slow you down a bit, but 2hrs worth of corpse runs means your losing people to trash on almost every pull.
---
whats "a d 2-3 guild flask crafters"? Do you mean 2-3 guild members have Alchemy as their main?
---
If they do, was it Alchemy and Herbalism or Alchemy and Engineering?
---
dont need to scale it, but its likely to be less played than paladin and shaman looking at this so youll be the least played class on both faction
---
I mained Undecided in vanilla so I was planning to do it again. But now that I see 11% of everyone is doing it, maybe I will try a less popular class.
---
i second this, looks like a lot of work was put into it, and a lot of good info, but useless as alliance :(
---
Vanilla friends is a joke anyways.
---
Oh my gosh I remember this! My rogue was my first 60 toons and I didn’t know about lockpocking till It was too late. I remember there was an old castle/brick like building that was full of lockboxes and you had to keep doing loops and wait for them to respawn. That was miserable!!
---
Pre-nerfs early Cata PvE was good, for modern WoW standards
---
I'm more worried about not having the time to raid then finding a raid spot. Job and family are more important. Only have a few hrs to play a week.
---
And you're surprised that a hacky non-playable method of launching an old version of the Classic Beta client doesn't have specific addon support? Just wait until August 8th.
---
When will they add them for EU tho...?
---
Not really. I make no mention of “whether or not one will be able to get a raid spot.” Obviously the discussion between myself and the parent comment’s author is meant to be one rooted in speculative meta and not casual land, which is where the OP takes things.
---
I remember playing deadmines and I loved that instance because it reminded me of the movie The Goonies! I look back and I can’t even imagine how much time I’ve spent there lol
---
The purple kind?
---
Bro I feel like you need to add a “farming” category because it’s a huge part of the game and some classes/specs are way better at it than others.
---
I mean, other addons do work. But yeah I guess I'll have to wait for the final stress test.
---
Huh?
---
I think it doesn't use a GCD so you can use it at the same time as lifetap.

I mean... fury warriors weren't patched to be good till end of vanilla. It's one of the reasons as to why they were thought of as a meme spec. It wasn't until post vanilla pservers that people found out how good it can be.
---
Hey nice macros. Can you combine it with /startattack macros ?
---
Seems like you are still a punk teenager, at least mentally. I know exactly what you are claiming and saying, and it is nothing more than exactly as I said, encouraging lazy half ass “good enough” play. 
---
Just because it can be done, does not mean it should be done or that it is acceptable to be done. 
---
What kind of MMO player grows up on wow and encourages shit like this 15 years later. 
---
Either your story is utter bullshit or you have grown up into a failure in life.
---
Yes, I understand, but I just find it to be way too min-maxy just to save 1 gcd instead of having to do 1 extra lifetap.
---
You had to tank poach from other guilds to do 4 horsemen in Naxx. Since when does difficulty have anything to do with fun. Classic was challenging but not retardedly hard. Go play darksouls and you have one difficulty that is how the game is meant to be played and how it should be enjoyed. “Modern wow has mythic, classic was too easy” Go play Halo 1 on Legendary, and tell me if it’s fun. Now go play halo on advanced and tell me which is more fun to play. Adding difficulty tiers to a game diluted the experience of the game to the point raiding is no longer important. Mythic and heroic shouldn’t exist. When you add difficulties to the game it creates less fun and overall more repetitive content. Mythic raiding isn’t fun that’s why nobody does it. Modern wow isn’t fun that why you lost 8% of the subscribers in the first month of BFA. You’re comparing a game that created the ethos of MMOs to a game that is slowly choking away all good will earned since the golden days.
---
Okay, that gives me some hope! Can't wait to try this
---
Agreed on them being fun, but I wish there was a happy medium between glass cannon and tank for lock PVP builds.
---
There is no "Russia" Battle.NET region, only Americas, Europe, Asia, and China, nor does the region your Battle.NET account is logged into have any bearing on what region WoW launches to.
---
Regardless of what region your Battle.NET account is logged into, you can create and choose accounts for all three available regions: Americas &amp; Oceania, Europe, and Asia. Chinese accounts are only available within China through a 3rd party.
---
So if you install WoW and change the game's settings (through the Battle.NET client) to Russian, you have three options.
---
1. Choose your Americas &amp; Oceania account from the dropdown, in which case you will not see any realms.
---
2. Choose your Europe account from the dropdown, in which case you will only see Russian realms.
---
3. Choose your Asia account from the dropdown, in which case you will not see any realms.
---
If you want to play on the other Europe realms, you will need to set your WoW game's language (through the Battle.NET settings) to English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, or Portugese. When you select your Europe account from the dropdown and login with any of these languages chosen, you will see all the realms but the Russian ones.
---
Well then it should be fine for me also I hope everything works out!
---
I blame Kargoz
---
Don't you dare speak about Thex like that.
---
Yep. Fuck it. Enhancement Shaman and Feral Druid coming up.
---
I just encountered this two nights ago on a private server. I passed the gear to the mage. He'd benefit from it more than I would.
---
Courtesy isn't done for reciprocation.  If you're being courteous with the assumption that it would be returned then I agree, you will find yourself worn down by the worst of people.
---
Courtesy has an intrinsic value, and regardless of response will make you feel better about yourself. I suggest you try it, it's hard at first because it goes against some people's upbringing, but habits are only broken if you make an effort.
---
He just means that if the group’s tank is already a warrior, he may choose different players so that he doesn’t have to share the warrior gear
---
WOW a lot more balanced than actual class distribution in WOW 2006/2007
---
so.... you're telling me he was topping DPS because of an *unfair advantage*? Well color me surprised!
---
WoW Classic servers will be hosted in Sydney (103.4.115.248) for Oceania players, Seoul (211.115.104.1) for Korean players, and Taipei (210.71.148.11) for Taiwanese players. China will also be getting realms, though it's managed through a 3rd party, NetEase, and your internet connection needs to be located within China to connect to them. You can use those IPs to test your ping to the various servers, though if your preference is to play in English, you really only have one choice.
---
Yeah I know
---
In world pvp though they are one of the best duelers next to Soul Link Warlocks and Rogues. A shaman doing something like 30/0/21 can world pvp win almost every 1v1 due to all their utility, burst dps, and heals.
---
So I'd say your info graphic underrated shaman pvp potential by marking neutral.
---
the same fate will be happening again with wow classic.
---
Op you are an absolute legend. I'm so glad you posted this. Player skill is the main thing. I'm rolling a human Or nelf priest because I'm not a dwarf fan.
---
One of my favourite memories in vanilla is when I was leveling my enhance shaman. I just got windfury at level 30 and was outside Scarlet Monastery waiting for my crew. 
---
Some Alliance showed up and we engaged and I literally one shot a druid with my windfury totem that i JUST got and everyone in mumble (the predecessor to discord for you babies) just LOST their minds. It was so fucking awesome and I couldn't stop smiling from ear to ear.
---
Im playing from Japan also. I did the stress test and more testing on retail US realm and the ping was fine. I think it was averaging around 120 from what I remember.
---
Demonic runes restore more mana and take less health while not using a GCD.
---
Demonic runes can be farmed while farming felcloth and sharding before a raid.
---
One little thing might not make a difference, but when you add them up they equate to the difference between the 15 players who carry your raid and the 25 who just show up.
---
&gt;Thanks for the info, to be honest I figured that as long as i was getting 100fps running around questing and \~60 frames while doing group content that would probably be enough for me. Tricky figuring out that classic requires though as I imagine it runs slighly easier than modern wow but not a log of benchmarks around.
---
This poll definitively proves that mayonnaise is not, in fact, an instrument.
---
Absolutely worth getting into. But be careful, I was shocked after all these years how addicting this game is.
---
&gt;nothing to do? How about grinding gold for you epic mount? proffessions? farm Maraudon? farm reputations? Hydraxian quest? Craft ammunition or Devilsaur set?  
---
&gt;There's plenty to do solo.
---
nah I was like, totally just about to hearth back anyway
---
The easier solution to this is to just use the standard disc build for power infusion and buff a mage. This would give more dps than trying to shadow dps on the side.
---
I'll fite you in game
---
Rogue my fellow scaper
---
Are you a Thexican or a Thexican't?
---
While the minimum specification requirements for Classic are much older and lower than Retail, the recommended specifications are identical.

&gt;Haha I don't think its that awesome a monitor, when I had a look around there a budget 34" screen around $400 USD/$500 AUD (Viotek, LG, Massdrop etc.). I was gonna buy a 1080p 34" but was advised by a friend that would be a little grainy.. I've been out of the loop for a long time when it comes to PC gaming haha.   
---
&gt;Thanks for the infor!!
---
Back in Vanilla I didn't have enough until 43 for my first character's mount. This was with grinding and farming for ore to sell on the AH. Times were tough on the initial character.

I didn't play a hunter in Vanilla but I'm actually really interested to try one for the crowd control aspect in dungeons.  Guaranteed I'll be one of those guys that forgets to buy arrows though.
---
Uh, yes it does. A 24 inch screen vs a 32 inch screen of the same resolution, the 24 inch screen will yield higher fps on the same PC in the exact same game. Not sure where you got your information.

A couple gigs eh,  that will take me like 10 secs on my connection!
---
Which spec? Why do you think they are easy to gear?
---
&gt; A 24 inch screen vs a 32 inch screen of the same resolution, the 24 inch screen will yield higher fps on the same PC in the exact same game.
---
Lol, no.

its an mmorpg you play however you want to play

A couple of months ago a saw a shrek musical and the female shrek (sorry I can‘t remember the name) looked exactly like the new female orc models. I couldn’t stop laughing

You cant keep forcing it on him though, if its not his thing it wont be no matter what you say.

Ive mates i play games with we have the same interests but there is alot of games they play and have asked me to try i just wont because i know what i like no matter how hard they try and convice me. Theres always other games you can play together it doesnt have to be every game.

As far as PvE content goes, nothing gives me the same joy as tanking as a protection paladin. From questing to tanking 5 mans I love getting loads of mobs on me and slowly roasting them down with consecration, Ret aura, holy shield, block damage from blessing of sanctuary. Was originally thinking of rolling one. But, I love pvp and protection paladins don’t offer too much, and in raiding I would never even be thought about being taken ( I’m a casual player so I’ll never get a good spot as a tank, however people make a case that they’re great for raid trash). Every one would want me to heal. I healed from vanilla-wotlk so I wanna dps or tank this time around. 
---
On an unofficial server I hit level 60 on a Druid and wanted to feral dps or tank. However I hit a sad reality when everyone just asked me to heal nearly everything. My guild didn’t even wanna bring me along as a feral. Made me sad 
---
For the most part, if your class has the ability to heal, raiders will expect you to heal.
---
If you actually played a healer or tank in Vanilla you know that you had to replace the gear to lvl as DPS spec.
---
Uhhh is that some sort of sick joke?
---
Excuse me, my son is also named Thex
---
The last time I played classic was in 2007 and I‘m still hooked. This game is so damn addictive and I have to be rly careful this time around
---
Your 5 piece canvas wall art of Bwonsamdi  looks cool but it's bothering me because the right most part doesn't line up with the rest of the picture. I can't unsee it and it's all I can focus on.
---
Yeah i have a strong memory of them being conjured no?
---
Just out of curiosity what makes you think he will like it? classic wow actually had really bland grindey gameplay. It was so popular because it was a glorified chat room with fantasy elements.
---
Better to use population figures at max level than level 1.
---
Shaman and Paladin should be 2x because the Poll wasnt split along faction lines.
---
(assuming a 50/50 split between horde-alliance)
---
First ever meme known is from 1921, that makes that generation less than 100 years old. People can live past 100...many generations? You sure about that?

Now this is about to be the real Classic/Vanilla experience .

I put it up in 15 minutes before i went to work i noticed tha5 but even leveled out the armband doesnt line up still so i left it.
---
That's just when you get into a guild 🤫
---
Isn’t that the gear you had while using the guide?
---
&gt;I knew you didn't mean it literally
---
So why start off the way you did? Anybody can be a shareholder. For example anybody with an index fund in the SP500 would be a tiny shareholder in Activision. So the degree to which each is investigating the company they are invested in, will vary. Do I care? No. I was just joking about shareholders heads exploding. A shareholder could definitely be interested in little tiny micro things like this tho. I'm using it as more of an expressions. I have a tiny bit of money in the SP500 so I'm technically a shareholder too. Whoopdy shit, that doesn't mean anything. "Shareholders" aren't sitting up in some tower somewhere around a shadowy table. 
---
I don't know what they do to find gold transfers from game to game like that. Somebody could walk up and trade righteous orbs to somebody, and on the other end somebody gives gold/goods to somebody in BfA.
---
I'll be farming that Pacifier in Alterac Mountains too.  4.0 speed rogue squasher.
---
Exactly this. My friends and I are working now and have way less free time. That means we want to be efficient with our game time. 
---
It's not about min maxing to be the top 1%, it's just about respecting the time of everyone else in the raid and trying to bring your best. That's all I want from a raid.
---
Thats my biggest problem with retail. When I open the AH I see the same item with 100 different itemlevels. Items should have one level and when you do a harder dungeon you should get a different item that’s better. Not the same item from so many sources with more agility etc. That kills the last bit of fantasy retail has. Classic will be so good. Getting bis and start enchanting it so you have it for some time. This will be great
---
Your values are incorrect, Shaman's excel in World PvP due to the short nature of the fight and self sustain. Also they are good in dungeons as DPS again short nature of fights and burst with back up heals.
---
That would be great if they weren't [conjured](https://worldofwarcraft.fandom.com/et/wiki/Conjured_item) wich disappear after being logged out for 15 min
---
I don't think needing cloth is unreasonable - but consider that one of the perks of being a Pala is that you have by far more options for loot than others, which means you also have more opportunities for loot, and sometimes loot is outright defaulted to you because of your wide variety of armor skill.
---
If you roll need on a cloth chest against a mage, then the next 3 bosses drop a leather chest, a mail chest, and a plate chest - you are going to feel like a colossal jerk.
---
Sure - maybe the cloth chest was the best possible option for you, maybe the others were only 80% as good - but in my opinion would   be that it's far better that the mage get his cloth chest, and you get one of the 80% as good options - rather than you get the cloth chest, the mage gets nothing, and the next 3 pieces of gear completely go to waste.
---
So even if it were "ok" to need on other armor classes, I personally would reserve myself and often pass for the guy where it is literally his only option.
---
In the event of an item being really really super BiS despite not being the main armor type (Ex: Mail Edgemasters for warriors) I'd happily roll need, but in the case of it just broadly being an upgrade? I'd pass - there are going to be more opportunities for me in the near future.
---
Troll shaman? You surely like chaos in this subreddit
---
From my experience paying pservers the amount of warlocks drop down significantly in favor of mages come AQ. This is weird considering that's when warlocks potentially become a power house. I don't know the cause for this but from my own experience i dropped my main because I felt that important gear pieces were handed to mages far too often. With this said, as a warlock guilds will be bending their knees for your awesome raid presence if this happens in retail as well.
---
Mage. You press Frostbolt.
---
I'm excited to be excited for green loot again.
---
I'll name him Thex
---
Yeah I don’t wanna backseat game him at all for classic. Part of the magic is the overwhelming feeling of information and world-size when you get dropped into WoW on your first character. I’d hate to take that away.
---
Troll Warrior named Brokenback FTW
---
Considering gearing and phase 1 is primarilly 5mans.. or less

By all means do w.e. I am not your maker.

Literally a classic guide and video...

Oh ya then he’d absolutely love it. If he can get past the whole “i hate RPGs” thing.

I made it to rank 13 right before they revamped the honor system. At the time, I was part of an AV train. We all got into ventrilo and queued for AV at the same time, then steamrolled it, with dedicated groups for certain objectives. The leaders had macros to give instructions to the random players that ended up in the match, with an explanation that if they did what we said, AV wouldn’t take 8 hours and they would get an assload of honor. We were rolling games in less than 30 minutes easily. With that being said, IIRC rank 9-10 took me 2 weeks of doing that nonstop for 8-10 hours a day, on a high pop server with a LOT of people grinding. Typically I’d spend the time between queues doing world PvP, and the consensus was that it wouldn’t sustain the honor required to get to rank 14. The premades for people grinding rank 14, which were the only way to get more honor/hour were VERY exclusive and they focused on FAST wins (5 capping AB, back to back flag caps in WSG)...
---
So basically. Join an AV train (when that’s a thing) or solo queue. Premades are only required for the last super grindy parts imo.
---
We’re good enough friends that I could tell him I’m gonna chemically castrate him if he doesn’t play classic and he’d be like “okay go for it” so I have no qualms about “killing the friendship” because that’s just not a possibility. 
---
That being said I get what you’re saying. But he does like RPGs to an extent, I’ve seen him enjoy them with my own eyes. He’s just closed himself off to WoW because on his first experience playing he felt the old world content was a waste of time because of how endgame focused modern WoW is, and just didn’t feel like investing in a game for that long just to maybe enjoy endgame. 
---
With classic half the fun is leveling, so i feel like initially he’d get the same feelings he got when he tried modern WoW but as he realized how involved leveling in classic is in comparison he’s begin to like it.
---
I played alliance through vanilla and bc, decided to do horde this time around.
---
Uh, no.

Undeath average was 1g to 2g, Water average was 5g to 6g
---
Arcane Crystal average was 30g to 35g, Thorium Bar average was 10s to 12s, Arcanite Bar average was 40g to 50g.
---
So your Undeath-&gt;Water transmute is making you 3g to 5g.
---
And your Arcanite Transmute is making you 5g to 20g.
---
Even at double the cooldown length, the profit potential of Arcanite is MUCH higher.
---
Except the 50% of people that played on a private server before and have general knowledge of the game, but yeah keep saying that to yourself. Man I'm gonna love seeing all the ragequit posts made by dads about how the skill gap is too huge and how this isn't the "old WoW they remember"
---
They did not disappear at the point of the AQ patch, at least. I rerolled with a guild in 2006 and one of our warlocks kept their first soul shard in the bank as a memento.

Oh fuck off dude. I’m not being shitty, why even speak on a relationship you have no clue about outside of a lightly worded post on reddit. I just want him to give it a fair shot I’m not trying to shove the game down his throat.
---
U so dumb...
---
I, too, want to know this. And without knowing the answer, I’d still guess that maybe when you deal less damage, the time to kill the mob goes up making the need to regenerate more health greater than if the mob was killed faster, since it can get several more hits on you. Therefore I’d guess that strength is better on your primary gear, and just switch out pieces to pieces with spirit on between pulls.
---
Ya. There will be. It's just the way he worded it sounds like he's saying 6% of the horde playerbase will be warrior. He's saying, of the entire playerbase, 6% will be horde warriors.
---
Edgar Wright's movies are all highly entertaining and worth rewatching from time to time.

I remember this, trying to explain to my mom why the computer had to stay on for 30 hours

I’m not trying to force him to play it I just want to try to spark an interest in it for him so he’ll give it a chance. If he doesn’t like it fine but I feel like modern WoW ruined his palate for the game as a whole and I want him to see how much more fun it used to be before casting his final judgment.

Check out my list for a full account of all the stuff you should hold on to while levelling!

I wouldn't really say grindy, rather that Classic has proper "long term goals". BFA is more of an amusement park with loads of rides and you typically get what you want in 10-20min.
---
XxxleggolassxXx
---
They have a real, fully developed tank spec. If you want to tank, I suggest you try it at some point in classic to know what your missing! It’s incredibly fun, and it’s a nice change of pace from enhancement being so rng windfury focused while leveling. People just don’t use it for end game. But it’s completly viable up to 60.  
---
Reasons for this are no “real” taunt but max rank earth shock works just fine in 90% of situations, not great aoe aggro even though fire totems/chain lightning pull is pretty good, and no dedicated tanking tier sets. They have gear that can be used to tank at 60 obviously but from my understanding it’s not streamlined/obvious what’s best like it is for other tank specs. 
---
The only thing I find annoying about Shaman is going oom all the time in dungeons when I’m tanking, but a lot of specs have that problem and I’m also probably just bad at mana and managment.
---
Tyvm for the guide. I find the spider idea very good, cause most of the new players are gonna spend half an hour killing the skeletons and wolves for the quests and there will be less people contesting the spider’s. I appreciate your effort, I think a lot will be useful on my mage too.
---
If he doesn’t wanna play that’s fine but it’d be cool if I could try to get him interested enough to give it a fair go and make his own decision. 
---
I know you’re really busy as an armchair therapist so that might be hard for you to understand though.
---
The question is how high do you want your settings. WoW can run on integrated laptop video cards. My work laptop for example can do 60 fps on low-med the last I tried. It would not take a brand new card to get that monitor to 100 fps on medium. I run a 2560x1080 dell ultrawide capped at 100 fps on high+ with a GTX1080 that must be 3+ years old now... with a 4k secondary monitor often streaming movies at the same time.
---
Really though the better you buy, the better you can crank up the settings, the less stress and heat the card will generate, and the longer the card will support what you want to do, so I would not cheap out. Think of how many hours you'll be playing, nearly any price you can afford is worth it. 
---
Actually this has me thinking of upgrading even though I'm in a comfortable performance zone. Going to throw probably 10k hours on Classic, might as well bump up. Also set up better for Cyberpunk 2077 next year which is the only other new game on my radar right now.
---
Cata introduced some of the worst mechanics in the game.
---
Lol reminds me of when they put an electronic timer on my laptop's power chord and I just bought a new power chord they never had a clue .. Also my dad put a BIOS password on my PC and then my brother realised he texted it to my mother so he grabbed his phone and for years I'd play till my mother came home then ask her to turn the PC on ...

Hahaha, preach!

He did say 7 months ago he cheated on her.
---
This is a good idea
---
You're spewing complete nonsense.
---
Depends on your definition of good I suppose. Good as in able to form a full group and clear all the raids in reasonable time? You wont have trouble if you're reliable. Good as in world/server first? Their rosters are likely already set in stone.
---
Read your post again :)
---
Make a human warrior. If you make something other than what you like you will regret it. Ofc escape artist is great in pvp, gnomes cant however compete in pve without the edgemasters handguards.
---
I agree generally speaking, but for female orcs for example I prefer the old faces.
---
&gt; because beta had very fast respawns, nearly instant when I was leveling as well
---
You also said:
---
&gt;I didn't have beta access
---
So when you were leveling in the beta that you didn't have access to, spawns were very fast? Okay.
---
Thank you, mage does sound interesting. I'll look into it!
---
Lets say you are level 40 with WW axe and aren't doing hamstring kiting. Your axe has a speed of 3.60 and 15 strength, so your increase I believe would be 3.6 seconds * 15 * .143 damage per second = 7.72 extra per hit.
---
Now consider Mograine's Might from SM (which gives 3 more stamina, 16 spirit, but is a bit faster than WW axe)
---
16 * 0.8 + 6 =  18.8 health per 2 second tick = 9.4 health per second
---
I'm willing to believe though that there may be added benefits to having a slower weapon that I may not be fully considering in the comparison of these two weapons - especially given this isn't my primary class.
---
I didn’t say it was done *for* reciprocation. I said relationships are reciprocal and it is inherent. You’re essentially ignoring the logical reality and trying to skirt your way around it. 
---
I am absolutely a very courteous and friendly person. I’m polite, conversational and kind even to the most solemn of people I meet in person. 
---
It’s discourteous to passive aggressively make suggestions based on values that are unknown to you. Are you attempting to only achieve surface courtesy to strangers so *you* feel good inside? That’s the only reason I can think that you’d be discourteous to me while being so self-righteous about how courteous you are as a person.
---
If you tried to understand my perspective, maybe you wouldn’t need to fall back on ad hominem attacks on my upbringing and my habits too.
---
dang
---
Likely all the way up to the actual launch 14 days later.
---
This sounds like you tested it on a private server, where drop rates for greens/rares as well as bags are highly inflated.
---
These are great. Informative without being overwhelming and they’re aesthetically pleasing as well. 10/10 wouldn’t roll shaman. ;)
---
I don't want to put money into this laptop so how well would it run with everything on low with the integrated card?
---
Thanks for that. 45 ping to Paris. 
---
I think I can live with that. beats the 3-400 I used to have playing Unreal. :)
---
Quest rewards, dungeon rewards, and of course I 99% of the time find BoE greens (or blues) to replace said gear with, but didn't want to showcase a video where I'm running around with zealots / shadowdancer cause mobs just get deleted. Heck I watched a rogue video earlier where the guide was showcased in 39 twink gear. Of course mobs are going to die super fast to that. I tried to go barebones / minimalist to show it can be done in the worst of situations.
---
The guide was made as "worst case scenario" as in if you for some reason got ZERO mob loot drops, didn't interact with the world at all, did ZERO quests, etc. 99.9% of players are going to do some quests, some adventuring, and find loot they can equip. 
---
The 2 days 13 hours is if you did what I did and only bought vendor greens, vendor white weapons, vendor white armors. 
---
To use the starter zone for example, if you don't replace your starter dagger it takes 5 sinisters, 1 5pt evisc, and several autos to kill a level 8 darkhound at level 10. With two cutlasses, you can kill them in 2-3 sinisters. It's a huge difference. Now imagine replacing a 14 dps white item with 28dps green. You'd double your speed. 
---
If all you care about is speed this guide isn't for you. If you want to minimize your /played then you're going to need to find a 5 man to roflstomp dungeons with until you break ahead then hire warlocks to port you to AoE spots as a mage to solo farm, while having friends on the opposite faction to kill anyone on your faction trying to share or steal the spot.
---
This guide is for people that just wanna zone out and watch the newest Sabrina on Netflix while not being stuck in the drudges of questing with 50 other people waiting on the cannoneer captain to spawn in at Ratchet.
---
Orc fury warriors with axes are no joke when some of the best drops from ony and bwl are axes!
---
You will see balance druids on raids. They will be on healing duty
---
Send massive amounts of them to yourself in the mail. Are the AV ones soulbound, I can't recall? 
---
My 2 cents
---
* Flare your drinking/eating allies. 
---
* Always lay a trap before it's needed. You want your trap to be back aslap.
---
* In WSG defend the flag and use your tracking ability, and never let a rogue get past your flare. 
---
* Create a raid boss like animal in enemy starting zones by using eyes of the beast!
---
*  In PVE have your pet's attack, growl, and recall all keybound. You will have so many freaking keybinds with hunter you might want to consider a programmable keyboard or a hand-pad/foot-pad type setup. Get good at macros.
---
It makes a large difference, but you make do with what you have. But yeah, if you do deadmines and then nothing until SM? it's going to be significantly harder to tank, both because your rage generation will be bad but because you will generate less threat without using your abilities.
---
I mean when it's just practice and not the "official" thing then it's pretty hard to go ham when I've done it several times before. It'd be like playing at a championship level in a sport when it's just a backyard basketball game with randoms off the street. Practice the fundamentals then exceed expectation when it counts.
---
Huh. I was under the wrong impression then?
---
If that's the case then why is using a 2h the way to go for leveling? I always assumed the extra hit chance was a big factor in that, the obvious bonus of mortal strike aside.
---
I would imagine... \^This
---
No **FROSTSHOCK** either. I am disappointed.
---
My spreadsheets from 2004-2005 show that greys alone net worth 100+ gold easily. Also I avg'd 3+ BoE blues every 10 levels of grinding back then. On pservers I averaged much less. On data I gathered from people grinding on beta it seems to match my vanilla data more so than pservers.
---

---
Progression is how your check your raid members. Any raid leader worth his salt can identify a bad player easily
---
Finding 40 bodies isnt hard. Filling the necessary healers is. Theres always dps willing to join.
---
Horde can also go with Orc as their 25% Stun resist can be useful in PvP and their racial is super strong in every PvE situation as Undeads Racial is only good in some PvE situations. 
---
Undead got the style though.
---
Never seems to be a problem for me, I usually take skinning which gives me a bit of extra silver, but even without it I always end up at around 70s at that time, if needed I sell anything I can afford to lose for the extra silver.
---
If you look at my speedrun on the stresstest you can see for yourself I don't have any problems getting that much, then you can compare to yourself and what the difference is
---
&gt;minimum 2gb ram
---
&gt;8gb ram isn't enough
---
What am I missing here?
---
Where would you be getting the mana to both dps and then heal during burst phases?
---
Due to to the availability of the PVC pipe... a catheter and some rubber tubing will let you get rid of the bottles entirely!
---
Viable? Sure. But only when there's no other option. Given the choice between a Warrior, Druid, or Paladin for your dungeon group, you'll only ever choose Paladin when you can't find the first two.
---
PvP is just PvE but with some flavor
---
Thanks a lot man, appreciate it :-)
---
PvP = BGs?
---
I put it that way on purpose because people should stop trying to put everyone in the 'normal' mold. If you have aspergers, it means your brain works differently than 'normal' people (i.e. the vast majority). 
---
If you have it in a bad way it means it will cost you loads of energy or effort to bond with people, form relationships e.d. For some people with Asperger it's just takes too much effort and it still doesn't feel comfortable. They stop trying and start doing stuff they *do*  feel comfortable with instead of always walking on your toes to fit in the 'normal' .
---
Appreciate the link! Great info
---
If being courteous has a cost, then there is an implied form of communication that has either less, or no cost. By the tone of your argument, I've assumed that you mean by not showing courtesy you save mental energy.  That's what has come across so far by all that you have said.
---
If you have no expectation of reciprocation, how can you say that all interactions are reciprocal?
---

I've got the same display specs, and am using this rig to run retail at max settings, usually 100fps, with occasional drops to 80ish in busier zones:
---
Amd Ryzen 7 2700X with pbo on
---
16 Gb ddr4 @ 3400 MHz
---
Msi 1080 ti gaming x 11Gb
---
Something similar would probably work for you as well. I think this will be a bit overkill just to play classic, but I play other games too and they run fine @ 60 fps.
---
I was just thinking the other day that i had to find something exactly like this, so thats a lot! Looks great to me.

Like in every game and wow expansion. It is solely there for entertainment.

&gt; In PvE, early vanilla raids are mechanically easy. The classes are mechanically easy. You don't have the option to click "heroic/mythic please" to find something challenging.
---
I stopped playing after Burning Crusade, as I couldn't put the time in, so I've got no basis for comparison here.
---
I'd be intrigued to play retail now to experience what has made the 'mechanics' different so that it's more challenging. 
---
From my experience with MC and BWL, there was nothing 'easy' about trying to get 40 people to kite the Chromaggus, and trying to hide in the right places and the right times, and also detecting it's resistances and hiding at the right times. It tooks some skillful hunters and some good positioning to be successful in that fight, and that's just one of the many different fights in the those two raids. What was 'easy' about them?
---
Yeah but they released this art in spring, once they announced the 15 year collector’s edition.
---
Thought we were talking about melee weaving while leveling.
---
Yep it's crazy. About 90% of it is taxes.
---
A very dedicated paladin tank will be sufficient for dungeons but requires the group to play accordingly. The moment someone in the group does just whatever they want it is impossible for the paladin to do anything. If the group plays accordingly it'll be enough, the biggest downside is then that you slow the run down whenever the paladin needs to drink. If the group plays accordingly, a voidwalker or hunter pet or even rogue could work just as much for 5mans.  
---
For raids a protection paladin is just bad. You lack the threat output required, you don't have taunts (making you a net 0 for some fights), you lack the mana sustain for long fights or for going faster than at a snail's pace. Tanking is more than just surviving being hit... a pally can do that even with the non-existent item support in raids... a dual-wielding tank can do it, a dps warrior with some leather and mail can do it if they put on a shield and drink a stoneshield pot, it is nothing special.
---
Pally tanking is something you do on your holy-prot pally if you're bored or your group can't find a tank for a dungeon. I wouldn't recommend doing it. Source: I did dungeon tanking on my pally back in retail vanilla (later a lot more in TBC) and a little on an alt I had on a private server. It is just too bad for raids.
---
on launch and if you intend to level fast you can probably only make good money on skinning if you level slower you can probably make money on any profession bar engineering. Some good way to make a good buck is to craft wands or quest items like hills man cloak (for alliance) in general look up quests that have a resource that ppl need. grooms blood for warrior berserker axe is a good example but every profession have some item that can be turned in as a quest reward. just remember this will hurt your levelling time it might be faster to grind at level 39 on mobs that have good grey drops and that you can skin for heavy leather
---
Is there a list out there? Tried looking, couldn’t find it.

It legit doesn’t matter for 5 man content. We had voidwalkers tanking that shit. Hunter bears tanking that shit. Ret paladins with a shield tanking that shit. Ubrs be a little different so idk maybe. But it wouldn’t surprise me if they could.
---
No, my character is also named Thex
---
 10/10 guide would recommend
---
Not the GM set but for sure is the alliance mail blue set
---
Warlocks will be so saturated.. warlocks in Vanilla were not rare but not popular either. 
---
I'm playing warlock as it was my first class ever picked.
---
Are they gonna be all male?
---
Mages have better options for AoE grinding which is far faster. As far as profit goes, it's been 13 years since I've played a mage but I do remember having a big bank roll from just cloth alone. Mages will always be faster than rogues regardless of spec. 
---
No rested other than the occasional server crash or stepping into an inn for 5 minutes. If you want to do it rested you just cut the time in half but it takes like 2 weeks of rest for every 4 levels. By then you can just use your main to bankroll an alt to get boosted through dungeons honestly.
---
Raid or dungeon?
---
In raid phase#1, if you go above and beyond with gear and potion you can do good dps. I've seen between 450-500dps, but this will depend on the coding of Mind Flay and if it gets pushed off.
---
??? Please give me examples of blizzard doing a anything politically like this.
---
I've never played the mythic/heroic raids -- I stopped playing WoW shortly after BC came out, so I've really got no basis for comparison. I just don't remember 40-man raids being 'easy' by any stretch of the imagination. They were a feat of organisation, scouting, learning, and co-operation.
---
I’d love to see Rogue macros too!  Thanks for all the great work - passed them on to mates playing Druid and Warrior.
---
As a life-long protection paladin, yes.
---
Most p servers, from what I hear from others, have warriors at the top, followed by mage and rogues. Something like priests and warlocks next. 
---
I know on retail hunters and druids are very popular but I don’t think it’ll be like that for Classic.
---
Sadly I don’t expect retail will ever return to being an rpg nor an mmo. It will remain an action-instance game, and activision blizzard will keep shamefully extorting money from “whales” (lovely industry term). Best thing we can do is condemn it and be adamant and vocal that that sort of practice and design mentality has no place in Classic.
---
that's a nice joke. The eu wow team has never really done anything
---
I thought you were setting us up for a good rhyme there but you stopped after the first sentence!
---
Yeah, 'cos keeping having 2-3 bags full of shards the whole time is super convenient.
---
You're always gonna be farming them before a raid.
---
Work paying off! Glad it helped you decide that!
---
“Found” some legos in “storage” actually means “busted out my LEGO and made this because classic wow and LEGO are equally awesome”
---
Yes, the answer is always yes.
---
Same here, I was a kid in vanilla though and I was just fascinated with casting fire from my hands haha!
---
It's seriously one of the best things you can do as a caster and it makes your journey to 60 SO much smoother!
---
You are making a good point with both the time invested in professions while leveling may yield less than focusing on leveling to high 30’s and then grind more valuable mobs, as well as focusing on certain mats used for popular leveling recipes. 
---
Which of the gathering skills (besides skinning) are favourable for most leveling recipes?
---
Dude fuck yeah this
---
I feel you.... :(
---
There's zero chance I'm joining a group with a Paladin as tank in UBRS.
---
*appreciated*
---
Warlock downsides:
---
Soul Shards and especially Healthstone production.
---
Paladin downsides:
---
Raid buffing.
---
It is a dumb question. Any of the addon websites will have this guide.
---
I thought dungeon leveling outside of completing the quests was inefficient for Classic, have I been mislead?
---
DR =Armor / (Armor + 400 + 85 * Enemy/Attacker Level)
---
That's the TBC formula... the vanilla formula is: 
---
Great post!
---
The thing that turns me off the most in retail is the min/maxing and GS bullshit in every raid/dungeon.
---
Would be a shame if it carried over to classic.
---
Yes I am also confident that an additional 600 damage every 15 seconds will make a massive difference in Naxx. Those undead will literally go "oh no, not the holy light! I shall crumble to dust!" and drop their epics!
---
Low elo scrub!
---
noo clue who you mean
---
for most quests while levelling at leas early on and on alliance was a long time ago i played horde and i have not research it at all pre classis launch sins i'm going paladin. i'd take mining, if you find an engineer you can make bronze tubes for look to the stars in dark shier and every alliance need silver bars for uldaman quest a lot of players that don't level that fast (melee classes) might try and level whit engineering and you can sell all your stone and most of your or to then.  herbing is good to when you get a bit higher in levels and the already mention warrior quest needs 8 grooms blood you can always sell underwater breathing elixirs and there are some quests for health potions later on in the game if you pair it whit alchemy
---
Yes. But anything over 48 is worth honor at 60. Thats why you kill them.
---
Warlock 4th most picked class?  Man times sure have changed.  I remember being the only lock in 40mans for awhile during vanilla.
---
Maybe but Josh is probably not sticking to Classic
---
Resto shaman neutral in pvp WHAT?
---
Definitely try it, it’s so cheap why not. 
---
Curious.... which way do you sway initially? 
---
Alliance or Horde?
---
He meant in a few weeks, the launch. Not in a few weeks to the launch.
---
That is not doing what OP is requesting. While it shows which stats you have at that level... it is scaling them as if you are level 60.
---
Any class is fine, Hunter levels easiest but it has a high skill cap in Endgame content, Warrior has the hardest time leveling and I wouldn’t recommend tanking your first go around.
---
If I had it name an absolute best for a beginner, I’d probably say mage due to relative ease of play and self reliance, but you can comfortably 1-60 with any class and do just fine.
---
Does King stack? Does Windfury stack? Can multiple Warlocks stack Curse of Elements? Come on newb.
---
Just wanna chime in here about hamstring kiting. Beta players have confirmed that it does not work in WOW Classic because the leeway is too big.
---
Just wondering, do you have a source for "mobs drop more grey items on classic" ? Not that I doubt it but I'm wondering if it has been confirmed anywhere ?
---
Can somoene explain me this joke?
---
I think what OP did solves your proposed problem already. Pressing unmodified 2 for overpower or whirlwind if you are in battle stance or berserker stance, respectively, should work already?
---
Imagine you need 3 hours a day to become rank10 in like 6 weeks. Due to the Decay you can play 3 hours a day for 30 weeks and nothing will  change. To become Rank11 with the same playsty  le you'd need about 5 hours a day to for 15  weeks f.e..
---
That's the difference.
---
next time try a gnome with the TF,would u ? :p
---
This.
---
Whilst counter intuitive, most teams react to problems not solutions - rather than saying „I want x“ say „I would like a way of doing y“.
---
you should be spending your time on consuming products, not being creative!
---
Ok but is mayonnaise  an instrument?
---
Pallies can't taunt, making them a huge liability on the last boss. Also people tend to run UBRS quite quickly and the risk of anyone pulling is increased (harder to herd 9 cats than 4). Paladin tanks struggle hard with keeping up the pace because they use a lot of mana, have a little mana pool and need to drink constantly when a warrior or druid could just keep moving after a quick glance to healer mana.
---
Some peeps like to complain :)
---
It's funny because that episode is a bit of an own goal for you, it shows swedes as being super annoying, PC besserwissers, not far from the truth now is it ;)
---
why not?
---
Is that shovel including a possible digging animation usable everywhere?
---
Yeah but you can sit on assassins blade or pretty much any BiS twink item and mad profit later. Heck, you could use it yourself and increase your leveling rate. There's a few sub 30 blues that are just below pre-raid BiS for some classes, which means you can save money on upgrades till you farm your prebis.
---
When you make assumptions, you reduce your ability to understand the other person and their intent. You lose the ability to ask questions or open yourself up to alternate views. You get on your proverbial high horse and turn it into a ‘I’m right, you’re wrong’ situation because you’re arguing with yourself and creating logical fallacies. Putting it on ‘how I’m coming across’ removes your involvement in the creation of your perception of me entirely. 
---
I had explained previously that I’m a courteous person even to the most solemn. After you ignored that I explained that I know I won’t receive reciprocation and I am polite and courteous regardless. You continued with the assumption and ignored that statement until this comment. It’s very frustrating to be told I’ve presented myself as only courteous when I know there will be reciprocity when I’ve explained that it’s not true and further clarified. 
---
Just because all relationships are reciprocal doesn’t mean you will receive reciprocity. Understanding that is how I’m a courteous person regardless of give and take. You don’t just pretend that reciprocity isn’t a thing in interactions. It is a fact that if you smile and don’t receive one back, that is an unreciprocated action. Your expectations surrounding that fact is what matters, rather than just blind mental perseverance. It’s mental understanding that I’m touting here, versus just mental perseverance. 
---
Have you ever heard of cup filling? It’s understanding your needs and ensuring that there’s a flow in giving and taking in order to meet those needs. There are obviously levels to how much you *should* receive from certain types of people in your life and how much they *should* take from you depending on your relationship to them. If a person views a small loss in reciprocation with a cashier as too mentally strenuous to continue to do, it’s likely that their boundaries are too low and they’re not repairing and filling the cups from which they’re giving. It’s not mental perseverance that counts there, it’s understanding and regulating that does. 
---
(It’s can also be that they’re just as you think, being selfish and/or lazy. But that’s a whole different story which I do think your view of ‘just fucking do it’ could maybe fix.)
---
Well I do have the feeling that visuals &gt; everything else.
---
Thing is, whenever I tell a pvper on discord or else that I want to go human a warrior, I'm getting mocked for not min maxing, and being told that I'm automatically going to be an underdog if I don't go gnome.
---
If I tell pve-ers I might go gnome to pvp here and there, they warn me I'll be a pve underdog.
---
It's so frustrating.
---
I think I'm getting tired of listening to people tell me that x or y race is gonna cost me something, and just go with my initial plan after all.
---
Ya! Let me know what you find! Did that myself and found CN to be better
---
As much as I've found the meme enjoyable the last few days, I'm afraid whatever server I pick is going to be filled with xXx_Thexphiroth_xXx meme names.  Good times though.
---
yep Female Orc rules
---
Great art!
---
Well said.
---
They aren't guaranteed drops, otherwise they wouldn't cost that much, and the main use for the orbs is the Crusader enchant.
---
This is what I’ll be doing as a Warlock:
---
Get mining/skinning, bank the ores for engineering later and vendor all the skins, aswell as banking excess cloth (need to level first aid aswell).
---
Then when I have skinned the dragonscale skins (can’t remember the exact name?) for my epic mount quest, I will drop skinning for tailoring.
---
If I need any of the shadoweave set before this I will buy it from the AH.
---
At 60 I will drop mining for engineering.
---
Nice! Did you use any special program to create this? I'm thinking about making a Horde/Alliance one but no idea where to start.
---
I will be rolling a human warrior tank on a PvP EU realm
---
OP should re texture classic!
---
There was actually an addon for that. Can’t remember the name though. :D
---
Technically there are.
---
The intros to each starting area do an in game fly over with voice overs.
---
Nah, rather smash it during the day hours than mess up my sleep pattern from day 1
---
Hey man, good stuff!
---
I'll give it a try at release. 
---
Just one other thing. Can you please tell me which addons you're using?
---
yeah, again, I
---
I honestly can't remember how long it takes for brokentooth to spawn-I can imagine though that it will a highly contested pet, not only with other hunters but with others griefing you by deciding to kill him for the fun of it.
---
Pet management is not as intimidating as you may think-a freshly tamed pet sucks as you will have to feed it quite often but it gets easier as loyalty increases.
---
If you're not sure you'll be playing a lot, just join a more casual guild that will not be so tight-ass about specs.
---
Remember, all the content in the first phew phases can be casually raided in any spec.
---
There will be plenty of great guilds who are always looking for cool people who will show up.
---
Hi I'm getting 160ms ping on Oceana  and 150 on US(West). I think its decent and playable. how ever i cant ping the taiwan and korea IP. I think ill go play in US WEST &lt;3
---
Didn't gnomes have the flying gyrocopter things or is that wc2 or are those dwarven too.
---
You keep a spirit set in the bag and switch inbetween fights, any other way should be slower
---
Respeccing in Vanilla wasn't really something you did often. You wouldn't be able to frequently go from ELE PVP to healing raids every day,
---
I'm planning on using the stress test for setting up addons for the newbies I'll be playing with. Knowing this will save me a bit of googling, so thanks for that!
---
I just looked at a picture and took some time. Felt kinda of like working on a big table puzzle.
---
Really it's probably very worth having an equipment addon while levelling and have set of spirit heavy pieces you switch to out of combat (can even be cloth or a staff), and then have another hotkey to switch back to combat gear that is all str/agi.
---
farming 3 mcps per boss during progression must suck so bad....
---
The flip side to that is when someone asks if they can roll on an off-role item you should actually say if you don't want them to. 
---
I once was in SFK on a Pally in a dps role. A shield dropped and I asked if I could roll on it for my tanking set. Only the warrior said anything and it was a single word "dude".  
---
I waiting for more response but got nothing so I rolled and won and then the warrior went mental at me.
---
I thought if commands don't work on classic?
---
To be fair there is a chance the audience for the game has changed somewhat during the last decade.
---
lmfao u silly boi
---
It still amazes me that so many people are going to play warrior, more than half will give up. Leveling was not easy or fun.
---
Why are you all ruining it for yourself. Play without addons! It is so easy. The way is the goal not to reach something. Again you will be leaving within 4 month because nobody admires xout uberskills. Sorry that this is written here bit all these posts cocnerning addons kill my mood. Sorry.
---
Yes its worth playing, its just something special about those first few weeks of Learning the game, i wish i could go back and re-do it all.
---
Lol
---
Raiding guilds wont get many hybrids cause you steal bis pieces from other dps classes and generate drama.
---
Warlock is so abnormally high because this poll was posted under a lengthy class picking guide video where Warlock was the first class featured for almost 10 minutes. This created a bias in the data set.
---
lol
---
Yes.
---
That's great actually. It means less competition for raid spots for the rest of us.
---
If that feral druid is very tryhard. Which he likely won't be in less serious guilds. A feral druid that doesn't tryhard isn't good.
---
Sort of. I would happily take the living root early if I got a chance, and keep it in my bags until I found some replacement of at least 12 spirit. 
---
But fundamentally, rage is very important and MOST of your rage comes from autos. The difference between a warrior that can afford to use his abilities and one that cannot is night and day, and that means you need to actually do white damage. 
---
Beyond that, warrior is fundamentally not a single target spec while leveling. It's important to be powerful enough to use your core rotation: you build rage in an easy fight, you come into a hard fight with both lots of rage and lots of health, and then you comfortably win that fight and then you eat. 
---
This means you really don't want to eat more than once every 4 mobs, or out of combat rage decay eats your lunch. (2 to build rage while still using your abilities, then 2 at the same time to blow all your rage on). 
---
Simple fact is, if you fall off the gear cliff, your 4 mob cycle breaks down and you start to really struggle. You need more rage banked to actually fight 2 mobs (and you CAN cap on rage easily), you can eat to come in with full health but then you are losing 5-10 rage to absolutely nothing every cycle and spending a lot of money eating twice as much food. 
---
I would definitely prioritize my fighting set, and only get a couple pieces (and therefore a couple inventory slots) devoted to a spirit set to use while eating.
---
a living root while eating is not small. I haven't done the math, but I suspect a living root while eating  is probably something like 4 seconds every long food break. If you are eating every ~2 minutes,  It adds up. It won't save you any food, it won't kill anything faster, it won't let you fight harder mobs. But 4 seconds out of every 120 is pretty good for one inventory slot. Like "oh, you play the game 3% faster". 
---
But that's a super premium spirit item that you are lucky to have, and it still takes up an inventory slot. It's not some +3 spirit at level 25 vendortrash.
---
Holy crap, dude.
---
Horde scum
---
I would note.... Mograine's Might is just a higher level item. By 4 levels. It's expected to be pretty competitive to just be using an item of the same rarity that is 4 levels higher. 
---
I talked about spirit a bit in another post, but to talk about weapon speed: it's pretty big while solo or group leveling. Cleave is incredibly important to both: when you sweeping strikes, you are down 30 rage. So you AT MOST, have 70 rage to play with, and in practice it's likely a lot less. 
---
Every one of those sweeping strikes hits that is a cleave will give you 4 autoattacks and, at 40, about 72 bonus damage. 
---
Every one of those SS hits that is not will give you 2 autos and no bonus damage. that's a BIG difference. Every second that you continue to have rage, you do more than twice as much dps? AND how long your rage holds out is inversely proportional to your weapon speed? 
---
In addition, with a very fast weapon like Mograine's Might, you can actually use all your sweeping strikes hits and then have a lot of time left over, which is kind of a big deal as then all the attack power that you have is spending time NOT being invested in sweeping strikes, which doubles your dps, but in your regular attacks, which does not double your dps. 
---
I would happily CARRY Mograine's might if I had whirlwind axe, but I sure wouldn't use it in combat. even though it's a substantially higher level weapon of the same rarity. If it were 7-8 levels higher? sure, I might use it, but a 8 level gap for a warrior is absolutely huge in terms of weapon quality. That's like "do you even have a progression plan? ".
---
Imo I recon a paladin + warrior combo would be near enough unstoppable
---
their
---
I thought it'd be so cheesy but the toast to Rag Nef C'thun and KT most part hit me so damn hard.
---
What a T3 parody
---
Before level 10
---
we were rare as hell on classic for a reason ;) , i think ppl will try it expecting a "different" warlock.
---
Although I can't answer your question directly- All addon information and setup is client-side. So theoretically if you can get everything how you'd want it to be on the stress test, then you can just copy+paste your addon folder over and things should hold.
---
Oceanic for timezones. If you are primarily anglophone I'm sure some aussie/kiwi guild will take you in for sure
---
If your raid needs it you could always use mana tide in phase 1-2 and respec to ele later on. You aren't going to be blowing people up anyway without good gear.
---
In reality guilds always need more healers and shamans are in high demand, you can get away with 30/0/21
---
Don't be too afraid of respec costs either. You don't need to respec twice a week. If your guild asks for mana tide on progression just go resto for a few weeks then back to ele when you have the raid on farm.
---
I didn't reach L60 until TBC dropped so once my Feral druid was L70 I did insane planning for my BiS pre-raid tank items. It was worth it because I knew I'd have no time for raiding so if I was going to be a good tank for Heroics.
---
tbh, if you want an easy class to heal, i'd deff go paladin. 
---
Buff when needed, and 99% of the time its just flash of light spam. Later on you can even completely ignore your mana pool
---
You basically hit the nail on the head, the advantage of warrior + pally is that they are both in plate and as a team much harder to kill, whereas the warrior hints like a truck when he has windfury, so more burst (with a little rng)
---
Another extremely effective combo is warrior + resto druid, as the druids mobility makes it hard to kill
---
No
---
Yeah just copy your WTF file over when classic launches
---
We really don't know for sure and don't call me Shirley
---
Good one. Still waiting for any actual numbers you have to back this up.
---
Was wondering if anyone would notice that lol thanks
---
Yeah best combo out there
---
thanks!
---
Well it depends do you want bloodlust or not.
---
throughout most of vanilla the faction balance was pretty good, there were some servers with moderate unbalance resulting in 10-20 minute queues for most BG's, and a few servers had 30 min-1 h queues towards the end due to some servers attracting high end pvp players who mostly played horde.
---
resto leveling not poop? really?
---
I hope not, but it was added in the later patches of vanilla, with a cooldown of several months though iirc.  
---
so it's a possibillity that there will be paid character transfers between servers, I really hope that it is not implemented at all though and if it is it'll be with a 6-month cooldown period.
---
Out of curiosity, were you applying to loot council guilds? Or were they DKP guilds using some sort of reserve system? I haven't really looked around yet, but I am curious as to how these preferences are being enforced.
---
I think the best choice would be Paladin next!
---
I don't know, everything was so down to earth I guess. There's an atmosphere about it.
---
Gear is recognizable
---
Everyone is on the ground
---
Culture can form
---
More things than end game and dungeon content require grouping up
---
Game imbalance and weird mechanics create memories
---
PvP feels like life or death instead of bullet sponging
---
More manageable stats and dps/hps numbers without stat squishes so levels actually feel like something
---
Having to travel places means things can happen on the way, and quests/bi-level trainer visits make you travel, a lot
---
Money has meaning, work pays off, goals can be worked at and RNG plays a lot less with the game
---
Non-standardized everything
---
Dungeons and raids require attunement and travel instead of braindead iLvl checks and teleportation after a queue in a hud
---
Weapon skill, old school stats like spirit and +hit
---
Old school talents, mixing and matching instead of talent tree lock-ins
---
Weird gear and weapons for weird and wacky results 
---
Godf*ckingdamn I am so ready for classic.
---
auto-attacking intensifies
---
Sly verified this on staysafes classic top guild summit; he said they were lacking paladins and druids.. interesting
---
On a 1-10 scale 5 and 6 would be average.
---
you probably won't even see the opposite faction during phase 1
---
Yeah, that’s what it says in the picture aswell
---
No bloodlust in classic
---
It’s the Authenticator code. You seem to have linked an authenticator (either a hardware token or an app on your phone) to your account.
---
Undercity was always my favourite city. All the green slime, the abdominations and the music. Amazing!
---
That's perfect!! More targets in wPvP and shorter queues to BGs :) yes yes, roll horde, good choice:P
---
I mean, a sample size of 40k + 14k from two different surveys, spread out over different platforms are a far better indicator of these numbers than your personal predictions.
---
I love these.
---
Name checks out.
---
Where see these stats?
---
None of those items listed are soulshards. I mained a warlock in vanilla through to BC and they weren't a conjured item and definitely persisted through logouts.
---
Looks like I'm buying 2 cards for two of my closest friends. They're more into fast action paced competitive games like League, CsGo OW but hopefully the launch and community of Classic lures them in long term. I'll be reserving a name for each of them on the 12th and send a picture to get the idea planted in their head
---
If anything I see it as a $30 investment for me to have IRL friends play with me which will be so much more fun since we can have lan parties or regular discussions, planned events, etc. They'll most likely pay me back on venmo anyway lol
---
Any idea which is the fastest?
---
If you skip lots of mobs you will fall below the expected level of the area.
---
You can compensate for this by jumping to another zone with the same level as where you were and do more quests there, or dungeons.
---
The last levels are literally just grinding mobs for xp so yeah
---
Holy shit i forgot this was a thing lol.  Thank you.
---
Yes got confirmed in an interview
---
been playing since beta, 9 years on private realms, raided everything and I concur completely.
---
k, roll ret and see how it goes.
---
Incorrect. None of the items listed are soulshards but items made from soulshards. I mained a warlock vanilla through to WotLK and they persisted through logouts.
---
A large portion of the quests require you to kill X amount of mobs. You definitely have an advantage on some quests due to stealth, but a certain amount of grinding is required to level.
---
Man life must be tough for you to be be so tryhard over a PvE easy game.
---
I added the import function just in time so that you can test it out with any written guides you have during the upcoming stress test.
---
If you have questions or run into problems importing your guides or are generally interested in the addon feel free to join the discord:  [https://discord.gg/qrbSPz](https://discord.gg/qrbSPz)
---
The addon can be started in the bfa client (even without a sub) and you can try to import guides there.
---
My plan is to do some quests and grind either on the way or in a specific timeslot. So I can sneak behind any questmob and do the grind stuff while farming leather/ore/herbs.
---
I mean, check basically every poll on this sub. Every single poll here has Warlocks really high.
---
Wands wasnt as OP in the release of vanilla. They got buffed later. But yea, I sucked also. Pooped all mana and had to drink after 3 mobs.
---
Sure, if you don't like puzzles amd want to be handheld through content. At the very least you could be sociable and talk to others in-game about any trouble you are encountering. Guides just seem so lazy and cheap to me.
---
I'm not disappointed at all. I get to play Classic with no Blood Elves. And Ion has already stated adding "new" content to an "alternative reality" Classic is not going to happen, would completely destroy the spirit of the game.
---
Are you disappointed? I do hope you can cope.
---
Less competition for lock specific gear, seems like a win to me.
---
Where did you find this? The site I've been always using for class population says something different.
---
We will funnel all linen to one guy in the guild that will lvl tailor/ench. Gonna be our wand bitch.
---
Thex the Troll Shaman, what else?
---
Can confirm.
---
This looks really cool :) I can see this getting used to spread personal guides as well
---
Yes
---
Man I mained a warlock back in vanilla BC and WotLK and this time I wanted to give mage a go but damn you're making it hard :(
---
Whats wrong with resto shaman in pvp?
---
Because making friends is easy. People in real life are dicks.
---
Thanks you! Glad to get actual feedback like this 👍 I totally agree with what you said. For some reason we recorded most of the lines over a discord call which made the audio sound even worse than it would have if we had just done it normally. I think it's cause my one friend doesn't know how to record audio and is unwilling to learn how. And for the visuals, there were so many little things that I really did the worst way possible but slowly through the course of making the video improved on and learned from so  future videos will definitely be better. Also I won't be using WMV as heavily, I wanted to familiarize myself with it with this one, but I prefer mostly ingame machinimas anyways. It's the old school way
---
Wow... That was so bad words just cannot do it justice....
---
Correct me if I’m wrong but aren’t these enchanting wands added in a later phase?
---
You paid 60? I paid £12.99 for it, why was yours so much?
---
281-330-8004
---
This doesn't sound right at all
---
Thank you! Just wondering, which voice was it hardest to hear? We made the mistake of recording all our lines over discord plus the female voice actor used a mic
---
Oh cool, I'll take a look and see if it works with mine

You dont need to do this. Just save settings account-wide which is the default anyway.

 📷 [**Patch 1.9.0**](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.9.0) **(03-Jan-2006):** Linked Auction Houses
---
* Auction Houses in Orgrimmar, Undercity, and Thunder Bluff will now share the same pool of Horde player-created auctions, and Alliance players will find the same to be true when visiting Ironforge, Stormwind City, and Darnassus Auction Houses. This system has been expanded to support the neutral Auction Houses as well. Tanaris, Everlook, and Booty Bay will all be linked for players of both factions to access.
---
Maybe you ought to use your premade sign then add a plus or minus or even multiples if it is better than neutral but not good enough for "excels".
---
Warriors largest weakness is root/slows. A paladin giving blessing of freedom makes this a non issue
---
You missed all the good 1s fam, Classic will be a blast if you actually enjoy mmos
---
Wow theres no way youre serious in this discussion 😅
---
8-10 hours per day for 2 weeks from 9-10 - intense!

---
We are waiting _Thexily_, I reckon.
---
Oh shit, please let us know if that works
---
Haha nice! pm me your parser if you like. sounds like we surely could improve both of our parsers by looking at each other's.
---
Yes, it will be a bit laggy in crowded areas but yes
---
Yikes. Probably cause it was signed by Thex. At least thats what ill tell myself now
---
Ah yes, the BitTorrent downloader. Can't say I miss this pile of garbage, but I also can't deny seeing it makes me nostalgic. :p
---
I have the 4 CD installer. That one is the best, let's be honest.
---
Night Elves can do somersaults. If that's not enough of a reason, I don't know what could be.
---
Fair enough
---
Mmm, well, they're based on my recollection from Vanilla as well. I think these aren't too off the mark, tbh, and definitely a 50g cap.
---
Yea, 10 years ago, everyone's dream was to work at Blizzard. Sad how the dynamic has changed
---
Thanks for the answer my dude. Ill be testing your guide on next stress test wih my addon and see how it goes. Playing as warrior so its extra interesting since you provide weap progression
---
I prefer rogue, but the animations aren't as good as undead. Orc female is pretty slick tho.
---
Nelfs have the best racial which allows them to move faster while dead.
---
This is great since you will be doing a lot of corpse runs, as a night elf.
---
For real though play what race you want.
---
i do
---
I see that i cannot read and misstook soulstones for soulshards for some reason
---
As a Hunter you can charge aimed shot from shadowmeld.
---
I would gladldy pay to have my future classic character drawn up! Has she considered doing commissions?
---
Yeah i clearly cannot read and misstook soulstones for soulshards for some reason
---
Don’t worry about min/maxing, it’s a small price to pay to play a character you don’t want to play as. Play what you want, that’s the fun in it.
---
1% dodge IIRC.
---
Not min max, but not too bad.
---
Druids are the quintessential Jack-of-all-trades. Going into character creation, you need to accept that they can do everything fine, but nothing exceptionally. 
---
Even Resto is underwhelming compared to the other 3 healing specs. 
---
Now, don't let this stop you from maining a Druid. What you have to realize is that the vast majority of the player base isn't doing their homework and will still be going off the 14 year old meta, so you may be able to sneak into a guild as a Kitty and no one will be the wiser.
---
Minmaxers minority : No way Warlock and shaman are gonna be played that much / most of them will reroll before lvl 60
---
Casual players with actual rpg taste that don't give a fuck about optimisation : Bruh..
---
They're good at everything. The fact that other races are 1% better doesn't change it.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.11.0 
---
Here you go! 
---
"The cost to unlearn talents will now decay over time. This cost will be reduced by a rate of 5 gold per month to a minimum of 10 gold."
---
So. You're right on the mark of the max cost. But it'll start off higher, it seems.
---
You have so much hit to choose from, both hit and ap have limited value for a tank, while crit is obviously really good.  A general guideline is 1crit equals around 30ap. The 14agi 7sta on dragonbreath beats strikers, since you have too much hit by that point. Ossi xbow beats strikers for both tanks and furys, you also have blastershot, heartstriker etc. If you desperately need hit on your fucking ranged slot, either fix your gear setup or just use satyrs/blackcrow.
---
Or fuck over your rogues and furys.
---
Pandaren ain't an option here dude
---
Haha. Do you know I actually know the exact video you are talking about. 
---
So I made this post. And then a couple hours later on my lunch break I was searching YouTube for classic class vids and ended up finding and watching that Kargoz video and I thought to myself that it was the exact same almost word for word. It was really weird. I’d never even heard of Kargoz until  then.
---
Why skip stress test and name reservation, those cause immense hype.
---
Most warriors would seppuku if they were forced to level paladins in vanilla.
---
Dwarves being unable to roll Shaman in Classic is the real weird thing.
---
I know that you play as IF Dwarves, but there were Aerie(?) Dwarvern shamans in the WC2 era iirc.
---
I'm pretty sure motw, brez and innervate are appreciated.
---
I don't get why people say that classic will die in 2-3 months, if that were so there would be no pserver community keeping the dream alive. I can't wait to finally log into classic like a whole new game all over again.
---
It breaks on cast, not on finish though in the version classic will be.
---
Yeah, I'm definitely aware of that and I can totally accept that, if I can do everything fine, anyway. My concern is moreso if druids are still "fine" at those things once Naxx comes around. I always hear that mages, warlocks, warriors, and rogues scale like crazy when they get Naxx gear, and I hear that druids do not, due to poor itemization options in there for them.
---
I can deal with being "fine" at everything in a pvp-context, I'd rather pick something else if that "fine" turns into "relatively pretty bad" once most people are in really high-end stuff. That's the main concern for me.
---
Hell yea brother cheers from Thunderbluff.
---
I know, my wife gonna be so sex starved, can't wait.
---
not everyone wants what you want
---
You get better stealth (if only slightly), which is actually helpful when you're scouting in stealth (distance to be detected). When you throw in stealth to cloak, darkmantle boots (etc.) it becomes exceptionally hard to pick you up. For Rogues at least, being 'found' is devastating and Druids get stealth detection on their PvP gloves (as well as the ability to faerie fire you, which is essentially an 'i-win' button for druids since you can't vanish after that).
---
Hahaha! 
---
Yes I will still play NE, for Elune.
---
This isnt tied to leveling but it did happen before i capped. Also didnt happen in classic but tbc. The patch had just come out that made it so mounts were available at 30 instead of 40, and my paladin had just hit 30 the night before. So I was super happy and went to the trainer in goldshire to buy my mount summon ability. 
---
People in general chat were talking about a group f horde players hanging around goldshire so i went out to look for them. A few max level (i assume in hindsight) hordes came into goldshire and they started fighting other max level alliance players. I was a noob so i attacked and got one shot. Multiple times. Then I ran away. 
---
At this point the horde had also left the direct goldshire area and people in general were talking about tracking them down and finding them. So i went and did my duty and went into the forest to look for these guys. There I found a blood elf paladin who was also lvl 30, also riding around on his newly aquired mount. For a moment i thought i would alert people but i decided not to and did some emotes at him, like wave and such. Also a lot of /me emotes because I didnt realize those didnt work across factions. He was hiding in one of the many little houses in elwynn forest and i sat there with him for a while. Then he started heading home and I went with him. i had no idea where he was going of course but the next hour of so was us going from elwynn trough darkshire , STV (where he got ganked for a while unfortunately) and then with the boat to the barrens. He led me up one of those mountains and waved goodbye and logged off. I will never forget that.
---
As for favorite music , its the human tavern theme
---
you can be the first one! \#Remindme 20 days
---
Shadow meld is great for dropping Agro. Also Night Elves look cool AF.
---
Can you drop the quest from the quest log and still retain the rod?
---
Thankfully
---
No you can't, it breaks stealth at the start of the cast.
---
Go Human
---
+ Free-Action-Potions do everything that escape artist does (and more).
---
+ Perception lets you open (charge) Rogues/Druids in stealth, and vanilla/classic Rogues are exceptionally weak without their openers (no shiv, no deadly throw, no cloak of shadows).
---
Hmmmmm
---
If you're admitting you were a noob 12 years ago
---
Maybe you're the loser
---
 &gt;It is very difficult to play the 15th level in the barren land.
---
Thankyou Google Translate for giving us the most poetic description of the Barrens ever.
---
Yeah, this is a good idea to have. I think OP is worried that people will get so far ahead of them that they won't be relevant. Which people will.
---
But that doesn't mean OP's gameplay won't be relevant.
---
Stop it!
---
You can't cast it in combat.
---
Perhaps, but if you make a video mashup of times you win that lottery, you could become a legend.
---
Indeed, one of the most disappointing points of wow was when they added pandas. I liked all the leveling zones, but pandas really?
---
Can’t meld in combate though, right?
---
Welcome back fellow veteran, FOR THE HORDE
---
I bet you're a ton of fun at parties.
---
A horde without blood elves or paladins, I guess dreams do occasionally come true.
---
I guess it’s gonna be different in classic then. I meld in bfa all the time after riding through mobs I don’t want to fight. I jump off my mount and meld.
---
https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/c/community/classic-discussion
---
Not in Vanilla (as far as I remember).
---
You could later on in TBC (and in Cata they removed/changed the quest entirely). If you're really worried about that single item slot in your bags then just drop the quest and pick it back up at 60. Honestly though the novelty of being Furbolg form at pretty much any time you want far outweighs the loss of a single bag/quest slot.
---
&gt;The difference between my method and OP, is that I've had 3 keys bound to the stances, and then had for instance: Execute/Disarm/Execute bound for the tree. For me these macros make a lot of sense, because they are similar enough that relearning wouldn't impose a lot of trouble for me I think.
---
Yep that's a far better method imho. I have done the same as you, based on this handy visual guide:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bpv9vo/handy_visual_for_warriors_might_help_setting_up/
---
Regarding your question, I thought you would need 2 keypresses too, but maybe that's our retail brains screwing with us. OP seems to suggest that only one keypress is required, because Stances are not on the GCD. If we break down and isolate the Overpower part of his macro, he suggests that shift+2 does
---
    /use [mod:shift]Battle Stance
---
    /use [stance:1]Overpower
---
and uses Overpower in 1 keypress. If that's true, then the same 1-keypress effect can be gained by the example I used in the first comment
---
    /use [nostance:1]Battle Stance
---
    /use Overpower
---
The only thing that saved was my keybinds, so I don’t know about all this default nonsense.
---
Yes a lot of things differ from BFA
---
And you'd think private server players would know what they're in for. But yeah.
---
If you think they're gonna layer by faction you're sorely mistaken.
---
The only real down sides to warrior/paladin are: sharing gear types, and being the two most boring levelers. Other than that, its golden.
---
Nefarian should only do class calls for classes actually in the raid, so no you can't. Maybe it'll be bugged and he'll just do random ones but I wouldn't count on it.
---
You’re thinking of a healer, the warlock is the most farm heavy class in the game
---
they are good at hiding
---
 My alt was a gnome rogue. A lot of power in a tiny frame. Escape artist was handy at times, but taking advantage of the clickers in bgs was the true treat.
---
Isn't this whole guide invalidated if enough people actually follow it? Since you would be competing against each other for the same spawns... Seems counter intuitive for a "guide" no?
---
Thanks!  I'm more worried about a quest taking up a spot in the quest log.
---
I honestly dont get the point in using a 10-point number rating if the OP just doesn't go below 5, and everything is between a 6-8 overall. 
---
This guide isnt comprehensive, it isbt in-depth, its basic and just parrots anything anyone has ever read about a class on this subreddit.
---
Hah, oversight on my part. I was focusing on looking at the numbers.
---
Lock is primo suprimo numbero uno when it comes to dps throughout raid tiers. You will always be wanted
---
Hey friend. There are guilds out there (like mine) that would love to take on new players. In fact, I encourage it. With enough guildmates you'll never be "steamrolled". We will be there by your side.
---
A knowledgable ret Paly does decent numbers, looking at a p-server raid logs for MC, every DPS Paly I saw was keeping up with the mid to lower numbers of pure dps classes. Is it the best? No, but you won't have the luxury of benching every DPS that doesn't pull the max numbers they can and if the Paladin can keep up with them, is it fair to cut the Paladin? The Paly can bring healing gear and heal fairly well during fights where you actually need extra healers or dispellers, and I can guarantee unless you are in a speedrunning/hardcore guild or your guild pays for respecs every raid there are going to be healers outside of healing specs anyway with or without your knowledge.

Upvote for 'LEGO' and not 'Legos'

I dont care one or the other about the wpvp, but jungle zones are dope. The Kurzen army with their Apocalypse Now theme blew me away back when. Highly recommended movie fyi.
---
They're the best druids on alliance!!
---
No, you don't.
---
Yes, of course.
---
They are best at corpse running.
---
You really can't trust any "guide" made with private server stats.
---
I dont know what you mean? Are you saying your addons got deleted? Seems like a problem on your end.
---
The fact that he didn't say OMEGALUL lets him win that argument by default.
---
Just have a spirit set man. Slap it on inbetween combats to regen, make sure you get AAe much stam on it as well so you don't lose too much hp when swapping back, 'of the whale' is what you are looking for.
---
I'm sure there will be an itemrack/outfitter mod that will allow you to swap at the click of a button.
---
I remember doing a run of Maraudon back in vanilla with a shaman tanking when we couldn't find a "real" tank. Was a bit slower but still fun running an unorthodox group.
---
Luke, 4weird man...
---
Ah, I see you too are a man of culture.

Auctioneer.

1). OP said Horde races, Pandaren count.
---
2). Nobody has to care about another person's opinion.
---
For PvP they are bis for druids and hunter, and equally good for dagger rogues.
---
It was, until they patched it out.
---
+ Once upon a time, you could even shadowmeld hearthstone (without breaking meld)
---
+ In the patch version classic will be, you can't.
---
+ You can still (finish cast before break) with the invisibility trinket though (apparently).
---
Thanks for all the replies. I will be playing alliance on ocianic.

What are the pots in your main bag in your first consumables screenshot?
---
Do you think it will be worth trying to farm reaper plans in classic? What gear level is needed to solo him?
---
They were really kinda shoehorned into the frozen throne expansion though.  Didn't really get all that much lore it was basically "here's a bunch of new heroes,  one of them is a talking panda!".

Yeah thats nice an all...just as long as you stay away from da voodoo mon.
---
I play on pservers and let me tell you, the vast majority of people are still shit at the game. People have always been shit at wow, it's not really a game that pushes you to improve yourself. I'm in one of the best guilds on the pserver I play and I still see people backpedalling/keyboard turning. Dying to the easiest boss mechanics. 
---
And that's not even talking about pvp. In wPvP, about half the people I fight (usually over a farm spot) literally just give up instantly and let themselves get killed. Of those who actually try to fight back, maybe 5% actually have any idea of what they're doing.
---
PvE orc for Bloodfury. PvP is a tossup between orc for stun resist and undead for fear break.
---
While leveling a lot more of your damage comes from white hits.
---
When you are under geared you dont have the same rage generation, so you cant spam abilities like you do in raids.
---
Easily the stealthiest of rogues, in three years I never saw even one.
---
Idk why people are downvoting you. I thought it was a good joke.
---
Are these in any way inspired by the Spirit Island cards?
---
Also, why are you a NE priest and a dude?
---
UC was always my choice, even while leveling 1-40. It gives you the quickest access to SFK and SM, which can be farmed and done over many times both for quests, specific items and exp in general. It also allows you to go to either Booty Bae or Org in less than 5 minutes as long as you get lucky on the zepp timing.
---
Otherwise the aesthetics, the music, the ambience... *It just works*.
---
ele lvls faster at 40+ compared to enhance
---
Stop trying to be reasonable. If the elitist don't make fun of the casuals for being bad, and if the casuals don't make fun of the elitist for try harding. Then what will we talk about on Reddit?

---
Almost more mayo's than paladins.

#\#Sad but true
---
Classic is a very simple game. In PvP, specifically, if I played retail right now, I'd get hard stomped by everyone, probably. In Classic, every class has maybe 2-3 spells that you need to play around and you're already better than 95% of the playerbase. The learning curve is not very steep. I still struggle to understand why so many players are so bad at the game, honestly. My best guess is that most people play wow with at least one hand down their pants and look at their game screen only once every 10s while binging Netflix or something. There's just no other rational explanation.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; In PVE have your pet's attack, growl, and recall all keybound. You will have so many freaking keybinds with hunter you might want to consider a programmable keyboard or a hand-pad/foot-pad type setup. Get good at macros. I think I had something like 54 abilities?
---
Finally a good reason for a flight setup lmao.
---
You can get them straight away.
---
Everyone I’ve seen talk about it suggests copying you WTF folder and saving it. Others seem to be saying you don’t have to. For the literal 2 seconds this takes to do and the potential time save if wrong, I’ll be doing this.

Worst case I delete a folder later which takes another 2 seconds.

Maybe Mr T hacked the world of Warcraft and created a mohawk class. Maybe Mr T is pretty handy with computers. Has that ever occurred to you Mr condescending director!
---
Yes which compared to the ones added on the ring around the AH's in a later patch is a mission
---
I guess I never got the relic so I had to drag all 4 around with me until they changed it
---
Yes it does.
---
Once you have other sources of hit (Accura, Onslaught, etc) the 14 Agi and 7 Stam from Dragonbreath is more stat value on an item.
---
The AP is less valuable because it doesn't bring anything else to the table. If it was STR you would at least get block value.
---
1% hit and 22 AP is roughly 17-18 stat points worth of value.
---
Dragonbreath is 21, giving you 0.7% crit, 0.7% dodge and 70 HP

I’ll be honest. As a newcomer to the game, it’s a little daunting that it’s required to be good at all. Something to learn, of course, but still a little intimidating.
---
in 4 months I've changed what class I'll play 3 times
---
A lot of quests involve killing mobs. If you can sneak part mobs to reach an objective I would only do it if they mobs are more dangerous than usual to kill.
---
In a perfect world you are always fighting, even when moving from A to B!
---
there's no way of knowing, and all the servers will get messed up at phase 2 again anyway so no reason to worry over it for launch
---
Then explain it.
---
Yeah fair enough. If you're Horde on an Oceanic server, there's a chance we could be warlockin' it up together.
---
It's amazing how much you made yourself look like an idiot and a douche bag in one comment.
---
Hey, good to know but therefore I need a chinese blizz Account which requires to have a chinese ID as far as I know....which I don’t have 😅
---
I got a vip vpn and will just see how it will work out. Doing q and low level dungeons should be fine. Takes time to get to 60 anyways :)
---
Haha, it wasn’t intentional, but autocorrect did me a solid on this occasion
---
It's not hating it's just the truth, but nobody prevent you from having fun with enhance if that's what you love to do.
---
First thing I do When I reach the new hub is level fishing cooking And First aid
---
Do it on your Warrior at least (if only so you can fish up the ZG boss and not have to worry that no-one can fish it up).
---
Fishing is a time-sink that (if you intend to level it) you'll need to get done eventually. It just so happens that you can make quite a bit on the AH if you're first-in this time around.
---
Lmao 10%. At this point your just making shit up. And for the % to be relevant you’d need the human/gnome to be equally geared and playing the fight exactly the same using the cd’s at the same time etc.
---
Stop spreading this shit. You can do fine on any race tanking every raid. Just know your shit
---
I feel like even with macros, even with an addon custom tailored for it, it's not super fun or interesting. In theory it sounds cool to time your shapeshift to get furor right before an energy tick, but, ehhhh?
---
Being feral would just make me wish the debuff limit was raised or removed so I could actually use my bleeds.
---
Or you know, you can also one shot people with ele except it's from any distance and that it's consistent.
---
I think you're incredibly misinformed on how layers are going to work...

Lmao ❤️

Speaking of First Aid, I always find it awkward on something like Warlock or Priest where its useful, but clashes with tailoring which you may also want.
---
why?
---
Dude you answered your own question. If you hate gnome melee animations dont play it. Imagine investing 300+ hours into something and hate how it looks?
---
Go human and buy a lot of free action potions.
---
SFK multiple times is the biggest waste of time lmao. 
---
Meteor shard and robes of arugal, biggest noob traps in the game, simply not worth the effort.
---
sorry never played classic.
---
nope, it always turns out like this
---
Doesn't the normalization in classic only affect the attack power bonus calculation in the damage numbers of instant abilities? Still making slower weapons hit harder? Either way, ww axe is huge, ww sword is tiny, easy peasy
---
Did the characters have the same name?
---
Nobody going to mention the frontflips?
---
How would you know? The game isn't even out yet
---
False. As long as loot distribution is done fairly, you won't cause drama.
---
By that logic you should halve the numbers of the other classes to find out the amount per faction, not add shaman and paladin numbers together. 
---
People who picked Paladins are playing Paladins, not Pally and Shaman, the faction shouldn’t have anything to do with it.
---
First Aid is way more important to a leveling Warlock than Tailoring. Tailoring is a terrible profession to keep up with while leveling.
---
Paladins is much better against pretty much all matchups except arguably and ironically, warrior+shaman. Some caster/melee or caster/healer comps sham war comes out on top but for the most part BoF &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; windfury. 
---
Also HoJ, a million bubbles and LOH are amazing abilities that shaman can’t really replicate (ankh is good sometimes, shocks are awesome and ele burst is really good against attrition comps) but yeah. Most wpvp matchups favor war pally, and BGs paladins are amazing
---
This will depend on how much work you want to put in. There will be trash Tankadins and there will be Tankadins patting themselves on the back for being passable tanks. Itemization is a huge part of not being trash and deeply understanding mechanics is the other part. You can't taunt, you can't charge, and people will hate you for it.
---
If you are serious about Tankadin and want to be the very best like no one ever was, start with looking at threat generation that doesn't cost mana. Seal of Righteousness is a fantastic ST threat generation tool. Judgement of Wisdom is a fantastic AoE threat generation tool. Both of these are tied to weapon speed. Understanding that Silent Fang, Fiery Plate Gauntlets, and Seal of Righteousness causes higher threat on a Judgement of Wisdom target than a Judgement of Crusader target is something I don't expect average budding Tankadins to know(or want to spend the time learning why). Getting initial threat with abilities then coasting on the Five Second Rule should be the default Tankadin mentality.
---
If you know your stuff and have some threat/avoidance gear you can swap out for the occasion, the only thing left is your reputation. Pug often and show others you are a competent tank in 5 man groups. After a few weeks of networking at your regular log on time, odds are people would be happy to have a good UBRS tank they recognize. If you find yourself tanking UBRS too early(regardless of class), don't be afraid to speak up and admit that; no shame in excusing yourself from a group to come back more geared another day.

fishing no for me, but cooking definitely yes.  Great way to make money (cooked meat vendors for a good profit) as you level, and then once you get to about level 40 the meat you get is very sought after by raiders for the stam/spi buffs or the special ones like hp/5, mp/5 and will sell for a tidy profit on AH or be handy for your own future raiding plans. 
---
Fishing makes better money but I just don't have the patience.
---
not sure how you came up with that wrong idea
---
Sure if the recipes work out that way but what i mean is i wont go out of my way to buy/farm stuff i dont have in order to level cooking

I feel like a lot of people will convert to the official server though. When I tried private servers around the time Classic was announced, a lot of people said they’d never pay for it again, especially when it’s free. I think many of those people will eventually start paying. It comes down to a sense of ownership- whenever I played on a private server I enjoyed getting to around 20-25, and then immediately felt pushback because it could be shut down at any moment. I don’t want to spend 100 hours on a character only to have it deleted without any notice, and then have to do it over again with no assurances. $15 might be high for some people but I also think when people realize that their time is infinitely more valuable it might push them to convert. Plus it’s in Blizzard’s financial interest to double down and close those servers, thereby funneling people into their official Classic.
---
I usually get both once I'm 60. Apparently it can be faster to get an early cooking quest done though.
---
Mountain king is strong enough to compensate tho.
---
ah ok i thought there was some big problem with them late game or something
---
Elemental should have a green check for PvP. Suprised it doesn't.
---
Attack power is attack power. Abilities like mortal strike and heroic strike have a bonus damage to its swings, however only instant abilities is based on the static swing table.
---
There is no other normalization done in classic when it comes to instant abilities :)
---
I could never bring myself to play a jamaican noodle elf, for the forsaken
---
Does Slam then reset the timing of your next auto attack swing?
---
What's your spell crit? Also, thanks for the reply.
---
Blizzard posts and beta testing. You?
---
The barrens oasis wi be my late night fishing spot for my Alliance
---
They’re fairly weak till AQ/Naxx. Very fear dependant, but shit, they’re fun
---
Your disclaimer is true BUT there's no other classes that can use a lot of the mail shaman gear other than an Enh shaman so you'll be near the top of the prio list for anything that drops. 
---
Crown of Destruction of Rag is a good example.  Extremely strong head piece for Enh shaman and no one else can really use it.  Fury warrior taking that would be sad
---
https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=18817
---
Yeah why would someone want to dps a dungeon. Makes no sense.
---
same
---
First thing I heard in my mind. I hear voices
---
When everquest 2 was empty because wow stole my friends. Night elf quest to walk on that branch of the world tree to pick pocket some jerk was too cool.
---
People were tanking ubrs with agi cloth in vanilla. Rogues can duo lots of bosses for the gear as well.
---
Imagine the mage aoe farming to 60 swapping layers to avoid waiting for respawns
---
/cry
---
This is only relevant if you're healing a tank, otherwise you won't often be casting a HW on the same target repeatedly.
---
Yeah it is such asinine argument. By design it is literally build for longevity, and due to not being patch focused has more content than retail. It also has a track record like no other game i can think of, being played continuously for over a decade despite a lack of official support.
---
Mage and priest still benefit from the stam and spirit buffs, possibly more than rogues or warriors. Also, if the Sagefish recipes are in game, that will be a huge win for priests in their 30s while leveling.
---
Oh he would lol
---
yes to all above
---
I think it was just the progression aspect, but not quite sure. Prior to classic WoW, I played a lot of Runescape, along with some other random games prior to that (especially Diablo II). But once I tried WoW, I dropped RS pretty quick, and stuck with WoW heavily up until mid/late Cata.
---
Serious question: how do people keep these mousepads clean? Can you toss them into the wash?
---
Dagger rogue seal fate build works. It is burstier but has less sustained dps. In pvp, being more bursty is often where it's at, except against platform classes and bear druids.
---
Hi, /u/AmpuGandT

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/clixfu/is_there_a_resource_which_shows_the_different/). 
---
meditation is provably beneficial but you dont need more than a few minutes, anything beyond that is a waste of time in my opinion.  some people just have more active and anxious brains, and actively trying to stop thinking causes more anxiety.  saying "there's something very wrong" is making that even worse lol
---
Spell crit isn't great because I only came to this spec recently.  I'm at about 10%.  But the buff lasts awhile and you do a shock on cooldown, so you end up getting decent uptime.  Definitely have better uptime on trash fights than bosses, but if you want you can start a boss fight with a r1 lightning bolt to fish for another opportunity to have a spell crit. 
---
If I farm a lot more I want to get a few of the tier 2.5 pieces from AQ as it has both spell crit and melee crit.  Woohoo
---
Yeah it definitely cemented the downfall for sure
---
Kek
---
5mans: absolutely. The skill/effort floor is pretty high, but once you get there, you can basically pretend it's wotlk and aoe everything down.
---
UBRS: Not having a taunt makes Drakk virtually untankable for a paladin. You could probably find some janky strat to make it work, but is it worth the effort?
---
----------------------
---
Generally, Protection Paladins have the following issues:
---
1. Running out of mana.
---
2. Lack of endgame gear.
---
3. Lack of single-target threat.
---
4. Lack of a taunt.
---
1 is easily managed through some gold investement and the fantastic blue Deathbone set. Proper seal usage and situational downranking doesn't hurt either.
---
2 is a massive problem for raids, but not relevant in dungeons.
---
3 can occasionally be annoying, but is doable. Fantastic aoethreat compensates, especially if you instruct your dps to focus on aoeing or tab-targeting. Lack of single target TPS is a problem in raids, though. Even warriors tend to struggle without special threat sets and specs.
---
4 Aaand we get to the big one. This is the reasons protection paladins cannot reliably tank anything else than 5mans and trash mobs. Even ignoring boss mechanics that require a taunt, wiping as soon as someone outthreats you (which WILL happen, see #3) is simply too much.
---
When you run into UC for the first time, you sit on that damn throne and make a screenshot or I don't want to have anything to do with you!
---
TIL
---
this is the perfect time to start playing. at best, it's a representative experience of what made the game so popular in the first place. at worst, you don't like it and you're out $15bux - you can spend more at McDonalds if you get their fancyburgers.
---
just play, dude. pick a class that sounds cool, pick a race that looks cool, and go. you wanna gank people and be a menace to the other faction? be a rogue on a pvp server. you wanna summon demons and make them run in fear while you kill them? roll a warlock. wanna do your own thing, go innawoods, and explore the world? roll a hunter. it's all good, man, it's all good.
---
this sub will get all caught up in minmaxing but they're wrong. for example the difference between a gnome mage (ie "best choice") and a human mage, in top-tier gear at max level, is being able to cast two more frostbolts before you're out of mana. that's fucking nothing.
---
I really like a grinding leveling guide more than a quest leveling guide, at least for the earlier parts of the game. So kudos.
---
I feel like quest leveling guides are almost useless for the first 15-20 levels, unless Blizz is putting a ton of layers then a lot of quests will be very hard to complete and you'll end up wasting a ton of time. Unless it's a guide that is specifically tailored to the more doable quests when areas are swarmed. But even then you will probably have to improvise a good bit to avoid long waits.
---
I didn't go down the whole list nitpicking but this one early on caught my eye
---
&gt; Giant Grizzled Bears. These mobs die very fast
---
Bears have very high hp and generally take a bit longer to kill than most mobs for melee, so this comment struck me as odd.
---
Vets are going to have a serious advantage on you. Knowledge of the game is a pretty big deal. There really isn't a way to sugar coat this for you.
---
That doesn't mean the game won't be fun for you. You can certainly catch up if you put in the time and effort.
---
This game is made for children. Everything is easy to pick up. You’ll learn more about your class as you go but there is no class that a 10 year old can’t pick up and run with,
---
Nice
---
There's no elves on the Horde (thank fuck), so the populations will be weighted towards the Alliance.

Thex' Skull
---
Have they mentioned a cool down? I mean it's literally the smartest approach to add a 10 or 30 minute cooldown between hops. Which would fix every issue except waiting on friends at that point you can wait 10 damn minutes
---
Bandages exist
---
PVui has one, I am guessing in Classic it will be Elvui or some variation since I guess lots of retail addons will have versions for classic. But that’s a full ui overhaul not sure if that’s what you are wanting.
---
Pretty sure the simple answer is that the Alliance needed another race to be able to be Paladins as Horde had 3 classes that can be Shamans. Lore part is simple to ham fist in later on.
---
Gotcha. Thanks!
---
For me, it's exactly this. My gas bill is $4 a day in winter. I'll pay that to feel warm. 50c a day to have a character in an MMO that will never go away, that's chump change. Fuck, a month subscription costs as much as a pint of beer in some pubs where I live. Fair prices for fair products, it's not hard to value this.
---
The added an internal cold down on it during the beta after folks abused it, they are still fine tuning it so we dont know the exact details
---
Yeah, that’s basically what I’m doing.  Preferably something Horde themed.  Also it must be PvP.
---
When I played on private servers, I saw backpedaling people pulling way to many mobs, people walking into other groups, I didn't see any keyboard turning though.  People are good at reading guide but bad at gameplay.  Some noobs will be generally good at the game and some vets will get rolled. I will be rolled because I didn't invest at ton of time on private servers. 
---
On private servers you are going to be seeing the more hardcore players so I would think you would find more good players then bad on private servers.
---
For true dps classes its not true. For alliance priests, yes its true. Also for all the meme specs it is true, you will have hard time getting into raids.
---
Isn't layering just for the first weeks of levelling?
---
What I've always wondered and never figured out is how to make a simple macro that replaces your currently equipped two-hander with a 1H item X in main hand and 1H item Z in off hand. I can't even find it on google or on forums. 
---
Basically I want to make a macro that swaps my [Two Handed Sword] to [Dagger] in Main hand and [Dirge] in Off hand.
---
There is a stress test next week? Do I need a sub for it?
---
The 5 extra memespecs contribute almost nothing and they still want loot. So im most cases its more efficient to go with 35.
---
Lol the Mormon pallys are my favorite
---
I just get lost in the Undercity until I start screaming at the monitor and HS the hell out of that fcking maze of a city.
---
Accurate.
---
Nope. Impale doesn't affect white hits, which make up the majority of your attacks.
---
All the things you cite vs the level of knowledge and depth of your guide and answers lead me to not believe you.
---
Dont worry, most of the bfa players have same fate. Pserver vets will just roll them over in pve/pvp/economics.
---
Yea, its been like 13 years.
---
So no dueling huh? :D
---
Don’t buy every spell available to you every time you level up, try to pick the most useful ones or you’ll bankrupt yourself fast.
---
Most healing Shamans will be going 30/0/21 the majority of the time. That way they can hold their own and do stuff solo.
---
Yeah that's probably smart, but would have been really cool.
---
LOL you are gonna get steamrolled by the real vets, child.
---
thanks for ignoring the whole point of the post. I know that the alliance needed another healer. Im asking if its explained in lore, goof
---
Yeah I remember using cartograph and having to alt tab for that. I always read the quest first because it was so damn slow to look and alt tab. Gonna use questie for sure
---
I saw my best friend brother playing. I tried it and then it took me about three months of drinking around to then get serious when I saw my first player all decked out. I think it took me three months of weekend only play to get into org.
---
Then I went on to fall in love with the game once I really found out there was end game and what the game was all about.
---
Scatter Shot + trap is better because Undead can break out of Wyvern.
---
We were 13 and one friend of mine whom i played football with told me about one great game he started to play. I sincerely didnt care for about 4 months. One day, i went to his home and he introduced me. We made a druid character and were running around starting zone in teldrassil, looking for a druid trainer for almost 30min. When i came back home, i logged in and continued on my druid. After leaving starting zone, entering teldrassil, i was shocked how big the world is. I could go left, straight or right wow! (It makes me laugh nowadays) i had no idea what to do and had to wait for my friend to help me out. Since then, we were talking about wow basically every single day on practise session for almost a year before i changed a football club one year later which separated us. Here i am 10 years later. The friend of mine doesnt play WoW anymore, he is currently enjoying ozora festival in hungary
---
Right! Gotcha. Thanks
---
So pure.
---
I’m not saying you will definitely have issues but it’s very common for loot drama to start due to people getting items they should probably pass up on. Neither system is perfect I just think if your priority is guild progress it makes more sense to have at least a mix of systems where certain items are given priority to certain specs.
---
Me and my buddy were playing we were like lvl 13-16 somewhere in there. We were at his house dicking around in stonetalon and we jumped a high level alliance and killed him. Then him and his buddy were chasing us around. We turned the corner of the building and hid up against the wall and they went running by us without seeing us. It was like a chase scene from an 80s buddy cop movie. Idk why but i was hooked and that memory has stayed with me all this time. We were so fucking stoked. 31 now and looking to go back and reclaim our wall.
---
If u play prot paladins in dungeons and ubrs i promise u that u will love it. Wont be hard getting grp since u can form them so easily since ur the tank. Also ive played with alot of people and i tell u that most people dont give a shit that u will play a prot paladin. This subreddit is the vocal minority
---
That's interesting, I had no idea. Very glad they changed it though. 😅
---
I didn't know that about purification, that's pretty interesting. Really good reply, thank you.
---
Touched a nerve lol? Explanation in Lore: The great Blizzard god saw that there was a discrepancy in paladin vs shaman race for alliance and horde faction. In his infinite wisdom, he asked the Naaru to bless the dwarves with their holy touch.
---
I feel like most Horde priests these days are Troll Priests on pservers.
---
There's no way I'm serious?
---
What? People are actually arguing that if you or your guildie finds a warmonger, you should not use it since you can't guarentee you get it.
---
I may reroll alliance if the horde outnumbers alliance much past 60/40. I want to be the lesser faction, I have always been and it makes it  fun.
---
Short answer, yes. Long answer, yeeeees.
---
usind old aswell, but cant even see flairs here without using the subreddit style.
---
Only have the lagging issue here aswell, so I didnt really put any thought into it and just deactivated.
---
TIL: "I want to play with like minded people" is an elitist statement now days.
---
How hard it would be to make it import [this guide](https://www.vanilla-questing.me/manifesto) (or rather [this kind of json files](https://github.com/wickstjo/vanilla-questing))?
---
Title sounds like you are applying for an undercity merchants guild
---
Cables, Repair Bot. Those two things are why you level Engineering for PvE.
---
Not on pvp server, pvp servers tend to lean horde. Pve server tend to lean hard alliance. My old pve server in TBC was 80/20 split.
---
Is it possible to put this into the classic forum style?
---
Its okay after 2 weeks of the same content youll be over it.
---
Rare recipe items like scopes and engineering items used for quests.

---
There are patchwerk fights for the usual DPS specs on this channel.
---
Going to level all the professions on the road to 60, I have a month of work, got plenty of time to take it slow, level everything up, farm and grind reps cause I have no intention of joining a hardcore guild and need to wait for the "casuals" to catch up so might as well.
---
I used to sit up top on my warlock just to grant 'see invisibility' to people so they could see all the ghosts. It was so much fun when you could tell they had no idea what was hidden up there.
---
True enough, very much yes =P
---
It certainly makes them easier, but you should still have enough mana / +heal to make it through especially if you're raiding and have any gear from that.  Rank 1 chain heal, or downranked healing wave on the tank will still keep them up a LONG time and provide a bit of extra +heal to nearby DPS as well if you use the lowranked chain heal
---
This right here. 
---
MVP Fucking move.   
---
She asks you why don’t you love/trust me? You say yeah I do so it shouldn’t be an issue, but if we grow apart or feelings change, do you really want me to be a victim to the courts and lose what I work for?  Her response to that question is vital.
---
The best layer for that would be a pve server
---
This is one of the best games ever made... yes... you should try it.  Never let others get in the way of your own personal experiences
---
True that! I had them mixed up because I like the blue set wayyyyyyyy more so I thought it must be the harder one to get, lol
---
Easy to overthrow that bitch overboard too, *on accident*
---
DRUID CAN!!!!!
---
People only say pserver exista because its f2p. I doubt that. But the numbers will probably decay after a few months and not all will even play to 60.
---
the secret is that wl is not fun to play in an raid environment and it's even less fun if you are playing as alliance because of wotf.
---
in raids you have to put coe/cor&gt;&gt;cos on all targets which means you can't precast like a mage. before any raid you have to fill up your entire inventory with shards because after summoning, handing out health stones, sacrificing your succubus etc. you want to have a significant amount left for shadow burns. you will also be busy banishing your assigned targets before you cast any dmg inflicting spell.
---
during mc and bwl you will miss every other shadow bolt because unlike the mage you can't skill any hit% in your skill tree. only after getting tear+bv set you will see a significant dmg increase. sadly there isn't alot of spellhit items (at least with the original item progression) before zg.
---
wl is a super frustrating class to play and has serious design flaws. so if you are thinking that the wl is a hidden gem let me tell you it isn't.
---
a mage
---
* can level faster (aoe farming)
---
* can farm gold faster and safer (not even talking about zg)
---
* has way more cc
---
* has crazy abilities like blink, clear cast, counter spell etc.
---
* has more instant casts
---
* has better aoe dmg
---
* can conjure food/water
---
* can conjure mana stones
---
* teleport
---
* spellhit is easy to get (skill tree, tier 6 pvp boots)
---
* most caster items are tailored towards mages
---
* robe of the archmage &gt;&gt; robe of the void
---
* MQG
---
I really hate that they destroyed the undercity and darnassus for little more than the shock values. That is GoT S8 levels of subverting expectations there.
---
There is no need for such thing as rogue. You have by far the fewest abilities and stealth changes your bar anyway.
---
Literally the first Minute.
---
Awesome addon, just wished it would have existed a few months back so I could actually have done my own guide in it in time for the launch :(
---
There are a couple engineering items that sell because everyone needs them for a quest.  Mithril casing, and goblin rocket fuel.  The goblin rocket fuel is used to power a device you need for the dungeon set quests.  I used to be able to sell them for a couple gold a piece, I believe.  Not huge money makers, but still.
---
being able to watch something on your second monitor while you level is priceless.
---
My favorite is just one big one, two monitors feels awkward for me/not really necessary
---
post ur life story in the title next time bud
---
to be fair, i'm thrilled with this stance. i don't want quality of life improvements, i want classic wow in all it's "inconvenient" glory
---
It's worth it if you get them on the run through as you complete the quests. 
---
Not worth rerunning for them though.
---
You can upgrade everything, but if ur not tech savvy, u should let a professional do it and it will cost more. Gotta see if it's less expensive than just save and buy new one
---
Doesn't work in vanilla and classic.
---
Hahahahaha, SO true.
---
You know quasimodo predicted all this.
---
I love how you didn't even mention PvP in your long comment where you had to explain something I already know. In PvP warlock not only has more viable builds than most of the classes, but it's also extremely fun compared to it's raiding playstyle.
---
Also, my comment was more about the fact there will be more warlocks this time, either from retail warlocks mains or from pserver warlock mains. Way more than in the actual vanilla, but still less than mages for example. I'd never play mage anyway.
---
The reason why I said the secret is out is because this time, everyone knows warlocks scale extremely well and SL lock is the most broken PvP spec in the game.
---
There will be nothing
---
The fuck mothering 27th oh baby
---
I felt the same around 20. Was great to get 20 but after that, might lose it all at any moment.
---
yeah, first 10 weeks &lt;.&lt;
---
I'm doing mage for sure
---
I have 2x 27” 1440p monitors. I like this setup a lot for games, work, whatever. Allows game full screen on one and whatever you want on the second.
---
Is this sarcasm? (lol sorry, still learning)
---
No, it's because the spec didn't work due to talents and skills.
---
It’s the same as always. Pally tank for UBRS is fine but the group has to adjust a bit to its playstyle. Some at capable and some players aren’t capable of doing that.
---
And because of that you’re up to a lot of ignorance in pugs and should aim for guild groups you can actually talk to while gaming.
---
So it is your turn now to re him.
---
The person who wrote/drew that was clearly not an infant. Get out of here with that weak ass comment. Also think about the likely average life span. Not to mention you know your original comment was wrong.
---
To the victor belong the spoils
---
I was sad. But soon I will be happy again, back in my beloved Undercity!
---
I wonder if Mal'Ganis will still be there...
---
everyone says this yet no one can show how long the cooldown is
---
Which folders do you delete?
---
This is pretty solid. Rogues usually farm 1-12, quest 12-30 and farm again 30-40 so they can go back to questing in extremely good gear.
---
So taking advantage of the right spawn places it can give you an edge over other rogues or even classes that just follow a cookie cutter guide.
---
You're not going for rogue first, you're going for an easy life while leveling. Also having extra gold does not only mean that you get mount at 40, it also means that you can afford upgrades from AH that people will find "expensive".
---
In general yea, you can farm your rogue 1-60 if you're bored to do anything noteworthy and yea it's gonna take you a week of /played but its reasonable and mindless.
---
If that's not your cup of tea use your knowledge and the guide above or follow your own guide/knowledge.
---
Do you know how much is it usually for a professional to upgrade it? It's about 10$ extra, right?
---
I've always liked one main monitor in high res with a side monitor (I just use an old acer VGA screen) and use the side monitor for my music, guides and Discord/Vent.
---
A good hunter is so much more than DPS numbers. Plus who hasn’t had the absolute hilarity of a hunter not dismissing their pet and pulling the entire raid lol. I was that hunter once in Kara. A good hunter can save the day. Flip side a bad hunter (huntard) can be the bane of any group. If you think your DPS # is your only value or measure you are not playing your class right regardless.
---
You can install it already?
---
Mac requires cheese
---
Wouldnt that make bats/owls/birds the same dps?
---
Uh I dunno where u live, but it's pretty delicate work, they charge 1h for it.
---
I’d make scopes and get a fair margin.  Pretty low volume though.
---
Same place as you bud... Recruited 3 buddies/colleagues in the last week alone. I got my characters planned too. Character for playing with friend. Character for playing alone. Character for nostalgia recreation of 2004 main. Browsing this reddit every few hours. Watching theorycraft/youtube vids. Bought a new laptop 2 days ago for the occasion (giving my old laptop to a buddy so he can play with us). This is crazy... You are definitely not alone.
---
Are you sure your names not Thex?
---
The insufferable/v/ spammer returns
---
Yaaaas lol are miniatures like these doable with polymer clay? Recently been playing with clay again dunno if you use a specific method or material
---
No shame in enjoying retail, many do
---
Okay. Thank you.
---
I like two screens and running wow in full-screen window mode on one and having a browser or video on the other
---
Clubbing seals for loot
---
I am to, I figured everyone would be UD.
---
does anyone else get this  [https://imgur.com/a/HestHvB](https://imgur.com/a/HestHvB)  when they attempt to open the game by wow.exe in the classic folder?
---
User perma-banned.
---
what do you mean with "It does not make it a less desirable spec"
---
when the raid has 40 slots and you only take one then it is a shitty less desirable spec
---
Oh man.... I can’t stop checking this Reddit, reading guides and swotting up for my first ever priest roll (first ever clothie, come to that). None of my friends know I once played, nor will I ever tell them - it’s my secret gate back to my lonely teenage years and the salve I poured on my wounds. Since then I’ve made good money, had years of very helpful therapy and I’m in a happy, loving relationship. I don’t need WoW to feel a sense of belonging and self-worth any more. And yet... and yet... I’m buying a new $3000 dollar rig for the occasion and I’ve basically walled off September for daily play 😂. 
---
I have some sanity measures in there - commitments to activities, three hours per day devoted to freelance work, plus a nice trip abroad with my girlfriend. BUT THAT LEAVES EVERY OTHER WAKING HOUR FREE FOR CLASSIC, AND I’M *INSANELY* HAPPY ABOUT IT. My name is Dolgraeth and I’m an addict. See you inside.
---
Gear is already taken into account.  Rag is doable anytime after Saturday for NA
---
Hi Skirvin
---
no why would I ever be sarcastic when asking you to post your life story in the title
---
this is where i post the Spider-Man pointing at Spider-Man pointing at ... Yeah, you get it (and me &lt;3)
---
Venoxis here I come
---
So? Why do you care how people like to play. Easier to get a raid spot for you. Add-ons makes the game funnier for me (often less tedious), not worse.
---
A few times. Absolutely never changing it now though.
---
St Croix rods are best rods
---
Is that it? Where are all the class subsections? There is a lot more to discuss about classes in Classic than in BFA.
---
Classic needs it's own desperate board, it's a completely different game.
---
In basically all class polls hunters are last or second to last (considering pala/shaman are only available for 1 faction). Since those polls are taken by dedicated players and hunter seems to be  the weakest only dps class from aq40 onwards, min/maxers seem to stay away from it because of that. Still doesn't change the fact that on some bosses tranq shot, kiting and such are usefull.
---
not shitting on you. good guide. a lot of work invested. 
---
but your mob counts (X mobs to get to level Y) will be probably off as mobs gave different (less) amounts XP on beta than they do on private servers. they also had more health IIRC.
---
You added a legend!thank you!!! Also very good work I’ll be sharing to my friends who never played
---
TBF NE priests and hunters probably would have been female whereas the druids would be male.
---
Well that and the 85 bears
---
How much is diesel over there?
---
nope
---
What’s wrong with socketing your weapon? I loved the blue axe you got from setthek halls and add 3x red gems (strength).
---
Also no this whole sub is just as obsessed as you.
---
There's so much cc and utility that almost anyone can tank to 60 as long as they can hold threat. Traps, poly's, roots, fears, etc combined with Hunter and warlock pets makes things very easy when everyone's working together. Our  group up to 50 had a single shaman main tanking and main healing at the same time. With a mage, warlock, and 2 hunters as the other 4 it was very viable and a lot of fun. Everyone had jobs to do so you weren't just sitting back dps'ing getting bored. 
---
I find the cookie cutter comps and builds very boring and classic gives you the freedom to improvise and play any way you want.
---
UD would still be my preference because DP is just amazing, but I think people have realized troll is probably on par.
---
Because to a lot of people, mmos are dead if they won't have millions playing, even though it's enough with just 100k.
---
Yep, that gave me chills!
---
I think shadownburn takes a debuff slot. We had to ban it on multiple pservers at least.
---
I like this, I think I'll do it. I really did want an owl, but wasn't going to settle for a carrion bird. This is a solid alternative until I can get to Felwood/Winterspring. Just going to suck if you're trying to do this around launch when a million people will be in Westfall, lol. Sounds like a 3 am kind of activity.
---
Several years ago I smashed my left pinky finger pretty bad and had it bandaged up and wasn't able to hit shift or tab so I ended up binding shift  to my mouse and my kicks to R and I just palm crush CTRL.  It took a  few hours to get used to but I would say that after you have done it using modifier macros feels way faster now.
---
Similarly, "200+ gold" in the title but it ends up being "usually end with 175".
---
I'm pretty sure I've mastered the art of making gold as Eng so I'll share here.
---
Early levels horde craft Deadly Blunderbuss and they will sell like hotcakes at launch because of a quest in Ashenvale with a healthy profit margin. Alliance can make Bronze Tube for a quest in Duskwood but the profit margin isn't very high.
---
A little later on you can learn Discombobulator Ray in Gnomeregan. Little known fact is that this item can be used to polymorph opposite faction off their mount and doesn't even require engineering to use so you have to advertise that one.
---
When the zerg is a little bit higher, the next thing to craft will be Advanced Target Dummy. You need 2 of these to complete the gnomish engineering mastery quest and for whatever reason people are lazy and just buy them. One is also required for a Desolace quest so they will sell surprisingly fast.
---
When you get to the mithril stages, you need to save your solid stone because you need 8 to craft 1 goblin sapper charge. They may not sell very high right away because everybody is broke early on but man do they go fast once things are cooking on a server. I can usually get away with selling them for somewhere between 1.5g and 2g on a server with a decent economy.
---
Mithril casing is a popular item to craft as everybody will need to buy one for a neutral quest in Un'goro. But the profit isn't very high as it seems everybody knows this one and a lot of engineers will craft a ton to level their skill and flood the AH, thus killing our profit margin.
---
Next is goblin rocket boots. You will need help from a tailor to craft some Black Mageweave Boots and an alchemist  to craft some Goblin Rocket Fuel for these.  Goblin Rocket Boots do not require engineering to use so they sell a lot better than their gnomish counterpart and you may need to advertise that as most people do not know that.
---
Now you're getting into higher profit margin areas but difficult crafts like Goblin Rocket Helmet. It's a pain to craft one but you can get a little greedy with this one and get maybe a 10g+ profit or so each craft.
---
When you start getting thorium, you can start dumping it into salt shakers as each LW will need one.
---
You may need to buy the recipe for a nice chunk of gold for this one. Goblin Jumper Cables XL. It drops deep inside BRD from a boss in the bar room. It's a pain to find yourself but occasionally you will find someone that doesn't know it worth and just want to get rid of it for cheap on AH, so keep your eyes out for that recipe.
---
And ofc all the reflectors. By far the most difficult recipes to attain. One is from a limited quantity vendor in Winterspring and you can count on it being contested by other engineers so it may not be as simple as walking up and buying it (you can get lucky though). The other 2 drop in dungeons and I always end up buying them on AH if I believe the profit margin will be nice on them.
---
SL is good but fuck me is it boring to play though.
---
he meant retail (which is bfa) - druids are very versatile and flexible atevel 120, therefore very popular. It wasn\`t on vanilla though (flexible yeah but the hybrid tax was hard)
---
Are they best when used on St. Croix?
---
On the st Croix river
---
Just don’t do it. Heal dungeons as retri. Classic doesn’t work like that
---
This may be correct, I did have an alchemist also and I may be conflating the two.
---
Trolls have always been a good choice, there were just more misinformed people in 2006.
---
Warlock is legit, just takes forever to get to the patch where they start scaling properly with all gear. Everyone with half a brain knows this.
---
Similar to the orc rogue/warlock discussion as well. "Why aren't you undead?!" The amount we've learned about this game since its peak is insane
---
He’s a troll, we have no word about the duration
---
Well I get to play the 26th since i'm in NA.
---
I'm excited for WoW Classic too, but I kind of hate that its existence reinforces this sort of attitude of ''changes are bad''. Just because you ''don't recognize the game anymore'' doesn't mean it's bad in the slightest. That just so happened to be the case with this specific game. But I very much disagree with the idea (in all aspects of life) that something should stay the same or ''recognizable'' for its entire existence. Change is good, change should be welcomed.
---
I've been in a Discord group for a Horde guild for Classic since April. Pretty sure only a handful of us are still playing retail, but everyone of us is excited for Classic. We've already planned out our classes, specs etc. I've already sorted out a leveling partner for the first few days while we both no-life it to 60. Got my BiS list ready and a plan of action when I hit max level. The great thing is with a large guild like ours we shouldn't have to PUG dungeons as everyone will be running them back to back as they are prep for raiding.
---
You are not alone!
---
but sometimes I like to gank too
---
Troll is the way to go for most situations. Berserking is really really good, better than most Undead Priest perks. You can cure Devouring Plague, you cannot cure/dispel a Berserked Troll Mana Burn spamming you to 0% mana in 3-4 casts.
---
&gt;Ya its crazy having something to live for.
---
Haha! I am using classic wow to self motivate with great success. Whenever i consider when to do something, i remind myself to have my shit together so i can get my me time in august. Luckily my current exams conclude august 23rd as well, which is a true gift.
---
BfA is a good game but it's a terrible version of World of Warcraft. Nothing feels rewarding and there is no sense of community. Its fun to smack things though.
---
yeah after reading 8 different comments of "LoL iTs jUsT cUz BlIzZ wAnTeD tHaT wAy" from contrarian shit posters
---
Herbalism is great leveling imo. Even when you get to it to 75 you can start picking briarthorn, which gives you a good chance at picking swiftthistle too. That stuff always sells for a pretty penny. Once you get stacks and stacks they will probably put you over that 20g extra benchmark by lvl 40.
---
As said, it is far from terrible
---
That's what I always thought. One day I asked him. He pronounces it Triple-X. Weird amirite?
---
Very catchy!
---
Well with MC from what I remember (as an example) it was ALL about just getting a fat load of +fire resistance. With enough of that it didnt matter if your hp etc was lower.... because the damage youd take was proportionately much much lower.
---
As soon as you hit level 5, get your fishing then cooking skills up to 75 (about 45-60 minutes total). It will slow you down initially, but then you’ll be able to cook up and eat Longjaw Mud Snapper, which is 4x better than any other food at your level and heals you faster than Linen Bandages. If you’re Alliance, then that will also set you up well for the Cooking/Fishing quests in Teldrassil/Darkshore.
---
One one hand there is the allure of flippy jumps and random wiggling, on the other is 10% more rep and weapon skill. The part of me that loves to minmax is wanting me to play a human but goddammit I love flippy jumps.
---
Hi I'm Fred and I'm a WoWaholic
---
Deadly blunderbuss (horde), bronze tube (alliance), accurate scope, 2xmithril casing.
---
dont forget people wanting cookies and then never using them.
---
There fault for trusting a rouge :)
---
But seriously, I'm not going to be playing seriously enough to become a guild bank, and even if I didn't find it immoral, I wouldn't the reputation. You'd be known by most players, and I doubt any other guild would accept you it.
---
There are quite a few SEA guilds that play on Oceanic realms, mainly Singapore/Malaysia I think.
---
I'd check the official classic LFG forums.
---
Most effective will be questing and grinding inbetween moving from quest to quest, there is alot less quest in classic so everyone has to grind mobs to some extent. Dungeons are a nice break while leveling and ofc you get some nice XP but all xp in dungeons will be split on the party members. Do what you like most and have fun while leveling, it’s gonna take a whole lot of time so do what you enjoy and have fun. Alliance part has some really interesting questlines and storys to enjoy :)
---
Fuck, hunter is kinda boring. Lvld a orc hunter on nostalrius, I’m done with that...
---
Very interesting! I've thought about doing the same thing, as I also love being a support class. As a druid I plan on getting some healing talents while I'm in the resto tree for furor but I don't think I could handle going full resto. Best of luck to you, and I seriously recommend getting a friend to level with.
---
Still got fond memories of thunderstorming people off the cliffs in Wrath
---
It did. People complained again that it was too confusing. That's why we can't have nice things.
---
It won't trigger in one press because they're on the same line, yes. The semi-colon works as an "or" statement, so if it triggers Battle Stance then it stops reading the line. The GCD doesn't trigger when switching stances, so if you pressed it twice quickly it would work. If you break it up into two lines it will always read both of them.
---
Play a warlock and summon him
---
Isn't petopia from wotlk?
---
This looks very promising. Even with lack of str and agi he's taking mobs down pretty well. I'd still probably go 2H but suppose that's just preference .
---
Probably cause it is a reused retail client and it was overseen/not worth changing
---
Okay.  The guy I first replied to said "You didn't play vanilla.  Druids are gear sponges".   
---
I did play vanilla, and druids weren't gear sponges in vanilla.   Most guilds used DKP, and most druids just fought over healing gear with all the other healers.    They typically weren't trying to build a feral set or a boomy set.
---
Druids are gear sponges on the pservers, and likely in classic.
---
Asmon hangs around here so he'll probably see this.
---
Now I've got a little bit of respect for the dude as he just tells it how it is, atleast to him... and that's admirable.
---
But the dude is on some kinda swingset when it comes to classic. Today it's going to be amazing, tomorrow it's going to die off completely, yesterday it was hype-inducing but Monday it was tear-inducing.
---
Dude literally can't tell his left from his right when it comes to classic and he has an unreal sway on a could-become community so he should be pushing it as hard as he can...
---
imo. Pisses me off so much dude what the hell is he doing?! He repeatedly talks about BFA being shit yet he can't do anything but grind mounts and fall victim to those whispering in his ear how amazing BFA is. It's so bizzarre. Could do a case study on his behaviour alone and how toxic his stream chat is, they'd eat the shit off his shoe and I just cannot comprehend it..
---
yep
---
Thank you I needed a concrete example to even better illustrate the 1st category of people I was trying to illustrate.
---
Just in case, most players don't give a shit whether warlock is top tier or not. It's normal not to choose a class for the raid dps it does, but for other things. Hope you are getting my point now.
---
On one of the class guides on youtube (may have been Kargoz?) owl or carrion bird is suggested as the optimal pet.
---
There'll be a long while before I'm level 60, and I'll probably just start alts when I get there. Classic has a lot of below 60 content, so I don't feel any urge to get to max level quickly.
---
The difference in bg is do you want to spam purge or dispel?

Yepp. I just chose my region I wanna play (it'll give you a "warning" before saving it) and the preferred language.
---
I am with ya 100% but why can’t we do that in retail atm. I love everything that is wow just wondering has retail really fallen that far away. I see it in an rpg aspect but I still play the classes and specs I want we just need to social aspect back
---
Something about cold cement in the dark that brings me comfort.
---
Must've been from hanging out in my garage as a child.
---
You are responsible for crafting your experience of the community

Let me know how you plan to do that since most people dual box with range, as one character needs to follow the other it means the priest will always be following the warrior into fights

---
Sure, just include the line /startattack somewhere. The only thing to keep in mind is the 255 character limit. The HS/Cleave macro is something like 250 characters, so it wouldn't fit.
---
The true endgame!
---
Right, I was generally assuming that they do. If they don't, I'll just go to an RP server.
---
When o first got to darkshore from teldrasil i opened up the map and realized just how large this game was it was a new server and darkshore was packed chat was busy.
---
Yeah I already planning on playing a troll priest before they got all popular now lol.
---
Feels weird but good at the same time?
---
Because Mac doesn’t have Direct X or up to date OpenGL.
---
I played on private servers so I had the hype a bit spoiled for me but recently I had some old IRL friends and guildies reach out to me, people whom I haven't talked to in many years all excited and wanting to play together. This has got me hyped more than the game, just the community and the new bonds that will be formed over this magnificent game. See you all in Azeroth!
---
What do you mean? Wow classic has only one original cinematic.
---
Mage. It has a simple, easy to learn kit that remains immensely powerful throughout the game, and is strong in all aspects.
---
These [17 points in prot](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LZZxfzox) are the heart and soul of a tank build.
---
This got my heart racing!
---
You take a chance
---
The best reason to get an Owl at lvl 10 as Horde is to show that you made the trek across the Barrens, braved the wilds of Ashenvale, dodged the Night elves swarming over Darkshore, stowed away on one of their boats, and successfully penetrated their homeland in that damn tree.
---
The mark of a true Horde hunter!
---
You are correct that it is made by alchemists.  I put in an edit to my comment.  I apologize for the confusion.
---
Yes, those too! I always forget about them for some reason but they sure are handy while leveling.
---
This is right. The main issue with a Paladin tank is that the group has to adjust to the paladin. If people can wait a second to let them get aggro, it's smooth sailing. The reality is that you are going to have people not willing to adjust, or people who are just used to running with a warrior tank that can taunt and make up for it.
---
You're better equipped than any of us to answer this question
---
leveling is not even part of the consideration. its all about endgame since i will most likely not level alot with my friends.
---
Good, I have no friends
---
On server launches we would group as five and go to the highest level non-skull monsters and farm them. And there was a lot of competition.
---
If people think an area is overcrowded they keep moving at 1-6 until they find an area they consider not crowded.
---
True, I try not to blanket sweep but it's hard. A majority of players gave thunder fury to rogues first because they had the dkp and topped dps meters to claim it. Vanilla was a unique experience and I pray the death to dkp style looting.
---
&gt;Is it shortsighted of us to go with a faction based on level 1-25 zones?
---
Yes. 
---
It's 10% of the time you'll spend levelling, 1% or less of the time you'll spend playing the game.
---
Yeah especially since you guys will fly past level 25 within week 1. I think you know deep down what to do.
---
no dropdown. I can only choose region.
---
Laptop's can get a bit tricky tbh. The parts on them aren't as universal as they are for full sized pc's.  Without knowing your specific laptop it's hard to know what you can and can't upgrade (even then I personally don't really know enough about laptop's to help you, just that they're a pain to try to upgrade sometimes).  Some laptops have non replaceable cpus that are soldered in. RAM is definitely a safer bet to upgrade, but it's still not guaranteed to be replaceable so make sure to check that.
---
Our guild used hunters as a cc class kiting various trash mobs so we could ultimately clear faster which really helped out when we were learning aq40 to allow multiple attempts on twin emps/c'thun before trash respawns.  Hunters will always have a place in my raids.  Same with 1 shadow priest.
---
Can paladins heal well?
---
You got carried then, I won't be in a guild that allows dead weight. If the guild that I've chosen does allow dead weight I will leave promptly
---
I'd pick nostalgia every time.
---
I think they should of gone halfway, where you could see items on different auction houses but you’d have to physically be at a certain auction house in order to purchase something. 
---
This was how the “bazaar” worked in Star Wars galaxies back in the day. I always found it enjoyable to travel to cities and pick up my purchased item. It also increases circulation between major cities.
---
Make sure the server you join’s “server time”
---
Is the same as your local time
---
This means it is specifically your region
---
Oh man I forgot that triple x was actually a wrestling thing.
---
I can give this one the benefit of the doubt at least since it might not take into account blues that can be sold
---
It is boring, but that guy makes it sound like mage is superior meanwhile not even mentioning PvP where SL lock eats mages for breakfast.
---
Also by fun I meant other lock PvP specs.
---
I won't lie. I did enjoy socketing gear.  It reminded me of the materia system in FF7.
---
Soooooooo much gold tho D:
---
Oh I get it, I truly get it. Just bummer things are so F'd up for men these days. Divorces, child custody, work environment. Real bummer :/
---
I didn't even know about classic until about 2 months ago.  Can't imagine the poor bastards that were looking forward to this from the announcement.
---
That's fine, but don't devalue others' idea of fun with untrue statements
---
Man me t-- Oh thats right, husband wants to be Holy Paladin.
---
u\_u
---
Probably heard it from a Youtuber too...
---
I wish we could have seen an untainted lorderon
---
That is just fucking incredible
---
I will be leveling all my professions including secondaries during the leveling process yes it slows me down but in my opinion it helps make the game feel more immersive. Its nice having stat food or crafting youre gear as you level. Also if done right you can make money as leveling i remember after one server launch i made a good amount of money selling darkshore grouper for the quest in darkshore it gave me a good headstart on finances.
---
I'm not sure on an all inclusive guide like what you're looking for, but if you Google "classic vanilla fishing and cooking guide" you'll find some guides on how to level fishing and cooking in tandem. They say where to go for each skill range, and it's not much effort to tie that into whichever 1-60 guide you follow.
---
My plan is to level first aid, fishing/cooking, skinning, and mining. Level fishing/cooking each time you go to a new questing hub. Level first aid when you're turning in quests that had you fight humanoids. Skin every creature you can to keep it leveled up. Mine every node you see when questing, but make sure to stick around the zone to reach a high enough skill to be able to mine your next zone.
---
What isn't dead weight in your eyes?  Rogues, Warriors, Mages, and priests?   Everyone else is just being carried, right?
---
Updates on this progress if you would good sir, I'm happy to pay for Joanna's subscription once the add-on is fully up and running but I'll be playing alliance so I don't know how soon it will be good to go
---
I'm guessing he's only as big as he is because he's the lower class of streamer you're discussing, basically you have to be a certain level of what the fuck to get the attention needed to be even remotely as big.
---
I think you need to undertake a case study! Finish Uni with it hahaha, though he might flip a lid...
---
Don't forget sharpening stones, weight stones and shield spikes.  
---
You raise a great point, this is the kind of area where Retail is really really bad at being an RPG
---
I know, the dad gamer militia here doesnt understand this though
---
Nobody cares what race or class you're going to play.  Crazy right??
---
If we are comparing them to most other classes they aren't great. They can't cc a mob and mine a vein for instance. They are weak in solo PvP so if you are fighting for a Black Lotus spawn or something you most likely lose. They don't have a great ability to kill elites etc. 
---
That all being said... If you are Fury with decent gear you can still easily kill regular 60 mobs with very little downtime. Additionally you can look into fishing which has no real requirements.
---
Must have misread, my bad. Happy hunting!
---
Lots of people that have never done the fights before are forming guilds. For MC and bwl it won't matter too much - bwl should only take two resets at most to clear, but aq40 is going to slap a lot of those guilds in the face. Naxx is another level above that
---
The ultimate Idle game haha
---
I recommene PvP even if you are casual. Its a big part of the game, and seeing the red names popping up gets your heart beating.
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/RespectfulSparklyLapwingOhMyDog?tt_medium=clips_api&amp;tt_content=url
---
It’s funny you keep saying noob. Like I bet you’ve totally never been one shot by an enhance before. 
---
I'm all for prepping for classic but getting a divorce is the most hardcore thing I've ever heard.
---
I guess it would be fairly similiar to elwynn Forest
---
So what you are saying is that I weighted the extra attack too high by giving it impale.
---
There is clear diminishing returns on crit, but those don't make it worse then the extra attack until the low 30% crit chance.
---
Sword spec will always be a sub 1% dps increase per point, whereas, at low values of crit, with all the synergies and bonuses, crit can be 1.1% or even 1.2% dps upgrade
---
You cannot look at 1% additional crit as addative, it is a logarithmic increase to DPS
---
The first respec didn’t cost 10g it was just the minimum it would decay to. It starts off much cheaper.
---
Well Silverpine Forest is great if you go the undead route
---
Barrens is also something
---
Let’s hope they keep it that way even when the whiners keep whining a lot.
---
Mal'Ganis was the dude Arthas chased to Northrend. 
---
 Varimathras  was the one that was in the Royal Quarter of UC.
---
Night elf, with two scimitars running around killing spiders. Death to the Spider queen!
---
The raid themed encounters were very nostalgic, ngl.
---
Lol, so did I. I was talking about the wow general forum poster from a few years back. Master of the long format troll post. Didn't like Panderan very much.
---
Some friends got me to play. The 2 things that hooked me early on was how big the world was. My friends had been playing a bit already so they made new characters with me. One friend told me to do some early quests but he was coming g to get me to take me where all of us would level together.. he eventually found me in mugler and took me all the way to Eurostar, mind fucking blown. Then I found flight points! This game is so big I have to take a taxi!? And it doesnt stop to load whe. I go to new zones. I'm fucking in man
---
Whipped!
---
There's an interesting meta game with being undead.  Undead is obviously great against warlocks, but there are way fewer alliance warlocks because they are scared of undead.  So then the benefit of being undead decreases.
---
Healing is their most viable role. They have amazing healing for both PvE and PvP
---
Creating a US Test Account worked for me.
---
No I am showing that you assumed I was a meme spec and then embarrassed yourself on an even different level
---
They can tank heal dps?
---
Yes because you can only raid with enhancement lmao
---
Not skill, just dedication.
---
You west coast? I wanna play with you and your guild when classic hits
---
Yeah it's basically this thing every single time. You can also tank pretty mana efficient if the group doesn't take aggro with dpsing/healing too early.
---
That’s just not correct. The XP formula was very well known all along.
---
* Same level mobs give 50, 55, 60, ..., 345 xp from levels 1 to 60.
---
* Higher level mobs give 5% bonus XP per level higher than you.
---
* Lower level mobs get a 1/x penalty, x going from 5 to 17 as you go from 5 to 59.
---
* This starts at a punishing 20% per level penalty at 6. Goes quickly down towards 10% per level as you approach 20 and goes down to around 7% per level as you head towards very high levels
---
I made a pretty helpful spreadsheet. Feel free to share it:

Played since Vanilla launch and I’ve never heard about that. How cool.
---
I stopped a bit later but I'm in the same zone.  I preferred TBC over Vanilla though so I just hope we get a TBC expansion then I'll maybe play until WotLK.  After that I'm out though.
---
Excellent until Thex part
---
My alt is gonna be a Nightelf Priest lol.  Shadowmeld + MC... xD
---
Flyover =/= cinematic.
---
Whats the point of joining a raid as someone picked up, or as a new recruit, if you have no chance at getting loot? 
---
Don't ever join a raid that you have no chance of getting loot from. That means DKP raids or Loot council. Only join the /roll raids.
---
The gyrocopter is Dwarven in WC3.
---
I tend to play casters so I definitely did forget about those too. I wonder if it's too late for modern WoW to come back around to these.
---
TB is my hangout.  I love the music, the ambience, short easy run between the AH and mailbox and lots of my fellow cows to moo with.  Watch where you step though (cow shit).
---
One feral druid (best threat before thunderfury, good aoe threat and potential swing spot for additional healer, innervate, brez)
---
One resto (hots are always needed, innervate, brez)
---
Hpaladins for buffs and efficient heals to keep low deficit hp targets topped off
---
Shaman for windfury/chain heal on melee groups
---
2-3 hunters for pulling, tranq, and kiting mobs to skip packs in bwl, aq40, naxx
---
Warlocks bring two dps curses, healthstones, summons
---
Never take boomkin, ret/prot, enh or ele
---
In my eyes the only race that's mandatory is dwarf priest. But I wouldn't join a guild with two gnomes as main tanks because that usually reflects a suboptimal attitude which will lead to problems for the more difficult content.
---
What? Trolls are the oldest and most prolific race on the Eastern Kingdoms.
---
Alliance is effectively plagiarizing the lord of the ring movies (took night elves, humans, dwarfs plus added gnomes), which is a bit embarrassing in my opinion.
---
Of course you play horde. This isn't really up for discussion. 
---
They've got undeads, how awesome is that.
---
Greaters are 30
---
No, he originally accepted but then decided he didn’t want to leave his home, Prague.
---
Alliance is easy.
---
Horde is for try hards
---
Thanks but I am going to get Zygor when Classic comes out. They are releasing a guide for it and I am super stoked.
---
ButI am strictly disagreeing with you. I am saying you cannot really escape competition 1-10. You have to actually beat it.
---
Yes, the spiders will have *less* competition. But competition nonetheless.
---
Well that's the thing. You aren't using your pinky for 3 separate modifiers. You moved some of the modifiers to your mouse. So that's not really comparable to OP's method. Although you still have a slight delay. You still need to press your mouse modifiers before you can press R. 
---
Tbh I don't understand why it's such a hard concept to understand that modifiers are objectively slower. You're adding a modifier keypress that HAS to be done before the actual R keypress. You're delaying the R keypress.
---
Pressing CTRL, waiting a tiny bit, then pressing R.... That's slower than just Pressing R.
---
Bats and owls have the same stat profile.
---
I believe settings are unique to each character and have their separate folder for each.  Goes by the character name and server.
---
Alliance pansy.
---
Aww, come on mate. It ain't gotta be like that.
---
So thanks again, lots of questions! =)
---
What does Discombobulator Ray do to non-mounted targets?
---
I read it's worthwhile making Advanved Target Dummy to use yourself to get an item from them, possibly Fused Wiring, that also sells for loads?
---
What does the "Mithril stages" (actually what are the Mithril stages?) have to do with obtaining Solid Stone? Is it worth buying Solid Stone generally from the AH, to just create and then sell Solid Blasting Powder on the AH? Or is it mainly worth using Solid Blasting Powder to make the end final item (such as Gnomish Rocket Boots) and selling that end item on the AH?
---
Do people use the Reflectors in pvp? Sounds a bit of a niche strategy? Or is this for pve?
---
Generally, which do you spec into Gnomish or Goblin, and, when do you change into the other spec?
---
What is the difference between the normal and XL, Jumper Cables?
---
Thanks :D
---
The key is to be there minute 1. If youre not in at launch dont even attempt an early grind rush. If you are and know what youre doing you can be level 10 in 2ish hours and way ahead of 99% of the game
---
Once
---
They also mentioned that their methods to find bored is better, so that's a good thing.
---
They're top 10-15 in MC
---
They start off strong, but get worse. Still not ret/arms/moonkin/ele bad. They are not on the level of hybrids during BWL/AQ. But they aren't mages or warriors/rogues either.
---
That’s a lot of work when you can just get a cat that can still tank 3 things at once and do more DPS
---
Yes, the OOGA gang!
---
Wow thex is even on a wallpaper
---
No.
---
Its not a spell cast, its a weapon proc.
---
I don't get what's the issue tbh. 
---
Yes, you can beat the game. So what? 
---
I can finish a Witcher 3 with all the DLC's and some mods that'll make things abit more hardcore in less time than I'd ding 60 on classic. 
---
I could also fully complete a game like TBoI faster, even though it  requires you to run the game dozens of times, including the Lost part (a character that can't take damage at all - one instance and there goes the last 30+ minutes; basically you have to know every mob/loot piece in the game and execute everything perfectly).
---
The same shit goes for all popular online games around there: meta gets solved, people eventually getting bored and quit the game; so devs have to overhaul everything with a big patches, but even then it's not guaranteed to be enough for you to start playing again.
---
So, yeah. Even if Classic is gonna last "just" half a year for me, I'd struggle to name a game that would hook me for that long, considering that I'm an adult now and my passion for games is not like it was b4 :)
---
Hey those DPS holy priests need their buffs too!
---
Quite good druids
---
Solid reply. Thanks!
---
I'm looking for an EU alliance guild that raids twice a week starting 18-20 CET, and ending no later than 23:30 CET.
---
I was a young scrub back in classic, and am hoping to redeem myself on this go round.
---
But does not excel at it at all, we have warlocks &amp; hunters for that.   
---
Hence the neutral
---
"For myself, my guild plan to run raids in both retail and Classic."
---
How the actual fuck? I will have to dedicate my entire life already to my Classic main char, how is it possible to keep up the grind in retail as well? Does he has two lifes to no-life? Who is this madman?
---
The amount of quest availability. Back then I had been trying out a couple MMOs, and they were all heavily grind intensive.
---
Coming into WoW and being able to get 80% XP from actually doing something not just going to the same spot day after day to kill the same shit was a huge hook.
---
It made the world feel so much bigger to me.
---
Joana has said on stream the alliance 1-60 guide will be ready and on the website but he is doubtful about the addon being ready in time.
---
I can not remember the last time i used a sharpening stone in retail or use a armor kit and actually feel like it was a upgrade. Its sad just how useless professions have become in retail even potions one never needs healing or mana pots while leveling anymore.
---
Shadowmeld was strong in TBC. You could use it as a vanish to dodge CC.
---
Never, Orc Warrior since open Beta 2004!!!
---
Thats why i like being the enchanter.
---
They pretty much overhauled the whole layering system. Let's see if it's abusable at all.
---
Holy heck OP, good shit.
---
Any other pets?
---
And the bells n crowd cheering on the way in. Rose petals on the ground too.
---
This is the answer.
---
Alliance have always been a poorly thought out boring Tolkien knockoff from day 1.
---
But hey if that is your thing and for some players it is, go for it!
---
set it once, kept it like that
---
Quest and kill every mob on the way when you’re travelling. I also enjoy doing dungeons throughout the journey to 60 - just try and do them with all the dungeon quests and you’ll get good xp for that run
---
I have been in guilds that let us use dkp for materials used, like Nether Voetex, to make really good boe items, like Belt if Blasting, to sell for personal gold. People would even buy them and have the bop craft reagent to a guildie that had the pattern to craft it. We would gear alts out super fast.
---
As cool as that was, I think the quality of life was better in guilds that sold things out of the guild bank. Never having to worry about repair bills is such a great feeling. Even if in the long run you would end up with more gold if you had to use your own money instead of the guild paying for it, having free repairs felt better!
---
I like the female ones...
---
Wish I wanted to roll spriest just to run a troll priest.  They look so badass but I already have a couple classes higher up on the priority list.
---
Since they made babies with an orc.
---
Yea just got this and it works well enough! Appreciate the info
---
1,5 € for 1 liter so around $6,3 per gallon
---
it is not like it is absolutely unaffordable to respec, neither is farming as resto undoable
---
It just straight doesn't work? I'm surprised tbh
---
I know at least 10 people that are hyped for Classic. We have even managed to convince a younger friend who never played WoW to give Classic a shot. I truly think Classic will be bigger than Blizzard expectations.
---
Joana is also making an addon of his guide as well
---
Heads Alliance Tails Horde, flip a coin if you don't like the outcome you know your real choice...
---
The added the 10s and 50s costs for the Beta.
---
The OG was 1g first respec and up from there to cap at 50g.
---
In 1.12.1 there was decay once a week so you can expect to spend 75g every week if you swap twice (Raid -&gt; PvP -&gt; Raid).
---
The cities aren't 1-25 though. I'm choosing alliance mainly because the cities are way better
---
I found this discord for RP-PvP. 
---
Since there's no official RP-PvP servers the plan is to atleast coordinate with as many RP-PvP people as possible and get everyone to concentrate themselves on one server in the hopes of making an unofficial RP-PvP server.
---
Horde has higher top dps
---
A lot of people have also hoped they'd increase the level cap to 50 or 60. The server was well populated, considering I'm playing in an EU timezone, up until the end of beta was announced. We've had a little spike in player numbers during the event, but it seems that people mostly lost interest because they've seen that there would be no further testing and that was all we got.
---
I'd still imagine the player numbers to level off after a few months, vanilla isn't for everyone and I believe a lot of people will lose interest. I don't doubt that there is a decently sized dedicated playerbase for that particular niche though.
---
I can’t decide between druid and lock. I’m pvp focused, kind of a solo player, and will only raid if I need the gear. Which does better with full pvp gear? I don’t mind being FC all day and will probably get more rep winning WSG as a druid, but I feel like aff lock will feel stronger. Also I don’t want to have to constantly swap trees. FC druid is feral? Resto? Or a hybrid build? Any help is much appreciated.
---
are you retarded? you where replying to a comment talking about shaman raid utility 
---
LELS
---
Idk, I prefer them being linked. Even the system you propose encourages people to all congregate in one city for ease of access. With them all being linked we're more free to set up in the less populated cities without having to run to Org every time we want to use the auction house or find a pug.
---
I have played retail ever since from Vanilla. There has been a lot of great big new cities but I have always returned to Thunder Bluff to use AH and do stuff. Sure it's not as effective as using Orgrimmar but I like TB so much.
---
My plans exactly (also a warlock), though I think it'll be a fair bit of farming before I'm ready to swap over to engineering.
---
Socketing was pretty good. Legendary gems lol though.
---
Funny, most try hards I know from pservers are going Alliance because its easy.
---
Horde is for ***fun imo.
---
They both have a 1.00 hp and armor, and their damage is both set to 1.07. I think the two biggest reasons owl is better is because, first of all it looks cooler, and second it eats meat which can just be gathered off mobs you kill to feed it. Whereas the bat eats fruit and fungus, which most of the time you'll have to buy off vendors.
---
\^\^ This guy is fun at parties!!
---
Skill in classing raiding?
---
They're still there you just toggle them to their predestroyed state
---
I semi agree with that, I don’t have to listen to negativity but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t pop up very frequently
---
I assume you need a live sub for that.
---
Came here just to post that link, but you beat me to it. Here, have an upvote instead!
---
Go go warrior gooooo!
---
It's not that much work really, and the cat does less than 3% more damage, whereas the bat/owl will be taking significantly less damage which reduces downtime and the need for pet healing.
---
/played ?
---
Beastslaying +2 for glows!
---
My son,
---
I would do the Alliance starting zones together later on. Always think about the endgame first because that's what you will do for most of the time on your main while nothing prevents you from reliving the nostalgic parts of WoW.
---
The game will run on integrated graphics, but I'd still recommend one with a dedicated GPU. Go to the websites of whatever stores are near you and look for laptops with an MX150 or GTX1050. If you're willing to spend more than what those cost, get something with an -H series CPU rather than a -U.
---
You don't need a 3k rig to play classic...

Have checked, haven't seen any guilds tbh
---
The only correct way to play WoW when Classic drops
---
Shut the fuck up before I shove your fucking quotations book up YOUR FUCKING ASS
---
It's tough to rely on those impressions too, since there are loads of us who have never cared to try a Beta nor a PTR throughout all of years playing the game, but we played the actual game just as much as anyone else. Honestly it wasn't until TBC when I realized I was allowed to join a PTR - I thought it was for official testers or folks who were invited to check things out. By that point I didn't want to ruin the surprise of patch day so I still refrained. Funny how so many of us wouldn't even look at dungeon/boss guides on Tankspot because that seemed silly to have not even entered the dungeon but are already watching videos and looking at diagrams which in the end would cheapen the "real" experience. How times have changed. By the time I quit in Wrath it seemed like everyone was bored/annoyed at fights long before they had even touched them.
---
Gotta oil your staff mate ;) 
---
And if you're particularly nefarious you can sell the oils with one stack left for full price and some unlucky fella will buy them and swear at you.
---
There was a murloc game a long time ago I think. Was pretty funny.
---
Then you'll be using wizard oils! Or mana oils if you're a healer.
---
That’s Kindof what I was thinking. It does seem really high that way. I’d be surprised if these numbers hold true all the way to 60
---
wow, that's totally wrong
---
Yeah, and that was his indication for the absolute MAXIMUM duration. They say it will be gone at the very maximum at the end of phase 1. It will likely end way before that.
---
Does this also work with the Stealth Merc keyboard?
---
I remember the first time i saw the gates of lordaeron, literally having chills just from thinking arthas walked trough those same gates, killing his father.
---
The ghosts are between the throne room and the zepplin
---
Problem is if 50 people do this even spread across 10 servers you’re going to run into respawn trouble?
---
Yes! Raid Healer is so fun. Downloaded it a couple of weeks ago. What's cool is that certain fights seems impossible until you find the right healing skills to use. 
---
 If I could ask, I have never managed to get passed "Ion the Hydra", a fight when you reach the castle. Am on my second restart now. Figured I would try a different talent selection yet again to see if I could manage it.
---
 If you have beaten that fight how did you do it? What talents and skill selection.
---
Sure. But getting reports with all the data from multiple characters with times ive played and at which days and when during those days are fun data to have.
---
If you recall correctly, right?
---
Seriously, are you trying to turn this one into an argument right now?

---
It isn't berserking. It's shadowguard combined with blackout.
---
Blackout has a 10% chance to proc a stun for 3 secs, you get 3 charges of shadowguard which can be up 24/7.  As a rogue I have opened on many troll priest to have their shadowguard blackout proc me instantly and it is frustrating ill say that much lol.
---
How dare you put on shoes!!! Traitor!!!
---
I’ve always assumed dps classes have higher populations than healers. What is it about paladins do you think draws in so many players? Class fantasy or utility?
---
Skill gap in vanilla being too huge? It’s all about who has more /played, not to mention the general class imbalance
---
Yeah, that's not it champ.
---
WE MADE IT BOYS
---
Since everyone's trying to be all lovey dovey positive and nobody actually answered your question, they don't scale well with gear like many of the other DPS classes.  They will fall off hard at AQ40 and Naxx and are near the bottom of the raw DPS classes.  They're right there will the pack until that point though.
---
That said, I'm still playing hunter.
---
Same here. My troll priest Shakalaka is now 120 and bored with all these expansions. I’ll be resurrecting him into the glory days in just a few weeks!
---
When a friend told me epic stories about scarlet monastery, especially the herod fight. I thought "man, there's no way that these things can happen in a game".
---
They "think" they will be 60 in 2-4 weeks. Considering it takes 8-10 days to hit 60,  it's unlikely unless they are playing 12 hours a day.
---
Its amazing, just downloaded it and it took even less then 4 Gb!
---
Did we ever figure out what the Green Slime was? Does it have an lore components or is it just for effect?
---
It’s a huge oh shit button that can turn the tides in PvP, 5 Mans, and raids. I was a troll priest in Vanilla and loved it, used it all the damn time. Pair it with some runes and some AoE damage for max effect.
---
I don’t understand why in chanting, or Joe crafting, or any of the professions to be honest, exist in retail wow. I actually loved having like five different things I had to do to a new piece of gear when I got one.
---
Por que no los dos? But seriously, two monitors is bis.
---
Undercity is pretty cool but it takes a bit of time before you learn how to navigate it. It's like a big hamster wheel. Running around in a big circle, very frustrating at first.
---
Any chance you have nodejs/npm installed (or willing to do it with assistance?) and I could use you to test something for me?
---
Who gives a shit kiddo?  Childish twitter shit.
---
Going to have the priest where plate.
---
Running around Ironforge talking to your guildies on vent is NOT a waste of time.
---
there isn't much of a reason to play troll as a caster in classic because of mana issues. 
---
casting faster if you dont have the mana for it is pointless.
---
I had a night elf priest in classic that would sit in stealth at the top of the horde town in thousand needles and mind control people as they came up the elevator lol. So much fun.
---
I don't understand your question
---
I played on an instant-60 pserver where they scripted all 40-man content down to 5 mans.  You can farm gold a variety of ways and purchase any end-game epic through scripted vendors or you can just do the 5-man content.  I mostly healed in end-game raids but once I got geared as Enh I could go along easily to stuff like ZG, AQ20, etc.  I tried DPSing in Naxx but Enh lacks the utility that some other classes have (No CC, no meaningful cleanse like magic or curses) so it wasn't too succesful even with Naxx gear + Might of Menethil.  I did a lot of PVP and other PVE quests to get gold and then bought the gear that way mostly.
---
I always knew. Even as a little kid there was something insanely magnetic about the game. I wasn't good at it, but it was amazing. Getting loot felt good, leveling up felt good, it was just fantastic.
---
That said, a few months ago I had my first rag kill on some rinky dink private server that keeled over and collapsed due to dev mismanagement literally the week after.
---
And that was when I knew that this would be a major feature in my life for the next year or two.
---
I didnt know druids are least played class till recently but it feels kinda cool :)
---
Part of the reason why retail is in such a poor state is the community as a whole and their obsession with min/maxing like the world first guilds and Blizzard designing a large chunk of the content treating it like an Esport. 
---
Cut out huge portions of the game that gave it charm in order to push everyone into raiding.
---
This is 100% true. I remember this VIVIDLY as a previous HPally in Classic. The Tank and Healer are supposed to have an almost "homo-erotic bond" with one another.
---
From what I've read (trying a sham this time around), the reason people don't go deep resto is because of the effectiveness of lesser healing wave and chain heal. Heal wave is not use nearly as frequent, so those talent points don't see as much use. Instead they but it into damage (especially in pvp) to make shocks more bursty and to damage when focusing a target down.
---
Also, hunters are pretty good in MC and the early phases, so I already wouldve had an easy raid spot anyway. No guild is gonna start benching their core players a year later because of class balance.
---
except all the tryhard pserver players play alliance...
---
If anyone's wondering, Im working on getting my levleing guide into this Addon
---
I played a bit of vanilla back then but I never liked it. I played a lot during Cataclysm but I didn't really click with the game until Nost where I really fell in love with the game.
---
My apologies, I was more conveying that the add-on for the alliance side will likely take secondary priority due to it being unfamiliar territory
---
Ah, maybe I'm wrong.  I'll have to log and test it for awhile to see thanks for the heads up
---
Cats can't tank multiple mobs at once, if you multishot one time you'll pull a second mob off your cat
---
Choose north america, then download
---
Ohh
---
Same. They were considered conjured items which disappeared 15-30 mins after logout, but I don't remember the exact timing. This was for sure a thing as one of my first characters was a warlock.
---
I mean it'll be rare for someone to want to get in bed with you without even knowing what kind of player you are, what times you play, or even if the like playing with you.  Better to just find people in game you enjoyed partying with and send them invites.
---
Atlas loot did all that? Thought it was just a browser for dungeon loot. Aucitoneer pulled the price data from the AH, also showcased what the item is used for in the tool-tip like required for a specific quest (turtle meat, etc.), profession item and a lot more.
---
Oh ? I can't imagine now.
---
Ever leave your volume up and scare the shit out of your self and loved ones in the middle of the night when the updater let everyone know it was done?
---
Heh good times.
---
I used to go an Internet café and play a bunch of games. I saw some people playing WoW and wanted to give it a go. I loaded it up, tried to put in my account (thought it was the same as the comp) but failed to log in. Some dude saw this and told me I had to make an account and pay per month. I was shook. So I went home later that day and begged my mom to pay more money for another service. She saw I really wanted it and helped me setup my account and pay for it. 
---
The next time I went to the café, I was so excited and couldn't wait to play. I logged in, made a gnome rogue named Tyuul and entered WoW for the first time. I did what I thought I had to do, I just kept killing any animal I saw, I didn't know quests existed. That was a fun 3 hours of grind. I may have hit level 3. 
---
The next time I went the dude who told me about the paying aspect saw me log on and came over to talk to me. He asked me if I wanted some help and or tips. I was ecstatic. He showed me what quests to do and how to do them.
---
 He also brought me to Stormwind and it blew my mind. The place felt so big and beautiful. Everytime I went back to the café  someone new asked me if they could help and if I wanted to be taken to cool places. 
---
It was such a great place to start playing wow because I was young and dumb, but I had a good support group who helped me learn the game. They helped me get to 60 even though I had no idea how to play the game, but I had a lot of free time. I was probably the worst 60 on my server, but also the whole game.
---
That's a great idea, a good networking aspect.  I plan to be a mage, so can hand out food AND stat food.
---
I wonder what will be the mos tpopular alliance classes.  Paladins, warrior, mages?
---
FYI - You forgot to redact your email from the window title.
---
Yes.  [https://willitclassic.com/view/8tvuvOzlk6X3bsIZ33Oe](https://willitclassic.com/view/8tvuvOzlk6X3bsIZ33Oe)
---
I'm thrilled at the idea of getting lost for 20min in undercity
---
Is it weird that I want to play alliance so I can experience something new since I’ll be leveling pretty slow. But I know I’ll go horde because I love the music in the horde cities and the barrens? I’ve been conditioned
---
SL/SL was disgustingly broken and fun to play in pvp, but I found warlock in pve to be just as boring in vanilla, tbh. Everyone was DS/Ruin and just spammed shadowbolt. Yeah you were better than a mage in basically every single possible way in tbc but it was still boring.
---
All gathering professions. Sometimes enchanters could make a few quick bucks by selling fiery enchants ect early game. Selling bags.
---
Don't rule out undead too quick. I know it "freaks her out" but it's the best of the bunch.

Counting the seconds homie..
---
I just moved to Canada from Israel, where I played on EU servers for 15 years.
---
I get 100ms latency and I have a Bell fiber connection.
---
I remember someone doing that back in TBC, but he used talents. Why aren't you allowed to use talents? You're still naked regardless
---
There is nothing like this in my [B.net](https://B.net).
---
Holy shit I just spit out my drink laughing.
---
Idk Tauren female can be pretty cute 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Female Troll feet is nightmare fuel.
---
Let’s invalidate this pricks post by downvoting it, that way no one else has to read it
---
Does it have the line in there about not calling Tauren "cows"?  That they are simply referred to as 'Tauren'?  
---
That's my favorite.
---
All the small changes of the private server cores make this less viable and far less true in true vanilla and classic. 
---
While still decent and much better than waiting for a tank, war and bear blow pld out of the water currently.
---
Troll female aint that bad

oops, thanks :D

It was just a gold sink. Rather than the blue axe having high strength as base, it didn't and instead you had to unlock it using gold

Take a screenshot of your WoW page with the 'Version' expanded and upload it.

If you don't see 'version', take a screenshot of your WoW page without it, and upload it.

Deleted and reposted because I had my email in the last one like a noob. Note this was from 2006, one of the earliest emails I have from WoW.

that’s fair. it’s a massive game. just focus on having fun and leveling your character, all this stuff comes later. it’s just icing on the cake.

Just accept that SL warlocks will ALWAYS be better than you and you'll have a blast.

Look at the avid series
---
Please copy the 1-12lvl Also, Joana will soon move all behind paywall
---
It will lag a bit but there are ways of improving it. I wouldn't recommend playing a healer because having a high ping means you'll constantly be sniped by the EU healers. Your connection to the NA grid doesn't really matter that much. You need to get a good connection to the EU grid and there are a few ways to do it like with a good VPN, I'm not sure how legal they are though so better ask Blizzard before you use them.
---
Where did people get the idea that you need to grind to reach 60? Back in the day i didnt spend a single day simply grinding. I was always doing quests or dungeons, which also gave me some nice gear.
---
Time flies like an arrow, but fruit flies like banana.

Bewbs

...
---
Technically humans have bigger bewbs though
---
Warrior probably.
---
Given the number of people rolling Orc, you can bet horde side is greener :D
---
The lag shouldn't be too bad, I have heard people saying it's 120 to 180ms, might be less if you have a good fiber connection.
---
Uh, no. The minimum required specs for Classic are identical to the minimum required specs for Warlords of Draenor.
---
Spec | Vanilla | Classic
---
----|-------|-------
---
Processor Speed | 800 MHz | 2400 MHz
---
# of Cores | 1 | 2

Differs depending on class, but usually hundreds

Avoid selling stuff to players and try to rely on vendor cash early on. Most trading goods will dramatically increase in price later on. 
---
Hunters/warlocks can farm maraudon for quite decent cash. I think mages can do some of Strath UD.
---
I guess I'll just walk into a store and ask them all those questions.

Thx man, i will check that. 1oz for senkos enough?

They were rare because they sucked early on. On 1.12 they're op, they will be popular among tryhards for sure
---
Probably
---
Show her how she will look like in T1 T2 and so on. I really like Undead female with Marge Simpsons hair and I also like female warrior. They got nice animations and since you can wear helmets who cares about a pretty face /. If u got your T2 head you want to show it!
---
Moonfire S tier tagging
---
Gnome mage is not a bad pvp racial.  With Blink and Escape Artist you cant be rooted.  It's no undead racial, but it's definitely good.
---
Wouldn't it also mean your pet generates more agro on the first hit?
---
I've been waiting for classic since the nostalrius shutdown... which was 1210 days ago now....
---
The end is near friends.
---
Ok, but what about that?
---
Inb4 bunch of Alliance healers/SP/ Warlocks coming to tell you just how great Troll is and that you definitely shouldn't roll Undead.
---
The cherry on top of it all is Berereking actually. It's not the greatest racial by any means, but goddamn is it fun to pop it and spam Mana Burn on some hapless caster.
---
Sure does! Slow AS does make it harder for your pet to establish aggro on multiple adds on pull though. Broken Tooth can put auto attacks on two mobs and put a hit back on your first target before a bear hits its second target.
---
Wow, I had no idea Dark Legacy was still around. Strangely, it seems to mirror the modern game - art style has be improved and while technically better I prefer the original style, also the older comics were largely about the social interactions between the characters and now it seems to be about questionable design choices in the game.
---
Never. Tanking til I die
---
I think I will mind that kind of latency.  It looks like I can expect sub 40ms with my connection on an NA realm. Seeing spikes to over 200 will get old. Thanks for the help!
---
Them seeds, man.
---
The polls have been quite an eye opener. Warlocks tended to be all the way down next to Druids and Paladins and lowest pop numbers for Alliance - the fear of WoTF is very real.
---
I played EQ and DAoC on day 1, and WoW was the next in line.  Still I quit WoW right before BC got added and the game exploded.
---
I do plan on playing a healer. I think I will be sticking to NA realm and building a guild from the ground up. Thanks!
---
Socketing weapons is fine. LFR, pandas, and virtually every other "improvement" is not.
---
Is there any way to cover those feet?
---
Of course you don’t, but I’m treating myself.
---
You're overestimating how many skills you actually need to buy
---
Far from alone bud, the old trailer and login screen gave me chills
---
Undead Warrior here. I like that city.
---
She does do comissions! This is her website, where you can find examples of her art and her contact info http://dawndragonart.webstarts.com/
---
You probably spend around 100g total if you buy all the spells
---
I mean PvP needs healers too, so you don't necessarily need to respec, not to mention getting viable shadow gear will cause you some headaches, since there is a huge competition for it and you are the last in line to get it for your off-spec.
---
I did a trial, rolled an undead. Died and couldnt figure out how to get out of ghost form so I quit. Maybe a month later I gave it a go again, the rest is history.
---
Where do you get the addons from? I’m hyped for launch but I honestly can see it getting pushed back to Sep/Oct.
---
No problem. Keep in mind it’s not really like other games, or even retail wow; there’s a lot of batching and delay even with perfect ping. Skills don’t need to come out immediately either for them to be useful. Only time ping really matters is if you’re playing a rogue or maybe fury warrior, and again your ping is over 200.
---
I played on a pserver with150 ping for a couple of years, but I’d also rather abandon a game of dota than play with above 70 ping for reference.
---
Also, there will be far less alliance warlock anyway because lot of people will fear (haha) to face too much WOTF, then WOTF lose its value.
---
I think you'll be surprised how many people have a tough time with the raids, might be easy now, but when everyone doesn't have gear it won't be a cake walk. That said, obviously there are class based items that should go to specific classes - other than that, it should probably be a /roll with some sort of modifier for those that show up a lot. As an example, zero chance I raid 4 hours a night 6 days a week like I did back in the day. However, skill wise, I'll add more value to a group than most. There needs to be some sort of balance - just being a body shouldn't give you equal loot opportunity. Maybe people should consider a multiplier based on dps/heals that gets taken into account - would essentially mean in the boomkin example, they would have to be extremely lucky, while everyone else is unlucky. Could do modifiers, or have 100/90/80/70 etc. as max roll depending on a few set of criteria. Deaths caused by newb mistakes automatically roll with a max of 50 or something.
---
I forgot what the sun was for 3 months in 2005.
---
Does your latency spike or is 100ms consistent?
---
What was after WoW?
---
What would happen today ?
---
Gotta kill all the trash in the final room of BRD before taking down the boss.
---
I'm excited to do hunter! My first character to 60 back in classic was a hunter, so I know hunter stuff particularly well
---
The tank is the bottom, healer is top.
---
I’ve never bothered with private servers. Lag, instability, and they inevitably shut down. 
---
Glad to have a blizzard server to play.
---
Actually it was the plural "Cinematics" even back in Vanilla, despite only having a single cinematic
---
DPS is normalized between families. Each family has a different damage, armor and health modifier. Attack speed isn't normalized.
---
Imagine writing MAGA or some politic memes...
---
Same, I am conflicted, I mained warlock in vanilla, also ended up trying rogue, warrior, priest in TBC/WotLK. 
---
I love the idea of being a Druid, but Druid in vanilla was so different from the Druids I remember (from TBC and Wrath).
---
Why?
---
I truly believe without nostalrius, and the efforts made by fans after its shutdown, we wouldn't be getting classic wow right now.
---
Blackout is the first shadow talent. Every pvp priest should take it
---
Oh how convenient that you found them.
---
Probably a silence for 24 hours.
---
This is the result of more than a decade of prejudice towards hunters in general when it comes to vanilla, plus all the shit about DPS decline on the tail end of endgame.
---
I find that the best way to make good is just go out and help folks. Everyone could use a helping hand every once and a while!
---
Hah yeah, there's some real cool crossovers they could do. Just think it would be a lot more fun to jump into than just an entirely brand new story. IMO at least.
---
Cool. Is it doable two man? 
---
I’m talking ~below prebis gear levels.
---
That’s a fact. Not denying it, just the reasons I never played them.
---
Retails basically like playing a really pretty solo Skyrim, with tons of cosmetic prizes, and using training wheels.
---
I believe Harukai released a alliance guide that has what you are looking for.
---
1-60 Alliance Leveling Guide: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiIDj0gsjp3Ci8YDgs12T83TWYvzQymHn
---
Thats what made Warlock so fun for me, being a underrated, misunderstood class that stilled packed a punch in vanilla. If warlock becomes to popular it will lose that appeal.
---
absolutely nothing! infact, all healers have their benefits for pvp. Neutral just means they dont excel compared to the other healers, and i felt that shamans wernt quite as good in a pvp setting as a druid (due to all their defenses with bear form/travel form) or a paladin (burst heals + bubble antics) 
---
if i could do a half and half bubble I would, but I really wanted to keep things as simple as possible.
---
Play with the female undead models. If you remove the facial scars, pick a normal hair and pick a nice face, they can look like cute goths.
---
You probably spend 2-300g if you but all abilities
---
Sadly a lot of animation are better on female than male
---
You're vastly overestimating the training costs.
---
I agree with this 100%
---
Silence on an MMORPG... Blizzard is definitely ruled like shit.
---
Its gonna be a field day. Long live the almighty banhammer!
---
All dmg is calculated based on a math equation. Rogues dont have any spell modifiers so those goggles will not fit into their math in calculating dmg. 
---
Now a hunter on the other hand....
---
Its less gear competiton because shamans only share int mail with other shamans. While a lot of good gear for them can be cloth or leather, they still have the option to take reasonably good upgrades in the form of int mail drops, which eases the competiton compared to say, mage who must take only cloth
---
I like strong female characters.  There is nothing wrong with it at all.  Sylvanas was probably my favorite character in the whole game for years until she ate retard pills.
---
The problem is that it's a fantasy world and when it comes to females the rules of what can be fantasy are limited or you will be attacked by the feminism police.
---
that ain't a bad idea at all.
---
Sadly no, they didn't start adding boots that cover troll feet until Legion
---
you didn't read very well i suppose.
---
Best bit was when I got 3 epics before level 10...
---
what exactly are you replying to?
---
You mention caster dps, what about priests?
---
I get ya, no sweat. The reason for my thinking is because, pre-modern WoW macros, and especially during real Vanilla, they were very limited. I remember having to manually pick up and put each 1 Hand in each slot and seeing a GCD trigger on all my spells. I tried many swap macros but they never worked.
---
Hopefully with the modern macro client, this thing will be possible. Thanks again!
---
Jewelcrafting was just cool all around. It relied on a profession that already existed and expanded what you could do with it. Also I've always been into mineralogy so I'm a bit biased.
---
If you're not dead set on alliance, we have a guild you'd might like (we already have a dude from the US, he's here for pretty much the same reason).
---
The cold truth is, in the whole roleplaying scheme of things, I identify more with a strong warrior who looks menacing in his armor than a not so menacing female character and can't comprehend that others don't share my narrow point of view lol
---
If you are play in PVP realm, shadowmeld will be very useful when you go to washroom. Not joking it’s really great.
---
I was reaaaly torn on that! ultimately i feel they arent quiiite as good as say, a subtley rogue prep cooldowning you into the shadow dimension, but they certainly can do very well!
---
My guild plans on being like semi hardcore. Some of the guys have played on private servers in the past. We will be taking a spriest, and a feral. We won't be taking oomkins or arms warriors though.
---
If there is stupid censoring, barrens chat will be ded.
---
Truth is you probably corpse ran ALOT.
---
Hey, same here! Hype continues.
---
I like the old talent system, but honestly, while leveling it's so boring. "Yeah, i leveled up, I can add a talent which give me 0.5% armor VS dragon"
---
My gut says no but I’ve never attempted so can’t say for certain.
---
So buying what you need will save you at minimum 100g, which is what he was asking
---
Early levels of BM include 15% more HP and 30% more armor. If you barely notice any difference with those talents compared to marksman then you are doing something wrong.
---
I hear you. I got a free one week subscription after I was in contact with customer support a couple of weeks ago( wanted to find my old WoW account to use for classic just for fun). Didn't even log in once to check the game out. After everything I have read and what I have seen on youtube it looks so different from my idea of a MMORPG. I know I wouldn't like it. Not saying it's a bad game though. Just not what I'm after.
---
Thank you for sharing!
---
Having 30 min cooldown on someone farming nodes. Would go like this,
---
Farm nodes, yay i got a bunch let me hop layers and do the same!
---
*next layer* oh crap someone just farmed this layer, let me hop to next one. Oh wait fuck I need to wait 29 more minutes.
---
Boom... fixed.
---
Is it slow via boot camp or does it work pretty well?
---
absolutely! they may not top the charts as often as a priest, but they give extraordinary buffs with the totems (and the healing is certainly not bad)
---
I mean classic is a 4-10 hour a week endeavor once you’re in pre bis and above.
---
Retail, dependent on how much you raid is raid hours +4 a week. 
---
If you’re efficient with your time, raiding semi casually in both is easygoing enough.
---
That's not a gold sink. Gold sinks remove gold from the game. Gems were bought from other players, so the gold was simply exchanged, not removed. And everyone could be a miner and jewelcrafter and benefit from it, it's not like you had to use gold.
---
And it's not like you could only socket strength. You had to inform yourself and choose what stat benefitted you the most. You could socket hit rating gems to get hitcapped without having to rely on loot RNG, or look up whatever stat was best for your specific setup.
---
It added a layer of depth, flexibility (without making things arbitrary like they are now in retail) and player interaction to the game.
---
I'll agree to an extent, the incremental stat increases are boring but getting a key talent is soooo satisfying
---
&gt; since classic is less demanding than pservers.
---
&gt; */run ClearTarget()*  
---
*/run TargetNearestEnemy()*  
---
*/cast Sap*  
---
*/run if not IsCurrentAction(59) then CastSpellByName("Stealth") end* 
---
This breaks stealth on vanilla.
---
Cant wait to be expected to throw out half an epic mount amount of gold on enchanting my blue pre-raid bis gear.....  
---
On the other hand there is no better feeling than getting that Phase X best in slot epic for your spec and letting your local ench dealer hit you up with the bis enchant. Then you just sit in the capital hovering the cursor over those pixels to get that fulfillment you lack outside of the game because you have became a nerd once again.
---
It probably is technically doable, but you don't really gain much doing lava runs in stealth. You still have to do the Lyceum and Magmus first.
---
Nope! when all is said and done all races will be represented, with 4 female and 5 male total.
---
Thx for guide, looks good
---
This is fabulous information, thank you.
---
When it comes to faction choice, it's best to go with your gut feeling if you can. My best memories of early WoW were in Westfall and Deadmines too, and I will always have a spot in my heart for the Alliance.
---
But when I reach deep down into my gut and rummage around in the black sludge that resides there, I pull out a crazy voodoo troll effigy. I pray to this effigy and paint my face red with my own blood as an offering to my gods. Then I run around naked under the blistering hot Barrens sun, the drums of war echoing in the distance. Flailing my arms and screaming a bloodcurdling war cry, my insatiable thirst for savagery stirring me into a frenzy, I slaughter every beast I come across, leaving nothing behind but shattered plainstrider beaks and headless raptor corpses.
---
This time around, it's Lok'tar ogar for me.
---
I think that's what I'm going to do next. Lots of people want to see other classes, but they don't really demand this kind of deep dive. I think I'll go over guiding principles to look for when designing macros.
---
Most of the character models look goofy as fuck anyway. 
---
I usually role dudes as well but I rolled a female dwarf one time and it was pretty cool. Think I’m going horde this time though and I don’t think thex works as well for a female troll as it does a male.
---
I was pretty well hooked from day one. But i think it was the 30s that did me in. Once you get to stv, it turns into a battlefield—loved it.
---
Idk spaming level 1 hex on troll for the 20% reduct in healing for 2 minutes at rank 1! How is this so underlooked. Kind of stomps out will of the forsaken.
---
After filtering for your region, timezone, language, and type (PVP/PVE/RP), you are unlikely to have more than one server to choose from.
---
How long did this fight last
---
I played WC3 with my dad; a year later he showed me the WoW website, and I loved the idea of playing a character in that world. He got me the game when it came out and I played it straight through TBC, when I quit for Warhammer Online and played that for a year... been playing WoW on and off ever since.
---
Really glad they're bringing Classic back, it's the one version of the game I never got tired of.
---
Unless you're in the Mountain Timezone, because you'll likely have to choose Pacific or Central.
---
Roll a tank and dungeon grind to max level. You get parties almost instantly.
---
I say you'll be bored if you do classic content in retail because you'll get through at light speed and no difficulty. It'll be a ghost town. Some one thought I was being a prick for saying this. But why not save the new experience for when everyone else is playing it together. Wait for classic to launch.
---
Check out shaman spells cost around lvl 45-60 and how many
---
Would you rather he give you the cold shoulder? I'll show myself out...
---
I was torn on shaman for world pvp because i think they arent quiite as good as say, a subtley rogue (who can choose the ideal moment to attack and gib you with a prep combo), or even druid with their massive mobility (being able to flee any losing fight with travel form and then stealthing in a corner is massively valuble)
---
Shaman definetly is toward the upper end of the pvp spectrum however, and in retrospect i probably should have edged toward putting them as a check mark, judging from all the feedback!
---
My undead priest will see you there, beware the living.

There are a handful of posts like this, so yes.

I imagine there will be much more people with some experience in WoW or other MMOs than complete newbies, but there are always newbies.
---
i should said "more optimized than pservers". Since it runs a lot better than pservers with crap hardware.
---
Check the guild recruitment postings. There are a few NA morning raiding guilds looking for members. I'm sure that they will have room after the 60 day falloff.

Did you actually read the op
---
There are toxic people in every community, classic wow is no different.  I know what you mean though, about supporting a company that you feel abandoned its base.  I'm hoping that classic will be a fantastic success, even more than blizzard is expecting - and that it will open their eyes on how to proceed in the future.   
---
One more thing about the community and toxicity.  I posted a picture of my hand holding a nail a couple years ago - in a woodworking forum.  I got comments on my apparently dainty hand.  People are ass-hats everywhere you go no matter what.  There was a toxic community present during vanilla.  There will be a toxic community in classic, and everywhere else you find human beings until the end of time.  Don't fall into a victim mindset because you encounter "toxic" people.  Have a good time in spite of them, instead of letting them take something you enjoy.

I wouldn't worry, man. This degree of macro'ing isn't necessary. It's good, I recommend you try it, and it will improve your gameplay, but it isn't necessary. You won't even reap the benefits of it until you're high level, at which point you'll have been playing the game for a month or two. Then you'll be ready for a little more complexity.
---
From what I've seen on Pservers, Barrens chat nowadays is white supremacist spouting their shit and people reusing 15 year old memes everyone has heard a million times before.
---
I wouldnt complain if all the white supremacist dudes were banned.
---
Tailoring...Grind humanoids, get cloth, make bags, profit immensely. Then drop tailoring once the demand goes down.
---
Retail is not an mmo. It's a single player action rpg, the multiplayer aspect of retail is an afterthought.
---
Ele Sham is not neutral in WPvP.
---
What about complete guilds with ONLY newbies? That would be pretty cool
---
And those who can’t teach, teach gym.
---
I'd like to disagree with this. During lower levels, like 1 to 40, gear means much more than talents. I believe certain weaknesses of being support specced could be mitigated with gear.
---
If you want to make some gold once everyone gets to 60, you could try LBRS jump runs to get the Arcanite Reaper plans + robe of the Archmage pattern + Greater fire protection potion recipe.
---
Cant wait for first aid to be relevant again
---
You can start one.
---
Some aoe grinding mage who used to speedlevel on private server made a video about the private server to classic differences, which he could test since he got a beta invite. He also talked about some non mage related stuff.
---
For example that unlike private server (with dynamic respawn turned off) the respawn timers of mobs killed at the same time aren't the same. So when mobs die at the same time some of them might respawn 4 minutes some 5 minutes and others 6 minutes after kill. 
---
Another thing is, that if a whole camp is wiped out or close to being wiped out, it automatically spawns in some enemies, he mentioned after he killed the remaining enemies in a camp 1-3 instantly respawned after his pull. So blizzard itself is using some kind of intelligent dynamic respawn systems, not comparable to private server dynamic respawns at launch at a 3 second rate in starting areas. I'm pretty sure that's what Kevin Jordan is referring to in that clip.
---
&gt;punching ostriches
---
How exotic. I've heard they're like plainstriders but from another world...
---
Probably Trolls. They are the most "Human" looking of the Horde I seem to recall.
---
When I was 9 or so, my brother and his friends had a LAN party at our house. One of them had brought a small server or something, I don’t know what it was, but they played WoW on it, with nobody else. The friend who had brought the box that I now think is a server gave us different kinds of powers. I remember being a tiny tauren running really, really fast around in Mulgore. 
---
I think my brother’s friend introduced the gang of friends to WoW on this LAN, because later I would often watch my brother play WoW while I played alot of WC3. He sometimes let me play on my own character on his account (omg account sharing) and I had a female night elf hunter with blue hair and skin, and no markings, as I wanted to make the Archer unit from WC3.
---
After a while of playing on his account, I got my own one in the middle of TBC. 
---
Since then I always played in a guild and raider with my brother for all the expansions up until now. He is still on the fence about playing Classic,  as he’s working alot and still playing BFA aswell.
---
But I’m sure he’ll join in when I tell him how fun Classic is.
---
Undead warrior tank here. Love your class and race and play what looks best in your opinion.
---
So it's normalized between families, but what about the specific named uniques that you can tame? That's really what I'm asking about. It was best that way and when they normalized it I was very disappointed.
---
Can we dispense with this crap? Hunter still performs fine and has its role in raids even through naxx, just stop.  I mained a hunter that raided through half of naxx in vanilla, every guild still brought hunters.
---
Movement speeds, resistances and "magic damage" (aka lupos doing shadow damage) is all normalized. Specific pets keep their attack speed. Broken Tooth is still 1.0 AS.
---
All the more reason to wait for classic AIR?
---
Thanks mate. This will be cool!
---
Thanks. It worked.
---
Im pretty much a complete newbie. Watching guides and shit before hand tho. The people i start woth, has mostly extensive knowledge of the game though.
---
Cheers dude!
---
Gotcha. Well I'd still prefer how it was originally... But keeping at least attack speeds is good.
---
Wouldn't it be ironic if the people then realized that Vanilla PvE was actually as mindnumbingly simple as they've told them for ages and then everyone quits within a month?
---
Big yikes
---
Yes, you need a active sub for the stress test.
---

---
I'm glad everyone is so focused on birds, bears and cats. Fires I'll be the only one with a piggy. (Best pet)
---
I used Titan Bar XP. Its not a bar, but it shows time to level and the amount of mobs you need at your current pace. IIRC it shows time to level" as default and shows you your XP (both in numbers and percentage) id you mouseover.
---
It might be slightly faster in a few places, but the mechanics of the instance make stealth somewhat redundant.
---
Honestly how empty the world is just kills it for me. I can enjoy aspects of retail and that's why I still play it periodically but the open world feels dead and I hate it. I play on a high (not locked/full) pop realm and even leveling right when BFA launched there were so few people (I assume because of the way they shard things not because people weren't playing). It just did not feel like a living world at all. I would rather run into some busy bottlenecks than have such an empty world, but I guess I am the minority in that regard.
---
You don't need to look at any guide, or any video, or whatever. All the "vets", or casuals, or elitist assholes present in this sub have mostly begun in Vanilla as MMO noobs. And I thing this is great part of the fun.
---
If you want to play this game "competitively" (a PvE game, which content has been cleared again and again, even 15 years ago.. lol), which is very unlikely from what I deduct from your post, then yes just go ahead and tryhard and be more knowledgeable than anyone before release.
---
But imo you should just take it as it comes. Level slowly if you feel like it, discover the fantasy of your class/race, and of course not let influence your choice by the multiple stupid posts you can see in this subreddit such as "X class/race is best, barely anyone will want to play with you if you play with Y class/race". Most players will be casual or chill people that don't give a damn about minmaxing.
---
Be yourself, let your experience be original. And if somehow one day you get bored or want to tryhard more, then look at guides. I would not like this game that much if not for all the good memories gathered during my slow leveling / slow progression at level 60.
---
TLDR : There will be more casual / chill people than vets. You'll be fine. If you cross path with assholes, then just ignore them and avoid them in the future. They are the minority.
---
Not at level 15 buddy.
---
Yes. A Plainstrider from Mulgore will have a 2.0 attack speed while an Ornery Plainstrider from The Barrens has a 1.3 attack speed.
---
I might be able to save you a trip. https://www.crucial.com/usa/en/advisor might be able to tell you if you're RAM IS upgradeable or not. As far as other parts go your manual would be the place to look. If you don't have your manual still I've had pretty good luck with https://www.manualslib.com/.  If all you're doing is replacing the ram then that's something that is pretty easy to do on your own. Keep in mind that opening up a the laptop case might invalidate the warranty though, so that's something to consider if it's still within warranty coverage.
---
Bruh yes I rly feel this .... Like wtf!!!!!

During my 10 day trial a few months after release. I had played the open beta and enjoyed it, but it didnt catch me properly until my second go at it.
---
Yes, unfortunately there is no button for options or version.
---
Tagged for discord update
---
Same. There's nothing i want to play besides classic, so i'm just messing around on a pserver until it launches.
---
Most profession guides will mention what items are used for quests, could be a start if you want to compile the list yourself.
---
The reality is that most players that does PvP, are also raiders. They will not have a single point in shadow.
---
Beserking could only be used after being critically struck and you would take increased damage when used for 25% increase in spell/attack speed.
---
Was priest racial even in the game when it launched? I can't recall. I feel like shadowguard would have been used but I don't recall ever using it while leveling.
---
There was no pvp trinkets either for fears. It was a different game when people were starting their characters.
---
&gt;"found some Legos in storage"
---
That's not how this happened. Why do people lie about such weird things?
---
If you're in the US, make sure you actually get sick on the 26th.
---
I later played Warhammer Online, Guild Wars 2, and Elderscrolls Online at release through most of the initial content.  Haven't touched any other MMOs, but am contemplating WoW classic.  I love MMO games, but I can't enjoy them unless I hop in at release and evolve with the population progression.
---
My favorited city along thunderbluff. !!
---
Yeah! My brother loves Classic, but he has always been a hardcore raider. He knows that Classic will be time consuming, and doesn’t think he can fit Classic hardcore raiding into his schedule. Therefore he will, for now, stay with BFA as it fits his schedule more.
---
classic has scaling IIRC, PS got the values wrong, nobody believed those procs should scale 100% 1:1 with SP.
---
Get to Level 60 before year's end, I have a week off around release and probably play at least 20 hours per week after that, so this is definitely doable while also taking the time to run dungeons, read quests ect.
---
Get to exalted with Orgrimmar as an Undead, for the wolf mount. Wanted to do this back in Vanilla, but it's pretty difficult as max level while grinding Runecloth turn-ins. Much better if you plan your journey from Level 1 and do all Orgrimmar rep quests (bearing in mind you only get full rep gain for doing the quest while it's yellow).
---
Get to Rank 10 as a Shadow Priest. The set is perfectly stated for SPs and pretty much the best full set (besides Rank 13) you can get before AQ40/Naxx. And even then it's still decent.
---
Raid a bit, but nothing too hardcore. I had my hardcore raiding days in WoTLK and Cataclysm, and while that was fun, I don't really have any intention to go back to that (and I have odd working hours so I probably couldn't commit to a normal weekday evening raiding schedule). If I can clear MC for Anathema, clear ZG, AQ20 and do some BWL for off-set items, I'll be satisfied with that.
---
Jewelcrafting didn't exist before BC.

I feel like an outcast because I love Shaun of the Dead but thought Hot Fuzz was sort of meh.
---
lmao there is so many things you can trash retail for like a good circlejerker, you don't have to make shit up you sandwich
---
Yeah they shouldn’t reset Azeroth when there is still so much left to explore like actual mount hyjal, more belf zones, dragon isles, ogres. They could also rebuild gilneas and silver moon. So much left they can do before a new story is required.
---
not sure if it was 30 seconds in on my first character, a warlock, when i cast shadow bolt.  I was about 15 and i had always loved magic users in RPGs but it was so different for me - i was used to things like baldurs gate and D&amp;D where spells were much more sparse and didn't feel as immersive.  the animation and effects of shadow bolt was gorgeous, and playing a 3D RPG felt great  
---
either, or a little later when i rerolled to a rogue and was questing in elwynn, trying to find the murloc-murdered stormwind guards.  I never actually found them on that character... but i remember getting my first green around there and being amazed haha
---
and then leveling in westfall.. first to get a mid-length cape out of my RL friends.  first to get shoulder armour.  it was around the time i was really getting into metal music too and i have very distinct memories.  First time running deadmines, first time going on a raid - an epic journey on the deeprun tram, jumping off the dam, running through teh wetlands scared of crocs, arriving in ashenvale and seeing a lvl 40 pala on a mount, following him in a glorious charge...
---
This is such a good description of modern WoW.
---
by the 20's you can be spending 20-30 silver depending on rank on some skills iirc.
---
Lol I feel that I like it cause the lore and atleast my pvp set will be plate
---
Classic players larping about playing on retail to fit in, name more iconic duo
---
That's pretty much exactly what I was looking for. Thanks! :D
---
Depends on what ur after. If you wanna raid naxx, you've gotta be ontop of your game. 
---
I for one am excited to play classic because you can choose to play it pretty relaxed. Like almost every game out there is super hard high intensity. I want an online game where I can just chill with friends, listen to a podcast, and turn my brain off for a while.
---
The Barrens are actually a great place to level.
---
Really useful tip for those that will go melee leveling. Will do as soon as I ding 16.
---
Just like the transparent kitties, alliance area pets bear a certain prestige.
---
I mean there are, but only for healing.  There's really nothing there that helps you with solo mob killing other than consecration but vanilla's consecration helps you run out of mana long before it helps you kill a mob or two.
---
More druids than paladins holy shit what happened ?
---
And then someone buzzes you from downstairs and your dial-up disconnects because it goes through the phone, too.
---
pretty sure guilds like that will form, it´s a pretty good idea.
---
Yep. You got me. Glorified monkey pushing keys. I know nothing of scheduling, manpower, planning and executing test schedules based on timetables, availabilities, and ensuring we come in under 5% variance.  
---
Have a great day!
---
&gt; You can also play for free up to level 20, but is that enjoyable if I'm playing by myself?
---
Leveling in Retail is almost entirely a solo enterprise until you reach the latest expansion.
---
What the fuck is a bonus roll
---
I read that on here somewhere before. Some guy wanted to multibox to 60 then xfer or migrate to 1 account. The response was a yes.
---
I remeber a video from 2 wow developers, a man and a woman, and she said they aren't playing any paid services at this time IIRC. (can't remeber what the source is to link, sorry!)
---
I will be doing something similar, so I'm hopeful I can merge them too, but I'm not fussed if not because I'll still play them both but only raid with one. Other will be gatherer and auctioneer
---
The entire point of grinding bad a mage is that you do it in an area where you don’t have to wait for respawns lol.
---
Mugler and Eurostar? lol that's great XD
---
If you want to heal levelling dungeons any spec is fine. If you want to tank you absolutely needed consecration for threat on 3+ mobs and you sorly want most of your prot talents for single target aswell as aoe treath. The spec you are talking about might make it posible to tank but I would suggest only playing whit ppl on voice and making sure everyone follows kill targets.
---
One thing that bugs me in retail is, if everyone is awesome is anyone awesome? It's like the participation trophy of games.
---
Blood on the steps to the throne and i think the crown is on the ground too.
---
No - do not - I'm not just saying that because I'm personally bored of it - I'm saying it because they are 2 different mindsets and you should go into classic with a fresh mind.
---
There is absolutely nothing to be gained playing retail before classic. 
---
It's only 3 weeks until launch - find a show to break up the free time :)
---
Oh God I need to start looking at what I typed and fixing the typos...
---
I'm leaving it
---
You can merge Battle.NET accounts so that the same login gets you access to multiple WoW accounts, but no, you can never transfer characters between WoW accounts in any version of the game.
---
They are not normalised. Pet attack speed normalisation began in TBC. If Broken Tooth has an attack speed of &gt;1.0 you will see riots on the streets, and yours truly will be leading it.
---
NOMEGALUL- game isn't out yet - 90% of people on this sub wont be playing thr game come this time next year.
---
Not because of it being a bad game... because its 2019/2020 and there are plenty of top tier games to put hundreds of hours into instead of a 15 year old game.
---
As much as I like the UC and TB, gotta say I love me some Silvermoon.
---
A retail thing where green quest rewards can proc to blue or higher. Was added in 8.1.5 i think:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/b1ce1l/i_got_a_upgrade_on_a_lvl_20_quest_to_give_me_an/
---
I seem to recall a video of some developers calling the first 2 expansions "the trilogy" meaning vanilla, tbc and wotlk.
---
If anything, I can see them starting these servers but in terms of additional content post naxx, I'm not convinced they could do it justice enough to release it to us
---
It's all bells &amp; whistles with no heart.
---
Honestly they had to make adjustments to allow for this. The leveling expert was utter shit on retail. With the changes to amount of experience per level I could get through the old level range for MoP in one of their zones.   Now at least people have more choices on where they want to level. 
---
Rumors are there is going to be a level squish so who knows what it will look like then.
---
Because hyperbolic statements and manufactured drama = views = money. 
---
It's what you do when you can't actually entertain people.
---
Is that a spell u get in classic? Or a spell u get if ur standing in the right place?? I'm a warlock but never knew this lol
---
Marks is a much slower and worse leveling spec than BM, even at low levels.
---
This is so true, I played pservers from tbc to cata and I saw how bad people can play. Pserver players are not some elite players that understand everything in the game.
---
In a wotlk server people shittalked me because, I, as a healer, used scarab brooch instead of another trinket. Valanyr, the legendary mace for healing had a worse effect than that trinket, and people didn't used it because it was a low level trinket.
---
The majority follow guides but don't try to understand it.
---
In cata, I was in a raid that wiped to Argaloth, this boss is the easiest raid boss ever, from vanilla to cata I don't think there is a easier boss than this. Literally was "tank swap every time boss does X skill" "dps, dont stand on fire" "healers, dispell magic when the boss uses Y skill".
---
If the average player in classic wow is worse than pserver ones, then nobody will be rolled over by anyone
---
If you are tanking while leveling yes get consecrate and go full ret after that - make sure you have a shield of course. Holy isn't necessary for healing while leveling - keep int gear along the way to switch to it.
---
It was definitely a thing at one point. And so were HARP builds.
---
Not confirmed.
---
Above it yes. You walk through the throne room to enter UC, and I don't think there are guards there.
---
They most certainly can. The chance was added in 8.1.5.
---
There are quite a few people playing level 20 f2p. With a trial account you can twink your level 20 quite easily, and play in the level 20-29 bgs. I’ve been playing the last few weeks and it’s been fun
---
Not sure it will help me when classic launches,  but just getting a feel for the controls and stuff was my objective.
---
Same with the private servers i played on.  It's fine most the time.  Do you only take brand name stuff or do you get the generic sometimes?
---
Someone posted on this the other day. Basically we don't know if private server numbers or actual classic numbers are correct when it comes to the spell coefficient on these proc items. So basically we'll have to wait until lunch to find out if any of these items scale with spell power 100% or near. If so a lot of other meme specs might become somewhat viable or very viable
---
Didn't confirm that- they just said server transfers would be implemented 100% for people that start on a server and make friends with people on other servers.
---
You used to be able to. I have done it before 100%.
---
Ive got multiple accounts and even transfered my still 70 hunter with thori'dal to my brothers account.
---
you sick fuck
---
Ok... First, let u/Jimmykreedz also know about this screenshot, I saw you guys tralking too.
---
Second, imho ofc Try for free. Follow the steps and at any step you will be asked/will be at the menu we all are talking about. Good luck. :D
---
Can strongly recommend watching ‘the boys’. 
---
It’s on amazon prime or easily googled
---
Thanks man, much appreciated.  Yea I was trying to go for self-sustain with some oomph.  I really liked the Blood DK DPS playstyle for pvp in wrath so I'm trying to feel out the different classes and find the one that plays most similarly.
---
I hope someone imports the Alliance Guide from VanillaGuide into that. I'm surprised no one has ported over VanillaGuide, seems like a very simple Addon to me.
---
and why the internet was so slow
---
I'm sure it's vocal minority, even if it's 40% it's minority. A global Blizzard poll is the only way to tell us the truth here.
---
Aight. You know any other instances that would be good for stealth running?
---
~33.3%.
---
I have said far worse shit...
---
cringe.
---
No. Earliest date that makes sense would be the 8. Aug to get the Stresstest.
---
Everyone plays the game differently. I mostly clicked to see if there are any good UI addons people reccomend specifically for classic. I need at very minimum a bartender type addon so I can make my action bars 3×4 because I have a naga and its irritating to use flat bars with it. Theres nothing wrong with using addons if it helps someone enjoy the game more. The world doesn't revolve around you and stuff like this has no affect on you. Shocking I know.
---
I would do the free to 20 before you decide to renew at least. Subscription or not you'd likely be playing alone till after 20 anyway for the most part. And that way if you don't like it, you didn't subscribe early for nothing.
---
&gt; NOMEGALUL
---
Completely unrelated, but you with this word is like a child that just learned how to roll their eyes and doesn't know how to do anything but. ~40 times in the last 2 days. Time to broaden your vocabulary kid.
---
You'll have to find them yourself on the server you choose but yeah there is nothing coming out in August and most top streamers will be playing it (for a week at least)
---
I think it depends if you are a hybrid or not for the most part. But like people said it does start to add up and a lot of the skills you don't even need at all
---
I expected nothing more from a guy named joe lol
---
Too bad there aren’t any classic WoW guides 🙄
---
Nope. Just one. On private server it was very hard to take aggro off of my carrion bird mid-40s
---
As an Alliance, Undercity was always my favorite city to raid and explore. So many cool corridors and bridges.
---
If (like me) you recently resubbed and tried to download the client from whichever live version you left off on, you probably didn't have the updated client (also like me) found here in step 3:  [https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/wowclassic](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/wowclassic) Download and run it = new client and the proper Classic install from the drop-down.
---
i started playing on a private server last year without any real knowledge of vanilla. despite having a reputation for being full of tryhard veteran players, nobody was ever outwardly rude to me. i played both a dps and a healer and most everyone i met was more than willing to be patient and understanding with me, give me tips and items ect. you'll be fine, you should play!
---
South Park episode... that is all
---
What if you need the AH
---
You can still quest, but no skills.  Hotbar must be empty besides racial passive and consumables
---
/r/classicwowplus
---
&gt; You just need an active sub.
---
Nah. The reason to have devilsaur is the hit rating. If you’re not at 9% you don’t take them off until you would be without them.

Just dont be a tauren... you wont fit through those doorways while mounted.  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Literally just go on willitclassic and save yourself some time.
---
Back at vanilla I named my turtle pet fishfucker, somehow I played with that pet for well over a month before I eventually got a three day ban, and came back to a pet named Turnther.

Im setting mine to the Gallow's End.

---
Gnome warrior here. Try and shatter me.
---
Best one is Zygor, Classic release is confirmed
---
Yea that's kind of how I remember the spells costing. But this counters your point above.......
---
That will be the reality for a lot of people, but not everyone will quit and there will still be enough to play the game which is what matters.
---
I got super pumped when Chromie said that but didn’t tear up until they finally showed the dwarf hunter at the end. The whole trailer gives me chills every damn time.
---
Yeah this is basically suicide. There is no way you're going to get there and not waste tons of time dying to swarms of alliance players. I'll stick to a boar, thanks.
---
Is it just me or does the throne look like a vagina
---
Classic won't die in 2-3 months, it will die DOWN in 2-3 months. The hype will be over, most of the tours will have ended, realm populations will begin to stabilize and we'll have a reasonable look at the long term population sizes.
---
Any who actually thinks classic will die in a few months can safely be ignored as it's obvious they have no idea what they're talking about or just trolling
---
you'll be completely useless in a raid scenario without healing.
---
Althought I really would try reconsider your stance on healing. I'm a dps player myself and never wanted to try it out, but when I did I found that it wasn't really that bad. And besides raiding is like 6 hours a week maybe 10 when AQ/naxx comes out. It's not that huge deal if you are a bit bored of your class doing raids.
---
4weird...
---
I never found it to be that busy, compared to Org, which is a bland lump of rock. And the orgs colour palette sucks too.
---
Fools work makes me sleepy
---
Come on, what about the "I play with no screen" challenge?  
---
And the "I play with no screen and no sound" challenge?
---
Not to mention the ultimate "I play with no screen, no sound and no keyboard" challenge?
---
Bats look cooler with a troll hunter don't @ me
---
Good reminder to rewatch this episode for the 100th time before Classic launches.
---
Could be - but I wouldn't spend $70 a month in "Hope of them enabling it"
---
Why did it shut down? Did blizzard do the lawyer shut down trick?
---
Slightly better stealth maybe? The tauren hit box and stomp are too good though imo
---
Here we go lol... just because YOU don't like them doesn't mean they don't exist.
---
I find the generic foods taste better.
---
The hard core population is a good look at which classes will be at 60 most often though, no?
---
The AH market is going to be significantly different, with everyone leveling at the same time and also saving their gold. A lot of people will be putting ore and skins up on the market to try and make some coin. The question is, are the Crafters going to be buying it if it's too expensive? I feel like prices will be pushed way down for a while.
---
Great for every troll class but especially hybrid casters, Priest and Shaman.
---
Hey look, this thread again
---
What you crazy dawg.
---
Set it to Kargath and fly to UC to experience all those lovely plaugelands.
---
&gt;everyone wants to be useful
---
&gt;nobody wants to be hybrid
---
significant data
---
I actually took a different approach than to find a guild off the bat who can meet my schedule. 
---
I found a solid group of people who seem level headed, fun and like minded. I'm going to roll with them, we will be on a busy server. It's gonna take me months to get to 60 anyways. I will figure out the raid stuff later. 
---
In a busy server if you're in a good guild, there's always groups running or you team up with other people who have similar schedules
---
Of course the second question asked is about brack rotus
---
DP is definitely bad against cleansing classes such as pallies
---
Wait. Why not just keep the bat? Why go to Westfall after? Sorry noob
---
Raid logging is a thing
---
Depends on the class but on average I’d say you save well over 100g by the time you’re 60. 
---
It’s vital to skip unnecessary skills till level 40 so you can afford your mount. After 40 you can start training more skills if you want. But I like to get my 100% mount on the same day I hit 60 so I will be very careful with my gold spending throughout the entire leveling process.
---
In terms of PvP: Enhancement can be fun, but it's heavily RNG and you have a lot less tools at your disposal than a Rogue or Warrior. Totems offer great utility but shamans primary benefits are to a group, and enhancement is pretty reliant on other melee just to take some of the pressure off you.
---
Elemental is great fun and probably a lot more self sufficient, given it's a caster that has the ability to self-peel, self heal, and reliably nuke an enemy. But they can be easily overwhelmed by multiple enemies, so they're strongest when they have support from a group.
---
For raiding? Either Elemental or Enhancement, you will likely be asked to off-heal often.

---
Good thread! I wonder if there is a list of required items that drop from mobs when you arent on the quest? Like the ones in Westfall that require hops, etc that you can get anytime?
---
Keep those ideas for retail, then go play retail and let us play classic ;)
---
i was referring to peoples crap hardware, not the server hardware. Classic runs better on crappy pcs than pservers do. I was getting several times more fps on the classic beta without a dgpu than i got on pservers.
---
Did exactly the same thing, and when you finally see someone they will be outrageous with their gear and items. So empty and void of meaning.
---
Yep they got a cease and desist. The server had about 15k people playing at peak hours so you can see why Blizzard wanted those customers back... thinking they'd come back to retail hahaha
---
I'm waiting until Aug 25-26 to subscribe. I see no point to subscribe 2 weeks in advance to lock my name/server
---
resto pvp is amazing!!!! surprised its neutral to be honest. grounding totem, poison cleansing, earth bind, tremor totem.
---
big scuffle on a point in AB? chain heal is OP AF!!! earth shock and purge the other casters? remove that freedom the warrior just got???
---
The only thing I can think of at this point, is that you need to opt in for the beta. 
---
You can do this on battle.net by logging in -&gt; Games &amp; Subscriptions -&gt; Bottom of page -&gt; Go to Beta Profile Settings -&gt; Select WoW classic.
---
Then restart the battle.net app afterwards.
---
Thats the plan. Tyty
---
You can play on a Private Server with hardware that has absolutely no chance of even launching Classic.
---
I’m waiting for the cinematic when you first choose your character, can’t wait
---
Tons of DPS against Thekal in Zul'Gurub if you use it before he dies and respawns at 80% life!
---
nvm ... but you can still try to get the right screen. Only there can start any install at all and maybe you have the classic option in the Version-drop down. That's what I would try at least.
---
I think the slowest attack speed bear is actually the Black Bear at the Ironforge Airport with its 2.5 attack speed.
---
He's taking about items with spell damage procs scaling with spell damage.
---
Spinebreaker
---
Does it?, you probably need to buy most of them. You can't just choose to buy two spells and save 50g for your mount, maybe you can save something like 10g.
---
For pve advantage you have the wisp form. That alone will be amazing while youre leveling so you can corpse walk faster. If you wipe in a raid or dungeon you'll get back quicker too. Shadowmeld would be nice to have if the groups about to wipe or you're a dps warrior and the tank just died. You can dodge repair bills. I'm going to be playing a nelf priest solely so I can meld and res in dungeons to avoid having to run back.

He's essentially just admitting that he was one of the scrubs that got carried by his guild.
---
I found a youtube video a few years ago from Classic/TBC era with me and a few other people I know. I messaged the guy who posted the vid and we made a Discord now he is bringing a few other people from our original server along with him to make a guild @ launch. We have about 30 people now hanging around in there and most of them all come from knowing someone in that original 4-5 man group in the YouTube 13+ year old video.
---
My dude is still like 90 i think. I came back during legion and rolled alliance,  but was happy to see the ol guys return
---
Or calling someone a deserverd retard. I mean i played with people on a daily basis i called retarded. I mean it was fine they acted stupid should be ok to call them that. Doesnt mean we cant get along or play together. If iam dumb someone can tell me no biggie.
---
The primary skill involved is finding a group of 39 other people who are not terrible and have the dedication required to get gear good enough to progress.
---
If there is a bigger version of this I think I found a new desktop wallpaper.
---
I honestly like horde a lot more than alliance leveling. There’s something about the barrens I really love and also thousand needles is an interesting zone, I love running through and up the pillars. 
---
But honestly paladins are super duper helpful and are like the one reason that is drawing me to play alliance over horde. 
---
I’ve always been horde so on an unofficial server I’ve tried leveling a character to level 22. I really enjoy westfall and I think deadmines is one of the best dungeons in the game, but however you also have wailing caverns on the horde which is a good dungeon as well ( not quite as good) 
---
Also as horde it’s still decently easy to get to deadmines from grom gol in stv.
---
I leveled a gnome warlock to 45 or so as my first character but finally found my place when I played a Tauren Druid. There’s just something about alliance that doesn’t make me feel as good when playing the game. 
---
So really it just comes down to which side you’ll enjoy more. I’d try playing on an unofficial server on horde and see if y’all enjoy it
---
I stand corrected then, thats fucking dumb.
---
Oh I gotcha. Hm. Just how it says in the title. How about that. -_-
---
Asmonbald, as stated above.
---
I agree. Point still stands, still much more versatile.
---
If he was mashing max rank Healing Touch, he absolutely was going OOM.
---
I don't like working and I have enough money to live comfortably
---
Paladins don't make efficient raid healers. They have no AoE heals or HoTs. They're best at keeping a single target at 100% HP.
---
iT dOsEn'T mAkE sEnSe To mE, LOL
---
You could save 100. I'd say you're missing some important stuff, but if you're AOE leveling in instances with friends and all ur doing is AOE or healing you could get away with very few skills. 
---
At a certain point the skills start costing a ton.
---
In.
---
5 points into blackout is a far larger sacrifice for pve than going undead instead of troll. Going undead means that you will have an iWin button against several classes in world PvP.
---
And all dwarves (Stoneform), and any player that has Jungle Remedy in their inventory.
---
every horde raid will ideally have 8 shamans
---
We have around 15 people who are going to play from my office and half of them are brand new and half vets. I think you will see a lot more first timers than people expect.
---
they have infinite mana and can spam flash of light endlessly
---
it's funny because at the time they had 8k to 9k people nobody cared, then the chinese came, the server got laggy and unstable and blizz shut them down
---
Why is that even a thing??
---
Cool, thank you!
---
Also Beserk, Guts is basically the warrior class fantasy in comic book format.
---
Do hope their expectations are up high.. queues :(
---
Playing Rexxar bonus campaign in W3. The more RPG feeling was exactly what I wanted from the game (had been already doing dumb stuff like creating a hero and then destroying all my buildings in normal games just to play one character). Then when I saw WoW I was sold, totally.
---
I agree.
---
But the reason  why im posting is to give a short insight ive noticed over the years when playing retail.
---
In vanilla pretty much all the quests give you  directions...  so you can  easily find the mobs you are looking for in 99% of cases (just follow  the direction they give and what kind of a location they say it is, cave/ruins/forest). This was the case when i tried nostalrius, i sometimes slipped into retail-mindset and i became impatient and didnt read (tried to use 13 year old memory) and didnt find what i wanted... so then i slapped myself and read the quest and lord behold i found it easily.
---
In contrast on retail RIGHT NOW almost all of the quests (prove me  wrong) dont give you directions.... because they dont have to. And this is very much unlike the game i first started playing so many years ago.
---
These days you just dont need to read shizzle... ingame quest-helper holds your hand  all the way through, and when it doesnt its double frustrating because the quest text doesnt help  at all and the quest-helper is not accurate enough.    
---
I had this angery experience during legion once and it made me realize how useless the quest-descriptions have become. :(
---
I never used quest-helpers nor did i want to but  when blizzard added it into the default UI, i had no choice.
---
Im sure im not the only one but im probably part of the minority anyway.
---
They have the greatest single target healing capability in the game. They also have Blessing of Light which further increases their healing ability. 
---
They also have Blessing of Kings, which is insanely good for progression, because it's the difference between a tank being dead and a tank not being dead.
---
Paladin healing is also the highest before a raid starts to get geared. Basically Paladins busted, man.
---
I like how you assume you know something better than someone who literally did it.
---
Yo what's a brosis
---
&gt;It’s almost entirely useless. 
---
Except ya know.. it adds fun. 
---
Which is a completely foreign concept to modern WoW development
---
Play the better faction
---
Close to release, there wheren't as many quests available and they introduced more later, so people could avoid grinding. 
---
Also you will level much faster if you supplement grinding with questing and vice versa for different level ranges. 
---
And coordinated dungeon grinds or AOE grinding can be much faster too. 
---
At the end of the day, would you rather hit 60 asap and grind or would you rather do pointless time-consuming quests with shitty droprate that require you to travel to another continent?
---
I have done this months ago. It's likely cause I don't have a sub. Or maybe I need to have BfA installed as a trial version.
---
Why is Elemental good for pvp but neutral for world pvp? Can you explain the difference? 
---
Also, resto has some incredible leveling talents. By level 22 you can get improved reincarnation which means less corpse runs and you can have +3% hit chance for both melee attacks and spells which since there's no hit gear leveling is really good.
---
I am in contact with a swedish guild that would like to join but their GM has no access to reddit. How can he get into contact with someone of this initiative?
---
Make shit up? I have also gotten epic at level 9 from one quest.
---
Imo night elves are better.. more agility and war stomp is rarely useful for a druid
---
I'll be at the beach the week before Classic drops so all my anticipation is for BEACH TRIP. These next few weeks will be prep, packing, and getting stuff in order before I leave. I'll go on vacation, blink and then playing Classic. c:
---
 Hello, I have played multiple Paladins recently and found them to be very slow levelers even as Ret despite what people are saying. I changed my talents up so many times leveling trying to find something faster and it never really happened. Kill speed is one thing but the issue is that you run out of mana either way(mana = faster kills = stopping to drink = more downtime)  
---
If you are dead set on it I would suggest going into the holy tree for Divine strength, Improve Seal of Righteousness, and Consecration. Then go over to the protection tree and increasing your defensive through those talents such as redoubt, Toughness, or Precision, and aim for picking up Blessing of Kings. From there you can just invest into either tanking or healing whichever you see yourself doing more when it comes to 5 man content. Eventually you can just start grabbing multiple mobs at a time and aoe'ing them all down. It definitely helps with a group ofc  
---
It won't be fast but Paladins are not fast levelers anyway. They just never die
---
That's all great, but if im doing half the dps of the top in naxx, im not happy. 
---
Judge me for that if you will.
---
...I found a horse girl MMO that's holding my attention.
---
What? No! Prot paladins experience mostly negative bugs, and will do *better* (but still not raid viable) in classic!
---
- SoR properly proccing on-hits will significantly improve tps or mana sustain.
---
- Proper holy resist (i.e. none) will improve tps.
---
- SoR resists were an issue on Nost (not sure about other servers)
---
The only significant positive bug was Consecration scaling with AP.. However, this mostly affected Ret dps, as Prot paladins only ever got a small amount of AP from their base strength.
---
In case you're talking about the current state of classic: bears, and even warriors, are absolutely better tanks during the levelling phase of the game. Prot paladins only really shine in pre-raid 5mans. Pre-60 mana is too much of an issue, and in raid gear you can just use a dps warrior to cleave stuff down.
---
Lmk why YOU think it doesn't make sense.
---
Shouldn't there be a little asterisk for the 26th for us NA folks? Unless Im mistaken our release is mid-evening of the 26th.
---
Uh, there isn't much AoE heal anyway in classic. And HoT's are pretty expensive and often overheal as someone else heals them up to 100% if you're not the only heal. And Flash of Light is a fast heal not healing too much why I'd say it's pretty effective in raid healing. However, yes, they often used as tank healer too as they can just spam flash of light.
---
I was there. And I was fucking mad.
---
I feel that way too. I'm gonna be that priest hanging out in the starter zones giving away wands to the little new priests running around. Still gonna raid but I gotta level enchanting somehow and wands are kinda a huge help at that level. (Itll probably be something like trade me something I can de and you can have a free wand otherwise I'll just be hemorrhaging gold at the start)
---
They can. Because I have gotten one.
---
I can see the RP now
---
But classic left me not the other way around
---
HoTs are some of the most mana efficient healing and there's plenty of raid-wide damage to want AoE healing.

It’s become an arcade game and lost it mmo.

Never was a fan of the throne room in the game. It's way too small and nothing happens there. This looks much better and closer to the wc3 cinematics.

---
Lmao I'm in the same situation as you (quit at TBC release, dabbled in privates since 2017).
---
I'm going to resub early for the name reservations. But I also think I'll try out modern WoW so I can appreciate Classic more.
---
Which would make great raid healers.
---
I second this.
---
Almost every female race have better cast animations than the corresponding male ones.
---
I'm going alliance and have used Joanna's guide up to 40 on a private server and it worked really well. From looking at Allyroute the thing I think I would miss is the check boxes for me to know where I'm up to. I really like the idea of not having to go to Stonetalon though. That was really rough as alliance.
---
Translation:
---
I currently don't have a sub but i still want to check out the stress test, and i'm not willing to resub for it
---
Its okay bro, just be fair, at least with yourself
---
Two, which is infinitely more than Paladins.
---
Well, eventually someone will create the naked gnome community and there'll be an epic and final battle
---
All bells 
---
And whistles 
---
No heart
---
They can’t aoe heal
---
I think that was the big problem. There was far too little time to do it before TBC came out
---
This is what I’m going to use it for. I have an entire guild to ask for layer invites too. Gonna be sweet.

translation: im a cheapskate and think people should give me stuff for free

The priests aren't throwing out hots.   They're not really using aoe heals.   They're casting single target heals on the raid to raid heal.
---
Join the mobile infantry and save AB lumber mill.  
---
  
---
Would you like to know more?
---
I, too, bought some ATVI in anticipation. I expect a pretty huge spike in subs for Classic.
---
Yep, even a trail of blood showing exactly how the crown fell and spun a bit in the cinematic, I love that place, best easter egg in wow.
---
You, sir, are awesome.
---
If you dont wanna sub you cant play. You are gonna sub the get the name anyway? Just sub now. Dont cry
---
Troll females kinda look like elves with mini tusks.  Even some of the orc models don't look so bad in a thicc butch lesbian sort of way.
---
Oof, right in the feels
---
I used Joana's Guide on the Beta and I like it and really want to use it, but sadly he won't finish the Alliance Part before Release T.T
---
The music of the trailer did it for me
---
Shamans are the only one that can really aoe heal.   Prayer of healing has very limited use.
---
This is an awesome guide
---
RemindMe! 20 days
---
Which they very very rarely use.
---
Well the reason nostalrius was shutdown is exactly what you hoped. They saw how popular it was and knew they could make money off it. So they shut it down, only to release it themselves.

More importantly it added Class lore. Also a foreign concept in modern WoW.
---
I'm just happy the abomination guards are back
---
Was it really 1g for first respec? I don't remember that, but then, who remembers their first respec in Vanilla!?
---
15 bucks is nothing
---
I feel like itll be as balanced as retail is. There will be servers with big disparity and servers that are near perfectly balanced. Both factions have advantages and disadvantages in pvp and pve. Alliance has fear ward and stoneform, horde has windfury and tauren hitboxes. Alliance has paladins, horde has shamans. It's a trade off but it's not horribly unbalanced imo.
---
Yolo bitches
---
Yeah they realized Shadowguard is really strong
---
The stress tests have all been on for multiple days, and even if they were to launch the final stress test next week, after lockout reset, you'd still have over a weeks worth of time ready to go for Classic. This isn't even considering the likelihood they'll just pin the last testa nd the name reservation on the same day. 2 weeks before the Launch. 
---
Pay for the sub right before the test, or just don't and wait for release.
---
I’d honestly just bite the bullet and heal. I personally only want to ele PvP but I plan on going resto to raid. It’s very easy to make an ele set while raiding resto. Resto is very desired in raids and easy as fuck. Your dispel is basically auto with totems. Your heal has smart targeting in chain heal. The flip side is ele pve being lackluster and you’ll basically click one button and not stand in things. Enhance will be similarly boring.

---
Because Blizzard truly believes that completely random rewards is a more fun system than rewarding players based on the difficulty of the content that they're doing.
---
Well put!  I couldn't quite out my finger on it but I think you're onto something
---
You’re gonna sub in less than a month. Just do the 6 months and get the ball rolling. Or wait and don’t join the stress test. You’re not missing much.
---
Do you have a link?  I like the style
---
Shaman is horde, priests holy nova is meh. Can't think of anything else raid-wide for now xD And I played druid heal and I neber got that far that HoTs were usefull. But I was also only just raiding MC, AQ20, ZG, UBRS with pugs (thus no heal management). And I was still mostly blue equipped.
---
Shadowmeld shannanigans
---
One thing's for certain, it's not because you don't have a sub. I don't have a subscription and haven't for many months. 
---
(Because BFA is garbage)
---
O my god, are you for  real?
---
I had forgotten this and it goes  WAY back to the very early days when i  literally knew nothing about WoW. 
---
This is a bigger memory trigger  than i realized... the first time i saw Azeroth was through the eyes of a night elf hunter in  teldrassil and later in darkshore. (dat dark blueish moonlight tint, like in the background  of  the downloader)
---
If i could i would press esc irl, go to main menu and restart my life...  ONLY so i can play  this masterpiece again back in 2005.
---
Uh oh, somebody call the Waahhhhmbulance
---
You know those difficulty settings on SP games: Normal, History with some challenge and then History without any challenge... Well retail wow is the last one.
---
And your first thought was to make a racist joke. :(
---
During my 10-day trial. When I died in the Fargodeep mine and decided that this must be one of those "dungeons" the cd case mentioned. I got a group together by inviting random people and communicating in broken English, and the four of us managed to defeat those terrifying kobold geomancers. Then my mom called for dinner and I never logged into that character again. Still, it stuck with me, and in 2005 or 2006 I finally got the real game.
---
Imo pvp racials way more impactful but no point in investing into a char u hate
---
I'm not going to hate on retail, it's just a different genre.  If you want to play an action RPG with more interesting raid mechanics, retail is great.  If you want to play a true RPG, it's all about classic.
---
All male group with no women allowed....I’m not sure that is what you think it is.
---
Right here brother. Can't wait for Classic, been in a void since Nost shutdown.
---
It's a bro or a sis.
---
OP, we need you over at [ClassicRaids.com](https://wow.classicraids.com/guilds)!
---
Prayer of Healing...
---
Mana issues is not a concern in PvP if your target is dead before you run OOM.
---
How is it very limited? Split your priests up between the groups and its just find
---
This sounds great especially for people like me who haven't played Classic and need help remembering special quests with rewards. Great Job!
---
It seems like hunter pets are allowable within the rules? You get the ability from a quest not from training.
---
What makes rogues good for farming? A genuine question because I'm planning on playing one in classic. Is it blade flurry or just high single target damage?
---
I see you have multiple flairs but you're missing the rock flair that you've been living under.
---
How do people live with only 1 or 2 monitors?
---
Wrong.
---
It's really not that rough, you just need to kite between shots.  Although level 8 and 9 are a bit painful.  6-7 are a bit more tolerable because of Concussive Shot.
---
I am all out of rocks.

---
My favourite quote of Boardwalk Empire is
---
Flip a coin. When it's in the air, you'll know what side you're hoping for.
---
We don't want him either.
---
It is very convenient to be able to craft gear while you level.  But I do think the minmax crowd will probably say level with 2 gathering profs and switch it up at 60.
---
Though the truth is its a brand new server and will have a pretty unique economy.  It's not actually 100% clear what the best path will be at the moment.
---
I’d second mage in that in that it’ll be easier to do acceptable DPS for a complete new player, and your healers will appreciate free water.
---
It's not that difficult lol, you just make the trek whilst dead as a ghost and nothing will bother you. When you get to Darkshore you just walk across the water as ghost (scary since you nearly completely fatigue) and walk right into Darnassus. When you walk out of Darnassus there's a Spirit Healer to the right so you just resurrect there and it's close to the area with the level 8-10 owls! I did this back in the day, and in some private servers as a lvl 10 hordie.
---
Awesome ty, ya i was thinking inner focus would be a good use of points just wasnt sure where they would come from.
---
That’s just dev talk, do you honestly think most devs are grinding away at their own game all day everyday for any game? There’s probably the odd job that does but I would puke if I had to work on WoW all day thrn play WoW in my free time aswell. They just don’t want to/can’t say they play other games (if they game at all) or mention specific games other than in broad brushes.
---
I doubt Diablo developers are playing every season even if they say they do.

Take what you want from this.  You could definitely do char xfers between accounts registered to the same name in vanilla but this guy says support said no foe vlassic.  If I were betting id bet the customer support guy is uninformed or misunderstood or something because this would mean they aren't allowing character transfers AT ALL.  I'm sure that's not the case.
---
As someone who mained Alliance in Vanilla I really enjoy Barrens. Also the Undead areas in Lordaeron are really good.
---
So, what about enchanting then?
---
Hmm, I'm inclined to say no just because that would clearly be the dominant class and kind of goes against the spirit of punching, I think.
---
If it were me I'd much rather have a guaranteed better raiding experience than a mildly higher ping. Gear from getting in the right guild &gt; the possibility of not getting a heal off maybe once in a while.
---
Good thing belief has nothing to do with it. When overcoming predictable raid damage, which happens A LOT, Prayer of Healing has more HPS and HPM than any other spell.
---
I did the same. Dude invited me for some instance runs like 10 mins after I logged on. Whole group just talked shit the entire time and kept trying to kick me lol. Wasn't even causing wipes or anything. I was like damn sorry haven't logged on in like 6 years my b. Was not fun.
---
Conga rats!
---
You play a lot of CS and have never downscaled? It’s almost mandatory lol. I jest, it’ll be fine.
---
Warriors benefit a great deal from the spirit buff.  Warrior regen out of combat is .8 * spirit + 6.
---
Why? Druid tanks are perfectly fine, they are better than warriors on some bosses and brings unique things that a prot warrior dosent + they almost dont use any of the same gear meaning that having 1 druid tank will make everyone gear up faster. Druids are way less gear dependant and have strong arguments for being better than prot warriors in MC and most of BWL + in naxx they are legit prefered on some bosses. They also have better dps on bosses where you dont need as many tanks.
---
This is true but i should habe mentioned im a pvper and was talking about that aspect bg wise
---
Huh? What's so unbelievable about someone playing nostalrius? They had something like 100k accounts. It's not such an exclusive club.

I’m gonna laugh if classic kills retail. I’ve been playing the same troll shaman since 2004 and he’s getting shelved for a clone of himself.
---
Oh brother, this is exactly what every expansion does to this game. All the old zones became virtually irrelevant, everybody just moves to another area of intrest. It could be downer for some new players because if they start from level 1 and meet nobody, well..
---
They're in proximity of the apprentices, and they drop rotting bear carcass which is a huge economic boom for level 14. Their health is comparable to level 17 mobs, that's true, but at 14 (for rogues) you get a scimitar from the blade vendor so they die super fast.
---
Nah, that's what Daggerfall, Morrowind and Oblivion are for.
---
Shoulda /s - tired of the million release date posts
---
 The only reason blizz is making classic is to kill the private server scene. It's not some newfound sense of nostalgia. I love classic WoW and miss it so much, but I'm pretty grounded in reality at this point and understand there are other reasons why classic exists. 
---
 Nostalrius did two things, it gave people a way to play the game they loved back in the day, and it had shown blizz how big the private server scene truly was, and now they're going to try and kill it with classic. I wouldn't be surprised at all to see a ton of CnD letters pop up to all the vanilla private servers online after classic is released.
---
You said you didn't want to waste time on something pointless.

Blacksmithing is not pointless, if you want to do blacksmithing mining go for it.

Let's not pretend like global/world chat on most private servers isn't complete and utter garbage. Arguing about politics, racism just to name a few.

Engineering is always a good bet for melee, sappers for PVE damage and good utility in pvp.
---
Stupid question: How can I get enchanted gear or how can i get my gear (e.g. a cool chest I found) enchanted when I dont have this profession? Do I just have to play this chest without an enchantment for the rest of my life, just because I don't have this profession? :/

I'm gonna pick whatever pve server has the coolest name and is between 2-4 hours behind my local time. I need raid time to be after the kids have gone to sleep lmao. (If most guilds raid 6pm-9pm I need to be 3 hours ahead of them because the kids go to bed at 8:30pm)
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one haha
---
It's ok you can just cut the video up to only show triple crit windfury procs!
---
In the video I didn't. I used vendor greens and white items to show it can be done undergeared. In actual practice you're going to be so loaded that you can just AH upgrades every 5-10 levels, and you'll find plenty of BoE greens / blues to outfit yourself with. For rogues specifically I have a video that explains some great upgrades you can snag from limited quantity vendors that are pretty nice / comparable to quest / dungeon upgrades.
---
&gt; edit: Why does this sub downvote for no reason? Even below they said that this is correct outside of a few minute cooldown.
---
Because this sub is filled with morons who think that downvoting how it actually works will somehow mean it doesn't work like that. It's by far one of the most fact-resistent subs on reddit these days.
---
I can still do cooperative content on retail with other players and communicate doing so, unlike for example runescape which is most definitely an mmo but you dont have to say a single word to anyone to succeed
---
I was actually considering trying a rogue with engineering on the side. Probably undead for a change in scenery as I level.
---
Same here, I loved male troll animations and their jokes.  Not a fan of female troll.
---
stop posting videos
---
You think the higher up lost? They are releasing this so they can take advantage of the sub money they have been losing while these player are on pservers. Everyone won here.
---
So, the group heal is then going to heal the targets group? Still not perfect, but more usefull. :)
---
I actually was wondering - thanks for that! Will you be linking it on the google doc when finished by chance?
---
I was lvling my gnome warlock solo for so long and met up with this random person named Clambo. Really helped show me the ropes n we palled around for like 10 lvls together. Idk if they’ll ever remember me but Clambo if you’re out there thanks for the memories.
---
Do we know how long we're expecting to wait for each phase?
---
Tab.  There used to be a /targetnearestenemy but now it's /targetenemy which is the same thing as just pressing tab.
---
Look at it on the bright side. You can literally only improve!
---
Nostalrius wasn’t blizzlike though
---
I remember reading an article about wow where "You get to play as a grunt from WC3!" That was all it took to get me hooked.
---
&gt; It really sucks to hearth back to stormwind to find a replacement and run back.
---
That's what your realm's Discord server and the ClassicLFG addon is for.
---
Can't believe 3 years passed since then.
---
After it functions like it should. Like the ability text says. Initial increase of damage while increasing haste with each attack dealing less damage than the previous. Before fix it was just a 30% haste increase with a damage boost added. The damage wouldn’t drop. 2h arms warriors would get outdps’d by paladins wielding 1handers.

This is amazing but I'd still prefer duel monitors with my info on my other monitor.
---
Yeah world channels being moderated is fine with me.. but guild chat grp chat should be a free for all as long as your not trying to recruit people to the KKK or something
---
no he's using a macro with "§" placed in the left action bar
---
Imagine playing horde
---
Which doesn't happen a lot.
---
I still don't get it. Jaina nullifies the poison with a greater blizzard or something... But whoops already used it once so can't case again ?? wtf
---
Hunters are going for full tier 2 set for the bonus, so they are not going to use crown of destruction.
---
Thinking similar to you, but I am a bit put off by the respec costs. What's your plan for that?
---
People dont think things be the way they be, but they do

---
It's a shame b/c in legion blizzard actually added some grind/flavor back to professions and everybody complained. So they created the literal worst iteration of professions the game has ever seen in BFA.
---
Really? I personally feel the opposite.
---
And now we're back to you never having healed in a raid before or likely even been in a raid before.
---
Thats the thing it was a huntard.. Like first thing he does is taunting with pet and thenn pulling a shitton of mobs when we jumped down because of said pet in gnomer. I mean its fine we didnt kick him.. he rolled on every item and so on. Typical hunter.. still we knew what we get into when inviting him and continued to play for days with him. But we were free to be satly about his greed and so on. Otherwise he was a good player and good dps so who cares :D
---
For Rogues in particular, there's not many good quest or instance items, outside of the premiere quest reward weapons (WC / BFD / SM / etc).
---
It's fairly pointless. All of the good stuff you'd like from blacksmithing are purchaseable. It's also a massive pain to level up.
---
«In vanilla we didn’t have good detection algorythms and techniques of botting, but things are much better now. We are confident we can deal with these problems.» 
---
Last time I checked bots were still running rampant in retail. They are often farming certain dungeons for raw gold, with a set route to do it 24/7.  It might not be as easy to solo dungeons in vanilla, but this statement makes me worried.
---
Same dilemma in my group, but I arbitrarily picked horde for us.  There are aspects of the other faction that are so fresh (raiding with shamans for example) that I doubt I’d ever get a chance to replicate by playing the same faction again.
---
Don’t get me wrong, Westfall -&gt; Darkshire are so good.  I will miss them dearly this time around.  But I’ve never done the horde Onyxia attunement, so I can’t wait to hate my whole way through that.
---
I played Alliance in Vanilla (haven't played the game since, except for a few 20 lvl chars in BFA starter edition), and there's no way I'm rolling Alliance this time. I have the confidence and belief in WoW vanilla/Classic that whatever side you choose, it's gonna be awesome. Thus, I want to experience more of the game and discover new things, so I'm going Horde for sure this time (Shaman, and then maybe Lock). I've never heard anybody say they had a bad time due to the faction they picked, and people on the Horde seem just as content as people on Alliance. So, that's good enough for me. Thus, yes, I'm going for logic.
---
I guess there might one or two of you (or more?) who don't feel this way about the game (i.e. having confidence regardless of the faction)? + You get Barrens chat, sounds awesome enough for me to want to level in Barrens, even if it does seem a bit "bland", but I don't care...!
---
G'luck!
---
&gt;WC3
---
&gt;never gave it a shot
---
What you waiting for?
---
Question if what the point would be to add it in phase 3 when only AV and WG are released.  
---
I would guess it gets added in phase 4 when AB gets added.
---
Yo it's Thex the troll shaman
---
Because retail is somehow super deep and complex as well. \\s
---
The meteoric rise of WoW was always due to the social aspect. Thats why the game could retain players so well and the power of "word of mouth" kept them growing.
---
Yeah, giving money to Blizzard before the actual product is even out... I'm sure this can lead to nothing bad.
---
6 month cooldown
---
Cl reared Cthun and most of naxx in vanilla as healer.   The priest very rarely used prayer.
---
aren’t they making it remastered? Figured I’d wait for that if I was gonna spend the money
---
I mean the respec costs escalate. Ele blows dick at low gear levels anyway. Im justngonna stay mostly resto until I’m in T2

You ask a question about something, you somehow disagree with the people that share their superior knowledge with you.

That take the time to answer your question.

But you just keep looking for someone to confirm that Paladins and the Alliance is stupid and sucks.

But accept it, shaman got the short end of the stick.

Hi there fellow hero of azeroth, fellow holder of the three unique artifact class weapons, fellow holder of the one and only heart of azeroth.

Yeaaaj

Thank you! :)

Yeah, you're straight up lying and have no fucking idea what you're talking about.
---
I think elemental raiding should be a ~
---
Elemental world pvp is god tier
---
NE Hunters are better than Dwarf Hunters for PvE because of higher base agility. Dwarfs would be better if there were more endgame guns in the game due to gun spec, but most of them are bows or crossbows so I'm definitly going NE
---
I started playing in 2004/5, I was like 12 years old. What got me hooked was the roleplaying the built into the world. You could sit and watch the quest text get written out in front of you. The NPC's would turn and acknowledge you, would say a greeting! The Capitol Cities were  populated and beautiful, you could interact with everything!
---
So your actually thinking these people are serious and not just writing stupid shit while they grind quests? lol
---
It's apparently mostly a matter of trademark/copyright protection. I think they once said that if they could give servers like Nostalrius the license to operate their game, they'd probably go for it, but ultimately allowing people other than your own company to run your game wears down the legitimacy of your claim to it. If you never fight to protect your game, then the law won't side with you when you finally try to block something like a private server form of current content that actually *is* stealing potential customers.
---
I mean, I was a Nostalrius player too and I was super fucking bitter about the whole affair. I cancelled my preorder for Legion Deluxe Edition at the time in protest. But... sometimes shit happens, unfortunately. And it sucked hearing that due to visa shit they couldn't even hire the Nostalrius team themselves.
---
At least that fight's over, now.
---
I don't recommend warrior as the first class a new player chooses due to how frustrating it can be level one. Having said that, you wanted to know which profession combination will be more efficient and which will make the road smoother. That can be interpreted a few ways. 
---
If you take blacksmithing and mining, you will learn more about how professions work as you go. This will happen gradually over time as you are leveling. This way it might be easier to absorb that process slowly and efficiently. Besides that, you will be making equipment for your warrior that makes them considerably stronger, considering how gear-dependent warriors are. One thing that will slow you down is having to take the time to search for/buy ore and additional materials. If you miss a lot of the ore nodes especially due to other new players searching for the same thing, you may have to double back to previous areas to play catch up. This is not necessarily a net loss of time, as there are other advantages to leveling more methodically the first time around.
---
Mining/skinning will probably make more money, although on a fresh server, there won't be as much money to go around on the auction house (AH). Still, skinning makes OK money just being sold to a vendor NPC; this might be a better option if the AH is flooded and you would make almost as much from a vendor once you factor losing AH deposit and AH cut of the sale. Mining will probably still make a decent amount. 
---
You probably should keep in mind that there will be people, who will not be worrying about professions during that process, leveling light years faster than you and will need your ore and leather. They will re-engage once they are level 60, and they will often just opt to buy much of it from the AH. This is money in your pocket for a mount at level 40. You will usually need about 90g for that. With no prior experience in the game, I would be surprised if you can accomplish that; however, asking a lot of questions can mitigate that challenge. Plus, mining/skinning is easier, and won't further confound the leveling process. If you have the gold to buy the mount or can project you are well on your way to getting there by 40, you could use the anticipated extra cash to purchase gear from the AH, especially as a warrior. 
---
As a blacksmith, you might have been able to make a lot of those (or better) pieces instead, including some rare (blue) equipment. You start to see how complicated choosing one or the other can be. This is why you get different answers when you pose a question like you did.
---
If it comes down to the two combination choices you asked about, my recommendation is that you go mining/blacksmithing. This will help you learn the game better as you go, still being able to use the AH once you outlevel certain ore and materials. It will be slower, but so what? It's safer for new players who can get frustrated with the warrior class, end up changing classes, and lose all that time spent anyway.
---
OK, there is so much more to write on just this dilemma, but I hope what I offered gets you a little closer to the profession combination that suits your play style best -- whatever that may ultimately be. Thanks for your time.
---
Correct me if Im wrong but doesnt TAB target both enemy and friendly players? Thats why /targetenemy should be in a macro?
---
So my story of getting in world of Warcraft all started with the south park season 10 box that came with a 1 month trial of the game. I was 12 years old and my computer was a old dell that had a Pentium 4 and 512mb ram. The download took 30 hours but once i was in the cinematic blew me away and of coarse my first character was a dwarf hunter lol. The bees knees moment happend when i made it out of dun morough and saw the loch modan dam that was mind blowing coming from runescape lol.
---
Reforged is garbage https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juWZLlH4tBM they really butchered the original feel of the game
---
MTG is for incels
---
A sad but true statement.
---
I'm amazed at how even these are, but this sample is biased towards people already learning about classic before it's coming out.  Many of which played before. 
---
It makes sense that the class distributions are way different than original release, though, given much more information about the end game.
---
Everytime i think of what retail wow has become i am baffled as to how a game can go from being so addictive, to being so utterly pointless and boring to play.
---
Has anyone else found it amusing that the time they want the most logins is midday on a weekday? Lol
---
Prayer of Healing only heals the priest's party, and only those within 30 yards of the priest because it is always self cast. You may be confusing it with Circle of Healing from later expansions which healed the target's party.
---
Atlas loot shows world boe’s, pvp sets, tier sets, every crafted profession and broken down into subsections like tribal lw and elemental lw, raid/dungeon gear and has a search bar so you can type the name in rather than searching every tan for an item. The only thing it doesn’t show is quest gear.
---
What kind of woman doesn't like cows? Tell her the orc will be wearing a helmet anyways.
---
These polls need to ask faction + class and separate the graphs. A combined poll is very difficult to see the real story per faction.
---
I'm not sure if you are looking for a serious answer or not but as many others have pointed out - Pallys are good at single target healing. So are Priests... But Priests also spend their time throwing up renews, shields, flash heals and big heals. Priests have a much larger kit which makes it easier to heal the raid. I raided as a priest and I would use renew and shields more often that single target heals when raiding. (If the group is doing what they need to do they shouldn't be taking on large damage, but they will take on damage which a renew is perfect for)
---
Technically a pally could heal the raid it's just not as efficient. The tank needs constant heals and he can do that job great. Having a priest do it wouldn't be fully utilizing his kit.
---
They can't. Different audience now. Current audience won't accept those changes. It would bleed the community without have anything to show for it.
---
Dont listen to him, its totally groundless
---
Lol no. Prayer of Healing is a targeted spell and heals the target's party.
---
Same here. Some things run together. I know it was wotlk because when my guild was wiping on patchwerk in naxx 25 all the nelfs would scurry to the back of the room to shadowmeld.

Won’t the classic lfg addon be broken by blizzard?
---
Would a hunter work?
---
I had two epics by level 10.  Look it up.  Quest rewards now can random roll for blue/purple upgrade.  Now if you will excuse me I have some more circle jerking to do.
---
I was planning on making a guild called misfit mondays. We raid monday with anyone and anything willing to join up
---
It also takes like n hour to get to 20.
---
That didn't work on pservers. 
---
You ended up all the way at the GY on the east side of Ashenvale. 
---
Not sure about Classic, but a true hunter would brave the run!
---
Gee I wonder why the games company wants to make money by charging $15 to try it
---
You can like mindedly complete content inefficiency together because you're collectively ignorant.  Telling your friend Joe he can't raid with you because we don't need any more XYZ isn't like minded, it's called being a twat.
---
I wish there was a browser game that has this art. It would be amazing.
---
I think it's 2-3 months for phase 1 and 2, but I'm not certain anything has been officially announced and I'm probably just regurgitating hearsay.
---
It only uses custom chat channels. To break it, they'd have to disable every addon's ability to use chat and that's just about everything.
---
You ... are ... WRONG
---
It was such a great place to start playing wow because I was young and dumb, but I had a good support group who helped me learn the game. They helped me get to 60 even though I had no idea how to play the game, but I had a lot of free time. I was probably the worst 60 on my server, maybe the whole game.
---
Well. Considering blizzard is owned by Activision, I assumed you would be able to infer that I was referring to activision-blizzard? Did you think I invested in blizzard without knowing it was also Activision?
---
Oh my God why? The suspense is killing everyone.
---
&gt; I possibly got the biggest, hugest, most immense...
---
Me too!
---
&gt; ...shot of nostalgia ever.
---
Oh... yea, that too.
---
In retail you can xfer characters if you have the same last name and address as the 2nd account, we have no hard confirmation of classic will allow any transfers yet.
---
In vanilla my little brother had a hunter on my account. He decided he wanted his own account so we transferred his character off my account to his own. This happened during vanilla.
---
Meh... is it even vanilla if you don’t spam trade?
---
Well, I think you are already part of the Classic community, by virtue of having an account and posting here. If you mean you're trying to get bigger... uh... about that, I don't know.
---
Anyways, I kind of liked your video, made sense and seemed relax. I'm sure you can do well if you keep the content going.
---
You can pick pockets, and you can get fiery enchant recipe, and I think you can also get the greater fire protection potion recipe solo (not sure about that one).

I love both factions, more in the mood for Horde for Classic, but it is what it is.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

No, sorry.  I didn't mean to imply it was necessary.  I just mean the view is amazing and I love flying up into the sky just to take Azeroth in.  It's kind of like going on vacation and taking in the view from a mountain top.

Priests proc inspiration (+25% armor) when they crit heal the target.

---
Actually, more recently a federal regulator said that privately ran legacy servers for outdated games were legal, as long as the company did not provide an official one. They brought it to the issue of product ownership, and that owners have a right to seek a way to use their product.
---
I do think WoW Classic will suffer from a few problems that other Classic MMO servers have had.  Games did evolve for reasons...  P99 is a perfect example of overindulged elitest multibox/multiaccount players attempting to just claim all the world spawn content.  Luckily in WoW instancing exists for many more things, but there will still be a few world areas that end up insta spawn camped for weeks... Like kaz and azur.  We'll have to see if layering solves any of these issues... Because without layering all the known desired content will be over camped.
---
Vanilla was nothing like this... And that's one big reason why Classic will be a different game.  Because the player base today behaves completely different.
---
Best of luck, friend. Lok'tar Ogar!
---
If you're a casual, don't forget to neuter your gaming experience because if you don't get to 60 fast you'll never get into a decent raiding guild!  :)
---
I remember watching it live, listening to the ice cream rambling, not really thinking about it just like "Yeah, ok... next expansion, somewhere frozen? whatever" then he did that wind up at the end...
---
"but I understand that for some of you"

*hey wait a minute*

"your favourite flavour"
---
*no. no way.*

I simply couldn't believe it.

Forcing your style of gameplay on other is literal cancer.  I agree with OP, what he stated is facts.  If you want to min-max do it, if not, then don't.   Stop forcing view of gameplay on others.  The only goal, in the end, is doing what you think is fun.  Not hard to understand...
---
I disagree. I think retail and classic are very different games. Freshness of content holds no relevance to me. I still enjoy watching people play Final Fantasy 7, but I wouldn't want it to come under a category of "Final Fantasy" that had all the different releases in it. I'd never find the content I was looking for. The same is true for WoW.
---
Please don't compare this to that great man.
---
Old man shakes hand at sky and yells “Get off my lawn!”
---
They have broken the game during the last few expansions because of some few whiners. I really hope they will not fall back with these mistakes again.
---
Pretty sure not. 
---
this is actually really easy to check yourself. You go to classicdb.ch, you pick a relatively low level rogue skill skill, like eviscerate rank 2. 
---
you go to taught by, you sort by reaction (to put the hostile to alliance at the bottom of the list.).
---
the result is a pretty simple list of the rogue trainers in the world (it won't always give you all of them as the starting zone trainers don't train much beyond the absolute starter skills). 
---
Of which it looks like there are [12 that won't kill you on sight](https://classicdb.ch/?npcs&amp;filter=type=[7];prof=[16];#0-4+3-2+1), nothing north of wetlands.
---
Roleplaying is pretty great in retail, I found, in doing the same thing you did.
---
I just remember being required to have a certain amount of fire ress for MC and, as a result guilds bit caring about anything else stats wise compared to that requirement.
---
Sounds great! Let me know how it works with your guides.
---
I dont know how or why but i did in fact have beta access. :) so i tested the addon quite a lot already. looking forward to more testing on thursday.
---
We raid 2 nights a week for 3 hours each time. Still did perfectly fine.
---
Vanilla, being easier, we could probably get away with one raid night a week.
---
Not saying we're gonna do it, but we totally could.
---
It's just a mindset issue. Do you want to or not? :p That's what it comes down to - and I completely respect if you say no. There are many things in life more important than WoW.
---
That downloader sucked so much dick.  I would just download the patches direct from sites like ten ton hammer, or other places.
---
I agree.  I'd be reaaaally surprised if the settings aren't persisted but better safe than sorry.
---
To be fair raiding is basically the only reason hardcore people play.
---
Hope they name a server Nostalrius but I kinda doubt they will.
---
They are learning from hunters...
---
The biggest issue here is that certain roles (read: tanks) have it so incredibly easy finding groups that they don't value it when they do. When you have to spend 30 mins looking for a tank before you can even think about going to a dungeon you're going to make damn sure that you stick through the whole run. Whereas when you login and get 3 whispers within 3 mins asking you to join various dungeon runs and, if by some miracle you don't want any of those, you can just start your own group and fill it in 5 mins tops, you end up not really caring about what happens to the group.
---
The solution is simple - we need more people playing tanks.
---
Btw - fun fact for those of us hoping to heal in dungeons at 60: if the player polls that have been done so far hold true after release, healer will be by far the worst role for finding a group at 60. You need as many healers as you need tanks for each group (1), but the number of people playing healers is almost double the number of people playing tanks.
---
Furthest north is Ironforge I think. 
---
You could roleplay it that you have to visit the capital for supplies every so often?
---
Yea as 21/30/0, I'd have to give up either 10% increase healing or spirit buff and 10% mana reduction to instant cast spells.
---
I just don't see a good choice to incorporate blackout.  On top of that, trolls are pretty meh compared to UD.
---
Do I need to sacrifice one of the other professions for fishing?
---
&gt;The average skill and tryhardness of gamers has simply gone up in the past decade.
---
Based on what?
---
Agreed. I get that occasionally shit happened and people have to leave, but you can usually tell in those cases. I also don't *terribly* mind people going afk for 5-10 minutes as opposed to just leaving.
---
This kind of reminds me of when I used to do dungeons with a kid who could rarely actually stay for the whole run because he had chores and homework and what not, but his dad also played. So you'd hear through vent "alright man, you gotta get this stuff done, I'll finish up for you" and his dad would take over. He was pretty meh at first, because he was taking over a tank and had never tanked before, but after a while he got really good at both of the classes he played because he was finishing his son's dungeons so often.
---
I don't mind stuff like that. People that say "I can't stay for the whole time, but my friend will be right outside to replace me" or "Hey, I got X amount of time, so as long as we're done by then, I'm good" and as long as it's reasonable, cool.
---
But people that straight up leave like "Only needed that boss, thanks"... I hope they have loot lag for eternity.
---
And then they were very low on the Classic Beta exactly like they are on private servers and in original Vanilla. *thinking*
---
Well considering you can't buy shares of just blizzard on the stock exchange. I think its pretty clear I bought Activision-Blizzard.
---
Being in a world of Warcraft subreddit among a demographic of blizzard gamers, I'd like to think everyone here pretty much knows blizzard is owned by activision.
---
Yes it does come off nitpicky, you are attempting to educate me on an "important difference" that is probably known by 99% of the people who visit this sub. I'd say if 99% of the people involved in the discussion already know the difference, it's not a point that needs to be made in my simple comment about how I invested in the company.
---
This is a message board about wow classic, full of wow classic fans, not a forum where we are trying to educate potential investors who have never played a PC game before and need all the "important differences" laid out for them.
---
Can you provide a source for this, or can anyone else confirm? I always thought it was possible to rez at other spirit healers.
---
Except you can pay for carries with the wow token, and buy level boosts.  Seems pretty P2W to me.
---
All that said, I’ve played every expansion and even bought a level boost. I’ll never buy a token with real money since it’s fairly easy to generate gold in the game itself, however.
---
Lots of people are excited to make their characters on the 13th as well so resubbing a week earlier won't be a big deal to them.
---
Holy hell I never would have figured that out. Mad thanks!
---
I don't know. I really don't know.
---
That's a point! And makes it even more complicated. Maybe that's why theyre always rocking plate
---
Upvote for effort.
---
Not a bad idea, I can probably justify a trip every 10 or so levels
---
It's irrelevant because the balance is entirely different.
---
I had played this game for 8 years and never heard of this lol need to try.
---
The trade off is less downtime because your pet is taking less damage, it can also hold aoe threat, letting you use multishot without pulling aggro off your pet. The only time focus dumping into claw over screech would be better is against caster mobs, but they're squishy and die faster than normal mobs anyways.
---
Retail is like playing with cheat codes.  I purposely pull every single mob I can and actually get irritated when I lose one or two.  I then just AoE them all down.  At the end of the fight I’ve lost like 10% health.

---
It was the closest we ever got. Nostalrius was the beginning of actual blizzlike servers. Before that, most stuff was broken. It was a huge breakthrough and it’s population was 10 times of any server population.
---
BRD full run takes 2-5 hours, be prepared
---
Your friend Joe telling you he wants to make your raid experience worse is him being a  twat, so I guess that's a one for one.
---
It absolutely is, I get what you're saying, but up until that point, its only heroic/mythic/pvp that is hard and that is at the max level.
---
Lol... are you that dense? No matter what games I could have said he would have dismissed them (even if he enjoyed them) just to try and be right.
---
Go outside maybe.
---
Care to explain?
---
Rogue
---
With limited time, no raiding or pvp gear I think rogue is your best option. 
---
You can avoid alot of ganging, choose yourself targets when they are vulnerable. 
---
Good 5 man armor and weapons at 60. 
---
Good luck and have fun!
---
I was once the tank and the healer for a four man scarlet strath run, it actually went pretty well, but I was with quality players.
---
This is awesome! Time to dig mine out of storage.
---
I very well may have. Thing is, I had been playing since maybe a month after initial release. I loved the game as it was and, tbh, even upping the level cap to 70 was tough for me. I had just grinded-out bgs to rank 11, started to seriously raid, and then - try, none of that gear I worked for was any good anymore.
---
Meh. Maybe I felt entitled. I suppose I did. Still bitter, though. ;)
---
You're not special. Follow /r/classicwow's rules and use the [dedicated threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=flair%3AWSIP%2BWednesday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) for questions like these.
---
If we experience any problems, I believe they will be solved with in the first three hours of launch. But I’m thinking that there aren’t going to be any issues.
---
What is Nostalrius?
---
Shamans are designed to tank up into their 40's. They might not be the best but once you start hitting the longer dungeons, it's time to stop.
---
That's such an awful experience.
---
The 15th time of Scholomance was still fun..
---
The 15th time of running that fucking Ogre dungeon from Legion or whatever broke me. I had resubbed for classic and decided to try retail. Haven't played since then.
---
Retail is so ridiculously fast paced. No, not fast paced. Stressed.   
---
I got stressed playing it.
---
You have instant everything. Instant quests. Instant objective arrival. Instant kill. Instant LFG.   
---
 Which means your sorry ass has zero downtime, you aren't allowed one moment of just chilling. It's one big race with no pitstops.
---
Perhaps some are better at taking those in-game breaks themselves, but classic had a bunch naturally. You spent some time getting to a dungeon. You spent some time waiting for BGs. Etc.   
---
That time was time you socialised, noticed the scenery, the mobs, the content. 
---
And when you arrived at the dungeon, people weren't expecting an instant resolution to it. You took your time, progressed together, and it was an entirely different atmosphere. Because those dungeons took a long fucking time, and always had something ready to fuck your shit up.   
---
The *one time* in those 40 levels we wiped everyone just left. We wiped because I had no idea what the final boss did. Pandaria, big room where the boss spawns like 7 different things.
---
Yes I loved 30-40 wPVP. Ghostwolfing up around the mountains and using far sight to find alliance then jumping down on them was always fun.
---
With limited time and no aspirations to Raid Hunter is the undisputed king.
---
If you want good *fuck you* ganking options Hunter has strong tools to MPK. Using pet despawning or FD to drop a huge pack on unsuspecting nerds is extremely satisfying.
---
Great post.
---
For easy gearing and be able to burn down casters go hunter.
---
To be annoying as fu*k, fast kills, pick your fights and a more satisfying playstyle go rogue.
---
When in doubt ALWAYS go rogue!
---
But be prepared to get your ass handed to you by an dwarf rogue ;)
---
Best of luck mate
---
I think your right thats the only reason, I dont think its a bad thing though. Blizzard have finally figured out how much money they were leaving on the table by ignoring a substantial chunk of their former player base(and why they left retail)  and are now attempting to mine that vein of cash again. GOOD!  Lets hope this succeeds and we can translate it into a long term viable paying experience for us all to enjoy.
---
Yes, you are special ;)
---
"We finally go home."

On August 12th 3PM PST, anyone with an active subscription will be able to create up to three characters for WoW Classic.
---
You can find your mods by searching https://willitclassic.com and https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons
---
The 13th of this month caracter creation opens. Google it to find the exact time for your time zone.
---
nah u be fine
---
Mmm..I don't want to be bogged down by trying to catch up on professions as I level either. If I can't bs to make gear as I level, what would be the point of taking it at all? I assume the best gear will be from dungeons or raids come level 60 anyways?
---
That's absolutely correct
---
Do you mind if I ask for a source on this? That's genuinely very interesting if true.
---
how dare she think cows aren't the cutest things
---
no, the horde doesn't have "pretty", or "cute" -
---
they're all "pretty cute"
---
far better
---
That looks really nice. I had not seen that page yet. Thanks for the tip. It would definitely be possible to use the json format to convert it to the addon somehow. I dont know if the author would like to see those guides in an addon though? /u/wickstjo? :)
---
I like it
---
Cool, thanks.
---
Sell high value trade goods. 
---
The inflation of trade goods over server life is overstated, quite dramatically. on the historical price data saved on wow-auctionhouse.com (I would link it, but it has evil private server names in the urls), you quickly realize.
---
Oh, in like 4 months, copper ore has barely appreciated at all. Bronze is the same. Switfthistle has tripled... in like 3-4 months. 
---
You can sell these things for very good money very early on. If you are a class that actually does well with a bit of money early, I would gladly sell a couple stacks of copper ore, buy a weapon or piece of armor, and not look back. Then at level 50, you can buy this sort of thing back if you really need it. Which you probably don't.
---
Lol ya i know but we all know its not the same
---
I was there. I will remember it.
---
playing the right race &gt; playing with the wrong girlfriend
---
see you on horde bruh
---
Plus i would pay anything to get another chance at that UC BAT mount
---
Some of us have been waiting since BC to play real vanilla servers.
---
Heaven forbid someone enjoys an open-world massively multiplayer online role-playing game differently than you.
---
I kind of think that's wishful thinking since good games rarely make money and we all know what corporations like, but god do I hope hope I'm wrong and companies look at the (likely) success of Classic. The whole gaming industry really needs a breath of fresh air.
---
We do hate on actiblizz but props for them doing that. Unless jay allen said he wanted to because of his meme status
---
I know what you mean. ESO is fun and I actually enjoy the game a lot but it just feels a little... Hollow... I don't feel like someone adventuring in a dangerous monster-filled world, I feel like a player playing a game... Guild wars 2 had the same issue for me, though to a little lesser extent. 
---
I think it's just that wow was my first mmorpg. It's hard for me to move to other gameplay systems... They just feel a little wrong.
---
thank you, and sorry for not using dedicated thread like this. you are right I am no special at all. 
---
&lt;3
---
Basically copy the Hunter DM tribute run. Stealth trough everything, rogue pick pockets the door. Then only kill last boss.
---
Engi makes leveling wildly easier however it will cost you time to keep your profession up.
---
Yeah man me too, I thought "ice cream" was somehow related to new expansion or something, but when he told it... Holy shit, that was intense..
---
&gt; Flametongue and Frostbrand are considered spell casts though
---
Sure, but I'm quite certain it does not proc shaman's elemental devastation (grants 9% increased melee crit after a spell crit).
---
I genuinely enjoyed the progression of legion through both the artifact weapons and the quest hubs. I think the artifact weapons could have been abstracted in some way that didn't get rid of the fun that came with finding real new weapons, but that is a side note.
---
Mythic+ is imo the best thing in WoW ever. What was adding arena back in TBC for PvP, thats Mythic+ for PvE players. I am running those constantly since Legion release and it never got boring to push keys. It was also the factor that made me not play PvP that much anymore and try some PvE.
---
This happened much later though. I absolutely did this back in the day with a troll Hunter lvl 19 twink, and I vividly remember people asking me how the hell I got it. I also did this again back in December in Northdale private server...
---
Thats surprising. Why are they so bad? Now im starting to question wether I should go warrior or not...
---
You slugged through because people were much worse. Raiders today would oneshot all of Black Yemple
---
Glad I’m not the only one who got major goonies vibes from DM!
---
You forgot stand-alone servers.  No server jumping.
---
Click on the Warcraft Icon.  The one that serves as the thumbnail for the subreddit.  Click on the three dots in the upper right corner.  Pick change flair.
---
You literally could not prove this? You are obviously the dense one here. I bet you're left on the political spectrum to with how you talk and act.
---
There's another Pserver that starts with a K that was in development around the same time as Nost. People were getting super hyped for vanilla as K was looking to be the best vanilla server to date. Nost was an unknown project. In order to cash in on the vanilla hype however, Nost rushed and jumped their previously posted release date by a month (maybe 2? Can't remember) and blasted advertisements.
---
Anxious people rolled there, and it wasn't half bad so most stayed and it got bigger and bigger. While K was a better scripted server when it launched, Nost held the title of the most popular vanilla server. Smart move by Nost but it definitely wasn't the best vanilla server.
---
Try and get your hand on axes as well the extra skill and warrior talents can make for a great time on an Orc
---
Maybe. But I think it'll happen, so I'm putting my money where my mouth is :) 
---
I think classic is going to revitalize the whole pc gaming industry when they see the success it has.
---
Of course I could be completely wrong, it's just my educated guess which is meaningless to everyone except myself!
---
This guy faps.
---
The proper response to every "anyone else" question thread.
---
I know I am going to be crucified by saying this, but as somebody who just wants lighthearted casual fantasy action escapism, I’m happy with retail WoW. I’m excited for all of you guys for getting classic back, but some of us are happy with retail.
---
You are not wrong, however there are other factors in retail classic compared to private servers that come handy to warriors. Lower boss armor values, availabiliy of some crazy strong items from the start due to 1.12.1 itemization (e.g.  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11726/savage-gladiator-chain](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11726/savage-gladiator-chain) ) and not to mention the fact that world buffs still favour melees the most and compensate most of that crit anyway. We are not talking about a drop from 15 to 10 percent. Even during phase 1 warriors will reach 30+% crit with consumebles and world buffs and that will be more then enough to keep flurry up most of the time.
---
Just want to point out again that I am talking about "potential" here. Ofc not every warrior always has bis gear, world buffs and consumeables. But the top DPS for each boss across all servers will come from warriors a 100%. (except there is something we don't know of yet)
---
I wish they would hurry up and release the names of the servers so I can coordinate with my friends and grab the names on the appropriate server.
---
Sounds like you're the one who is triggered.
---
Let me guess, you haven't touched a mythic raid or mythic+ key and you think you have an opinion worth a damn.
---
Get over yourself, neckbeard.
---
Played a troll priest in vanilla....got tons of crap for it.  Actually got a lot of crap for going shadow too, early on, often hiding the fact that I was spec'd shadow to be accepted into groups.  Good times.  :)
---
Yeah it is, but playing the rest of the awefull game just does not make up for that
---
There's only going to be one server, so it'll be more than enough people
---
Likely due to the updated lighting and other graphics tweaks they've added.
---
First I saw the game around late 2004, early 2005 in internet cafes and I was playing NFS Underground 1 and Star Wars Battlefront 1 and wondered what people find in this dumb game called WoW or whatever. I ignored it for a while. I became a high school freshman in 2005 and people in my class were talking about it, I was listening and getting intrigued, but still ignored it all the way up until early 2007. It was still Vanilla at the time and I went to the internet cafe and decided to try this game out as I didn't own it and made some Alliance characters, played for like 20 minutes, ran around confused, attacked 5 level mobs as level 1 Nelf Warrior, died a lot, thought the game was trash.
---
Then I started playing it at home on a private server (after spending a lot of time learning how to set it up) in the spring. Made a Human female Mage, as I played Diablo 2 before with a Sorceress and I thought it will be similar, thus easy, left Northshire Valley and I reached Goldshire and I did some exploring around the Crystal Lake and got killed by some level 8 Defias, but the world was so big that it made my head spin. At that time I took a little break and decided to check the Horde. Made a Troll Mage, leveled him till 13, but I still had level 5 skills and I got murdered in the Barrens, thought the class sucked. Made a Tauren Shaman, reached 14, again with level 5 skills, got murdered again in the Barrens, decided the game sucks and left it aside.  
---
Summer vacation started and I was wondering what to play since I had so much free time, decided to give WoW another try. This time I made a Nelf Hunter, it was female and I made it after a crush I had at the time. I'm not a native English speaker, so my English was a lot worse, so I decided this time I will read everything very carefully and follow the instructions correctly and be patient most of all. Teldrassil enchanted me.. those quests for Mangy Nightsabers and Thistle Boars are still imprinted into my brain. I was really weak and died a lot, but I saw as I leveled up to level 5, I became slightly stronger, then at level 10 the Hunter trainer had a quest for me, I did it and got a pet, now I was twice as strong and twice as excited about WoW. Now I was really into it.  
---
This female Nelf Hunter was my first character with which I really got into the game, I loved it, I couldn't stop thinking about playing my character in this awesome game, at night I had dreams I was still playing my character, in one particular dream I remember I was playing my Nelf and I was escaping Undercity while the Undead were chasing me... After I finished Teldrassil I contacted some guy playing a Human Rogue in some zone called Westfall and he invited me to go there to play with him, he told me how to get there and swim through the ocean. I thought the swim will be long and wanted to do something else in the meantime so I asked him if there is a way to make my character move while I'm AFK, apparently he didn't know about the Num Lock key, so he told me to put something heavy on the middle mouse button. xD  
---
I reached Westfall and it immediately became my favorite zone - yellow fields everywhere, scarecrows, mechanical scarecrows... it was my dream zone. Still my favorite zone to this day. After a while I reached Stormwind and saw all the big guys at high levels with their cool gear... I wondered when will I become a high level like them as all my previous attempts ended up in me giving up. But this time I persevered, reached Duskwood (the server was local in my city) so I actually met people I knew in real life from before... it was an amazing experience finding out they were playing the same game I did and on the same private server. I went to STV, another zone that became a favorite of mine and actually at level 44 I quit, because the leveling seemed really slow, but in fact I was a noob with trash gear for my level.  
---
Then I moved to TBC funservers, then to WoTLK funservers, then I had to repeat the 10th grade because of WoW, then I changed schools to avoid the shame, made some friends in my new school's class, they were also playing WoW, one in particular became a very close friend to me and he never played the game so I showed it to him and he became more addicted than I did. During 11th/12th grade he would sleep through all the classes at school, because as soon as he would get home, he would fire up WoW and play until 6 AM and then just pack his bag, go to school and sleep through all the classes... xD  
---
We played a lot of WoTLK x1 Blizzlike servers together after that, met some people from around the world, I was really excited about CATA revamping the old zones, when it came out, I played it on the Blizzard F2P trial and hated it immediately. Then I went back to WoTLK until 2012 and then something happened and I decided I should play Vanilla again, because I never leveled that Nelf Hunter to 60 so I started playing Vanilla private servers and nothing else all until 2019.  
---
At the end of the day, for me the only true WoW is Vanilla WoW. In this particular case, WoW Classic.
---
I did do it on a private server back in December, one of the more popular ones which I can't name or I get my comment removed!  
---
Blizzard didn't fix this till later patches so it may or may not be the same in Classic since they aren't keeping everything exactly the same, but you definitely could in original Vanilla. I had a lvl 19 troll twink with an owl!
---
For shamans their best role in raid PvE is healing. There is no way around it.  
---
For everything else, elemental can tank better, do more burst, more dps, heal nearly as good as resto, and far better than enhance.
---
Just go elemental and heal raids.
---
I’ve currently only got 3 (My first ever 1080p monitor from 2012 died last week) and I’m really struggling.
---
It has a few uses.
---
1: Seeing another Warlock’s Succubus
---
2: Being used as an additional buff to prevent more important ones from being purged
---
3: Collecting soul shards from invisible NPCs 
---
4: Extremely situational for people who use invisibility potions/engineer trinket in PvP (although, hilariously, I’m actually uncertain if it works in that scenario)
---
Yeah but they werent like allies of any of the parties in the area. You get my point?
---
The ones you use like evis and sinister strike. If you dont use it dont buy it. Evis is important as its static damage not increased by attack power
---
I was there Gandalf.. I was there 1210 days ago.
---
[https://youtu.be/YWn4DZWRkE4](https://youtu.be/YWn4DZWRkE4)
---
DM:N won't be released for some time. Think it is phase 3
---
Not quite. It's about a 10% DPS increase to Rogues and Warriors, so that's max 40% of another DPS member.
---
There are weekly threads for that sort of thing. Monday's specifically the LFM weekly post. I assume it will continue this way.
---
NOCHANGES REEEE
---
I don’t play rogues but I am curious: why should you get rank 1 Ambush and avoid others only if you are horde?
---
Gutrot ftw
---
I wouldn't know but i love the reply. +1 with love
---
Yes that interaction was confirmed to not work on the beta, I was just saying that the Elemental Devastation only counts spells from a very specific list instead of things like, for example, the Wrath of Cenarius (which triggers from any spell damage effect). So Flametongue and Frostbrand are coded as spells even though they don't match the coding for Elemental Devastation.
---
Fury Prot won't work in classic. a shit spec that only works on the pirated realms.
---
It was still a pretty popular location even in WoTLK and Cata (At least, on my server. Especially for bank alts)
---
smash your balls instead
---
No, it's 10% per tick and it ticks 5 times (so total of 50% coefficient).
---
Put it on pause.
---
well I was going in direction to be safe - what if and your spot in raid blah blah blah..
---
I do know beside raids there is no chance to have good gear, to progress even more/further but that's ok just because I am not sure if I will hit 60 on my toon before Christmas and until then raid ready people will most probably have their alts ready as well.. 
---
My plan is not to raid but of course would like to step into  MC, Ony, ZG, BWL, and AQ20, just knowing how elite player base and how experienced cause private servers and how demanding players are, combine it with my RL responsibilities, you get behavior such as " i will most probably do that"
---
I got a lot of  warnings and mutes for spamming out trade chat with macro's 
---
Either Rickroll or a seasonal  merry christmas macro's, that half feeling of regret when you stopped tapping the macro a minute and a half ago and its still spamming on
---
Shit, that's the life man. I wish I could replace my job hours with wow hours and then get out to do my other hobbies in the evening.
---
its dudes
---
The Poisons quest for Horde requires that you kill an elite that is near impossible to solo unless you use Ambush on him, which takes 50% of his HP and greatly reduces his damage. If you wait until level 22, you can Ambush-&gt;Vanish-&gt;Ambush and he dies instantly.
---
&gt; waiting on vendors.
---
I'm not really -waiting- tho. I'm playing on my main toon, with a second account with 9 alts camped. Every 5 minutes all I need to do is look at my other monitor, switch toons, check the vendor. 10 sec while my pally is autoattacking her mob.
---
Why does that matter? You can shift in and out it literally gives you a free heal in pvp situations.
---
There will be, I bet. There are a lot of threads like these that pop up. I wouldn't worry much about it. There are plenty of guilds (like mine) that will gladly accept new players.
---
Correct
---
At least BRD has a lot of good pre-raid gear for a lot of classes, so it is worth it. I'm only spamming dungeons that give a lot of gear or can make gold while doing it. That's why I'm not spamming LBRS/UBRS and focus BRD / Strat instead.
---
It doesn't look like WC3 at all or Warcraft at all. The colors are so dull and depressing, the models of characters and building are so ugly and feel like Retail WoW.
---
"Thing is, I hate healing raids"  Don't roll shaman then.
---
So you really thing they'll be more warlocks than hunters 1 week into Classic?
---
They're probably just overestimated based on the assumption you don't use the old graphics.
---
big yikes lol, ofc you use it if you get it, but you *CAN'T guarantee that you WILL get it*. That's what the discussion is about, and that's what makes you look stupid. You can't plan that "ok, when I get 60 super early I'm gonna get a warmonger" because it's literally not up to you if you get it or not. If you get it, perfect, then you're set. If not, then you'll have to go another route.
---
200% worth it, BRD is probably my favorite instance of all time.
---
Not to sound like a noob but will I be able to play it on my 2012 MacBook pro? Upgraded ram and ssd
---
Just heal in ele spec. Respec only if it's progression and the guild is struggling.
---
Impossible on Pservers or in the beta as well?
---
Appreciate the enthusiasm, but by that time, I was a crusty, curmudgeonly wow vet, and I'd had enough of these new, punk kids and their crazy rock music. I wanted/want what I fell in love with, and I think we're about to get more than I ever though possible
---
Yeah instead you'll play Vanilla where half the classes literally use 2  buttons in their damage rotation. The blind fanboyism around here is comical.
---
I don’t know if I can wait that long, I’m hungry now!
---
What site is that?  Pirate it?
---
Well good luck to you then. Personally I don't understand players that are willing to purposefully gimp their experience in WoW.
---
Brilliant! Agree you should include talents.
---
&gt;My recommendation if you want to play retail is to do everything with friends
---
With what now?
---
Farming chests can be quite lucrative.
---
Then play Morrowind. Doesn't mean you have to hate on Skyrim. Skyrim didn't delete Morrowind from people's computers.
---
Scatter shot trap Dr is not a bug
---
It confirmed functioned this way on the beta
---
The Wall has definitely aged liked milk.
---
Just to be extra clear. You’re referring to private server data which likely won’t be accurate.
---
Well, yes. If you are paying 15 dollars a month for the purpose of accumulating bronze tubes, that could work. 
---
I do think that it would be a LOT easier, if you are selling bronze tubes, just to make 50 of the things with blacksmithing.
---
Because they thought it would be time consuming and costly, but then Omar locked himself in a room for a week and was able to mesh the old client with the new infrastructure with relative ease. So they prob gave him a small team and said "go for it."
---
Tauren Priest is my preference, but sadly they didn’t believe in gods back then ☹️
---
He'll murder you at level 20 in Classic unless you use Ambush or have help.
---
MoP was insanely stupid.
---
I was watching a compilation of cinematics of all expansions on youtube. Every one of them had amazingly powerful villains. 
---
And then you get to MoP and it is basically a jackie chan movie (I know he’s from Hong Kong, but MoP was pretty much a bad kung fu movie).
---
Hey thex, I found a guild for you
---
That wouldn't really prove it, that would just show that there was hype and a load from retail tried and disliked it. That doesn't mean the core audience for classic is just gonna pack up shop a month in and fuck off to RuneScape or something
---
Keep an eye out for the YouTube channels Gideon AI and CaperFin. I'm sure they'll be quick to post any news that comes concerning these things
---
Read this as bfd, was like wtf
---
Just reading this gets my hype going.
---
the other issue is they lack incentive once they get their gear so easily. Give them incentive by offering them gold, which is hard for them to farm easily as a tank. I used to do this is 10 mins went by and I couldnt find a tank. It sucks but time is money, and if you spend 30 mins trying to find a tank you could have been playing.
---
Sounds about right. I logged in to try Legion content (not buying BFA) for free. Got to level 111 and can promise I'll never go back to it.
---
When you're in Orgrimmar and you see that portal room for the first time... That was a big yikes. Town was empty. Nothing was going on. Questlines felt meaningless. I was taken out of the game many times for cinematics. Had plenty of instances where I was the only player. It was a mess. Really hated it.
---
Roots &gt; War Stomp in pretty much any situation you could cast War Stomp.  One low rank heal isn't doing much if you have pretty much any melee class right on top of you.
---
I could see it working out in a couple particular situations, which is why I said "rarely useful".. it's nowhere near as good for druids as it is for warriors.
---
No, but Skyrim dumbed a lot of mechanics down, setting the pace for future TES games. Complex mechanics are being driven out for the sake of a bigger audience and more money. (Oblivion also suffered from this, but not to the same extent)
---
Well.. I have always been of the opinion that if a game, movie, book, whatever is not made available by the original creators then piracy is just fair game.
---
It's entirely up to the creators if they want to profit off of their own products or not, and I dont see anything wrong with using the product if they dont want my money.
---
But at the end of the day, Vanilla **is** the intellectual property of Blizzard, and if they want to make Vanilla servers and charge us to play on them, then I will go play there.
---
Defeating Alliance dogs requires more than bloody knuckles and glistening abs, but I respect this idea thoroughly.
---
No :)
---
Yeah this is how I thought it worked back in Vanilla, being only your own party...but so many people are saying you can just target other parties with Prayer of Healing I started to doubt my admittedly spotty memory. My priest was just my alt too so that doesn't help.
---
A Classic WoW private server that was closed by Blizzard in 2016, being one of the most populated and well-known servers at the time and whose shutdown was the driving force behind the Classic WoW movement.
---
You realize many of the players / these world first guilds you’re cheering on today where also the ones racing for works first back then right? 
---
Also I hear half of you guys struggle in timewalked black temple? Why aren’t you all one shotting it.
---
Yeah i guess you are right. I m not going to min max or anything so my rotation wont be super complex like any other class. I ll just enjoy the game for what it is :)
---
Cool thanks man.
---
Got to do better.  Something about rogues doing it from behind.  Lube rogue?
---
Turnther? Wtf lol
---
I agree that the new catch-up mechanics are worse. I also don't like them but I do think you are exaggerating a bit. It's a bit unfair to compare LFR or normal difficulties with Classic/TBC since those didn't exist back then. It's easier to get good enough gear for raids in retail but that's because there are a lot more levels of difficulty.
---
I personally love the Barrens because you constantly run into the same people even if they're a few levels above you.
---
If someone pulls a number like that, and starts putting demands on *you*, I'd recommend just removing them right away.
---
People like that always cause trouble/drama in groups.
---
Shocks do a shocking amount of damage and the procs are fair enough to see them every mob.
---
I had the same problem, ended up picking undead - they actually look cute if you make them right.
---
That’s what I meant by the training wheel comment that caused half this sub to nerd rage.
---
this basically mean it is fun around 25% of the time you hit a target
---
I predict a lot of "baby woke up, brb". And you can't actually plan for that shit.
---
I'm pretty sure there won't be a huge difference between them and yes, one or another will be ahead but not by much.
---
You don't need to be tank specced to tank vanilla dungeons mate...
---
Assuming the base 13" model, your MBP has an i5-3210M (2.5 GHz), which supports Intel HD Graphics 4000, so yes, it will play Classic.
---
I think if you’re upfront (and reasonable) about your time restrictions it’s okay. 
---
Don’t expect to log on, and be done with a dungeon within an hour, that’s just not going to happen without some sort of prep. But at the same time, I’m not setting aside half of my day for what should be a relatively quick dungeon because our group can’t focus or coordinate properly. 
---
With regards to breaks, be respectable, stepping away for 5 minutes can be an opportunity for everyone to grab a drink/hit the bathroom, but any longer then that and you’re just punishing your group. 
---
Like everything with the community in Classic WoW, there are sooooo many subtle nuances that change every situation. The only way to prevent this from becoming problematic is through clear communication.
---
If only
---
Let people know how much time you have when in doubt.
---
The most important part is that there's no surprises half-way through. 
---
WC could take 1 hour, or it could take 2 - but if you've stated that you only have a single hour at the beginning, no one's gonna complain when you gotta go.
---
This is funny because even on a reddit sub-page for pservers i pushed Trolls and it wasn't that popular. 
---
I think the truth of this matter is for most people arguments and evidence don't matter much, but get some popular / leaders to say something or do something and most people will just accept it.
---
Falls on deaf ears.. lol
---
How weird. Its like you took someone’s comment from below, changed a few words, then posted it 2 hours later on a higher comment chain
---
Word. Thanks for clearing that up.

Blizzcon 2017.  Too bad you didn't get to see it live.  Chills, tears and cheers.
---
Nahh, i think they believe big names when they told them it was strong. This argument has been around for a long while and even a year ago on pserver pages was still argued that UD&gt; by most.
---
The start of WoD wasn’t terrible.
---
BFD is fairly long, but nowhere near, lol.
---
How?
---
Why wouldn't you just put 1 more point in Inner Focus so you don't need to spend 2 in Improved Concentration Aura to get the same effect?
---
same. i'm excited to get started.
---
I don't think they're doing it to kill the private server scene.  I think the main reason they're doing it because they've actually been convinced there's money to be made from classic.
---
And also not 10k pop on one server
---
Is there info somewhere on roughly how long each dungeon took in vanilla?
---
You lack imagination, if they truly fuck up their implementation of layering and spell batching and they ruin the game pservers might get popular again.
---
Maybe they want more EU logins
---
Yeah I can agree with that, it's just that you said catch-up didn't exist. It did :)
---
The amount of people on the server was also way off by like three times more than the cap on original blizzard servers.
---
Never said it was. It was quite fun, in fact. But once the realities of the Garrison set in, it very quickly became a game of log in, raid, garrison, log out. And **that** felt like it lasted forever.
---
Not at all.
---
Kronos was blizzlike, Nost wasn’t.
---
That is exactly it!!! The reason LFG killed the game is it allowed assholes to still get groups. If you’re a ninja, a leaver or just a douche you will get a rep and not be able find a group even if you are a tank. I remember back then there we people who had to switch servers because nobody would deal with them. If you’re a decent player, and more importantly a decent person, you’ll be able to find groups no problem, regardless of your roll. If you’re a jack ass you better be a bad ass tank or you’ll be F’d. Even then people will eventually pass on you too. Karma is real again in Classic WOW.
---
Bruh in starved for classic. I'm on this sub every day reading every thread.

## bruh 😤😎👌👌😎
---
NE priest is not bad at all if you are planning more small group or WSG/AB like pvp. Shadowmeld is a great way to eat/drink in otherwise hard situations to do so.
---
Honestly i've always been a fantasy nerd, i ended up Horde but that first glimpse of teldrasil had me hooked. A lot of people complain about how addictive WoW is and how its taken over their lives but I had already reached a period where i genuinely would not leave the house for anything. WoW kept me socializing, and genuinely quite happy in a really dark part of my life - Things are really good now but im not sure what i would have done without
---
Turnther the Turtle.
---
No shop on k3.
---
Many turtle species (not all) can hide their heads inside their shells when attacked by predators.
---
Rotations are the same across all classes tho, 1 spender, 2 builders mainly.
---
It removes them.
---
WF Weapon is a 20% proc rate so WF crits happen much less than 25% of the time.
---
All fair points.  I love Hex of Weakness too and would definitely make my priest a troll, but totally understand the reasonings for wanting to go Undead.  Definitely helps against the bad matchup with warlocks too
---
Is it really that different from a woman who plays male characters?
---
What makes it weird to you?
---
If you are pvping without blackout you are doing it wrong anyway.
---
There's a cooldown on switching layers now, so that's not really a problem. And layer hopping wouldn't make things less rare, it would just mean that one person gets more of the rare things.
---
It wasn’t that WoD was terrible, aspects of it where actually really well done.  Ultimately the time limit set on the devs killed their ambitions and the expat suffered hard from it.  Had we gotten the two faction capitals, garrisons where guild based (not individual player based), and the last two raid tiers weren’t crammed into one and instead, separated into 3rd and 4th (a fel based shatt city and a orc based HFC), that expansion probably would be revered as one of the best, not the worst.
---
/world + Discord + ClassicLFG will have enough coverage of the playerbase so that you never have to go into a city to find a group.
---
It’s funny because theres a lot of people saying layering will never go away.. so who is right?
---
I found it boring. You mostly lightning bolt, shock, auto until dead and repeat.
---
"skyrim is shit"
---
he said, having three digit number of hours played on the game.
---
I mean arent we pretty much getting classic because blizzard did listen to the community though?
---
Night elf. Just tell them you’re from the future where nelfs defected to the horde.
---
I wonder what subreddit we're in... 🤔
---
I do not. I think you're mistaking me for someone else
---
Holy hell. Guess I'm in for quite the work then. :P
---
I'm a new player so don't have the same experiences you guys have. I was playing Runescape when WoW released and actively avoided WoW because of all the connotations/social stigma (poopsock) that came with it. Eventually I moved from Runescape to drinking over the park and then the pub so didn't spend as much time online. These days I play DnD (being older and not giving a fuck helps - also my friends live with partners/have kids e.t.c) so all that has gone out the window. I've been struggling to find a game to get lost in for the past 3 years or so (everything else has bored me). Over the years of being online it's kind of impossible to not come across 'WoW stories' so having read a bunch of these previously and seeing how hyped people are for classic, I've taken a look into WoW. I popped onto retail, got to lvl 50ish but found it to be a bit of a snoozefest. Figured I'd try a classic server and almost instantly fell in love with it. The world feels like an actual living world. You're forced to communicate with other players, you have to traverse the world to get to a dungeon. The no map markers is a huge deal for me because it means you actually have to explore and take notice of your surroundings, not just go to pointless markers that you forget about as soon as you leave them. I also died a lot (which I actually enjoyed).
---
I didn't push too deep into the classic server - I think I've finally found the game I'm happy to get lost in and so I want to wait until release and fully experience it with everybody else.
---
FOR THE HORDE!
---
&gt;I hope they have loot lag for eternity.
---
I love it.
---
Thread full of people that have either forgotten or never knew how Vanilla healing worked.   
---
* PW:Shield is shit, it is never efficient. You should only use it when you're worried someone is going to die. It is not a raid heal.
---
* HoTs are shit. They are only efficient when they tick to 12 seconds which will never happen in a raid except on a tank (and even then it's really for a buffer not for efficiency). 
---
* Holy Nova is a very poor healing spell. It causes no threat and is instant cast so you very occasionally get some use out of it but it costs huge mana for very little healing. 
---
* Prayer of Healing is a very niche spell. It has poor range and only hits your party, so you only use it when the raid takes even damage AND when no one is at risk of dying (where you be better casting a single target spell to save them). It is nice on about 1 fight a tier. 
---
So yeah, it's fairly obvious pallies are very valuable raid healers on the alliance side. That doesn't mean your priests and druids don't raid heal, and it doesn't mean your pallies can't MT heal. You just do whatever works.  
---
But this meme that *pallies dun haf aoe healz or hotz lul* so they aren't raid healers is just showing everyone you don't know how to play the class. No one gives a shit what *your kit is*. You do what's effective.
---
2 buttons? In pvp??? Gl :D
---
I know. I've died like 3 times from 1-60 from non pvp. It's just so easy now. As a warlock I just summon a new pet every time mine is about to die. And take 0 damage.
---
The mods of this sub reddit are absolute cancer and completely hypocritical, I get my comments removed often for referencing private server names. Yet posts like this get to the top, bravo nazi mods.
---
I've had my sub active since May and all I've done in the last 3 months was go through all my chars and sell everything on AH to get my sub payed for through January with tokens.  It's just not even close to the same game anymore.  Pointless really does sum it up for me too.
---
After the vanish the fight will reset. How should you manage that?
---
always play on asmonlayer
---
/thread
---
Is it not partially a money grab and to stop pservers? I’m not sure they actually care. They might when they see the success classic will have.
---
What was blizzard's reason for shutting it down?  Isn't there other private servers out there?
---
Well We are not saying you are not allowed to like retail. We are just saying you a wrong.
---
J/K
---
 I am sure it has it's positives
---
Which is why I'm kinda mad at the retail guys who did that, yet claim they are totally on board for Classic. Like, ok... where was your support two years ago?
---
If you're interested in testing it, jump on my [discord](https://discord.gg/bnxkuEB)
---
all you need to do is save enough for mount at 40. 100g.
---
skills start costing 1g ea per rank about level 30 could easily save 30+g by not buying all skills until after you have your mount.
---
Well when you just buy gold or mounts or whatever it becomes pay to win or a pointless grind. Kinda makes you not want to play anymore
---
Only if poniard + flametounge weapon is boring to you
---
What is Dr?
---
Yeah they might stop using layering ... or not. Personally I will wait for facts and not eat up corporate propaganda.

BFA has way more buttons to press in PvP than Vanilla.
---
&gt; 1% or less of the time you'll spend playing the game.
---
Only if you're playing the game for a specific goal. As an altoholic, I played WoW for 3 years before rushing a single char to level 55 just in time for WotLK's Death Knights, and I knew many others who did the same.
---
I still play it, like I'm not a mythic raider but I have 431 ilvl now, so I think I can speak about the state of retail a little bit.
---
I find some enjoyment in doing M+ (altough I hate it compared to Legion) and the new raid. That's pretty much all the positives I can think of. PvP is pretty terrible, class design is worst it's ever been. The new zones after few weeks are meh. That hyped essence system is also meh (I already have rank 3 essences and the first minor slot unlocked). Story is just weird.
---
Like honestly, from content wise BfA is obviously better than WoD so it's the second worst expansion in my book. However gameplay wise, I'd take WoD class design and PvP over BfA anyday. When your class is not fun to play, the content also isn't fun.
---
I'm not sure if I would even play BfA if Classic wasn't that close, but right now I just don't want to, and don't have time to get into the new game for few weeks. So I'm playing retail. Also I'm DK main, so I'm preparing to be without it. The sad thing I won't probably even miss my DK because of the garbage class design.
---
I'll be completely honest with you, as much as I'm hyped for Classic I also want retail to be good. I don't hate the modern WoW, for example Legion was the best expansion for me since Wrath. I enjoyed it a lot and it makes me sad seeing how terrible BfA is compared to it. I hope the next expansion will be better, I'd like to jump into the modern WoW sometimes too even after Classic comes out.

Yeah pretty decent list.

Yeah, before I quit, my last 3-4 weeks were spent almost exclusively with pet battles and farming my farm. It was like a weird fun Facebook game.
---
/world for sure... but i never heard of classic lfg till today and classic is almost out. I live on the classic forums and Reddit. Doesn’t say a lot for how widespread that addon will be.

Really hoping zUI gets updated for Classic client..
---
No problems detected B)

Meanwhile: I had to buy the game again because there was something wrong with one of the 20 installation CDs.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/discords
---
There are 3 repositories commonly supported. Check above.
---
This is almost certainly how it happened. Some analyst was messing around/putting off real work and then went to his boss and was like “we could do vanilla for way less money than we thought.”
---
Correct. Put them against 3/4 moderate difficulty mobs (god forbid one of them is ranged) and warrior will kill them much faster though. Mage has a niche of destroying large groups of melee mobs, but on a populated server the handful of places where that's useful will be camped to hell by the mages. Plenty of other classes shine in other situations.

In some regards yes. I mean methods basically a fucking NFL team of video games. But you really think there was such a drastic difference in these players ability to click buttons in a certain order and not standing in shit a decade ago?

I know you're joking, and honestly the over-the-top bantering about Classic is fun and why I hang out here.

However, there are some people here who think Classic is objectively the best game in existence, and are simply astounded that anyone could like retail WoW.  Like, not joking, but honestly act like their video game preferences are the pinnacle of the objective video game hierarchy.

LOL, usually yeah, but I've pulled off a handful on pservers.
---
blizzard listens to the community, that's why we're getting unarmored mounts and rppvp servers
---
oh wait
---
Back when players had normal requests instead of " Blizz please give my class 5 stuns, a demon cock and a purple bike "
---
YOU. SHALL. NOT. LOOOOOOOOT!!!!
---
I was in my 40’s level wise, ran into a twink over 10 levels higher than me and asked him if he could run me through a dungeon. He was very smug and overconfident, wanted me to beg for it. So I dropped a duel flag and beat him as a balance druid (he was a paladin). After that he stopped acting so superior but still wouldn’t help me. The gratification of beating him, about 15 levels higher than me with all purples ... meanwhile I had greens and a spec that was considered useless at the time. Still puts a smile on my face.
---
Thank you.
---
15 = 0
---
you are pretty stupid
---
Fuck motorcycles in wow
---
You can't really blame a company for making decisions based on finance, can you? At the end of the day, Blizzard is making Classic because they think it will earn them some more cash. It's a business after all, with employees to pay.
---
I guess their "listening" is their realization that there is plenty of demand for classic. In the end, demand begets supply. They finally realized how much demand there actually was for classic and, in turn, decided it's profitable to pursue it.
---
In a way, both you and the parent poster are correct.
---
Yes. Immensely so. Method of today would not wipe on any Vanilla-WOTLK raid boss more than a few times. Mythic Jaina/Ghuun/Azshara make them all look like child's play.
---
First image of THEX in his natural habitat.
---
Well, it also means you don't understand anything about the addon. It works with players that don't have the addon either by using chat channels. Even if you're inside the dungeon, you'll be able to advertise your need for group members inside the cities so long as anyone with the addon is inside the city.
---
Are you saying 30/0/21 is a gimped spec? lol
---
This was me, played for half a month and got so bored that I stopped playing before even reaching max level. It felt like I was playing a movie or game where you hit the buttons or tells you to on the screen and it was so dammed boring for some reason.
---
It's as much of a "gold sink" as enchanting your gear.
---
You've really re-sparked my interest in going Feral Druid again, I must admit.
---
They've publicly stated it's temporary. If you don't want to believe that then I don't see how you purchase anything in life, let alone invest time into a private server.
---
Time really flies
---
&gt;Players spend hundreds of dollars on these things in BFA.
---
The fact that you think the average player buys anything past their sub is hilarious.
---
Troll sucks booty cheeks compared to UD lmao
---
So you want a player to be forced to play for months and months before they ever get to group with anyone? Fuck that.
---
Meat usually drops free.  I rarely buy it.  Also I don't think the loyalty thing works right on paervers.
---
It's the living in the closet, makes them devious.
---
They would not be doing it if they were not sure they could make a profit i also expect we will see name changes and server transfers for classic eventually.
---
Everyone I know that still plays retail pays for their sub with the infinite amount of gold that the game showers you with anyway lol.
---
Back in 2005 had just came off a year binge of FFXI. So when I completed a quest and got experience. I knew I was hooked.

---
G loomis man myself.
---
&gt; I wouldn't be surprised at all to see a ton of CnD letters pop up to all the vanilla private servers online after classic is released.
---
You're forgetting that most private servers are hosted in countries where their C&amp;D notices are used as toilet paper.  Blizzard is powerless to shut them down.  Only the players hold the power to voluntarily leave pservers and move to Classic.
---
Private servers will never, EVER die for 2 important reasons:
---
1. There are thousands upon thousands of old school Vanilla diehards who have an obsessive attachment to the original patch progression.  They are incapable of accepting Classic starting at 1.12.
---
2. Many of those players are too cheap or broke to pay $15 per month to play Classic.
---
Classic will also have a side-effect that Blizzard does not want.  New Classic-based private servers will start to appear which use the modern client.  With a live retail model to use as a reference, quality assurance and accuracy verification will be pretty simple for the devs.
---
I mean, you're still buying a sub. But yes.
---
$60 dollars for a leveling boost.
---
That was why I had tamed it way back when, slower hits but each hit had more threat behind it. Just couldn’t remember if that was the case or just what I convinced myself of years ago lol. Also ate anything like a garbage disposal so food was never an issue XD I liked it since it was different compared to all the 1.0 attack speed pets I used to see and it wasn’t even a rare spawn getting me the results I wanted
---
There will always be people that want to play for free, but their populations plummet at the release of Classic. Some may even die off from lack of players.
---
Damn i shouldve done that...
---
I spent the equivalent of a 4 to 5 year subscription in the first month of Legion's launch. Classic will be profitable, but it doesn't have anywhere near the profit potential as Retail.
---
A quality product
---
And those subs tokens are paid for by other players. They actually cost more than a regular subscription. $20 or something
---
That is what I am getting at. Good point.
---
Or maybe they listened to the other half of the community that doesn't want them?
---
When you consider how short a time classic has been in development, how few people are actually involved with the main development of it (given that it's just a more technical port, and not actually being made from scratch), and how much those people working on it get paid, yes, Classic is insanely profitable for Blizzard.
---
If 1 million sub for the first month and then never play again, it was profitable.
---
There are pvp trinkets for fears, pvp trinkets are class specific and certain ones remove different CC.
---
Screech is broken on the pservers.  Generated way too much threat. 
---
Also, why FUCK with the bat eating fruit, when u could just use the carrion bird?
---
Hair styles also pretty good. :P
---
Even if a BFA player doesn't buy anything after their subscription, they're still spending 5 times as much as a Classic player in that first month. And Blizzard has reported that microtransactions are over half their revenue for years - they might not be half of WoW's revenue, but they are certainly a significant contribution.
---
Mainly because inner focus is player based and improved conc aura is group based.
---
You can’t reach 100% just with 3/3 imp conc aura so this is kind of has best opportunity cost so to say.

Kind of a side thread sorry, but if anyone here is using 2 monitors where one is 144hz and the other is lower quality and is getting strange fps spikes when some kind of activity occurs on your other monitor, make sure to go into your gpu control panel and under "adjust desktop size and position" change the "perform scaling" option to GPU based. Had to dig for a while before i finally found the  [solution.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/7h9bnu/psafor_people_with_dual_monitors_with_different/)

TRUUUUUUUUUE
---
Isn't that just a private server thing? I don't remember any world chat before pservers
---
Diminishing returns. If you hit someone with scatter shot, your freezing trap will not last as long. It's a way to prevent you from keeping someone CC'd forever.
---
yes, im sure half the population would quit if blizzard added rppvp servers
---
2 years later, i've read so many different "classic+" ideas, and none of them sound alike. I don't know if people are dense or they don't see why  that is a problem.
---
It's either "Just follow vanilla philosophy" . If asked for ideas, they will either ignore you, downvote you or insult you. If they actually give ideas, it either results in a drama or it's filled with not exactly "vanilla philosophy" changes/additions.
---
Or
---
"That's a minor thing that won't affect the feeling"
---
I wish i was blessed with the ability to be so ignorant.
---
You aren't supposed to play something forever, when you don't like it you stop. If they change it so YOU like it, someone else will stop.  Retail is the perfect example of what happens when blizzard tries to make everyone happy, and i pity you if you think your post-content is the "best" idea.
---
That's not directed specifically towards you, OP. It's against every single thread of the sort. It's complete insanity if you've read these threads for as long as i did.
---
Everyone has their perfect game in their mind, every one thinks their idea is good. Ignorant, hypocritical, and naive. Good luck Turning Blizzard into Jagex, a company going down the drain ever since mid-WotLK will suddenly pull the second coming out of 15 year old game, because they will follow the ideas of the community that gave us retail in the first place.
---
if this hasn't heavily bled over into private servers after a decade why would it suddenly become a massive problem now? ''but the influx of modern players'' most of them will figure out pretty fast that the mentality doesn't work here
---
Probably a good idea anyway with diablo 4 in the works and I don't doubt their working on an auto chess game.
---
On the other hand it really sucks when it's midnight and you think "hmm I could fit in an SFK run" but your group doesn't have a decurse and you wipe 4 times and suddenly it's 3am and you have to get up at 6. Don't do it to yourself.
---
No, it's a Retail thing that is now in Classic because we're using their client. Custom chat channels can have an infinite number of members and are not restricted by zone in any way.
---
I was 8 years old, my elder brothers got a copy and let me play on his account. It was fantastic, I made my own hunter, leveled her up terribly and made good friends.  
---
Eventually my eldest bro quit, the middle bro stayed and got his own account. Been playing since.   
---
Happy my brothers never shielded me from playing games when I was little.
---
Blizz wants to exploite the whales. Which means we collect boring mounts while the nice shit is on the store.
---
Bite does nearly the same dmg as claw,but cost far less energy.  Bite and growl is better than claw spam.
---
Please don't call classic a money grab and compare it to the sort of shit you can buy in early access on steam, or MMOs like Bless Online that.
---
Of course they expect to make money off of it, it's a business, no game company ever does anything without expecting to either make money directly, or advertise themselves to make future profit off other things. It's how businesses work. But I can tell you for damn sure that people who have actually worked on it are trying to make it the best experience that they can.
---
If you're going to make us wait the least you could do is tell us what we'll be eating
---
Wait, do you actually think something got changed because one person asked for it randomly in a forum post?
---
\*cough cough\* r/murderedbywords
---
I agree with that. It is just crazy to me how BFA at roughly only 2 million subscriptions is still about to generate so much.
---
It works that way on almost every private server as well

Yeah, karma farming is a real job you know. Or, it's not that original and 2 people got the same idea. Can't tell.

Wouldn't that be copyright infringement?

Real-world-time is not in-game-time
---
Also good for defending flag carriers in your base at WSG, mind control ambushing and throwing attackers off the lumber mill, and preventing 3 minute mages from initially pyroblasting you.
---
Your not really right or wrong. Fury prot is a spec for an overgeared and fully raidbuffed endgame guild. What the spec does is trade mitigation for extra threat. It will likely only be used by competitive guilds doing speedruns on raids they outgear.
---
I feel like this is a cool tool to help you remember your leveling path... but wouldn't copying someone else's material be copyright infringement?
---
I got into wow through an irl buddy. He's a lore nerd and a great storyteller and would tell me all about the Warcraft storyline from the games and books. 
---
Eventually he ran a wow-themed DND game that was a lot of fun. When I didn't understand the finer details of one part of his game he set me homework - go play the human and orc campaigns of WC3. That piqued my interest and when he mentioned that Arthas and Thralls' stories continued in wow I was suddenly a lot more keen to play this mmo he'd been talking about.
---
I don't know if it was all just a long con to get my partner and I to start playing wow so said friend could have another tank and healer so his guild could raid (definitely seemed like it in retrospect) but it worked for a few years and at the very least has given me a love for the Warcraft story. And what a fucked up mess of a storyline it is sometimes lol
---
Ahh BRD. Quite possibly the best dungeon of any game, ever.
---
They would have used /played for that
---
Why is there a pic from tipsout? Confuses my...
---
Hard to tell with my limited on hand resources, I could have sworn it was 3 or 3.5, only thing I found for a source is notes on the wikis saying:
---
“They are tamable by hunters. These bears were famous for having an unusually low attack speed when tamed, but since swing speed for pets is normalized, they are now an ordinary bear.”
---
But not the actual value. If anything I’d say just keep it in mind if you wanna try it out lol
---
lok tar - ogar.
---
And yes retail is mindless in such ways and feels like a button masher with lanes you run in. Similar to diablo for me. 
---
I can’t wait to be a badass again on a server 😅😂
---
This day was so sad... 😞
---
Once I heard of Classic I almost immediately started preparing on private servers. I've been obsessed since, manically trying classes and level routes, watching videos and reading guides and just generally behaving like back in 05-06.
---
How do you add a bot to discord from github? I've only added bots from sites like Carbonitex.net
---
The I'm dad bot is terrible. But, Bobby b can stay.
---
1% of the game is hard, the rest is a joke, that's the issue lol
---
Finally some good fucking numbers
---
WINE! WINE! MOOOOOOOOAR WINE!
---
$15 a month per player (more for multiboxxers), and they don't have to spend a ton of money on development after launch.  Yeah they're definitely making some money.  They made a fuck ton of money on WoW classic the first time around using the same business model.  So long as they don't over extend themselves by investing in hardware early on they'll be fine as long as a good number stay subbed.
---
&gt; Mythic raiding is 20 times harder than any vanilla raid
---
That'd be nice if any more than 0.5% of the playerbase ever saw the first boss of a mythic raid.
---
You just need to take a not of when you started playing classic (date) and same again when you hit 60. The time in between is how long it took you irl.
---
pre raid bis with devilsaur has like 11% hit i think tho
---
WoW classic is basically Blizzard's alternative to WoW 2, so there's that.
---
I dont know? Its just a guide i use. Does it have its own addon?
---
Sure, why not?
---
This happened alot, I was warrior friends were druid and shaman... we usually ended up 3 manning the dungeons. Was a different kind of fun I guess! More loot for us.
---
!RemindMe
---
I  hate it. Tried it on a TBC server ;) ;). 
---
It was like spam abilities pull, auto auto auto. Slower than priests wanding and you still go oom. 
---
Sure i could do some elites quests my priest found hard via Earthbind and shocks/fire totem but that is rare and not fun. Ghost wolf is nice (for sure).
---
I really disliked leveling a shaman more than any other class i have played.
---
This being said i mean shamans are wanted x2 as much as other healers for raids. As they are that useful. And as a healer, i really want to play one... but will not.
---
Shhh 🤫 this is currently my progress with some friends. If they see this they’ll begin to question...
---
That's not how it works.  Someone still has to buy the token from blizzard.

&gt; Some of us have been waiting since the shutdown of nostalrius. 
---
Some of us have been waiting since 2008...
---
Because wow pvp is terrible.
---
So close, I have only ever played the 1-20 free trial and Nostalrius, Can't wait to finally have a wow membership lol.
---
I have a 34" ultra wide monitor as a main and a garbage 24" monitor as a second screen. Works like a charm.
---
actually bite does nearly the same dmg as claw spam, but is far more efficient.  Bite + screech spam will do better dps than claw spam.
---
They want it to be one way, but it's the other.
---
Watched my friend kill mobs in Tanaris on his Nelf Druid with max graphics in. Shifting out of forms, casting spells - the sounds that went along wjhh them bursting out the speakers of this desktop. So good.
---
It's literally not that at all...
---
That's 15% more than classic.
---
Thats if your tank isnt a complete asshat.....I remember the a tank that would pull a mob, go afk for 3 minutes and repeat. 
---
8 hours later.....I wanted to stab my eyes
---
One hear: Of Azeroth
---
Bfa sold 3.5 million copies day 1 so thats already 200m+ plus millions in cosmetic microtransactions. I doubt classics whole life time will be anywhere near as even just BFAs. Though classic will make plenty with a small team so free money for blizz, they also dont seem to be spending any advertisement money so thats a big win
---
One of the problems is people using raid finder and thinking they have cleared all content when in reality raid finder wasn't meant to be a challenge .. did ruin it though .
---
*game isn't out yet* WE NEED MORE PEOPLE RUNNING TANKS.
---
This is how rogues could solo run bosses in instances.
---
"The realities of garrisons" is placing the blame incorrectly. Yes, there was very little reason to adventure outside of it, because of the lack of content. 3 raids over 2 years and no post launch dungeons that I can recall is a far larger problem for a MMO than gimping crafting professions and simplifying gathering.
---
Leveling will look something like this.
---
1. Before pull, heal if needed.
---
2. Pull mob with a spell, place a totem, refresh lightning shield if needed.
---
3. Autoattck until mob is dead while not casting anything. You generate mana after 5sec.
---
4. Run to next mob or stay within totem range.
---
5. Repeat, or if on a pvp realm you probably want to heal immediately.
---
I quit a month into TBC, WoW is not the same without the original map. I'm not hating on expansions but it just wasn't for me anymore.
---
its boring if you don't nerd it out and optimize you play, and be lazy about it. and don't try to minmax and do your best. basically if you just lazily autoattacking, merely paying attention or trying to do it optimal. then ya. Ppl playing like that will say its boring, so it dpeends on a player.
---
but if you are optimizing your play every moment, its one of the most fun classes to level imo (and i leveled all the classes). Cos you need to watch and abuse mana regen ticks, plan stuff ahead, estimate how much damage you can take, when to take breaks, is some spell is worth using and so on. 
---
You stack spirit to minimize downtime and abuse 5 second rule. 
---
You dynamically swap weapons 2h or 1h+shield, depending on the situation and enemies. you can kill hard mobs with kiting, and multiple with kiting around the slow totem. watch your autoattacks timing for kiting.
---
you have wolfform from level 20, so it cuts boredom of traveling and moving around alot. and more fun in general.
---
also cos of wolf form you don't need to care for your mount so much right at 40, compared to many other classes. so its less stressed and more chill in terms of money, so gives you more freedom to spend.
---
also you can perform almost all roles in instances and quite resistant in pvp to gank with a shield, and can self heal.
---
but yea overall, if don't really minmax and just play without thinking, people tell shaman leveling is boring.
---
also most ppl they say it didnt stack spirit, you need to stack spirit, abuse 5 second rule, which significaly cuts down downtime and the need to drink/eat frequently, and in general gives another dimension to the play, as you regen in combat and can use more spells.
---
For sure. But Classic isn't really competing with BFA, it's just another attempt to retain subs. If a player hates BFA and quits, you just lost your sub, the micro-transactions become irrelevant. But if they quit and play Classic, you've retained your customer. Nothing was lost. And of course that extends to people who have quit. At the least, you're going to get a bunch of people who either stay or come back to play this, and that means a bunch of subs, but in the best case scenario, they scratch their classic itch, think "I wonder what live is like" and then try it, and maybe buy a pet or a mount or something. But even if they don't, they still have the sub.
---
That's Blizzard approach to this. Classic is *only* an upside. At the least, it's more sub retention, at the best, it's a gateway into additional purchases.
---
It'll likely be world chat lfg.
---
If you don't think there are nice mounts that can be obtained outside of the store (which can still just be purchased with gold), I mean, you're just a hater and not worth talking to.
---
The first night I played it.
---
I was a college freshman, home for a holiday, at a friends house, with a handful of people just hanging out shooting the shit. I was an avid single-player WC2 and WC3 player from the beginning. Eventually, cars, girls and Halo replaced Warcraft.
---
I had heard about a new Warcraft game, taking place in a fully developed, immersive world, but I didn’t have the cash to buy it or the time to play. My friend, whose house we were at, began playing WoW while at school. He let me log into his level 6 dwarf hunter, and I started wandering around snowy Dun Morogh, killing whatever I saw. The wintry environment reminded me exactly of the first couple WC2 campaign maps. I was immediately hooked. I played until 6am the next morning.
---
Fast forward s year, I had my own lvl 60 Tauren warrior, and I’m staring Ragnaros in the face, wearing a full set of fire resist gear, waiting to run in &amp; hold aggro when the MT gets knockback.
---
I burned out when our guild dissolved during AQ40 progression. Played on a couple private servers, made a couple trial accounts to try Wrath &amp; Cataclysm, resubbed for a bit during early Pandaria, but the community was gone and it was a totally different game.
---
I'm sure if enough people to fill an rppvp server actually asked for one they would open one. Do you know how much profit they make off of a full server? Do you also know how many people quit the game because their server is dead? Seriously. It's not that Blizzard's not listening, it's that there aren't enough people for an rppvp server to survive. You have to be seriously braindead to think blizzard doesn't want to spend another 15k up front to make 50k+ a month.
---
I don't know why most people glorifies Nostalrius and forgets about all servers before nost and all emulators, like WoWemu, ARCemu, Mangos, Team Python, in which a lot of ppl put a shitload of work. Also about Lex who was first legend who started reverse engineering WoW and his team.
---
Umm sorry I'm not sure about classic but are you not able to front glitch backstab anymore? Did they change something?
---
retail normie, begone
---
Stealth. It will just slow you down.
---
Wow! good to know, I loved the global chat on the private servers, did not figure they would allow that in retail.
---
Yea, I might have to rename it Horde Priest as everything is listed as the horde variant.   I'm going to add Trinkets, Enchants, some function to weight 8/8 T2.
---
You can’t switch specs back and forth with out spending your life grinding gold so you kiiinda gotta pick which one unfortunately
---
I would just play what you find most fun. You make have a harder time finding groups but you will enjoy 100% of your time more
---
That is how games are made. Devs put their hearts in because the care, and the business people will do what business people do to make money.
---
Even if you assume that Blizzard starts working on the next expansion the very day that the current expansion launches, Classic has been in development for just as long as the average time between them.
---
I like my job. I would like to keep working. However, if I could work 4-5 hours a day instead of 6-7 that'd be my ideal life situation. And only work 2-3-4 times a week tops..
---
U guys realize that screech and demoralizing shouts threat isn't correct, right?
---
Honestly at this date and time you will probably have more issues running chrome than classic. Only thing is look out for a non integrated graphics card.
---
&gt; And it sucked hearing that due to visa shit they couldn't even hire the Nostalrius team themselves.
---
Nostalrius team should have just crossed the Southern border and claimed asylum.
---
Lol classic might not be your cup of tea
---
What social aspects? Seriously, WoW has always been an inferior game in the social front.
---
Ok fine, just the demon cock.
---
Profitable enough to actually make this happen, they did not like private servers specifically because it made them lose money.
---
Happens in league all the time and it's 2019 - you saying this wont help.
---
I was already a big fan of Blizzard before WoW (wc3, starcraft, diablo 1/2), so obviously i had to play their next big title. I was also awaiting starcraft ghosts at the time, but that obviously never happened.
---
That was only ever a Private Server bug. Frontstabbing was NEVER possible in real World of Warcraft.
---
That's actually an issue I have with mythic raiding. With only 20 raiders, the fights are tuned so that everyone is so incredibly important that one fuckup means certain death. The gap between heroic and mythic difficulty is just way too fucking wide. I'd like it for mythic to be made easier, or for heroic to be made harder. I went back to the game in legion after quitting at the end of wotlk, so it was my introduction to mythic raiding. My group started out as heroic only since we were not all on the same realm but of course we quickly beat the bosses after release. After months of begging the other members to transfer to the same server we started mythic raiding only for people to get burned out because of how hard it was. Smaller raids also means that the FOTM specs are actually even more powerful than if it were still 40 or 25 man raids. With very limited raid spots the op specs will of course be vastly more important to bring. Lots of mythic raiders have multiple raid ready characters because of this, adding to burnout factor.
---
OMEGALUL- no
---
r/wholsomewow
---
That was one comment by one person years ago.  it has nothing to do with the fact that a lot of Blizzard staff, including top managers, wanted Classic to happen.    
---
Sure it was stupid, but a ton of people have mistakenly thought and said that players wouldn't really like vanilla WoW today.
---
Fuuuuck that pissed me off BAD. Finishing the first boss in a dungeon then the healer or dps goes "g2g in 20 min, go faster?" Like fuck right off
---
Ooh, you're right, thanks!
---
I never did a dungeon unless my day/night was free
---
Your mom sounds cool.
---
The fuck this has to do with classic?
---
I'm glad for the lack of unarmoreds, if it was available I would surely rush to get it, but this way I can stop and smell the roses. This is pretty much the reason behind the decision and I'm glad for it.
---
rppvp sucks tho.
---
found the correct answer
---
Retail goes through peaks and valleys in terms of subs.  My guess is that Classic will fill the gap between the valleys - during content droughts.
---
I mean, it's pretty obvious Blizzard is doing as little work as possible in creating Classic.
---
I'd sub for a demon cock.
---
Great list, you should add torch of holy flame. Great for paladins to pull mobs. Maybe other classes too
---
Yeah not making leveling easier would be very bad. Imagine leveling 1-120 if every level content took the same time as it did at release. No one new would ever join and make it to cap. We’re talking ~30 days or more of /played time just to hit cap.
---
As a member of the group you mentioned, just wanted to say thanks.  There are quite a lot of us and we are happy to see this happening.
---
8 days off here.
---
Stormwind? What kinda noob goes to SW instead of IF
---
I agree. Its a masterpiece.
---
No...
---
$60 expansion + $15 subscription versus $15 subscription is 400% more than Classic.
---
Except it won't generate nearly as much threat in classic.  Selections will be done by bears.
---
The days are getting longer and longer
---
The number of players that stay subscribed for 716 days in a row is a very small minority.
---
Well I was an avid Warcraft 3 player and I loved playing the rpg custom games.  When I heard about world of warcraft and that you could play one of those characters in a game like diablo 2 where it's you in the world I was super excited..  I guess that was the first time I thought "this game is going to be amazing"..  Then the other shoe dropped.... You would have to pay a monthly subscription in order to play.  I was flabbergasted at the time the subscription was announced.. There was no way I could pay it.  I was around 14 when the game was announced.  Some of my RPG friends were talking about how cool the game was even with the sub so I decided to check out the website.  I spent a long time reading the website about how the world was so big and how long it would take to run across the continent on foot and that was only one of two continents!  This would be the second time I would think "this game is going to be amazing"  I was getting excited but there was still the thing with the monthly subscription.. how would I afford it?  I kept reading about the game and how the subscription would include literally endless amounts of content in a growing world with new quests and things to do.. This would be the third time I would think "this game is going to be amazing".  The word endless really caught in my mind and I told my parents about it and they agreed to pay for the first couple of months and see how it went.  Anyways open beta rolled out and I made a dwarf rogue.  I played it for a while and I spent probably 90% of my time in the beta fishing in a little ice lake in the dwarven starting zone.  I was catching the fish because I wanted to be rich and they vendored for a lot of silver!  I made over 1 gold fishing up entry level fish and I felt like a genius.  This would be the last time I said to myself "this game is going to be amazing".  I ended up playing vanilla wow with my Dad, 2 brothers, and many real life friends.  
---
The game has come in and out of my life a lot since then but I have never wavered in believe that I was right.. this game is amazing and I can't wait to relive the first few most precious years.
---
But no micro transactions, and a lot of that $50 was used to pay off the costs of developing the game.  It evidently wasn't as easy as flipping a switch back and Blizz HQ to bring classic back, but they certainly didn't have to spend the same amount resources  on development as they did the first time around.
---
Classic doesn’t require content creation or major class tweaks. It’s like releasing a remastered video game. 95% of the game was already done.
---
That's how mafia works.
---
lol i remember this
---
The number of players that buy an expansion and don't play a single day after that is a minority so small that it isn't worth speaking out loud.
---
Yeah I agree besides racism, but as someone who uses the c word religiously with my friends, I am scared to slip up with a random 2 or 3 in the party
---
well $15 is only .02% of $100,000 therefore $15=0.02% (of $100,000) and 0.02% can be rounded down to 0 meaning $15=0
---
Gold sinks have to actually remove your gold from the game, otherwise the gold just floated to new hands.
---
You think current method would down no lights yogg in a few attempts? Look at watched the azshara fight. I saw how it looked like the vashj encounter x 10 amped up on mega crack that was cooked on the sun. But you retail dudes are delusional as fuck.
---
All right, gonna take that into consideration. Thanks for the reply buddy.
---
yeah it works differently sometimes. It might be completely unnecessary to include. Wasn't sure how it'd work in Classic :P
---
What stops you from doing so now? You realise OP said you can import it on a bfa client that requires only starter account
---
It's immensely profitable.
---
WoW was not expected to have so many subs. They were expecting something like 100K subs or so. Not millions.
---
So consider that in 2003 they spent millions of dollars making WoW, hoping for 100K.
---
Now they're not building it from dust. They're just tweaking it. And they'll have far more than 100K extra subs.
---
WoW Classic would probably be profitable even with 50,000.
---
Blizzard listened to the community when they demanded French/German servers for Classic.
---
Thank you. +1
---
Compared to everything. But the outlier was SWG. 
---
In WoW, you only needed social interaction to form up groups for dungeons and raids. You didn't need to rely on crafters for every bit of your gear. WoW never forced you to build supply lines. WoW is end game raiding then fuck all socially.
---
Back then I lived in Romania and I was in fifth grade. I had just joined a basketball club and was making new friends. So one day me and two of my friends were shooting free throws on one of the side hoops (I remember that moment so vividly) and they started talking about this game. They were just discussing these adventures they had gone on and I was so intrigued. I couldn’t stop asking questions.
---
These conversations continued and a couple weeks later I visited one of my friends and got to watch him play. He was a human paladin somewhere in the level 20 bracket and logged into Darkshire. I remember that he walked behind a building through some bushes and eventually down a hill and into a clearing where he found some werewolves!! He killed them and got to open a chest with loot. I was so incredibly hooked just from that 10 minute event. I wanted this game.
---
So I asked them about it and they showed me where they downloaded it from. They were playing on a private server. I went home and tried doing the same thing, but it didn’t work... I was so sad. I tried over and over again for about two months, but I couldn’t figure it out and they didn’t know to help me. Again, I was really sad, but at least I got to watch them play now and then and play a little on their accounts.
---
I read every piece of information on WoW’s website. Everything about every race and class and fantasized about it what I would play and how fun it would be.
---
I eventually realized there’s also an official version, but you had to buy it and also pay monthly and I had no money. About 6 months from my second hand experience in Duskwood I convinced my parents to buy it for me and pay monthly for it! No idea how I did that, but they were generous and I think felt really bad for me because they could see how excited I was about this game and also how sad I was that I couldn’t play it.
---
So there it finally was... we went to the store and bought World of Warcraft! Unfortunately, right after the store we had to go to my little sister’s ballet show. I sat there for two hours with this box in my hand and kept opening it and looking at the pictures and imaging what it would be like to play.
---
We finally got home and after many hours it was installed on my computer. I couldn’t believe it, but I was also so nervous that it would somehow not work again just like the private servers had not. But I logged in. And then I picked a server. And then I got to make a character! A troll shaman (I promise I didn’t write all this our just to say Thex, but that would have been funny). I entered the world and pressed the up arrow button over and over just to watch my character move forward on my own computer finally! It was so surreal.. I couldn’t believe that I could make my very own character move in my own home on my own computer... I didn’t have to go over to my friend’s house to experience WoW anymore because I could do it from my very own living room. It was just the best! I was a complete noob and never learned totems. In fact for the first two months I didn’t get any character past level 15 because I kept wanting to try new classes and races. I eventually made it to level 16 as a troll hunter which to me was a great achievement.
---
My little sister started playing too and we would take turns playing and watching each other play.
---
I’m a 25 year old man now and I miss it so much and can’t wait to get back to Azeroth! See you all there!
---
&gt; The fact that you think the average player buys anything past their sub is hilarious.
---
WoW makes more money out of microtransactions than it does out of subs these days so uh.. yeah.
---
I remember Nostalrius. It was the first vanilla wow experience I've had, and probably the best. I remember hitting lvl 16 on my human warrior, looking at my stupid pony tail, and asking trade chat where the barber is. I rerolled, made another human warrior, and was questing in Redridge south of Lakeshire near the gnoll encampments seeing people say RIP, server shutting down, it's over boys. I only got him to 17, and I was in Stormwing when the horde raided and I died over and over. I had an extensive pserver experience after Nost, but now I'm ending it with Classic, and hopefully it's the best.
---
I've got a raging clue
---
What is everyone talking about what server shut down?
---
Are you talking about class polls, or has a role poll been done?
---
Most of the time I see a hybrid class thread on the forums or here it is basically:
---
"By golly, I am going to be the best hybrid dpser ever, you'll see!"  37 upvotes  
---
"lul, have fun healing" 52 upvotes  
---
"But healing is fun..." 3 upvotes
---
&gt; Which means we collect boring mounts while the nice shit is on the store.
---
You can buy store mounts by buying tokens with gold and adding the token to your Blizzard Balance. It's actually cheaper than a lot of gold mounts if you think about it.
---
Blizzard started listening to the community. 
---
Now you want Classic back.
---
Saying "I'm not sure they actually care" is inherently problematic because it is a company, not a person. Some people at Blizzard *right now* are deeply passionate for the community, some are not. 
---
But of course, without getting paid they can't do it either way. Luckily they generally get more money the more we like stuff.
---
It is very boring but can be mildly exciting when WF crits. That said you have no mana pool for leveling so your stuck just auto attacking for most of your 60 levels. PvP is much the same way where you have a ton of utility in your totems and purge and interrupts but you lack the mana to actually utilize them often. The fantasy beats the reality of playing a shaman unfortunately.
---
Professions have been worthless forever. At least in BFA you can craft BiS or near BiS raid gear.
---
The first guy was skull
---
While everyone says you don't need points in prot to tank leveling dungeons, you will appreciate last stand and that one point in improved shield block when you get to the higher level dungeons.
---
Improved charge is nice for packs that you can charge into.
---
Leveling will mostly be done with a big two hander. For this reason, you probably should be thinking about two handed weapon spec and axe spec. That will help a lot with leveling and is worth it even if you don't tank with an axe.
---
That was my train of thought as well! I still occasionally watch the presentation and I smile every time :)
---
it all boils down to the social aspect of the game was removed. That what made it better than BFA.   
---
Also BFA is all about WSAD and instant spells, we who liked Vanilla/TBC/Wrath like a slower much tactical version of the game.
---
Hey just requeue with the dungeon find- oh right
---
Probably when I was a kid and my dad showed off the snow leopard his hunter had just tamed. Another moment was making my first night elf - even just the character creation was amazing. And getting to turn into animals totally sold me.
---
Rotations while leveling? lol
---
&gt; So even if I accepted your premise, you're still wrong.
---
Sure, but 1 month (400% more)? That happens. 2 months (200% more)? That happens. 4 months (100% more)? That happens. 5 months (80% more)? That happens. 8 months (50% more)? That happens. 10 months (40% more)? That happens.
---
this thread is full of people being like DAMN BLIZZARD IS FULL OF SJWS... CANT SAY ANYTHING NOWADAYS when this email is literally from 2006
---
Anyone have a list of estimate run times for dungeons? Would be helpful to have a general idea so people have a better idea how long x instance will take.
---
my hero
---
I’d highly recommend a razer naga
---
My real hope is that they can adapt retail to system more like vanilla with a few quality of life changes without ruining the fun. Don't ask me how!
---
Better community. Even in Wrath I still knew most level 80s on my server by name. All that died in Cata with cross realm servers and phasing.
---
This can happen, but the most important part of Vanilla matters again: Your reputation is everything.
---
The run can also die once you get to the Lyceum, if you have lowbies with crazy aggro range or don't have the right group comp that room can be a real pain.
---
Like madden and cod? Top tier for sure....
---
Its weird. I find that BFA/Legion are actually sort of distinct, but TBC/WOTLk/MOP/WOD were sorta similar. even cata too
---
My rod sure is expansive. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
You know that’s what I meant.
---
You have to sub in order to play the game on live. What exactly is the issue?
---
fair point, but also people literally play this game right now on pservers
---
Incorporate ninja blacklisting as well
---
For me I like burning Crusade because there are still weird specs that you can't find in later expansions. Also the game is still really fucking hard and there are number of a attunements that gate you and stop you from racing through the entire thing. As the expansions go on and on it just gets easier and easier to get to the end. There needs to be Milestones that actually matter and make you feel like you've accomplished something.
---
It also feels like it becomes less about what the new expansion has to offer and that you have to restart from scratch your character. I personally don't have any interest in any of the expansions after Wrath of the Lich King. Some are they homogenize all the classes the less interesting the game becomes
---
It's a money grab but it'll also be a slight boost to subscription numbers.
---
Think about it:  We're paying $15/mo to play a game that requires very little upkeep.  It's feature complete.  Balance complete.  Nothing left to do but let it print money.
---
oh for sure.
---
i thought pvp enhancement was really good though
---
2004 some nerds in PE class were talking about WoW. 
---
Played with them on boulderfist and moved on to horde. 2006 I lost my virginity to a girl I met on WoW who lived 30 minutes away. 2008 also playing WoW, it prevented me from getting HIV. Girl wants to have sex and I had a raid to do (raid leader) So my friend ask if she wanted to hang with him instead. Boom 6 months later he tells me that girl gave him HIV
---
Wow is my angel
---
This is Classic. 
---
You want convenience? Play another game!
---
Or, do you want each city to have its own exciting theme and vibe, and want to work to discover things, have to search for vendors allowing you to uncover the charm of the city, and not have things handed to you easily? 
---
Then, welcome, friend. Keep your feet on the ground.
---
&gt; You think current method would down no lights yogg or heroic arthas in a few attempts?
---
Sure. DPS/HPS/mechanic ability requirements are insane at the level Method plays at.
---
Nah I was alliance back then, I’ll be going horde this time so imma make new friends.
---
Diablo doesn’t have micro transactions.  Just the necro DLC which is a character add on.
---
I love lamp.
---
Great speech I love it! :)
---
Well a big one is talents. In TBC you had 61 points to spend and ~70 unique options to spend them in. In WotLK you had 71 points to spend and ~85 unique options to spend them in. In BFA you have 7 points to spend and ~50 unique optiosn to spend them in.
---
Another is class identity. In TBC and WotLK, each class had unique playstyles and advantages in a group setting. In BFA, that is almost entirely lost.
---
Rogues may see around ~10%, but with the additional rage generation and uptime on flurry I would argue its higher than that.
---
Got em
---
Yeah. Just like why PoE is getting better and better, because GGG is listening to interesting feedback. 
---
When Blizzard started listening to Joe who wanted flying mount and free epics, the game went downward.
---
its very RNG heavy, which is the main reason why I made it neutral rather than excels. Sometimes you will crit windfury them into the shadow dimension, sometimes you can go an entire fight without a proc and do nothing but die.
---
It doesn't sadly
---
Yeah soft cap is 9 hard cap is 14
---
Don't stop at Consecration. Go all the way to Divine Favor, and pick up Healing Light on the way there. From there, you can either go for a 21/26/0+4 spec or a 21/0/30 spec.
---
What! A company that has employees and creates great products needs money!@#@!#!
---
And tanks aren't an issue, have a 60 on nd and lh. Fury war on nd, tank constantly for 5 mans.
---
I can see that, Legion tried to spice it up in ways that I think worked and made for a fun, different xpac. But BfA definitely just feels like an echo of what legion was. It's sad because I was so optimistic for it the first week.
---
A single Windfury Totem is still not going to equal an entire DPS player though.
---
but why is BFA so divisive if it is similar to Legion. why don't legion players like it
---
Its 1g for a Shaman to train level 14 and 16 together.
---
I'm an old head and no one gave a shit what race you played back in the day! That is something that transformed post Vanilla.
---
No, why would I? The distinction is important.
---
Going through old backups, another screenshot I found.. Something about a Blizzard realm contest? Blizzard VS Players, I vaguely remember this..
---
[https://i.imgur.com/GEuMY8y.png](https://i.imgur.com/GEuMY8y.png)
---
Well from current players maybe. I left in september 2012. The only microtransaction I did was 1 realm transfer. They will get a few months at least of me in wow classic vs nothing in retail
---
I was just literally looking at this exact same guide moments ago! 3 weeks to go 'til Classic's launch!
---
the class stuff for sure
---
Well you're paying $15 a month for a dinosaur of a game, I'd say that's enough.
---
Good bot
---
You can take my female nightelf druid out pf my cold dead hands. When I saw that Intro I was 200% sure what class/race I wöuld play.
---
Maybe add another filter for "Quest Item: No" to eliminate items that can drop outside of having the quest. For example your filter lists Sida's bag which can only be found if you have that quest.
---
Right. Thats what I always think about
---
Like, where are the people that used to say we had rose tinted goggles because we played on nostalrious, or the ones who said we lived in the past, or the ones who say that retail wow is just the natural progression of gamers, or when retail wow fans called us pirates and thieves 
---
You think you do, but you don't
---
Shaman
---
+ You're doing this for her, not yourself (at least you claim you are).
---
+ Can you really put a 'price' on the joy your wife would get when the stars align and she gets great WF-combos?
---
Heeer deeerrr I thought blizz were paying to run private servers
---
It really is. Sometimes I can't tell if I'm being bursted or their RNG is good and they just have their max sustain up.
---
Make Tank and Healer friends as often as you can while leveling, its invaluable. As someone who can/will heal leveling and 60 I'll gladly help others who are nice and social too if they ask.
---
Paladins work for both pretty well. Paladins are also able to stand in dumber spots so they can be closer to tanks for certain fights.  
---
In live we always had a paladin healing the tanks, with some back up hots from priests/druids. On Private servers it was Druid on Main tanks paladins on raid due to the increased healing from Blessing of Light which essentially is a Healing power bonus since lower ranked spells get a smaller % of its increase.  
---
its just that Druids and priests have more diverse toolkits for raid healing. Paladins are literally just Fast heal or slow heal.
---
added in next patch for 15$ per demon cock
---
&gt; The meeting people while leveling, the ganking while leveling.
---
That doesn't happen after an expansion. When everyone is already level X going to X+Y, the players leveling 1 to X meet no one.
---
A lot of people will play Classic but the exit rate is going to be astronomical. I won’t be surprised if the player base drops by 50% after the first month once the tourists are gone.
---
I have the 2nd edition, the one that came out for 1.12 :) Has a page on the original battlegrounds and everything. It's so nice reaching for a book instead of alt-tabbing when I have a question. Admittedly, the book doesn't have everything, but still.
---
Is there any point in learning the dagger only shit?
---
What are we defining as "full run" ?
---
Absolute full-clears of BRD are extremely rare and almost never happen. Most BRD runs are either:
---
-Jailbreak
---
-Quest run (might branch off to hit a few quest bosses, but not full lear)
---
-Emp run (straight shot through the instance to emperor)
---
-Lava run (doing lava trick to skip straight to lyceum)
---
None of these take "2-5 hours" unless the group is awful and wipes multiple times.
---
Well, in retail the gear isn't meaningful in the least. In vanilla it is generally a real upgrade which will last a bit.
---
I’ll buy everything from the mount shop.
---
yea
---
Well there's something called diminishing returns. Especially in the classic community, who's tagline is "#nochanges".
---
Never bought a mount in my life:) that's the best part of how they monetize WoW. Its cosmetic and completely optional.
---
"I'm only being IRONICALLY racist!", jfc
---
I don’t think they disappear if you put them in the designated soul shard pouch
---
sure.. that suggestion wont get me banned, lets go with that.. &gt;:)
---
The real ones know what to do...
---
&gt; Well, in retail the gear isn't meaningful in the least.
---
If I ever get the Dreadmist Scowle in Classic I wonder if I will be excited or disgusted seeing it again after leveling so many clothies?
---
Just the adult mentality. You'll get it when you mature a bit.
---
I enjoyed enhance leveling because it was like a constant slot machine.
---
By all means play it.  But don’t be surprised when they show up
---
The only reason people know this saying is because it's the episode after make love not Warcraft
---
I don’t know what you’re looking for.  All games have monitization then.  Ocarina of time had a price, monitored, bad.  Am I doing it right?
---
Perhaps he asked to do it, to try to apologize and show good faith.
---
Roll Alliance
---
I loved that dungeon. Some people hated the 3-dimensional aspect, moving up and down, but I loved it. I like anything that breaks the norm and gives a taste of something different. I liked the Vashjir underwater zone for the same reason.
---
Layering supports an infinite number of players, so there's no reason for Blizzard to launch Classic with more than the absolute minimum number of servers (one of each type per region/timezone/language) until they have actual player population numbers.
---
Adding more realms later, which could be days or even hours after launch, has zero risk or consequences. Launching with too many realms is a risk and does have consequences.
---
I was today years old when I realized Nostalrius is derived from nostalgia... huge face palm. 
---
23 days.
---
14 exactly. Might be 15 here soon because I kinda dig Druid
---
so 1 hr a lvl basically.
---
Two “a”s in kebaab thank you!
---
It’s 15 fucking dollars why are all these people so cheap just fucking sub
---
so war stomp is largely useless. thank you!
---
I mean I know it because I own all the season and watch them constantly
---
Go luck getting Thexette, it will probably be the 2nd most popular name after Thex
---
Warrior. Far more base attack power and hp than any other class.
---
Whats not cute about a big fluffy cow
---
Go into. Go to Outer Ring. Head to Plague Quarter. Look upwards and behold the giant plagueworm whose literal shit you are swimming in.
---
Fill me in on LBRS/UBRS. Are they not worth doing? It's been so long I don't remember the drops. I do remember that I liked the architecture and layout.
---
&gt; All posts should directly feature WoW Classic or *the associated culture in some way.*
---
it's tagged as [vanilla] `nostalgia`
---
Good point, I didnt think about it like that
---
At least it's not the silence from Ragnarok Online, where if you typed too many messages too quickly, it would literally SILENCE you, as in you can't type...and can't cast any spells or abilities either. For like 20 minutes iirc.
---
The guy who went on to become CEO of blizzard. Nobody made, he humbled himself.
---
Shaman is absolutely the class you want to pair with her warrior. The joy she'll get on a 2 hander windfury proc with crits is going to be unmatched.
---
A couple of things:  
---
First of all, the builds you linked are useless when talking about levelling because it doesn't show what you spec first nor take into account which talents you'll have at what point. Even then it is common for people to respec once or twice during levelling (for example switching from fury to arms at 40) and then respec at 60.  
---
Second, you don't need protection talents for tanking levelling dungeons. Yes, defiance makes things easier while tanking but overall the prot talents won't do a lot while levelling.  
---
Third, you chose the wrong prot talents, assuming we're talking about a levelling spec. You don't want to spec into the shield talents because the damage reduction provided by a shield in a levelling dungeon is mostly down to the additional armor it provides, not due to the blocked damage. You also never really want to use shield block except for some particularly hard-hitting bosses in 5mans. Because of this you should go into the defense/armor talents and of course grab last stand if you actually go that far. However, I repeat, you do not need those talents at all for levelling dungeons and can just go with a proper levelling spec.
---
Fourth, you can tank levelling dungeons in any spec. So yes, your spec is going to work. However, I think for max level it isn't particularly good (even though not terrible). For tanking, going too deep into arms is kind of a waste but it'll still work. For questing etc. going a bit into prot isn't gonna hurt you too much. What you're mostly leaving out is how many talent points you actually need to get to the good stuff. Most of the prot talent points you don't want to spec early because then you lack the talent points elsewhere for levelling quickly. And when you finally have the points spare they won't have great impact.  
---
It is not gonna be terrible, I just think you won't truly be arms-prot until you're actually high enough of a level that you could potentially go into a fury tank spec or even just normal prot (or even impale-prot). In theory arms-prot requires a bit less gear to be okay for soloing than fury-prot and it is more flexible/pvp-able but it just lacks the whole point of going fury prot, the insane threat. Also when I tested it some of the potential deep arms synergies (e.g. heroic strike while tanking or sweeping strikes-&gt;whirlwind-&gt;double sunders) are actually way too clunky to be used.
---
Just go into fury until 40, then respec to arms like most warriors usually do. Then just keep speccing DPS and respec into a proper tank at/near 60.
---
when i killed my first gnome
---
Tauren female are "cute" in more of a friendly dairy cow rather than minotaur kinda way. 
---
Undead female can be "cute" if you ignore the protruding bones and shit. They also have nice animations.
---
I'd much rather take the risk of them possibly adding micro-transactions as opposed to playing on another private server.
---

---
Devouring plague
---
Up to a maximum of 10 demon cocks per character.
---
&gt; Improved heroic strike is garbage, improved charge is better
---
He can take 2/3 Improved Heroic Strike or 2/5 Deflection, but Improved Charge is irrelevant.
---
Does it really matter if it's a money grab or not when it's something people have been asking for, for years? 
---
What I mean is, can you really fault them for making decisions based on finance, while also pleasing the audience?
---
I feel like people are trying their hardest to shit on Blizzard. If they didn't do this "lul Blizzard don't care". Now that they have done this, listening to feedback and clearly have shown they care for the integrity of 'Classic' and have shown time and time again they seem to understand what people want, it's now a "lul Blizzard does it for the money and they don't care about you"
---
We should play together:3
---
Nah you are so lucky to experience it for the first time. Using guides would be a shame, it's a big slow game so just go in and figure it out, don't worry about vets, they'll be the ones to help you along the way.
---
I'm so much on the fence about whether or not I'll give classic a try. There's so much in it that just seems anti-fun, and people are requesting it solely for the nostalgia. 
---
But Wrath, I feel like Wrath was so close to the pinnacle of the Vanilla WoW formula. 
---
* You actually had a rotation in raids and dungeons. 
---
* Menial grinding was helped along with some quality of life features like dungeon finder. 
---
* The raiding more than made up for the non-challenging dungeons. 
---
* Northrend was beautiful, and so was it's music.
---
* The Lich King was one of their best executed plot lines the game's history. 
---
* Talent trees were still a thing. 
---
* Almost every spec was viable and dual spec let you take advantage of that and explore new styles of play after a one-time large gold payment. 
---
* Flying opened up brand new parts of the world and was neither too easy nor too difficult for the average player to get. 
---
* Wintergrasp was cool as shit. 
---
* You had ways to level alts much easier, but you still had to actually work for those perks and you still had to actually play your alt and learn it as you leveled up.
---
* Legendary weapons were legendary. 
---
* Achievements opened up so many fun ways to play the game.
---
But most importantly of all:
---
* Server community actually existed. Reputation mattered. Cross-realm play was limited to random dungeon finder and to battlegrounds. The open world, the economy, guilds, and raiding were all dependent on your community.
---
Then Cata came along and changed so much about the game all at once, it was no longer recognizable. Warlocks, Shamans and Paladins were turned into combo-point classes for no reason. Gameplay slowed way down. I don't mind them updating the world, but it's been torn apart by the Cataclysm longer than it had ever been the classic world. They didn't tear it apart to refresh things and make it exciting to explore the world. They tore it apart to get rid of the classic world. Everything became cross-server and raid-finder took convenience features to the most core portion of the end-game. The pinnacle of PvE challenge fundamentally held less weight after Dragon Soul.
---
Sorry this became such a rant. I guess I just needed to get my feelings out there. I want to love this game again so badly, but neither retail nor classic scratch that itch for me.
---
War/sham is the equivalent to pb&amp;j.
---
Eff a troll priest.
---
Signed former troll priest.
---
Triple monitors, of course.
---
Osrs still does this because theres actual developet interaction with the actual community.
---
Blizzard got too big and all the people who actually cared about improving the game probably got rich and retired.  
---
We need dev interaction via reddit/twitter/forums. Not just bullshit announcements. Fucking talk to us, listen to us, or classic will become the same hollow dogshit hellscape that retail became.
---
Look up Mod Ash on twitter - osrs dev with 100s of thousands of replies to osrs twitter comments, implementing suggestions and talking with players.
---
Takes blizz 10 months to fix game breaking mechanica that no one likes or sometimes never at all - see retail PVP vendors.
---
This is not related to wow classic... you asked why your posts get downvoted. this is one of the reasons.
---
If they do i will just simply quit playing. It didn't bother me when i deleted a lvl 60 mage and shaman on northfail.
---
At what level do people feel like classes need to spec into their proper roles to heal/tank?  I feel like you can be total leveling spec in dungeons until maybe ST/BRD.
---
https://boundingintocomics.com/2019/04/05/report-blizzard-forbids-okay-symbol-in-overwatch-league-arena-claims-its-a-white-power-symbol/
---
Absolutely!!!  I think you did a fine job but there is always room for improvement.  Not only with just environmental sound design but also what I call “trailer” sound design as well.  Those keywords mainly consist of impact slam, swell, riser, suckback, swish and swoosh.  A good library to look for are called Trailer Toolkits.
---
I was looking at it from a Priest perspective and there are 2 items a necklace and a BoE drop, compared to BRD where you can get 3/4 of your pre-raid gear, which is insane. Then you fill in the gaps with Strat (with good neck drops in phase 2) and Scholo with the AD trinket so you farm gear and reputation for a shoulder enchant and you'll be also set for Naxx too. LBRS/UBRS is just a necessity for raid attunements.
---
Quite a few pieces are competition for pre raid bis for certain classes.
---
Kind of. Players are asking for perfect balance. And that can only really be done if they are all identical. Reducing complexity makes easier and thus better balance.
---
You literally cannot take Improved Charge without taking 2/3 Improved Heroic Strike or 2/5 Deflection.
---
Underrated dungeon imo. I had no problems with it.
---
BFA is soulless for many reasions except for the art department, Srs those guys do amazing work, but it isn’t enough.
---
Loot doesn’t matter, cause everyone is entitled to all loot. Raids don’t matter because everyone is entitled to see the bosses. Leveling doesn’t matter because everyone is entitled to hit max lv in 30 mins. And the community doesn’t matter because all of the above don’t matter.
---
Entitlement has killed modern wow. Classic wow says if you want to see KT earn it! If you want an epic, you earn it. If you want to hit to lv 60 you earn it. You want to do these things easier, find a community and make some long lasting friends? Join a guild! 
---
I’ve never understood the entitlement arguement. Your paying 15$ not to see the content. But to experience it. Those two things are way different.
---
My issue with K was the game shop, allowing players to purchase items that wasn't in Vanilla. I played on Nost to play Vanilla. If it wasn't scripted the best or had incorrect values didn't matter.
---
What expansion? This is classic wow. Not classic bc

Ranged matchups and if warriors charge you or if rogues sprint at you. Play a druid for more than 20 minutes in a pvp situation and you'll understand.

Enjoyed this story :) thank you

I know what you mean Ive been playing mmorpgs since 2004.  My first game was conquer online and max lvl was about 130 but most people didnt hit max lvl.  It was the journey.  The game began at lvl 1 not max lvl like most mmorpgs nowadays.  The friends you meet on your journey and you get sidetracked doing pvp as well.  Best mmo experience ever.  I made this thread not because I wanted to rush but because I wanted to ask a question about the lvling experience.

I think dungeon finder and too much cross server functionality was the true beginning of the end.  Once you had dungeon finder, no need to keep track of who the good players were on your server.  Just q up and roll in.
---
Kind of but on the other hand it feels like yesterday since the “Only 100 days left till Classic“ posts.
---
I find that I usually have more low-level cloth than what I need for tailoring. Ex: by the time I need silk for tailoring, silk is rare and wool drops everywhere.
---
I haven't have problems levelling up both, as long as I don't expect my FA skill to be at the bleeding edge.
---
Wow Google images has nothing... I have an orc with the orb on my ancient vanilla account... Need to sub though.  I can tell you it looks super generic.
---
Did you forget the context of this conversation? We're talking about why reducing the leveling time in Retail was important and right.
---
The only time other players matter is in terms of Pvp. In pve if you got a better player he will just help you. In Pvp a better player will destroy you.
---
Launch plans are to wake up 2 hours before server goes live and get into queue. Level asap through mass grinding and hopefully do dungeons (cause lazy.) with decent group. (Doing all of WC with a level 22 group who dies at the end is a massive waste.)
---
Hit 60 asap, get prebis while ganking alliance.
---
They have already said they will be adding paid services that existed in classic needless to say they will probably add others on top of that like race changes etc. But they will not be adding faction swaps and things like that.
---
At least one UBRS is required for BWL attunement. And a pre raid bis tank shield drops off last boss. Finkles skinner off the beast. 
---
Pre raid bis Dal Rend swords off rend. Chromatic scales same place. 
---
Felstriker is pre raid bis offhand dagger for rogues I’m pretty sure as well. 
---
LBRS is the one usually not worth doing.
---
It's about time people started taking STIs seriously.
---
Amen
---
Y-Yes Mr. Hazzikostas I would love for the art team to waste their time on amazing 50$ cash shop mount models while 1k hour grinds get reskinned versions of cata mounts!!!
---
A small indie company like Blizzard has to make money somehow!! Plzzz piss in my mouth Ian!!
---
fucking SLAVE
---
you are why retail turned to dogshit
---
* Get some levels.
---
* Kill some Hordes.
---
* Repeat.
---
I ran so many instances trying for valor set. Never ever ever dropped....but this time I hope my luck changes!
---
^(Rough plan:)
---
* 1 week long LAN party
---
* Play 18-20 hours a day
---
* Level as fast as possible
---
* Do dungeons together
---
* Gank horde together
---
* Have an epic time
---
In almost every multiplayer game where you team up with other people, leaving early would waste their time or negatively affect their gameplay experience.

There's always a chance that kids could wake up after they go to bed until they're school age. Usually a kid waking up means going afk for a couple of minutes to get them back to bed, but sometimes it can take longer. Most people who played this game back in the day are 25 and over, and a lot of them will have kids. As long as the player doesn't expect it to happen, cut them some slack. Think about how many people who disconnected due to poor internet back in retail vanilla.
---
I stand by what I said, that if a leaver is a total crisis for you, get a reliable group of people to do dungeons with. There are people on the other side of the screen, and shit just happens sometimes, kids or something else. 
---
I mean what should the probability of a disruption be before someone's allowed to do dungeons according to you? Below 10%? Below 5%?
---
That’s why it’s typically important to be very clear what section of the dungeon you’re doing. And invite certain levels accordingly
---
If you look at his proposed build he has 5/5 deflection and 3/3 improved rend as well as 3/3 improved heroic strike. I suggested improved charge over heroic strike because it is way more useful and beneficial in everything he wants to do.
---
Ahhhhh I see thanks
---
No, as a healer.
---
People leaving after Emberseer in UBRS grinds my gears so badly.
---
Why can’t you guys just level as alliance to experience the beginner leveling zones then reroll to horde?
---
That's true but the non cosmetic things have no reason effect on the game at all. They are all still completely optional.
---
Go alliance, no matter what people say classic wow still has something to do with nostalgia, you're going to have way more fun seeing the old dungs you used to run and die in, and questing in the old zones you remember. 
---
This will make it so you might want to run dm and stockades multiple times instead of just once just to get the quest done. It's all about having fun, and seeing the different side just isn't as fun as running around in sw and if and remembering the good times you had. 
---
If you choose horde you will always think about how much more fun it was playing alliance.
