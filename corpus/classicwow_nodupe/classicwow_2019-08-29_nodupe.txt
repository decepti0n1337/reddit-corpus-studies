Out tagging someone for a quest mob is being a dick?

Chuck Norris IS barrens chat.
---
All rare spawns have different timers some are 12 hrs and some can be 2 there’s guy on you tube who covers rare spawns and give a lot of info about them but hasn’t covered every single one thus far
---
If you could read I said we still would have got it without "you". As in you're nothing and don't speak for anyone but yourself.
---
I understand for back then
---
You're suggesting they put a time limit on how long you can remain logged in an playing? After 8-12 hours you get booted and sent back in line?
---
You haven’t seen at least 50 players standing in the same spot an hour later after finishing a bunch of quests? Because I sure have
---
I don't want it to go away again and I fear it inevitably will
---
&gt;6? Let's be realistic, you don't need all 6 pally buffs on a raid. Wisdom/Might are pretty much mutually exclusive, except for Ret Paladin and Hunters. Likewise, I can't think of anyone who'd need both Sanctuary and Salvation.
---

---
I was wrong about this. You only need 5 to cover all the majors.
---
"Meme" spec is what the internet calls anything that isn't a Tier 1 raiding spec
---
3% spell crit is the big anime tiddys tho.
---
I guess the stigma for Ret is a little different because they're not just standing there hanging out waiting for the boss to die unlike Boomkin/Arcane/Elemental. 
---
I mean, personally, I'm not the type of person who tries to "break the meta" by attempting to make something viable so I don't know this struggle.
---
Lvl 19 warrior I'm on 2,5g
---
Could have more if I sell green gear instead of giving it away
---
i put all my money in tube socks, doritos and mountain dew futures last week
---
my friends for whatever reason stuck with faerlina when asmongold announced he was playing there.  2 and 1/2 hours isn't bad.  I've been in queue for 4+ hours waiting to get on today.
---
plus side is I'm getting a lot of chores done while I'm waiting around.
---
I actually got buffed by a mage (Arcane intellect) on my rogue and I was thinking, what would intellect ever do for me.
---
Turns out, it increases the chance that my weapon skills will improve.
---
If I'll ever want to level up weapon skills aside from the sword/dagger (that I use for leveling), I'll specifically look out for intellect gear to speed up the process.
---
As a rogue.
---
Which is the addon for the bottom bar with some info?
---
97,899 holy crap!
---
Don't feel too bad, arcane missiles is doodoo anyway.
---
So? No one wants Blizzard to fail. What they want is for the lessons of WoW Classic doing well to affect change in retail moving forward.
---
Submit a ticket or give it a bit since lots of people are resubbing all week.
---
What a god tier void name. Lucky!!!!
---
Don’t sweat it. There will be guilds starting Ony even if/after they release a BC expansion again.
---
Get a pocket healer, peel for them and you're golden. I was a rank 13 gnome war in vanilla and I loved my pocket healers and protected them which resulted in a lot of glory...and fun!
---
Its a trap!
---
It was changed in Burning Crusade. I don't remember the patch # but I remember that healing threat was changed at the same time. It gutted healing being a mechanic that you had to think about to do well.
---
when they buff you while you're drinking and they run off, it's the saddest thing because i wanted to return the favor
---
ya, I have no clue how that works. So if someone just simply goes afk they WILL be automatically logged out?
---
Id save a few more hundred dollars. Anything really in that range should be fine
---
He's a dev. When battle for azeroth was in Beta that same picture was on walls of a few unfinished areas instead of proper textures lol
---
You don't need to look further than Wildstar to see how opening tons of realms to meet temporary demand is a bad idea. You just end up with a whole bunch of half-dead servers in a couple of months, and then even those that remain start leaving since an MMO without people isn't exactly fun.
---
I went rogue because I've never mained one before and when I can afford to do multiple respecs I'm going to go sub and do world pvp. Popping up and stun locking someone sounds so fun to me.
---
[my first thought](https://youtu.be/GZpcwKEIRCI)
---
I hope you get a life and find something else to do.
---
Back when ambiance and music actually meant something. Just walking up to siege engines and actually hearing them running instead of being dead in Kronos is amazing. Didn't realize what a bad job those kronos guys did until I saw the small things they missed.
---
Depend who you ask

---
There are lots of mice that come with software that is able to write and use macros. 
---
They can't people just because they have the Logitech/Razer/Corsair mouse software running. 
---
And there is no way for Blizzard to know its a macro or if im actually pressing the button.
---
I think BC and Wrath would be fine if Blizzard scaled everything back a bit, if that's even possible. Seeing sick gear in BC was cool, but dumping all my hard earned epics for a bunch of greens felt bad, man.
---
yes, lots
---
that's why im going to try to change my sleep schedule so that i wake up at around 5 am everyday, tired of these queues
---
That website is useless
---
Last updated 8/26 @ 10:08 PST. Arrows compared to 8:44 PST.
---
sorry for askng here, but what is this chat addon? and anybody know any WORKING and essential addons for classic? downloaded a bunch of addons and 2/3 of them are bugged or dont work at all... im so tired of this :(
---
God DAMN haven’t listen to Dota by Basshunter in so long!
---
I just logged onto whitemane instantly without doing this, no queue?
---
Man I wish my encounters were like that, I join silent groups doing a quest who just leave when it’s done.
---
Osrs is a sandbox mmo. Wow is a Theme park mmo. Runescape is a cookie clicker. Wow is not.
---
If you look up the definitions there is an obvious distinction between the two.
---
And thus doesnt work for shooting.
---
Thanks lol my buds and I got a kick outta it and we thought a GM was fooling around or something
---

---
That's Samwise Didier, Blizzard art director, whose face is used as a placeholder icon sometimes
---
Not to mention that once you have a main with literally any amount of money at all, you just mail your new alts 10slot bags
---
So yeah this has fuck all to do with BFA v Classic. It’s just starting a new character on a new server in a new game. 
---
If BFA launched from scratch today, getting a bag drop would be exciting too
---
Honestly, I'm tempted so say I wouldn’t be against Blizz doing random server resets to force people out. But that screws over plenty of others in the process. 
---
If more people stopped afk’ing, there is a chance more tourists will get in, get their fix and move on. Ultimately reducing queues.
---
Agreed.
---
It’s a rough feeling when you roll an alt after maining a mage. But in retail hearthstones are a lot shorter. I totally forgot it was 60 minute CD until Monday.
---
Some guildies are saying this, people in que might be bugged? Maybe they added more layering
---
Classic doesn't have difficult end game content? Ever done Vanilla MC with 40 men? Naxx? Gearing up for MC? Onyxia? 
---
Shit's hard, bro.
---
Raids are just as popular on pvp servers, especially at the beginning because battlegrounds won't become available for a few months.
---
Couldn’t they phase features out slowly? Each new expansion restricts flying as it is, could they not restrict LFD until Pathfinder 1 or something and see how it goes? Just to test the water. Restrict raid access (INCLUDING LFR) until a basic attunement is completed to see if something more complicated or involved might work for future raids. That kind of thing. Doesn’t have to be all-at-once make-it-Classic, just try some of the things out for a bit.
---
Dude, just go to a lower pop server and play! Don’t worry about it. Blizzard merged low pop realms back in vanilla days and they will do it again if need be. Also I’m sure they want to cash in on server transfers down the line since so many groups of friends have been split up. Enjoy.
---
Beacuse of hype, this’ll unfortunately keep going for sometime.
---
Uh oh we got an angry one
---
Are there no line of sight wireless providers in your area? My parents are out in the middle of nowhere and get 15mbps down from a LoS connection and it's pretty reliable, and there's no data cap.
---
4G is another option, but chances are you aren't getting very good cell signal where you're at either, this could potentially be solved with a roof mounted cell booster though. You will get throttled though after a certain amount though on any cell service in the US. WoW doesn't eat a lot of bandwidth though, so you could potentially stay under the cap easily.
---
PvP means player versus player, not private. Private means not owned by Blizzard.
---
I just like the feeling of going through Westfall questing geting killed left and right questing, USING the road to avoid danger, then doing 2 Deadmines Runs, get both swords on my rogue and the chest, that are like mega upgrade. 
---
Then go back to questing on the mobs that spit in my face, like "Remember me assholes".
---
A then continue to wipe the floor with them.
---
THe progression is there, you feel powerful. It's just awesome.
---
Okay looks like I'm camping thanks for the info
---
Haha yeah leveling a warrior is hard with a capital H but so worth it. You’re basically golden God’s end game.
---
What a messed up way to think...
---
For real. Took me a long time and a bunch of breaks to bust through the 30s in vanilla.
---
Really when I send a mail it auto completes with different realms
---
Well, almost. You have to run in and smack them with your big Axe every 3 seconds or so as well, then strafe away
---
Ya, like all other games the numbers will drop. Just, hopefully not too much.
---
Exactly this. I've played for 26~ hours so far and only been in queue for a total of 2 hours. Once queues disappear, I wont have to jump through hoops and the people currently stuck in queue can finally play.
---
100% warranted. If you are horde on kirtonos I'd love to know your name too
---
Not at all. Which given the “sky is falling” attitude this sub had towards it, I’m shocked.
---
That's awesome! I got a sentry cloak on Golemagg EU about 3 hours ago. None on the AH as I imagine people will be holding onto it for later.
---
4k was better than 16k cheers
---
In the laptop area of things, you’ll probably have to spend about $500 to $600 to run the game well. Save your money for a little while longer, the game will still be here when you get back.
---
LOL,
---
Got a queue 4 hours ago 11.5K and 230 mins.
---
Since then is has bounced as low as 9, 6, 3 mins, and back to 30,  then 60, then 75.
---
I saw a big jump at about an hour ago with 1k people dropping out, but I'm still at 3k and \~60 mins queue estimate.
---
He trades them a weapon.
---
I'm #365 but haven't moved I kinda wanna try this but feel it would backfire
---
Yeah that was a bummer, had to redo my whole spirit load out. Im sure it was less of a headache for them to balance
---
It's an add-on. Cant remember what its called, think it was Storyteller
---
Servers seem to have communities again.
---
I randomly encountered a priest three times yesterday and a mage two times today. The world may be big but a server is small.
---
Later on while fishing at Crystal Lake a dwarf randomly started a convo with me. We were just sitting there, fishing and talking. Then he had to go and I told him see you later.
---
And I'm pretty sure that we will (I remember the name).
---
As far as I remember pve wise it was.allowed but for pvp it's a banable offense
---
Stop repeating this. I have friends who quit WoW before I did, before Pandaria, or dipped back in and out for a while, who are trying desperately not to come back now but are. You underestimate the number of 30+ year olds who enjoyed WoW in hs/college/early 20s and then quit and are now going to re-sub. If anything, I feel like we'll see more subs in the next week or two or month even as people convince their friends to come back and play w/them.
---
I think I will want to get a good one in case I want to play games such as rust aswell?
---
Can I use AHK to hit a key for me every 28 minutes to stay logged in? I read the tos sounds like it could work, one key entry = one action.
---
I'll be honest as an Undead i'd rather not go see the Banshee queen. Pretty sure something will be wrong with her.
---
8 hours is 3-4 days for jobbers like myself, and thoae unfamiliar with the game may take longer/level professions on the way/etc
---
I'm just saying people hate giving up time invested
---
Esfand seems like a decent human being that enjoys gaming. I don't know him, won't profess to know anything else.
---
A guide that was finished and has been obsolete for 14 years is somebodies full time job?
---
&gt; Pisses everyone off
---
It'll piss off exactly the same number of people who are already pissed off about layering. Everyone else will just defend Blizzard like they always do and tell you to "stop whining".
---
Also, the class quests and crafting quests ! Having to choose between crafting gnomes or goblin explosion, or special druidic sets is awesome !
---
Did he need on things he didn’t need? Cuz if he needed them then needing is fine. Though back in the day it was mostly an unwritten rule to pass on blue gear if you already got a piece earlier in the run.
---
Aren’t the new servers they added gonna suck because a lot of established guilds aren’t moving to them?
---
Trolling?
---
Thanks for the tip. Someone tried to grab a chest i had attacked a mob to get to and i opened a trade after i killed the mob and got my battered chest, suck it uzuul
---
can anyone confirm for other servers?
---
To be fair, Cata introduced so many good quests, and then they ruined it by having world flying, heirlooms, and boosts.
---
I think they should expand upon the content. Not even raising the level cap or adding new races/classes but just not go down the “time to re release all the old expansions” road. 
---
I would love to just see new raids or new bg game modes. It’s strange to think that the end goal is to hit Naxx then kinda just question what will they do next. I realize that Naxx is by no means easy and won’t be cleared fast but maybe a story where since we are going back in time by means of Chromie, we get an alternate timeline where things stay, more classic for lack of a better phrase.
---
Just got instant q on whitemane. Huge fix?
---
Yes you need an active sub to install it.
---
No, because you wouldn't need to. Everyone can just loot it.
---
There is no solving the problem except more people leaving or just letting everyone on to the server. The queue on my server is significantly shorter. Like if I try to log in past 4pm I'll actually be able to get on a play a few hours instead of 0 chance. And the layering has pretty much 0 negative impact on the play experience for now.
---
World bosses will be a major issue in a few months. Layering wont work with them out.
---
no one cares that you decided to have a child.  could have easily not had one and just queued up to play AT work with remote desktop and been happily gaming since you got home for 8-10 hours until work again.
---
dude gtfo with this shit
---
It will drop. I think everyone agrees on that. It's more of a case of how much.
---
The estimates range from like 10% to 80% though. 
---
Lol
---
Haha glad to hear, i didnt want to be left without knowing
---
I was expecting Chuck Norris spam but yesterday I had Keanu Reeves spam and I'm ok with this.
---
Damn 9g at 23 is pretty damn good
---
Nice try
---
Obvious troll
---
Google chrome Remote Desktop

I don't even play this game I just came across it in /r/all but I had to comment because I read a top comment on some thread about how people will be bored of this version of WoW because of how slow it is in comparison to the others. And the fact that people have become so addicted to the instant dopamin release, things need to happen instantly for people to find pleasure in games and things and thus it was a long time ago games were designed as slow as I assume Classic WoW is? I've never played it nor do I have interest in it, I just found this post a funny coincidence. Didn't think I'd find proof of that statement so early after reading it
---
&gt; All I’m saying is they haven’t affected me negatively in anyway
---
That's how they trick you.
---
I posted this in another comment, but I'll repeat it. What they are doing is like putting duct tape on a leaky gas pipe and then you're saying "Well, I can't see any gas leaking, so it must be fine!"
---
&gt; If this is as bad as it’s gonna be I could honestly give a fuck if they even remove it in phase 2
---
This is how they trick you x2.
---
&gt; Do you have any idea how Hunters fit into dungeoning groups?
---
Find a friendly guild I suppose. A good hunter is great for tricky pulls and multiple CCs. But if you're the good hunter, it's the other guy people will remember.
---
Once you hit 46 the levels just start flying by.
---
Looks like titan
---
I know but I wanted closer
---
Blizzard: No.
---
Low effort at best.
---
Drop rates aren’t changing. And if you think leveling is slow now, technically you’re not even halfway(exp required wise). This might not be the game for y’all. Honestly.
---
This is pretty much the motivation of all the changes to WoW over the years. To make different areas and activities more accessible while maintaining difficulty in a seperate bracket.
---
Or just kill em when they're low on health
---
When Keanu Reeves does a push up he doesn't push himself up, he lets the world down.
---
Was the same on Fairbanks today, Silverpine Forest general chat was full of Trumpets and trolls
---
Lol every time!
---
Hey guys I've played for over 20 hours the last 2 days when does it get fun btw
---
That... makes no sense whatsoever....
---
I'm sorry if this isn't answer you want. I don't know how to do it in classic without using an add-on but I use Dominos as a action bar replacer and you can hot key in it.
---
I play on Kurinaxx.  I have seen some people baiting reactions in chat, but its not that bad.
---
Yeah I don't know why people are so surprised at this honestly half the fun is trolling the edgy bois back
---
The Barrens on Fairbanks has actually been pretty good
---
actualy this guy did a lot to destroy wow...
---
Envangelion is weird
---
Ah that is good to know.
---
5min to get flagged afk, then 30min to get booted to char select. Then another 30min. totaling 65min
---
Thanks!
---
It's for people that don't like reading the wall of text quest log stuff
---
It's been fairly minimal on my server, but I play on an RP server so that's probably why.
---
I've initiated and enforced queues repeatedly - successfully too. Some take a little extra encouragement (read; being called out directly), but queue you shall!
---
There are some pretty neato staves in the early dungeons.
---
You're paying to screw yourself out of the experience of progressing in the game. Pretty dumb.
---
thats my point exactly… youre the one wanting a hard stop on certain server types because you dont like it. i just called you out on your bullshit
---
Right?! Is it even applied to Incendius? The queue is longer today than yesterday
---
Ask a guard and you will get a flag on the map
---
Yeah I buff as many people as I can as I walk past. Also heal people who are about to die to a mob. Gotta spread the light.
---
Waiting months to play the game...what a solution
---
Seems better but I haven't logged off. :|
---
That's my problem.  If i go over 60 feet high I'm subject to all kinds of regulations and begging for lighting strikes.  I found 5 or 6 line of sights bit i would have to build knockover towers and bounce the signal each way.
---
I'm currently laying in bed with 5 bars and 4glte looking at the tower less than a city block away.  
---
...can't do it.
---
End me now
---
Must have been a temporary glitch, queue is back at 10k
---
And this is the beauty of RPvP
---
Very good way of putting it lol, classic wouldn't be the same without Barrens chat
---
Where the black one at?
---
Because you feel weaker as you go along in BFA, and you don't get anything as you level. There's virtually no reward till max, and then you start farming. It's pointless in BFA.
---
Chickens are like Gamon in Org and must die. Always.
---
Yeah I'm level 24. I'm not doing that again anytime soon. I'd rather just not play until it cools down.
---
Tallisi, first to know of the rain, queen of the top shelf, and breaker of head on doorways
---
It’s not about being mad really, it’s about valuing your own time.
---
yeah I might try to get on even earlier depending on how it goes, the closest time reference I have is last night at 2 am the queue for faerlina was about 400 people
---
We both have jobs I don't think that's possible for us but thanks
---
becuase its made before pc opinion terror...
---
Stuck in queue?
---
If Arugal, you won't get in, gotta queue up beforehand
---
Can you explain how this is negatively affecting me then if you know how I feel about layering better than I do???
---
I don’t give a fuck about layering if you do that’s fine but it’s done nothing negative to me I don’t even notice it.
---
I buff everyone. Never know who's got a new weapon
---
u fapping with the same hand that your using to hold your phone?
---
Well the plan was for half the playerbase to quit and go back to BfA and the other half play to play less than they do during launch. Not sure that's going to work anymore though.
---
What server are you on that has this long a queue holy shit. I play on Bigglesworth and it’s like a 2k queue.
---
Yeah. I timed it before the hotfix and now. It's going at the exact same rate. All that happened was the top 2000-3000 got in instantly. The rate of the queue is still the exact same. Disappointing to say the least.
---
Also doesn't help that none of the questing addons work right.
---
That's kinda true
---
You didn't see it that often because of the hardware at the time. People can now multibox on budget hardware.
---
Man, I was about to contribute money to him and subscribe but unfortunately I will not be doing so. Anyone have the alliance guide?
---
And she still has no idea how to lead our people
---
You could probably go to pred strikes, and blood fury...and be ok to switch if you really wanted to.  The down side of that is your not far from starting HoTW, which will help your healing too.
---
But honestly, if you group a bunch and don't mind slower solo grinds you could probably get away with stopping at swiftness and it wouldn't kill you.  You'd drop some kill speed for sure, but it's not like you couldn't solo either.  Might add another couple days to the /played time.  *shrug*
---
Also thanks for the advice.  My wife streams hd tv 24/7.
---
Any limits or caps are ruled out because god forbid we only stream with a casting app....
---
none, go on a low queue server.
---
Wait you relvld a Druid from a hunter in vanilla????
---
GTFO of my bags Tough Jerky!

---
This website suggests someones hit 49 already. There are a few confirmed 45's I've seen.
---
&gt; There is no solving the problem except...
---
...Adding more servers or adding more layers.
---
&gt; This is sort of a lie.
---
The models and textures are the same, but the rendering is improved.
---
This is fixed by adding more servers, if blizzards doom and gloom prediction of mass exodus (and no new players) turns out true, you merge dead servers. Simple. The only downside is some folk lose their names. Which is nothing compared to the grossness of layering and absurd queue times.
---
Nice, good to hear dude
---
Ive been sitting in a 90 mins queue for Faerlina for the last 4 hours
---
At lvl 20 you can do your class quest to get a very useful hammer which has excellent healing stats and good damage until you can get the RFK corpsemaker. Try it out with seal of command is you intend to play retribution.
---
Like what? The 3 PvP battlegrounds?
---
Hopped on about 4:45. 7.5k people in que. But I've moved up about 1.3k spots in 20 minutes. So probably about 2 hours? Better than 6
---
thank you
---
So I'm 26 and just go to 1k needles, the mobs there aren't dropping shit and like you said they are very annoying. How is their loot table so good?
---
Is that case the Lian Li PC-011 dynamic? That's a nice build!
---
there is a 5 min grace period
---
yeah, its in retail.
---
Better than the constant bickering in EU Barrens chat because of the different languages.
---
You come to bigglesworth and I'll treat you right. I just want that sweet sweet xp.
---
Modern wow needa to go* ftfy
---
For me I'd prefer option 1. I still enjoy retail and I'd love to be able to hop on classic to enjoy some world PVP and maybe level an alt or something without feeling any pressures of time.
---
Que
---
Man it would be crazy if Blizzard released an update which increased server capacity for the express purpose of reducing queues.
---
Absolutely not transmog. Call me old school but that literally ruined the prestige of getting items. Quiet possibly my least favorite feature ever added to the game.
---
Maybe just a stock coordinates indicator on the map would be good
---
Where do you get those?
---
15$a month... people are spending 200$a weekend drinking and 15$ a day on a pack of smokes and you're worried about not getting a 15$ value a month?
---
Woman have to buy hygeine products men dont that cost alot more than 15$ a month. If youre a guy consider yourself lucky and just get the sub.
---
At most I'd be cool with a $10 sub for Classic only. Ultimately I feel like a sub would be better for the game rather than a one time purchase. I think Blizz likes the idea of people being on the same sub as retail so I don't see them changing it any time soon.
---
And you opted in to the challenge by deciding to play the game.
---
I could understand the tuning of BFA if they were designing the game for 5 year olds.
---
It's cute that you trust the timer.
---
I'd choose 2, however that has its issues.  First is that the classic community would split.  Some people will prefer to stay in Vanilla, others will choose to continue on to TBC.  Then what do you do when you reach the end of TBC content?  Do you then do the same thing and split the community up even more and maintain even more concurrent versions of Classic by opening Wrath servers?  Then what about when Wrath runs its course?  The general consensus is that Cataclysm was the start of the end, so I doubt there will be a lot of demand for Classic Cataclysm servers.
---
I feel like a yearly ladder could be interesting.
---
They know. They're just trying to turn the tables on OP because OP dissed their God emperor.
---
No, fishing is a pro strategy to make money.  Most people skip it, so it can pay off.
---
Nah they are joking, the Alliance completely oblitarated them. Like not even funny. We chased them all the way from Westfall to STV two times lol. 
---
And then we still had 2-3 raid groups of Alliance stuck on other layers!!
---
To be fair you are seeing a game from a time before social media.
---
World of warcraft not only put the casual and hardcore gamer on the same level but also allowed people to talk to each other, in real time, with an avatar.
---
-cheers
---
Vanilla Druid raider and current classic Druid, it’s a fucking healing class you goober shamans are the only ones that can do damage like at all in classic until 60 lol
---
No, almost half the playerbase is still alliance. You'll be fine
---
Is this live? Just got home to a 300 minute queue, guess I ain't playing tonight..
---
Man I used to say this on this sub and get downvoted, nice to see people are finally realizing that blizz has utterly underestimated every step of the way for Classic.
---
Can we be friends?
---
This is a great idea, actually. Scrap the shit-pile that is everything post Wrath and restart.
---
Download Chrome remote desktop and try to log in on your phone at work to jump in queue faster.
---
I suppose that's a fair way to read it. Just not the way I took it. 
---
I took it as them being conservative to make sure they didnt create too many servers. I feel like spending resources on servers is a drop in a very large bucket with a company like Activision.
---
It was the hotfix to server capacity.
---
Yeah me too. I got a chuckle out of it the first time but it’s legit every single question now gets a crazy hard time. 
---
Old Blanchy. Every other post on r/classicwow is so feel good and really impressively reflects on the community. We just started so maybe we should just switch:)
---
Honestly though, who fucking cares?  What does it matter if there are 2 or 3 layers forever?  So there are 2/3x more rare mats.  Who cares.
---
Yeh, this is my worry. It's my understanding that on long-established RP realms on retail, it's a very different place.
---
Drood or warlock. I hate melee dps but love caster dps. However, I almost always role a healer because I love healing. I just kinda got an itch to play caster. also I will be leveling witg my gf whos going to be a hunter.
---
HELP!
---
Thanks, I'll try that out in the talent calculator!
---
Amazing in wpvp amazing in bgs good raid healers good off tanks.  
---
They're basically good at everything except raid maintanking, moonkin, raid pure dps.  If you want to sit cat form all the time you're playing the class wrong.
---
He apparently made 1~2 million back in the vanilla days with his guide.
---
Not at all, the only difference u will notice is in pvp zones and even then it isn't that bad
---
It's literally his fucking job to play this game.
---
Imagine you couldn't get paid because another company made you join a que to get into work? 
---
The problem isn't afkers, it's the ques and lack of servers. Stop blaming the behavior and not the cause.

Maybe they were waiting for an invite, because they had the same quest? I watched a level 6 warrior rush a level 9 mob. He died, I finished the kill, he called me a "dick", I laughed and asked him why he thought I needed to cater to his stupidity?Later, I had a mage come to me and request my help with a higher level quest mob. We grouped, killed his mob, and he left me with a stack of food... I often find that people are usually willing to help out most of the time, and communication often helps. If they are watching, maybe throw them an invite for the quest progress? Chances are, they are watching you fight it because they need it too. I guess spitting on them is a good way to make friends tho. You'll go far in Classic.
---
I think it’s at 20? And then if you make the boss move and spec down Prot to get King’s, you’ll be the talk of the town.

How can you afford wifi, a computer, a roof over your head, etc, but not fucking $15 right now?

You can mute the painful words you know
---
I’ve done exit and logged back in about 6 times in the last 30 minutes and not had a queue.
---
If you are a non raider fighting a tier 3 raider you get absolutely wrecked, think about how absurdly broken something even stronger than that would be. And if the new content released doesn´t improve when compared to the currently available gear, there is not enough motivation to do it. The idea of classic+ is kinda flawed in that regard.
---
Almost positive it doesn't. The only thing that matters for druid weapons is stats, since you're always using  claws.  Theres actually a 2h in gnomeregan that's probly bis for a long time. Manual crowd pummeler
---
Blizzard have literally doubled their server capacity to accommodate the amount of players queuing. I think Stormwind will *too* noisy.
---
Will his snap reduce the queues by half?
---
We knew this was true years ago and thus fought for it. I wish we had this support from the start.
---
Like everyone else says, Barrens chat is so wild and has been ever since the game first started.
---
Ok thanks I hope we get there soon :)
---
I'll port to BC server, then eventually to a wrath server and stop there. Wrath was the pinnacle of wow IMO.
---
Thanks buddy
---
I’ve been told no, and I’ve experienced no. So I’m thinking no
---
Except I'm still in a 7700 queue on one of the servers that isn't as bad as like Herod.
---
Let's say the one time cost was priced around the same price as 6 months sub, how many will have sub on consistently for 6 subs? Btw I'm not completely agreeing with my stance here aswell, I'd just like to get convinced as to why it is a bad idea.
---
I'd like to see arenas and rates bgs.
---
I'm in the same boat as you buddy...have you made it in yet?
---
From what I hear they are considering realm transfers for Classic. If they do this, a lot of the non-rp'rs will leave I bet.
---
I guess that’s the US rp server? No idea.
---
This happened on an EU rppvp server. But it was hosted by Nixxiom (a big wow youtuber and small streamer). If events like these happen you’ll hear from World chat.
---
Yeah I downloaded that today, but the fact that people are even doing that as option is still kind of baffling to me ya know. Like they should be able to handle something like this so people don’t have to do that.
---
The social aspect is really what's getting me.  I ran into 3 people sitting around a campfire, cooking food.  I asked if I could use their campfire, they said yes, I cooked up some grub, chatted a bit, and then one of them went down to the shore with me to hunt Murlocs for their eyes.
---
Like, fuck yes.  Or seeing the same goddamn people I've been leveling alongside for the past 10 levels.  Or people giving away free bags for mats.  Or people tipping you a silver or two for helping them with something.
---
People seem to instinctively realize that this is a game where, unlike retail, other people are actually a genuine boon.  In Blizzard's desire to make the game more solo friendly, they outright killed the community by making other players un-needed.
---
Had the same thing, using a different ability seems to fix it but no sure what causes it.
---
5.1 I was told by a fellow guilty so that's out all together. Don't forget to check pet Opia classic if you forget all the pets that are available at that time
---
Switch to allow pop server if you don’t wanna miss out.
---
PvP. You actually have to cooperate with your faction. PvE in my experience has been more of an every man for themself vibe.
---
And when aq opens bring back layering?
---
I missed this!
---
One of the reason most players in this sub prefer Classic over retail is the sense that it's a single cohesive world with the same players inhabiting it day to day. If something happens, like horde attacking goldshire, everyone on the same realm will see that and be impacted by it in the same way. On retail, each zone is essentially an island to itself with multiple copies, so when I see horde attacking goldshire, that only impacts my copy of the game. If I want my friends to help, I have to invite them to group so they'll be on my copy. 
---
Layering has a similar impact on that "shared world" experience. That's why players are critical of it.
---
Serious question. I've heard medical cannabis helps with seizures...ever tried?

While I don't agree with what he is doing, the guides on that site aren't very good. You're better off just picking up everything and doing it as you go.

Use whatever has more dps to be honest until u get sword spec talents
---
I love when people aren't skinning their beast kills.  I was walking from Durotar to Crossroads and just finding dead Zhevras everywhere.
---
Not from how you worded it. It kind of implied that he won't \[ever\] be able to transfer his character.  Agreed that it's quite risky to count on it though. Though I think Blizzard will paid and free transfers available when layering is turned off... whenever phase 2 begins.
---
I'm a student with other (living/school) expenses and about $20 extra per check outside of desposting in my savings. I'm hyped, but I won't dive into my savings.

Then instead of Cata, a brand new expansion which keeps the core fundamental playing experince of Classic and effectively undoing the pitfalls that led us to BfA.

None

---
&gt; could you please comment on the concerns regarding how multiboxers affect the economy?
---
I'm not a multiboxer. However I can answer this question. It doesn't affect the economy in any meaningful way. 
---
How I know? Because I was one of the people directly affecting the economy back in vanilla on my server. I was playing the AH like a fiddle. It was not multiboxers that impacted the economy. It was people like me with millions of gold.
---
True. Would there be cheaper desktop options? My friend told me he could run it on his 300$ hp with like an i5 amd800 (Greek to me), but maybe he’s full of shit. Anyways, thanks again.
---
Of course I completely agree with you, that if you have no other responsibilities and are available to play the game at all time. I just wonder how many aren't able to play the game like that and would prefer a different monetization, which isn't necessarily worse. Thanks for the reply.
---
Take an upvote. Not changing ur mind.
---
Is this a copy pasta, this is the dumbest shit I've ever read.
---
I was so proud I took screenshots
---
I heard this too. im like 1,000 in queue and it hasnt moved for like 45 minutes so I think people are by-passing me
---
Everybody forgets to peel. Stop training the mage, and get these folks offa me!
---
If Classic doesn't fit your lifestyle, then find something else to play that does.
---
Can you play other games?
---
No we don't. Only weirdos call it VC.
---
Amazing!!
---
Hunter cast: Eyes of the Beast

Is this serious?

We will face them in the Barrens next time!

Not when you're only doing it every few seconds.  You're not looking to take 120fps worth of screenshots.

As a person who has played in almost every single major MMO launch to hit north america since 1999...
---
This isn't even in the top 10 worst launches. This has been pretty flawless actually.
---
lol
---
Different people get pleasure from different things. I can totally understand someone just wanting to get endgame as quickly as possible to take part in the most epic fights, both PvE and PvM.
---
If you're strapped for time because you work a lot, I can totally see why someone would trade what they have for what they want. I've always seen people attack RMT but never seen a fully fleshed-out argument as to why it's totally unacceptable/bad/etc.
---
Yeah a lot of people I know that tried to log in again got in instantly and other people are reporting 10k queues still.
---
But he gets paid by your classic money so I'm pretty sure he isn't too sad about some statement he made years ago lol.
---
Thanks cuz
---
It is far more than them being "Greedy" that is a naive argument. They understand that dead realms are harmful for the community of the game and server merges kill these communities.
---
Thanks for the help!
---
Its all smoke and mirrors. The queue looks like it was cut in half today, but its still the same wait. Blizzard probably just cut the number in half to make it seem lower.
---
PvP, especially when you get to contested zones. You soon stop getting anoyed at the guy tagging your mobs when there's an undead rogue stunlocking you and tea-bagging both your corpses.
---
Like this? Great!
---

---
Game over man game over...
---
The queue moves when people log out and the next person can log in. You can't make that move faster because Blizzard doesn't control when people log out.

I have att and am fully satisfied. They offer 15g hotspot/teathering my dude.

Hello, 
---
I agree with this point, the US does not rank very well in measures such as education quality of life etc. What the person above was referring to was richest country by GDP (not GDP per Capita).  It turns out the GDP of Luxemborg is 62.4 Billion USD whereas the GDP of the US is 19.39 trillion USD. However, the GDP per capita of Luxembourg is around 100,000 whereas it is only 50,000 in the US.

Waaaaaaaaah I have to put in the time to get something waaaaaaaaah

You will have to play frost in MC (and BWL in large part as well) as most things are immune to fire.  Arcane is many hungry and doesn't do much damage.  After BWL though, fire mages start to do truly stupid damage with rolling ignites.
---
why dont you just not look then holy shit
---
It's a soft reset of sorts.
---
If classic wow continues to do well then you may see tbc and lich servers.
---
If you see those thers is no reason why you can't do a wow classic plus.
---
You would then have servers for the different aspects of your community whilst able to keep a streamlined bfa.
---
Everyone wins if classic does well.
---
Awesome to know
---
Queue everyone getting exactly what they wanted and more
---
This comment serves as a second downvote.
---
3 hours later I still have a 63 minute queue. I don't think the accuracy has improved at all. Hope you got in though! Happy Gaming!
---
I was leveling my enchanting in Brill, and realized it was dumb to just plop +5 health onto my own bracers over and over.
---
Gave some warriors a small-but-hopefully-useful health boost (and a priestly fort buff), chased some randos down to give them free stuff, and got some tips (once even 10s!) and a few health pots in exchange.

What's blizzard going to do? Start scanning my excel workbooks?
---
This is too amazing of a possibility for us to even consider
---
nah man. Since Cata leveling is uber easy. You get a ton of power the second you have talents, to the point you solo groups of mobs and single out elites. You couldn't do that back in the day. If you wanted to kill an elite in Outland or Northrend you needed a group. In vanilla a *normal* quest might require you to group. 
---
Since Cata elites just get nuked or tanked because your class, be it any, steamrolls over all the content... everything was made easy to the point it's BAD
---
Anyone on whitemane near 1,000 have an incredibly painful queue? It’s moving down 1 then up 3? What’s going on?
---
[Bullshit](https://i.imgur.com/8DYK6Q4.jpg)
---
I've literally been doing this. So far this que I cleaned the stove, did a load of dishes, mopped the floors and decluttered a bit
---
its called retail....Classic is about enjoying the journey and taking your time
---
also you dont need to buy individual game licenses and xpacs for classic. just an active sub
---
You want a slow weapon and only move in to attack when your swing timer is up. You essentially get a bigger 3.5-4.0 swing time hit for their smaller 2.0~ swing time hit and save yourself a lot of damage if you time it right.
---
Afking for 2 hours instead of logging out is a dick move.

Ive spent a lot of time in the wild just randomly buffing people, like thats what a priest do right?

I'm pumped over bags dropping in Classic, but no gear drops in BfA feel good at all.

Tried seal twisting yet?
---
Too many game companies and developers have become more and more arrogant and try to tell us what we want to play and not listen to the players. 
---
I’ve just come back to WoW after 8 years playing swtor. EAware made all of the mistakes Blizzard made after the second expac. To this day, swtor devs refuse to listen to the players and the game is dying because of it. And EA/Bioware are 1000x worse than Blizzard when it comes to player enjoyment. 
---
I’m so glad WoW classic has been released. I felt so trapped playing swtor because I had no MMO alternatives for things I liked.
---
Skip those quests
---
You sure can. Just hop on BFA and enjoy higher xp from quest, and less xp needed for each level, and heirlooms for even more xp!!!
---
Man the dsync is real....WoW needs to take notes from ffxiv or archage or runescape. Those games can display that many people with correct animations.
---
If you are going to try PvP now is the best time before there's people camping low level zones in a few weeks time
---
They already said it will be a thing.  Just need to wait for it to be implemented.  If you arent seriously invested into your current server you can always move.
---
the secret is to just kill everything u see on ur way to quests, and if quest is busy, kill everything else u see.
---
Yep same Shit is happening to me
---
Oh how i wish they all would of heard the stealth noise and then saw a group just as big as what was in front of them behind them of rogues and druids
---
Seriously. I know it feels like forever as every quest seems like a competition for a mob but you’re right. In a few months, it’ll feel like a joke not having transferred because people don’t want to lose or start over having one character at 10-15.... the midway point to lvl 60 is 44.....
---
Yeah I have been in queue for whitemane for 3 hours. Friend who just got home logged into same server immediately. Something is broke.
---
Yes I have already restarted and switched servers multiple times.
---
I'm really hoping they do let us transfer. I got lucky and got into the server my friends wanted to play on at launch. Some of them went to one of the server a that opened after launch because their schedules wouldn't let them play on the one we originally picked the same way I could, but I already have 15+ hours on my character and I really don't want to start over, but I'd transfer my character to another realm if I could.
---
You're in queue. Welcome to the shit show that is classic wow population.
---
I love buffing people. :O
---
The OP is trolling.
---
Or the fact that Trump's immigration strategy is basically the same as Hitler's in his early days
---
why did you even sub in the first place?
---
I've been in queue since around 4ish central time and I'm currently at 1635. Had the same big drop down then no movement
---
Bro PJ Masks! Lmao
---
Redesign to make it work without flying mounts or with severely limited flying mounts/abilities
---
Shaman actually, the last kind of person I would think would do that. Life is cruel and deceptive it seems

You're misreading my comment, I'm not saying have more than one level 60, I'm saying doing that leveling over again every cycle for multiple "60's"

Did you try re going into the queue after your grace period had ended?
---
Good cuz I was in a 6 hour queue yesterday, and it took about 7 hours.
---
What server? 
---
Seeing a post about queue being stuck for people also..
---
That's not at all what I'm saying. They're enjoying their experience but the things they are enjoying so far are very very likely not Classic-Specific. 
---
They're enjoying things like leveling with friends who might have come back, the high population, and everyone in the game starting at the same spot so the zones are flooded with players and interaction. 
---
Take a look at this sub, "lines for quests" posts dominated, that's not Classic specific at all, that's just because it's new and popular. Questing is harder, and they're comparing it to retail with Heirloom gear. 
---
Everyone's allowed to like whatever the hell they want, but you're not being honest with yourself if you think, within 3 very limited days, the "Classic" aspect is the biggest reason
---
Same, it's awesome. And all my buddies don't like queues either so they're on the same server as me. It's dope.
---
Your kid is obv ignoring the queue and watchin pj masks
---
Kinda getting to that point.... my friends are all about 12 hours of playtime ahead of me and I work more than they do. When I get home, I'm tired and done with my day and just want to play some wow. Instead, I wait 3-4 hours just to even login and I put about 2-3 hours in before I go to sleep. And most of the time, I've already exhausted myself playing other games to spend the time, so when I finally get in I'm not even in the mood to play anymore. Plus, with all my friends high level than me I have to play super efficiently just to feel like I've even gained anything from the session. If it's not resolved by next week I'm quitting and picking up a copy of borderlands 3, where I can actually play with my friends at our own rate.
---
Anyone that new should be in a perfect position to start over. Very unlikely they’re leveling with several others/etc
---
My hot take is that the queue is there whether you want it or not. My tip is just about using the time in a way that is best for you. 
---
It's a drag, for sure. Just offering up what has made it easier to live with for me!
---
Blizz should accommodate the high demand. If someone gets logged out because they have to feed their baby and come back to a 10 hour queue, i don't blame that person at all for macroing his way around afk times. 
---
Log in early, and set up a macro, then you won't have to worry and blizz will be forced to deal with constantly full servers until they pull their heads out of their assess and admit people want to play this.
---
You Remote Desktop in earlier to start the queue.
---
I dont think there is one tbh.
---
You hit the nail on the head mate. This is the best version of WoW and I'm also so glad to be able to experience it in all its glory once again.
---
You're in it, the queue just drastically slowed down. Im trying as well, and noticed that same as u. It dropped like 500 in an hour.
---
aye its a mouseover macro, they're gunna press the button when they're mousing over someone, i understand the "completeness" of the icy-veins macro but 99.9% of use cases the simpler one works
---
It's pretty easy to make an in game macro to tag mobs.
---
Absolutely it can be played solo, the game does reward social playing as you share XP with your group.
---
I spent 8’hours playing yesterday. Felt guilty as shit and woke up to play for 8-12 more
---
Does remote desktop wake your PC up or do you have to leave it running?
---
Why should you get rested xp? Entitled
---
Can only play during the butt crack of dawn, it's awesome.
---
:-/
---
Dun Morogh on Kurinnaxx was poppin but not overwhelming. I grouped up with the random people and got shit done.
---
What is this grace period you speak of? Do I need to wait a certain amount of time?
---
&gt;guess
---
So directly out of someone's ass basically
---
Probably longer because once you get sub 10 minutes it goes down 1 minute every 10 minutes.

What UI addon are you using and where did you download it. I've yet to find a UI addon like ElvUI that is actually useable.
---
Look over here everyone. This guy said BfA good. I'm calling my ~~mom~~ mods

I went through Ashenvale as alliance earlier tonight, admittedly outside prime hours, and could not find someone to ~~gank~~ PvP. Ashenvale is usually horde favored, so I figured the odds of finding some PvP there would be good.
---
At the moment every single EU realm is way overpopulated, so it's not like it's a population issue.
---
This layering thing is nice for questing, I really really hope it doesn't sequester away potential PvP.
---
How can you know this?
---
me questing in silverpine
---
Can skip the expansion. Go straight to wrath.
---
No
---
Or if you get in too early just get on your phone every 20 minutes and jump or walk or something like I do.
---
Exactly. The main reason why I'm not seeing more of the same people is because no one can play when they want to.
---
I like to have the tank be a bit over the lowest level "starting level" because of low defence and more
---
What queue did you start with?
---
Be able to play yes but I would bet on bigger ques
---
If you think there won’t be insane queues this weekend, then I’ve got some bad news for you.
---
Now *THIS* is fucking epic.
---
I'm really confused about what's going on. Like I said, some people are logging in and bypassing the queue entirely and I think it's slowly it down for everyone in the queue.
---
Is this the only known working way to get ElvUI right now? I've tried from a few other sites and it doesn't work
---
Seems pretty petty.
---
sounds weird. Blaumeux is moving at like 3k an hour minimum.
---
As a warlock, this isn’t too far from the truth hehe. At least if you don’t wanna oom every 2 mins.
---
Whitemane constantly 12k
---
I don’t doubt that but I can pound monster for 3 days

Weekend is going to be even worse as far as queues go lol

Yeah I feel like that’s what I’m gonna do!

Open your spell book and put leatherworking on your bars. Now you can see what you can craft. The first 20 or so levels of leatherworking are turning scraps into light leather.

&gt;I'm willing to bet if Classic remains to attract a ton of players, they are going to want a way to extract more money out of the playerbase other than just subscription fee's.

To their own detriment. Anyone still playing past the first month is likely to stick around for long after, perhaps even playing it exclusively. Those players would also rapidly abandon ship if "monetization" beyond sub fee happens.
---
So far, I don't have any reason to doubt the Classic team. They have rapidly responded to the population explosion, and appear committed to keeping it honest to the original. Don't get me wrong, 25k queues are aggravating as fuck, and I hope that this realm capacity increase makes getting on to my server that much smoother tomorrow during peak.
---
Thots and playas.
---
Theres an addon called ConsolePort. It work with classic, does all the keybindings and UI for you. I had a play around with it and it works really well.
---
I feel like it will only be good in early game. Once you hit a certain point you'll just have too many spells to fit onto a controller.
---
I was more excited for white shoulders from WC than i have for any item drop since Cata
---
Didn't they yesterday or two days ago said that they will NOT increase player cap on realms? Yet here they are.
---
Smh
---
I queue for the server as bout 2 hours before my 1 yrs olds bed time that way I can play by the time he goes to bed
---
That’s odd. I don’t want to hop out to try just to lose my spot, but at this rate I won’t be making it on tonight anyways.
---
Thats what i mean! i feel like the loggin system isnt working properly right now. There is absolutely no way at least 50 people haven't logged off in 2 hours
---
Well without Blizzard releasing the exact numbers, wouldn't an educated guess based on their revenue be the next best thing? 
---
What method would you suggest to estimate BFA's sub count?
---
Cya
---
good ok twin galaxies
---
Yeah, I was online for about 16 hours yesterday, 6am-10pm, a couple quick breaks for a shower/meals, I’d be annoyed if at 4pm I’d been kicked into the queue.
---
Oh man. A real job. No one has those. So you've only spent every hour you weren't at work or asleep playing, but you're not having fun.  Im not a scientist, but I'd suggest quitting.
---
Layers &gt; Queues
---
Happens to me on Mograine, when you went through the queue once earlier you have priority, just when you reboot your game mid queue, you go back where about you were in the queue
---
What the actual fuck
---
what does this have to do with bfa?
---
How are you more entitled to the node than them? lol
---
Don't you dare get my hopes up
---
Hunters are amazing in Vanilla for all roles, WPVP (good hunters that is), farming, leveling, dungeon dps and CC (good hunters that is)  but the biggest problem is competing with the sheer amount of them you'll have to contend with, and standing out in the by and far largest played class is always your challenge if you want a regular spot anywhere (unless you play with a solid group then that's no issue).

I went staff. I didn't have a good 1h weapon or I would have been sorely tempted by the orb.
---
I moved out and tried it.
---
When you log or close and get back on in the grace period it just puts you back at your same spot in the queue.
---
This is what makes the game great. You see people doing random things in random places. It wouldn't be the same if everyone was just flat out power levelling
---
[Auto-Shot]s fired

It's taken me 2+ hours to get from 970 to 630.

Good luck

well, give us a number please.

Private servers could have different damage numbers for stats.

TBC Was an amazing expansion as it made the hybrids viable, and improved class balance and spec balance across tanks and healers.... It also introduced heroics, 10 man raids like the great Kharazan, and reduced the normal raid size to 25.  Tbc was the pinnacle of Wow. 
---
A lot of people say cata ruined wow, but it was actually Wotlk. The content was great, but everything was ridiculously undertuned. Every tank could aoe tank and keep threat on entire packs of mobs, and no cc or careful coordination was needed anymore. You could run heroics in quest greens, as they were easier than tbc normal dungeons... Which probably fed into the ultimate release of the lfd tool, and later lfr tool that came about in later wotlk patches. If they released wotlk again, it would have to be rebalanced upwards by about 40%+
---
10k lol. Those are rookie numbers
---
This should be the top comment.  Assuming the op is not trolling, rushing to the level cap is the fastest way to burn out on classic.  Enjoy the adventure.  If you don’t enjoy walking around, finding random things to do, then classic may not be your cup of tea.  Its fine.
---
nice wife
---
Pretty sure it's 12,000
---
I actually have never gone through the queue.
---
Skeram is one of the highest east coast servers and the last 3 hours are when most people will be playing after work. People just aren’t logging off I think. Especially with some of the things I’ve seen posted on how people are just staying in game and tricking the game into thinking they are there even if afk

I don't really know how to make it any simpler than that sorry.
---
None of that applies to holding down a key to stay in game, key presses by macro software such as AHK and razor synapse have already been confirmed non-bannable because disabled people and multiboxers use it, they said as long as it's a single button it's generally ok, automating your character isn't. Spamming jump would fall under that and it's been done for decades.
---
I was tailoring last night on my mage and had the option for an 8 slot green back or gloves that had +2int and +2spirit (my previous gloves had no stats). I went with the gloves, but I was going to regret it either way

Don't tell me that bro! What realm?? I'm trying to get on Fairbanks.

Oh man you just know we’re all gonna see this tomorrow now. Haha pretty hilarious

I'm trying to have fun but it needs some work thats all I'm saying it's just my opinion

Yea I think if anything, wow classic will convince them to go through with another world revamp and the level squish they've been teasing. 
---
That being said I think people need to realize part of their enjoyment of classic is that its been 15 years. If classic were released instead of tbc or say wotlk people would be like..........uh what?

Leveling in Classic is an adventure. Go out and explore the world, make some new friends and do quests together.

What server?

Server shutdown. (maintenance)
---
Alt shift Print screen captures only the active program ;)
---
Do any of the capitals have trainers for professions their races can’t learn?
---
You're misunderstanding the PP. They are talking about *future* disaster. They probably kept the layers low at first to force people to spread out (because of the queues). If they just allowed like 10 layers from the start, everybody would have got on with less queues, but everybody would cluster on the bigger servers with no incentive to spread out, and it would be disaster come phase 2.
---
i spent 9 hours from launch and only hit lvl 10....Im perfectly ok with that pace. Today i played and was able to go from 12 to 14 in 1.5 hours....again im ok with this.  If you want superfast lvling then go back to retail tourists...lol
---
Oceanic Servers are so good for that! Been finding dudes in my postcode left and right..
---
same with frostbolt lvl 1 on mages for the slow or the lvl 1 fireball to prevent rogues from invis.
---
They have added several new servers that does not have the same queues as the large ones. Also, today they increased the server cap on all servers so you should see a lot of improvements on that part as well. They're doing the best they can to ensure everyone can play while still not ending up with dead servers and overcrowded servers at phase 2.
---
Obviously you all need intellect you aren't Horde
---
https://gfycat.com/idioticseveralelephantseal-worldofwarcraft

Had this happen to me too. Thought I was dreaming. Happening on any other servers? I'm on Whitemane as well.
---
It's per server
---
Fr. People will always find something to bitch about. Don’t wanna wait? Go to the rp pve realm then. No problems getting on that realm?
---
“ will alliance cities be dead when almost half of the server population is alliance?”
---
No they won’t.
---
The flex
---
He must’ve been doing something weird because they can’t reasonably ban you for using an auto clicker as the person can just say he logged in from a remote PC and moved him self every 5-10 mins or what ever
---
Well most streamers and youtubers is like 0.1% of the players.
---
And if they don't get banned after publicly admitting it then nobody will.
---
Per server
---
Don't play on the server that has all the streamers on it.
---
Yeah, spend another 15 hours doing the exact same shit I just did. Nope.
---
well they reboot the server so might aswell wait for the queue right?
---
Should have played on a freeshard
---
lmao found the salty rs3 player.
---
What was Hitlers immigration policy in his early days?
---
You got married thinking classic would never happen right?
---
fire. use 5 sec rule and u wont need food until later
---
Can you please explain to me what is going on with your hotbars?
---
Not insulting you. Just purely curious on your train of thought.
---
They wanted to be extra sure not to create dead servers? Yeah fuck those assholes..
---
Skip those quests. 
---
At launch I walked over to Garrick Padfoot's place, saw a literal queue of people lined up from his hut all the way to the vineyards - noped right out of there.
---
I mean, it was funny to see, but I'm not waiting in no queue.
---
So I am overwhelmed by all that is Classic WoW. Back in the day, I ran a mean tauren hunter. I loved it, and I still carry the regret of never getting to get that damn leaf from MC to run the epic quest for that amazing bow. I now have a family, job, and all those things so I am unsure if this dream would even be a possibility now plus I wouldn't mind experiencing another class. Do any other classes have an epic quest like the hunter does?
---
Again, you are in the sub 5% range. A small amount of people would be unhappy, but it would cut que times drastically.
---
You know what annoys me? Not being able to play for multiple days now because by the time I can que there are over 10k players ahead because a fuckton of people abused the afk system by using macros.
---
You're grinding weeks for the honor of *replaying* the game. Notice how you unlock the death knight and they don't make you restart the game if you decide to play it? *That's* a worthwhile grind.
---
The game is a grind. That's the nature of MMOs. You know damn well leveling up is not the same thing as having to grind shitty quests for *months* is not the same thing
---
Do you know if there is any way to prevent being kicked after logging onto your character?
---
1. Play on server without/lower queues
---
2. Use teamviewer/google desktop control to turn on queue from work/school?  
---
I don't get it why people are crying about that stuff.
---
thsnkyou so much
---
If you join a party then it puts you on the same layer.
---
Yeah I can see how that's true. 
---
If there's more people in a server then there's a higher chance at any one time that someone could log out. 
---
The reality isn't so simple though. People wait in the queues and then afk with team viewer or a key script so they're logged on when they get home or wake up. 
---
This means there are more and more people logged on that simply aren't going to log off.
---
its not to late since its the original wow
---
Short of literal launch in 2004, now is literally the best time ever to get into WoW.
---
thasnkyou!!
---
Engineering has 'fun' and 'good' stuff for pretty much every class and playstyle AND, you have to actually BE an engineer to use almost all of it, unlike the other crafting professions which can rely on a guildmate or alt to help you out. Yes, it will be helpful in dungeons, it's debatable whether it helps more than leveling with a gathering skill would.
---
Did you not get the premium queue pass? I would not play on server like Whitemane without one tbh.
---
I see, thanks for helping me!
---
Nope does not work. Will put you back to 11k.
---
They prove blizzard lost 2/3 of their subscriptions at a minimum with the last 10 years of developers.
---
yea basically helps with mobility and some range stuff to pull mobs
---
&gt;  It'll be worse when city raids are happening
---
Going a bit off topic, but how will city raids work when dishonourable kills are back in with phase 2? I missed that point of wow's history but it seems DK's are going to make city raids impossible (because of aoe and/or only takes 1 person in the raid to screw it up)
---
No, short term planning is starting on a low pop realm because of some long queues in the first week after launch.
---
I was too scared to try WoW the first time, I thought I would  make too many mistakes and let down potential teammates. But I was convinced I was gonna try it this time around and I have been so pleasantly surprised and supported by the community. Everyone has been so kind, sharing items and knowledge, and I’m so so glad I got to be a part of this!
---
Lmao they are not a billion dollar company.
---
Nuff said
---
Guilty.  Hey, it's been 10 yrs lol
---
Classic is basically a relaunch of the game as it was originally released. (Not exactly down to every detail, but close enough.) Since it literally just came out 2 days ago, you are definitely not too late to get started.
---
Level 2 arcane int is +7 int, motw is +2 in all, so +10 in total and + 65 armor.
---
No it’s not to late at all it’s honestly a great time to as many newer folks are joining too and classic is much more social and helpful
---
Appreciate the responses, good to hear
---
Looks welsh to me
---
&gt;I guess what I'm saying is we've been playing expansion for years, we need a full game.
---
You're welcome
---
Cool thanks
---
Lmao
---
Imagine paying $800 rent for a house you've lived in for years. Your landlord decides to up and sell all their properties instead of continuing to rent them out. They hike up the price to an outright $5600 per property, and if you can't pay it upfront, they evict you, no questions asked, no remorse.
---
It's illegal.
---
I get legit sad when I see someone run by who already has fort! Let me buff yoooouuu!!!
---
I know people dont wanna switch from their original preferred realms but we had to tonight after 20k queue. 
---
At least we get to play together again with our friends. Not gonna suggest the usual “switch to low pop” but at least we can play now. Took us a few hours to get to where we were instead spending that time in queue.
---
thats so sweet
---
Where do you live where $15 a month is expensive?
---
If you drink alcohol, simply cut out 1 beer a week and you’ll be able to afford classic.
---
On launch the servers were capped to 10k, now it seems they're around 12k or 13k ish.
---
Bloodsail Buccaneers, the new Moonguard.
---
&gt;says its’s another 80 minutes
---
*Dont believe his lies*
---
But for real, the estimated time is whack. It’s better to go by the position in queue, which is also whack, but slightly less so.
---
There's an ad that keeps coming up on YouTube for a boosting service
---
Wouldn’t wow tokens rise in value because more people are purchasing them for Classic?
---
They said some servers would have long ques.
---
You were warned.
---
You picked said servers.
---
You are at fault, not Blizzard.
---
They started with few servers, I dont think they expected what they got. "You think you do, but you dont". Same goes for your server selection
---
On Skeram..
---
Tuesday: Queue at 5:15p when I get home from work, didn't get in until 11. Went through a \~11k queue
---
Wednesday: Queue at 5:15p again, queue started around 7-8k. Dropped from \~6.5k to \~3k in one update tick around 6:30p, is now moving at the speed of glass melting from being room temperature. From 6:30p to 9p, I'm now sitting at 1.6k and quickly losing any desire I had to stay up late again tonight to play.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
One of these days I'll get to play before I'm passing out at my desk. That unfortunately won't be any time soon.
---
I was a druid main in wotlk and don't remember it, that's why I think end but could just be that I already had established my looks and just didn't care enough to look at changing
---
If you’ve been playing for 15hrs your ques haven’t been that bad
---
Many tourists haven't even had a chance to log in. I know multiple people that are waiting for queue times to die down before they play.
---
I abandoned the quest and kept the rod on the beta. I don't see any reason why they would have changed it between then and now.
---
The problem with more serves is in a year you either have some empty servers or have to merge servers, both of which suck. One thing people liked was the server culture of vanilla and merging was part of what destroyed it.
---
Some people create solutions to problems.  Then there’s this guy, creating the problem that classic wow was the solution for.
---
Tukui might work for you. Its what I am using on classic. I've been able to move a lot of my UI around.
---
Ya damn right
---
Today I chased a priest that gave me fortitude halfway across silverpine to give him healthstone :) I would do this again, it was worth it :D
---
Bruh y’all got bots for the grind, to prevent disconnect when you’re away. This is awesome
---
Go engineer if you really wanna pvp hard. Pve I'm not really sure. I do know that engineer is probably the hardest to level as it's a money sink
---
frankly, i wanna see the cluster fuck.
---
You don't have to grind them for months, if you feel like you have to, look inside yourself, that's where the problem lies, not the game
---
This is the best opportunity in a very long time for a new player to jump into WoW.
---
Joined at 648 pm est yesterday, got on at 1206 am

Steve French?
---
12.00 i started que 15kish
---
I got in around 21.xx due somehow the que was crawling super slow around 3k, then poof i got in instantly. 
---
But ye wait times are quite insane. But hopefully the new hotfix will alliviate this a bit.
---
Even though crafting professions are not seen as worth it most of the time it really is so satisfying.
---
Same situation on Skeram. I started at 6k about 3 hours ago.
---
I'm at 4k now and it hasn't moved any noticeable amount in the past half hour.
---
It wasn't even reserved as the servers for reservations turned out to be unplayable due to queue :)
---
How can blizzard say definitively they are using a mouse clicker to buff them selves to keep them non afk when the user can say they just used remote pc log in from phone ?
---
Good stuff my man, godspeed.
---
True! That will be fun.
---
Didn't want OP to get an idea that I am bias towards asmon and that I'm not a white knight of his.
---
Blizzard’s net worth as of August 27th is $37.5 billion
---
It was pretty obvious in the first few hours after launch. After that it was fine (when I wasn't stuck in queue that is).
---
Wait till you put some goggles on the little fella. Goggles were a status symbol in vanilla.
---
Today someone named "Coolbones" on Nethergarde Keep (EU) gave me 2 Linen Bags which have 6 slots extra and wanted to give me food aswell and he did it for FREE. I wanted to give something in return but all he wanted of me is passing the spirit. This was one hell of a great experience I never thought I would get in Classic. This has to be the Classic experience everyone talks about and now I felt it for the first time! It felt like he gave me a fortune of money. So excited still! :)
---
This never worked in vanilla.
---
If you are ally there is a great sword from NE barrow quest. It straps across your back like a 2h
---
Slow 2h, and uhhh I don’t think taurens it matters just make sure your weapon skill is up or you will keep missing
---
I don't know whether to upvote or downvote your commitment.
---
?? I'm not justify anything here with shitty excuses.
---
Also, you're completely missing the problem here. It's not the grind. It's the fact that it's artificially gated behind dailies/weeklies. Your comparison to leveling would make more sense if you were only able to level up 5 times a week.
---
I'll have to take your word on it as I guess I just don't remember leveling that long ago
---
Yeah I’d never seek out spirit at end game. But for leveling, it’s really nice not having to sit and drink after every few fights.
---
How dare you contradict his blatant white-knighting.  Now blizzard will never sleep with him.
---
I got a ring in 'ere last night.
---
I usually just take 6 linen and 30 copper even from a complete stranger but your left but will do fine.
---
Been in queue since 4:30 - started at 5k and now at 600. Been moving only 100/hr for the past 2 hours.
---
I think that might be activision-blizzard which is the parent company of blizzard
---
I, too, play high as fuck, listening to Zelda and Chill, dotting the hell out of everything in sight, realizing what I’ve just done, then running for my goddam life, laughing as I run into a camp of gnolls during my escape, and immediately dying with a smile on my face. Classic is the goddam tits.
---
Bear 10 cat 20 cheetah 30 or 40 I forget
---
Classic+, would pay for new "classic expansions."
---
Give us voting like OSRS for gameplay impacting / QOL updates. Gatekeep it behind a level 50 character minimum. 
---
I would vote for TBC with altered content if they did things like remove infinite flying mounts and replace with movement based flying (i.e. you need to be moving to  ascend, automatically descend if stationary) and only have them able to fly in certain areas to access content, they are ground mounts otherwise. 
---
-Keep level 60, but have 60-70 talents. Tie earning talent points to actions in game, like "elite" quest chains, raids, PvP, crafting, dungeons, etc. And have more then enough avenues to earn those talent points. Reward for doing content that makes it feel like your character earned power, not just gear.
---
Base things off talent levels rather than level, e.g. at talent level 62 have small class quest to learn a new ability, at talent level 66 open a QOL gate to a area/rep for late-game content like how burning steps does it, through questing.
---
At max talent level, require a short quest to respec, like go kill X hard to solo mob (different per class) and give current respect cost in gold. Make builds feel like investments, but give us options to respec.
---
-Give us a LFG tool similar to TBC where you can list yourself for content, BUT only available in hub areas like cities or major strongholds like booty bay. This will keep it from being abused for simple quests that require a quick group forcing us to socialize to do those, but having an option for more invested grouping like dungeons or raids
---
-Expand on the racial mount system, race X learned how to tame/make Y mount, build rep to start a quest to get your own, gold sink for other models. Not a fan of race restrictions though I understand the reasons they exist.  As far as aesthetic goes, it's mainly things that would work as mounts in a semi-believable way, no celestial steed type BS.
---
- Change original content using phasing technology. We already do it for world buffs (dragon heads). Killed Onyxia? Lady Prestor is gone. Finished AQ40? Build out the Cenarian stronghold in the area. Classic+ could incorporate these areas into quests and opening new content. 
---
- Balance, shaman and paladin should be available to the opposing faction, dwarf shaman and tauren paladin. Mixed feelings on new races, no new classes, should tweak specializations to make competitive in raids, but still respect raid theme, i.e. MC isn't friendly to fire magic/damage.  Next content after naxx should remove debuff limit, restrains warlock gameplay. 
---
-Give us all the professions, archeology, pet system and battles. More horizontal content like darkmoon fair.
---
-Make all raids have atunement quests, make a previous raid involved in attument process. MC attunement could be a good example.  If another elemental/dragon/undead related raid, make MC/BWL/Naxx involved in the attunements to keep it relevant. If new concept, dungeon/faction gate attunements. Maybe implement raid wings that expand on attunement. Full raid attunements open new questlines and itemization up.  Final raid of an expansion requires only initial attunements quests of previous raids completed to become available.
---
-Raids should have horizontal content. Hard modes, gated bosses, quest chains based on raid completion. Have summonable world bosses that impact raids, like once you've downed Nefarian, kill all summonable dragon world bosses and Onyxia to open Nefarian hard mode. and Give us a reason to keep raiding tiers, keep tiers relevant, they aren't just loot boxes.
---
-Itemization, keep secondaries as they are, must vote to change them. Supermajority (75-80%) wins are necessary. Gear should have slots, no reforging. Only one major jump in ilvl per "expansion,"  once you have full attunement for a raid, associated faction gives quests to boost gear pieces. Make us work for gear, no welfare gear.

lvl 18, 0 bag drops. had to buy all mine
---
What's transfers gonna change??
---
i wish i would have known this. i've invested too much time on thalnos to abandon it now and i'm really pissed off.
---
&gt; And even then, there are other ways to solve queue times that don't include kicking paying customers from their servers.
---
How do you solve people gaming the AFK system?
---
&gt; Where are you getting that 5% number from? 
---
My ass of course, although common sense will say that far far fewer people game for more than 8 hours straight.
---
&gt;  Certain servers still have unbearable queue times, but that was predicted and warned against.
---
After most guilds and friends have decided where they will be of course. Sorry if I'm not playing with my guild then I am not playing at all, god forbid I want them to actually use a solution that guarantee fixes the problem.
---
If Que times arent an issue, why do you care about needing to re-enter them every 8 hours?
---
Housing, it turns out, is treated differently than wow add ons. Depends what the $5 bought you and if he refunds in the next 90 days but probably not illegal.
---
Bitcoin donation address?

That said, the in-game addon is just a UI for the string that the desktop client gives. If ever needed, the client can also be easily masked as another windows service. In order to ban this, they would have to ban discord.
---
My friend just did this. Ive been in Skeram queue since 5pm so a few hrs now. at 7pm he hopped off Incend and got right into Skeram. I was like wtf? That was 1.5 hrs ago and im still 3k+ in queue
---
Yup. Downloaded teamviewer at my work to log in 2-3 hours early.
---
Worked perfectly today. Should be in queue by the time I finish eating dinner
---
😭😭😭
---
Chrome remote desktop works on the phone as well!
---
Freezing cold takes
---
Can mods please make it against the rules to post a shitty phone video/picture? GPUs come with software that will record a clip for you in 2 key presses now. Get with the fucking times.
---
If hearth is on CD/doesn't exist then it goes to nearest graveyard.
---
Sometimes they say I'm a bad influence :P
---
I have not once had an experience like you've described.
---
The thing is there is no where to go. All the servers have a shitty Q.
---
\&gt;serious problems
---
this isn't serious. we're on day 3 of a game that will be around for years
---
thanks for your advice!  i decided to actually go with a hunter dwarf on alliance and i'm loving it.
---
Thanks :)
---
Who is this lame anyways?
---
Ahmpy lvl 44
---
Skeram
---
just saw this, unfortunately i'm already leveling on thunderfury but good luck!
---
You'd be right, if these were normal customers we are talking about. These are fanatics. They will defend and praise the game for anything.
---
You start with a good product, fanatics are happy. Make it worse, they're unhappy but they're still defending your product and the changes. "Fix it" and now the fanatics have more things to praise you about because "you're listening".
---
These aren't normal customers, these are people with their head so far up blizzard's ass they know what blizzard had for lunch.
---
The frustrating part for me is that they dealt with and solved long log in queues *10 YEARS AGO*, they *knew* Classic would have massive interest, they have 15 *years* of experience managing server populations.
---
And yet here we are, at the launch of what should be a massive boost to their health as a company, and lots of us are looking at 60+ minute queue times thinking, "Is it *really* worth it?"
---
And I'm *really* starting to think it just fucking isn't.
---
To all the Magebros around:  toss me that sweet Arcane Intellect please!
---
I have so many weapon skills to level...
---
Try a lower population server.
---
Or the new option, add a bunch more carriages to the roller coaster so you can have more riders at one time.
---
They tried to gank the hunter mid fight, because they had the upper hand, hunter was low on helth plus bonus they were gona ruin hi kill. [HOW THE TURN TABLES!](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/411a098e-79b6-44b7-8b33-75d7182dc4bf)
---
I'm off Friday for a 4 day weekend, getting up at 6am and I will lost as long as I can. I will not use a macro to stay in game tho, because its a shitty fucking thing to do.
---
It "matters" in that you have to do it, but its boring as hell.
---
There's a lot of boring bullshit in the MSQ, and the devs said they're probably going to retool that in the future. And thats why they sell story/level boost pots now. They do a lot of things to make it not as bad as WoW, like the job levelling, and level sync. That helps TREMENDOUSLY. 
---
You still run into a lot of problems that WoW has to deal with, empty zones, irrelevant content, and just a lot of bloat. FFXIV deals with it more elegantly, but there's still inherent problems with the theme park expansion formula, imo.
---
Because, for some reason, some people (like my gf lol..) were able to just log in and skip the line.
---
The queue is bugged.
---
Same thing for me.
---
I'm for sure having the same issue and my queue has restarted 5 times, no matter how long i wait it just goes back to 7k plus position in queue. 3 and a half hours now. Server is Incendius.
---
paid and free transfers were both in vanilla and they said they will probably add paid at least.
---
Don't you only change layer if you're invited by someone on another layer? Thought that's how it worked.
---
It's a whole lot easier to have a guild transfer for free than to convince them all to re-roll from scratch.
---
Pretty much this.
---
Untill you start gathering its not your node, you just got ouplayed and are salty loser.
---
Go to a city and try to sell something to someone. You will notice the layering real quick.
---
Don't break an arm jerking yourselves off. Can someone make a new classic wow sub and just leave this one as the official classicwow circlejerk?
---
Back on Nostalrius, I used to use Blessing of Protection on people mining to steal their nodes.
---
Not even just that, I was raised in a household where "subbing" for things is considered dumb, I now know that it's not "that dumb", if there's continuous support of the product they oughta expect something back, but there's still a side of me that gets flustered every time I waste money that ain't on EXTREMELY necessary things due to how I was raised, so buying a sub to sit around waiting to just get in? That would drive that anxiety up the fucking wall.
---
No one has an excuse not to go with you if blizzard offers free migrations.  good luck convincing 20 people to reroll no matter how small the time investment.  people don't work like that.
---
Yeah this happens to me all the time. I never thought of it in this context tho, people are certainly skipping the queue which is unfair and makes me extremely angry

Can this app turn on my computer, or wake it from sleep? I just downloaded the app and connected it to my computer. I’d rather not leave my computer on while I’m at work though
---
I'm on Kirtonos... what more can I do?
---
No queue on Kurrinaxx at 630 pm. Yesterday was 1 hour. Seems to have helped
---
Omni cc maybe
---
Damn I’m sorry you had to see this this. I take full responsibility and will handle the fallout from your exposure to sub standard sharing methods for fake internet points.
---
yeah they dont even excel at being hybrids
---
give a priest a wand and they are 10x better than any druid at both dps and healing
---
&gt; Or the new option, add a bunch more carriages to the roller coaster so you can have more riders at one time.
---
Many people want to stay with their friends, what the fuck is the point of classic if you don't play with your bros?
---
Is there a list anywhere of locations if chest spawns?
---
I mentioned technological and logistical boundaries, because as someone who lives in the real world I appreciate that there are many moving parts to any decision.
---
They have solved the logistical side, and were then able to update the technological side accordingly. 
---
I still don't know why you're so upset, maybe you need to find yourself an outlet, sounds like there's some inner hurt or torment waiting to figure itself out because you're clearly far too upset about a trivial matter.
---
Catch you later buddy, I hope you figure out whatever it is that's bothering you.
---
Considering they ignored our pleas to make more servers before release, we gotta take what little victories we can get, I guess.
---
I’ve been in q since the exact same time. I’m at 140 :(
---
Retail has like 78 servers just in NA.  They haven't learned anything. Read ions most recent comment they still expect that these full servers will die off in a month.  Imagine 400 lvl 60s running around in ungoro or silithus crashing everything once they take away layering because they are *still* massively underestimating the playerbase.  They didn't understand why people wanted classic, and they still don't.
---
It really is. I thought I was going to become impatient or frustrated. But it's so much fun doing our class quests and exchanging meaningful grey items with each other.
---
Why do people avoid the RP realms?
---
I think it's unfortunate you consider people doing this assholes. People doing this are like you, they really want to play the game. I don't think anyone's an asshole for doing what is logical to do if the goal is to be able to play the game instead of stare at queue at home. I've got about 20 hours of queue under my belt, far less than /played so I get the frustrations but levy that anger at Blizzards strategy for launch, not other players.
---
Yeah you are always afk for like 30 mind until logged out. Even when sitting still.
---
Nothing "phases", it's just the dynamic spawn rate
---
Can I keep my torch out though?  It was really difficult to get lighted.
---
Many people take a break after shutdown. Shutdown happened every night so far, even on launch night, so I don't think they made any improvements.
---
im saying ill clip my nails for 3 days now...
---
Why not play on a lower pop server? Like yeah, if you're trying to play on Faerlina you're SOL, but I'm on Rattlegore and the world feels pretty full but there's no queue.
---
Are there non-BOE random enchantment gear?
---
You reek of ignorance pleb
---
Well that didn't last long... Whitemane had no queue at 4pm pst, now at 6:00 it's back to 12,000 queue. 
---
Looks like everyone just moved back to their old servers after the capacity hike was announced.
---
I'm not too sure about a voting system. I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the features that started the downward spiral of retail were also features that the majority of the players would have voted for at the time. Perhaps the classic community is different but I am not entirely sure when we factor in large amount of classic players that are not your average /r/classicwow player.
---
If you don't mind telling, how are you making so much gold?
---
Me too. That’s barely a queue
---
I logged in around 7pm EST and got in instantly. I took a short break and am now behind 8000 others, jeeze...
---
God that sounds awful.
---
It somewhat goes against the spirit of competitiveness, no? It's like paid boosts to max level, everyone worked their ass off to get there, made sacrifices (whether you consider that good or bad, they still did), and here's some guy who comes in, buys his way in, doesnt know shit about what's going on, and (at least, anecdotally) arent really fun players to be around, often some of the least fun, I assume because they're not invested in the game to any degree if they have that kind of fuck-you money to throw around.
---
Theres also a bit about the philosophy of "earning" in games from this era. It's one of the few places where time invested into something can pay dividends in server fame, social status... its one of the places that money can't actually buy massive success in the game, which is a good feeling. The moment you add gameplay bonuses to those with money is the moment you kind of screw over everyone else who got there without it, because the gameplay mechanic is now "look, you can have as much fun as all the other players who worked their ass off to get here as long as you're rich". If you have the time, it's legitimately an exciting, open playing field. And again, rich kids with way too much money are often the worst people you come across on these games [anecdotally, dont @ me], but I think the vast majority of people agree, and culturally look down on things like that.
---
You could certainly make an argument that this reinforces addiction, as many have, but that doesn't really affect the cultural perception of RMT, so hey, there's your argument against it. :P
---
That explains so much! Thanks!
---
I think it would be more tedious if a) you couldn't get a key to get in the back and b) it wasn't a level 30ish dungeon. It's not that bad.
---
Thrall confirmed for smash.
---
Wow, me and my dad were playing on the same account for many years, didn't know that was actually covered by ToS hah
---
What's she gonna do? Take half the debt?
---
Joking, my wife is a gamer too. She's pretty understanding.
---
Why? That option would've saved me hundreds over the years. I know whether I like the product or not. I do.
---
I know some of those words
---
So you're selfish. What if everyone had the same shitty mindset as you? Then no one would ever get buffed.
---
My mates and I started alliance alts on Felstriker last night to escape the 10k queue on Arugal. No queue and no regrets
---
He isnt though.
---
The real strat is to take a week off in week 3 or 4.
---
Right now I basically stop playing from 6pm to 9pm central due to how fucking packed the zones are.
---
Only 15 years?
---
Yeah you do
---
Leveling my rogue. 
---
Still in the starting zone. 
---
Gotta kill some spooky spiders. 
---
I pull one with throw then BOOM two spawn on me another one pats.
---
 I except death. I know I won't make it out but ill put up a little fight. 
---
I type out. "Welp this seems to be my end"
---
Foooosh a fire ball flies across the screen. Hope returns to me, I start pressing buttons with more and more vigor, we each kill one off. I kill another. 
---
I type out to them to tag the 4th so we each split thr XP evenly (naturally i think of sharing the kills) afterwards we bow at each other and go out ways. 
---
I missed this. I rarely see others in BFA unless I message friends and we meet in the mythic or raid setting and or inside a loaded zone (arena etc)
---
Unfortunately all my kids are too old to fall for it now.
---
I don’t know, given the population issues. I know I’ve had them restore deleted characters on retail in the past. But this is a different beast.
---
I had the same thing happen. Was waiting in queue for 15 minutes and people in my guild said they were able to skip the queue entirely.
---
I cancelled login and reopened the game and instantly got to the character select screen. Same server as you
---
Can only be daggers, unless you go train swords at weapon trainer.
---
Classic raids are a joke compared to modern raids lol
---
Umm, yeah this isn't how any of that works.
---
Anecdotal, but I've tried this multiple times the past 2 nights before giving up without luck.
---
Do macros automatically cast  the highest spell level or no? I forget if that was at launch or if it was added later.
---
Yes, alt+Z by default.
---
You can make friends along the way. People often cooperate out of convenience or necessity. I’m not a “retail hater” but I really can’t endorse retail right now as a good experience for a new player. Definitely suggest checking classic out
---
People who accidentally delete their chars are the same people who accidentally pull half the instance with their pet on agro
---
Right now I have a 3 hour wait time
---
I'm ok with that solution, the only issue is that without addressing the people who abuse the afk system, we will have a higher number of people in the game but a higher number of people abusing afk too.
---
So let's say they increase spots by 100 and a quarter abuse afk, well then they really only opened 75 spots. Extend that out to every server and it's an issue.
---
But I still hope it helps, I really do.
---
social gameplay is meta again. It feels useful too, instead of being an effort or inconvenience with less benefit than the automated systems.
---
im sure it did jack. maybe 5,000 more (im being lenient as hell) can enter. that's still 15k people trying to jam in.
---
the thing is that im still in and im doing that now for an hour
---
I made a human warlock and got it to level 11-ish and got to westfall, idk if wow isn't for me or the class doesn't open up till later but i'm not sure if I am feeling warlock. I've been looking around and mage looks pretty fun too but I am really torn now between sticking with warlock and committing or going with mage. Warlock looked really cool in concept but it feels kinda off. On the other hand mage also looks really fun but I might miss out on warlock fun since I don't plan on making an alt any time soon.
---
ok ty
---
PvP without transmog might be a little more difficult. The game is harder to RP in my opinion anyway.
---
&gt; MonkeyQuest
---
This is exactly the type of addon I was looking for, thanks! I wasn't sure how many retail addons worked with Classic so I didn't think to look for something that wasn't made for Classic.
---
ty
---
one hour rn
---
If a level 18 was lfg and said DM and a level 60 whispered them for tribute run, the level 60 was who got laughed at. No one on my server called it VC until wrath babies came along.
---
Flamelash EU? I remember this comment
---
wand!
---
https://i.redd.it/ccbdiourmmi31.png
---
sorry if youre alliance I only saved the horde one
---
Hey aren’t you that guy
---
Yes! This is the first version of the game!
---
Yes!!!
---
You probably got in queue before hotfix went live. Hotfix made it so queues are way lower or not existent.
---
You actually just have no idea how these afk scripts work so it’s hilarious to see you get so worked up about it. You can set random intervals, and random actions, and no one smart is having it spam something every single second. If you actually think there would be no false positives you’re just a moron.
---
Most have some, like TB has a priest trainer I know
---
Repost this in the morning when people are at school/work. It deserves a bit more visibility. Not much mind you, but fair is fair.
---
I would argue that they are already leveling pretty damn fast
---

Knock yourself out.
---
Thats exactly what I did.  Currently at work and logged in 2 hours ago for when I get home in an hour and 45 mins.
---
Haha these are great!
---
I've buffed more people in the last couple days than I ever did in anything past BC
---
Man I’ve talked to more people in the past 3 days out in the world than in a month of BfA. Feels weird but nice.
---
So you beat the queue. Must be nice.
---
Same rog stole my lether!
---
That makes sense. Thanks
---
On my server they've been barely above vendor price for like a day lol
---
WoW Classic to WoW Retail: this is so easy, I literally can sit here like a potato and get epics :)
---
Too soon?
---
dude I feel you. dont understand people saying that the game will tank. man this is classic fking wow. it's already set records and it will keep doing so. people are in for a helluva surprise.
---
That's why Im leveling a hunter with my wife she works more hours than me so I can main a  warrior and have the king farm class not many levels behind
---
still in queue tho
---
Having any vectors of social interaction feels amazing. People became white noise in retail.
---
In vanilla it was always DM for Deadmines on my server. DM+wing for dire maul
---
Ya’ll stay away from Westfall ya here
---
That looks absolutely amazing.
---
I got 4 last night! Wife was out with friends, girl went down early. It was glorious!
---
What's gated behind dailies and weekly's that actually matters to content though? You've given no real examples that anything is gated

That's actually really accurate, well said.
---
You have to shitpost I'm general when waiting an hour on the 10 minute quest respawns.
---
It's not [Barak's Head] anymore...I want my money back.
---
Because they're scared blizzard will try to make retail more like classic if it's more popular.
---
/target seems to make his face show up
---
Yeah I bit the bullet and started over elsewhere and guess what? That server now has a long queue. You can't win...
---
It kind of depends how conscious people are about group make-up. I feel like for the most part, people just consider if you're tank, dps, or healer; and not so much if you are going to be rolling on the same gear as they want (but I do that). If you want to do a lot of instances and groups, you should also consider what will be easiest to get gear for. It sucks competing with every other caster for caster gear, and shamans/druids/paladins also need a healing set to make up for not being spec'd for healing. My point is, priest is in high demand, but getting gear will be annoying if you don't make your groups very specifically.
---
Hunters on the other hand, at least after 40, have pretty specific gear that shouldn't be needed by anybody except other hunters. But it will be harder getting groups :P
---
Warrior might be the best of both worlds (specific gear and easy to get groups).
---
Now it’s back to 10k people 2hr estimate?
---
Yeah!! Have fun guys! I unfortunately planned a vacation this week before Bliz announced the release date... Next week though, all day erry day WoW day. Still better friends with the players I met in classic than anyone irl 🤣
---
Just go to a new server then. I've never had a queue on Old Blanchy. I don't get why people are wasting so much time on queues especially if they haven't even gotten to make a character yet.
---
Imagine expecting there not to be queues the first two days.
---
Got my first gold in classic today.
---
felt better then breaking 200k in bfa.

The exception being humans with perception, which gets you the jump on any other stealthy.
---
I got logged in from ~2000 yesterday. It was  like a layer opened up, ir I guess crashed, and funneled a bunch of us in.
---
Umm legit may wake up at 4 😬
---
Poor as sin, every time I get over 50s i blow it all on skills. Granted I'm also levelling professions because I want to make sure I've got potions for levelling and decent food, and I've been ocassionally buying health pots and scrolls from vendors. I'm probably putting more money than I need to into it but yknow as a warrior I'll take all the buffs and health pots I can get lmao.
---
You're taking the concept too literally.  They didn't think it would actually "fail", they just severely underestimated the amount of people that would subscribe to play it.  If they had thought it would be nearly this successful, they would have released way more servers before launch.
---
Holy shit... my first character was a night elf rogue. I lived in Darnsssus for about 6 months - no joke.
---
This brings me back to the very first days of playing WoW when I was completely and utterly hooked.
---
ಠ_ಠ
---
I rolled with a group of people on this server.  Blizzard suggested it prior to launch to avoid long queues..
---
Now those of us who work until 5 haven't been able to play
---
It’s prat 3.0
---
......... When the Boogeyman goes to sleep at night he checks his closet for Chuck Norris.
---
clearly he isnt trying hard enough
---
Warrior too. Stamina boost legit saved my life 3 times. Spirit helps with life regen. Got 27 of those kaldorei spider leg kebabs. 27!
---
Fascinating. There are a lot of similarities here with how runescape became rs3 (or as some who are less flattering would call it, ezscape). Instansed worlds, huge focus on endgame PvE. Streamlining of skills.
---
&gt; I think that's a huge curiosity amongst the entire player base. Is how will classic evolve if at all? Do they introduce a classic server for each expansion down the line? How will it effect future content for the "retail" game? These are all questions that I like to think everyone will hope makes for a better overall Warcraft experience.
---
Here are some interesting knowledge based on how Old school runescape (OSRS) has functioned. Obviously there are huge differences but we may see similar outcomes:
---
-Upon initial release, once the nostalgia high wore off, OSRS almost died. Apparently without updates, MMORPGs cannot exist. 
---
-Once the game received regular updates, it started gaining traction again. These updates fit the 'older style' of the game and were distinctly different from rs3's updates. Polls had the community vote on the direction of the game and which updates would be released
---
-OSRS vs Rs3 is a constant debate, but OSRS is objectively more popular. It's not even close. Rs3 barely has 1/10th of the popularity.
---
I'm eager to see how Classic performs vs retail wow. I hope they update the game in a different direction. That would imo be the best path
---
Wouldn't Walmart workers have lots of time
---
I’ve eaten about half of it so far, and it tastes amazing.
---
It's not really so much about avoiding queues, it just suits my RL better to start next week
---
Keanu rolls on cloth as a warrior, Keanu steals.
---
i promise its just luck, if you get on the afk logout code's radar itll kick you off as intended
---
people have left their character standing in an inn and come back a day later still logged in somehow
---
some people have afk'd for 15 minutes and come back to character select
---
spaghetti code and whatnot
---
IMO warlock is more fun than mage. As mages generally spam the same spell Frostbolt and run away. Where as Warlocks have multiple dots and can make choices between wanding, draining or shadowbolting to finish something off depending on the situation.
---
Just a common courtesy suggestion: in a professional conversation especially one that involves problem solving, respond in the same clear, direct, professional language as the operator you are communicating with.
---
Id say they're both as shit as the other, really.
---
No way...
---
Was he already on or something?
---
welcome to the ranks of the awake my friend!!  
---
BFA not good. Mists sort of threatened to see the game become good again, that was the closest it got. Major major blows were dealt as warlords come and as it patched to pre legion. 
---
This game's magic is dependent on currency of interaction, difficult distance crossing, and world gameplay that isn't stiff and Cookie cutter. Specs and gameplay that has interesting variables that lead to decisions whether to do an action, or to conserve/recharge, and talent options that robustly support that with role customization.
---
Modern game abandoned all of this.   
---
The classic game is still new as an mmo. No game has yet iterated on and given us the next version of what is magical and excellent. No newer one has been invented yet. This is the newest one we've got and we need to cherish it, this a surreal opportunity.
---
I would honestly tell you not to play because it is the same game you played back in 2006 and it would be like giving an addict a hit of their drug.
---
Yes that’s correct, but only for that 20 seconds.
---
I was expecting ash letting butterfree go
---
All of you are describing lvling experience which I admit is better than retail, and thats the only good thing about classic. In before “classic is harder” because this always make me laugh.
---
“My own opinion”
---
Played every expansion, and retail is far superior for me than classic, with all of specs broken, talent trees with 1 viable build and a lot lot more broken things. Retail got a lot of quality of life changes that should be implemented from the start, aoe looting, cross realm play, inspecting other players talents, etc. 
---
I just dont have 15h to play a day to “keep up” in classic with all of the consumables required for raiding, time commitment, guild ninjaing tanks/geared players because there are no catch up mechanics. Classic just feel broken for me. I have great memories from vanilla, but I dont want to go back.
---
&gt;The sense of danger
---
I think this is so overlooked. The feeling of danger you get when you're making it through a rough cave makes you so engaged. But that's nothing compared to the feeling of joy you get when you safely make it out with quests complete.
---
That feeling happens a few times before level 20. And it feels better than any loot upgrade I've gotten in this game before this week for the past 10 years.
---
Your welcome.
---
Runescape model would be good. 75% of player base votes on their site to agree to any new update in their classic+.  75% have to say yes
---
Personally I’d love classic+
---
Well you managed to take the fun out of leveling so I would argue that you aren't either
---
I got 2x 6-slotters from killing defias mobs in the Northshire Abbey.
---
1 character responding to an event via 1 keystroke is not automation.
---
10 characters responding to an event via 1 keystroke is.
---
Youre automating 9 keystrokes. Idk how this is so difficult.
---
If you made the Great decision to roll on Sulfuras, make sure to join the discord: https://discord.gg/8pUtP6f
---
Did not work for me.
---
Every time I remote from home, my internet either gives out or the server kicks off when I'm not watching, so i go back into the queue. I just give up for now. Wait till it dies down
---
I guess that's fair. I was thinking more of they wanna hit cap to start raiding and everything but I can see speedrunning being an issue on pvp servers
---
There are some jerks in the mix, but that can't be helped. For the most part people are helping each other out, which is nice.
---
So just go straight after arthas?
---
So sad to see. Unfortunately a common neurological condition in Dwarves
---
yeah mby in the public chat but doing dungeons with strangers is totally chill
---
I remember a few people in Vanilla called it VC, but it was really rare. Pretty much everyone called it DM, and I never met anyone silly enough to think a level 16 in Westfall was trying to run Dire Maul.
---
Of course players will always be happy to get something that is (somewhat) rare, and rarity is always relative. 
---
For example, in classic you earn copper/silver and in retail you make tons of gold. The value of currency is completely relative and it doesn't automatically mean retail is "wrong".
---
There’s a future president killing boars out there as we speak.
---
Just merge down to a reasonable number of layers. What's the issue?
---
Accurate asf
---
This isn’t blizzard. Are you drunk?
---
This is the best classic meme I've seen yet, thanks for the laugh
---
They've stated they will be paid.
---
We always had fun! And some aggravating times too . Lol (time lost proto drake) we used to play until the sun came up sometimes lol. I miss WoW and seeing classic makes me want to play again. I missed the horn when I won something I really wanted. * core hound anyone ?*
---
xD
---
Layering doesn’t even change on login. Yesterday I was questing with a random guy and today, 16 hours later I saw the same guy and we did another quest together. This was on Whitemane which had 6700+ alliance players on when I ran a census scan.
---
&gt; A rare purple or blue drop from a mob FEELS amazing 
---
You already have purple or blue drops? Nice! I haven't played that much yet, so for me a white armor drop feels fucking amazing.
---
Has anybody horde tried attempting to push-trade a bolt of silk cloth to an alliance paladin yet?
---
US nuclear launch facilities still run on IBM computers from 70s.
---
Best time since 2004 to start.
---
No clue who he is or what he did, but he streamed 9 hours today.
---
Picked-up around 10k followers and hasn't streamed in over two years... Maybe Twitch thinks he's viewbotting?
---
Stats: https://sullygnome.com/channel/kungentv/365/streams
---
Guild Wars 1 did. Although technically not an MMO in many ways, more like Diabloesque parties with dungeons/raids and MMO in towns only.
---
But the concept was there, and it was amazing.
---
Happening on Skeram too. People were getting really pissy about it lol. I've always seen it as VC.
---
They've stated they will be paid. It's ''the one thing we're currently planning to charge for in classic'' or some such. For now. Maybe they can see the light and do free ones considering how ridiculous the Qs are, but i wouldn't hold my breath.
---
Lyrics are in the Video Description! If that helps! Oh and Thanks!!
---
No you're right. Don't let that guy bully you. Multi-Boxing software does automate duplicate keystrokes.
---
Instead of having to input an action 5+ times you only have to do it once... With software.
---
So if they are planning on removing layering BEFORE phase 2. That means they will not be introducing phase 2 until layering is gone. Which could be months at this rate.
---
Did you do it through twitch mods?
---
r/2meirl4meirl
---
i have 30 hrs /played help me
---
I'm on atiesh as well and oh man this is already old.
---
This is more people than I've ever seen in a single place on retail.
---
Someone posted something similar yesterday. Stupid
---
Im not an r tard
---
I would love for them to open up locations on the classic continents that have been opened in expansions (quel thalus, gilnaius, Kara, Mt Hyjal)  and you can open up new races that exist in these lands ( worgen, goblin, Blood elf)
---
there are ways to maintain Classic, while adding content.
---
If you log out in an inn the. You will gain rested xp the longer you are logged out in it. This gives you bonus xp when you are playing. Other then that, I’d suggest sticking with retail.
---
Play retail
---
You got more xp from killing those 136 mobs than you would have from the quest. It was worth it, and that's the point. Quests were just meant to guide you where to grind. I'll get that 5th rune and keep killing mobs even after that
---
That makes sense, so in some ways it's like invisible realms within the whatever realm you think you're in. I've seen some evidence of that in retail but I mostly play solo or pug dungeons and bgs.
---
Yes. It precisely is. Tons of friendgroups and guilds having to split up over this asinine launch.
---
Save some silver train staves before you get to DM even if you don’t get the dungeon drop the quest stave is decent enough to last. Your dmg is all about wand don’t ever hit things with staff. It’s just their to amp your int/spirit up. If you can’t afford staves right away better to put that money toward a wand.
---
Yea! Stop holding out on us OP!
---
Some of the materials you need to craft are simply sold by NPC vendors. Look for the “leatherworking supplies” guy in main cities
---
obviously this is also being added to NA? only ask because it’s on EU forums, and i’m kind of noob-ish still
---
I didn't participate in the fight but I did ran past the entire raid at one point (I'm pretty sure they ended up making it on the wrong layer at first). My frame rate tanked from 120+ down to sub 30. I can't even imagine the slideshow the fight would have been.
---
Ah,an asus vg248qe. I see you are a man of culture.
---
&gt; I still don't know why you're so upset,
---
says the guy continuously trying to defend idiotic statements.
---
&gt;I mentioned technological and logistical boundaries,
---
No, you made up bullshit thinking you know everything, they proved you wrong and proved the queue is entirely based off choice, yet you CONTINUE to defend them, like the little lemming you are. 
---
The "boundaries" were nothing but a CHOICE that most sane people thought it was idiotic and now have proof it wasnt a technical reason at all.
---
The only thing bothering me is idiots like you that defending piss poor decisions because you cant handle any criticism of your overlords. 
---
Catch you later? bitch please.. fragile egos like yours will never stop responding, you cant handle  being smacked around on a forum so easily.
---
Wow RuneScape went more casual then. If Blizz does decide to go classic + I hope they stick to their roots

Here is the Curseforge page for classic filtering. Also, if you have the Twitch app installed, you can choose the Classic version and only addons that are in the Classic section will show up for it. You can also use Wowinterface as they have a section specifically for Classic addons. I've been testing quite a few and so far MonkeyQuest is great but because my eyesight is horrid and my memory is trash, I'm trying to find something that will give you an arrow pointing to the quest location. So far only Guide like addons have it and most of those suck because they want you to go to a different zone, then do a bunch of quests in that zone, once you finish all those quests, it wants you to head back to the zone you first started in and then after a few quests will send you on another journey.

---
Just had a 4 hour DM run and didn't hate it because the randoms in the group were chill.
---
I do not want to play retail, I want to play classic with everyone else
---
Low quality bait
---
There are ones that don’t make the game any easier but just make it so it’s more your style - different unit frames, larger minimap, action bar with different art etc. the gameplay is the same.    
---
   
---
There are also ones that give you basically a guide to complete quests
---
I’m a noob, can you explain what you mean? What pulling half they stand means? What their pet on Agro means?
---
After I found the rank 2 I still didn’t fort him...3 times I went back.
---
It's a satire account fyi
---
No the guy was a dick but he was right. I misunderstood what was going on in the gif. No bullying here, I promise.
---
good luck queueing for bgs as ally on that shit lol
---
like I said, you rename it if the pop is healthy enough
---
it's a way to guarantee people that if they go to a low pop server now, they won't get stuck on a dead server, if the pop is too low in a few months after the initial spike in players, it will get absorbed to the server with the same name. predictable - people can't complain about the merge, they created a character with that knowledge
---
Meanwhile. 20 hours later I hit 18 today.
---
They changed the way the servers are labeled now. If it says anything other than full, there is room for you!
---
Lmao alliance vs horde. If you went horde and friends went alliance that shit would happen whether there were queues or not.
---
Attention seeking much?
---
well hope it worked cause if not I'm out of advice &gt;&lt;
---
That’s good to know. I hope that’s still the case. I had read a thread a while back stating the opposite.
---
I'm actively muting people who only call it VC too, not being elitist i just don't want those people in my groups. The same with people who say "google it" when someone asks for help.
---
The difficulty with the raid is way more so getting 40 people to a gear level where they can do it in that first week.
---
The game in general is just unforgiving compared to retail.
---
I remember when I came over from EQ, one of the reasons I didn’t want to play WoW was because it was considered way more casual and less of a challenge.
---
It’s still way more of a challenge than what the game has evolved to.
---
Devs have confirmed they'll be using battlegroups
---
no we're full
---
Oh how it must feel to not have real problems.
---
Then you’ll have to just leave over time. Imo leveling IS the classic wow experience. Idk why everyone is in such a rush to leave as fast as possible. Take you’re time, enjoy the ride. Doesn’t matter how long it takes as long as you’re having fun.
---
But they will most likely never bring any kind of xp boosting to vanilla.
---
Yes. Rage quit like a little beeotch. Better now than in the middle of a 2 hour instance run. Go back to retail and its zoomer welfare and leave the nostaglia for people that were there in the beginning.
---
Quebec?
---
He came back to World of Warcraft for World of Warcraft Classic, where a lot of his online Stuff appears to have originated from.  
---
An influx of a lot of Views and Subs/Follows is to be expected for almost everyone playing in that section this Week. Especially for those who used to stream the game back in the day. Don't think that is the reason behind the ban, but as always one should wait until proper Information is distributed by involved parties. :)
---
I suggest reading up a bit more about your class. It doesn't sound like you've done much research yourself.
---
To get you on your way: if you want to level as Fury (you perfectly can, though it's not optimal unless you can consistently proc Enrage), then Slam is your main ability, and for Slam: the greater the swing damage (i.e. usually slower weapons), the better. Your other attack, Bloodthirst, doesn't care about weapon damage, as the tooltip says.
---
This is the third Logan Paul joke I’ve seen here today
---
This is the classic experience. Much better read than “omg queueueueueus r baaaaaaaaad”
---
NOICE BAIT MA dude
---
the initial server count and announcement was handled so pisspoorly. Thousands and thousands got fucked over by it. Am glad i had the sense to see that us needing more servers was a given, but i was scouting over many guilds and a number thought that was all we were getting it, picked one and called it. They all lost a bunch of members for sure.

---
It was awesome a few hours ago (instant log in), now I'm back to a 6 hour queue.
---
Sounds like you just named who you should be upset with... Otherwise deal with the consequences of a hugely overpopulated server for a week or two while it calms down.
---
Show me data and I'll recant
---
Thanks! :D realy good to know
---
More of us will definitely start if they don't address it.
---
They admitted to having people 'play' their account and keep them logged in
---
Troll is a troll. Created an account just for this one post is all I needed to know.
---
And this is the asshole taking my spot while I sit in the queue.
---
&gt;but then I don’t understand how their servers work.
---
I wish I could give you gold for even acknowledging that there's a possibility you may not understand an issue enough to critique it's handling. Truly a breath of fresh air on this sub haha
---
Troll
---
Because in the brown one money disappear
---
Why wouldn't you start over on another server. Also it's not like you have to delete the characters you already have
---
Maybe he was in que for 20 hours and his lack of sleep is turning him into a frog? Idk. Chemicals turned my gay frog.
---
Give a look to wake on lan function of teamviewer. That should solve your problem :D
---
No change!
---
Queued at 2:30... it's now 9:30 and I'm showing a full hour wait yet....
---
I'm on Fairichild
---
100% they will open new servers and offer xfers though. It's what they did in vanilla, but this time they expected the mass.
---
lmao its actually crazy
---
18, alliance on thalnos. 
---
i played horde from vanilla - cat when i quit.  I'm trying the other side this time.
---
Let me guess you want a refund but aren't going to cancel your sub
---
Thanks for the reply. I actually just went into task scheduler and set up a time to wake my pc from sleep lol
---
Nice
---
Going for the hard sell. 
---
Never understood the "Buy what ever I say because I'm smart and your not" tactic.
---
Share with us your powerful script😂
---
Healers are always wanted and you need much more of them in a raid. There are already a ton of warriors and the leveling with warrior gets worse and worse especially +10 if you are alone
---
You have like a minute of grace.
---
Thank you, Added
---
Paladin as well sir.
---
I know I'm late to the party, but while I wait for my queue to drop...  
---
&gt;Not feeling like I am missing out on upgrades when I'm not doing my daily/weekly reset **chores.**  
---
  
---
Exactly this... retail was a *chore.* I've been on and off for years, but I'm actually experiencing joy in this game for the first time in a long while.
---
"i hope the community will enjoy"
---
DIE NORMIE REEEEEEEEE
---
i dont think a kid who grew up on micro transactions is even old enough to play wow man...you act like this is something thats been happening for decades...
---
I mean, 15 seems like overkill and overbuying into wow...but general rule of thumb in life is that if you undoubtedly know something with no evidence then you're probably wrong.
---
Well I can tell you right now people would be more pissed about that then they are about the queue times right now lol
---
At that point you’re painting a demographic of players with one brush. I call it VC, but I’m not snarky or rude about it at all.
---
I like to use my time well.... Sorry?
---
Judging by your corny ass post, I don't doubt you truly mean it when you say it's your drug.
---
lul has been around for fucking ever.

I want less features and more locations on the classic continents opend up. fill on the blank spots on the map as future content.

What are the chances of two people naming their characters in a Blizzard game after characters in another popular Blizzard game?  Pretty high I imagine.
---
Dude doesn’t care for gold right now because he doesn’t have to save for his 40 mount

This is hardly a BfA thing. Every new expac brought with it great new bags.

---
I made it to 60 some 15 years ago.
---
!remind me 4 days
---
They rightly assume that at probably at least 30% of the current playerbase isn't going to be here. And as time goes on the amount of time people spend online at one time will go down drastically.
---
What are layers?
---
the beauty of classic is the orderly chaos
---
the homogenization of the game really killed it for a lot of people
---
druids and ret paladins are "bad", if you bring them up to par, might as well play retail
---
I just always get parried and cry on the inside.
---
If you are mad about falling behind nolifers you are a nolifer
---
Im on whitemane too, considering it, wife and I got to 16 and told all our friends to make toons there. But now none of us can play.
---
oh god no. 
---
Play as Feral (which is both Cat and Bear in classic)
---
If you have discord installed, disable the discord overlay
---
That’s not that bad depending on what you’re playing.
---
It sucks knowing the ques are basicly because of tourist's that are just here to have a look and never come back
---
I gave up on Whitemane today after a 7 hour queue and still 3k behind
---
First time playing wow, picked an Undead Mage, about level 6 now and having a great time.
---
Question is, I've hardly seen any other mages in game and haven't seen much discussion about the class. Is there a reason the class is so unpopular? Did I make a poor choice?
---
I think Duel Spec is the only QoL feature i want added lol
---
Priest is actually one of the best leveling classes.
---
Remindme! 4 days
---
They give out free game time all the time. The proof is in my inbox with them begging me to come back to the game.
---
Shout out to the dope partners/lovers that understand how excited you are and let you game your heart out because your joy is their joy!!!
---
I love my gf
---
Uh yes the fuck it is. Message me I'll tell you
---
How do I do that?
---
The stat screen from the achivment tab. I can’t see a reason Why someone would say no. Seeing how many times you killed Hogger. Largest crit etc.
---
Sorry fellow human. I am not designed to recognize this command.
---
Pve wise they are versatile until raids in which case they are valued and desired healers with great utility. You'll have a hard time finding a spot as dps and tank though.
---
Not as sure on PvP sorry friend
---
Paladin blessings require a light touch and therefore fade more quickly.

---
A bear spiritual level to be specific.
---
Lol same, if there weren’t queues I wouldn’t be paying attention to my gf. She is going to start playing though!
---
Oof howlongof a ban?
---
Well if the dark portal isnt opening, then going after Arthas probably wont happen either since its an alternate timeline. Both Guldan/Illidan and Arthas's story setups happened pre-WoW, so if we were truly going alternate timeline it would probably be brand new content.
---
I went to Ironforge, /who was \~75 people, and I couldn't find anyone in the whole city. Doubtful there was 2 or 3 layers.
---
Remote control your pc with a program on phone/laptop to put you into queue while u irl and come home to a nice login screen instead of queue.
---
They’re not great tanks either because they don’t have a taunt
---
I would give my soul to bro out with Chris Metzen for an afternoon playing WoW.
---
Devolve
---
It saves your spot assuming you use the new device to login immediately
---
yep same, no horde in sight on my server. the only time i've ever seen horde was in moonglade.
---
Thank you for the clarification. I'll look into it when on.
---
you have to think/remember. THIS is the version that launched 10 million subscribers ! 
---
all the way to LitchKing. was the glory days of WOW. 
---
the numbers show it was down hill after that. 
---
the return to Classic ? its the return to the game that people came for for the first time.
---
Sounds like you haven't rolled a Night Elf yet ;)
---
Lmao that’s hilarious, barrens chat just flipped out over a dwarf paladin near wailing caverns. Cool we’re having similar experiences

Thor slays the mighty Jörmungandr, but only walks 9 steps away before succumbing to the serpent's poison.
---
I sure hope not.
---
they've already banned one lfg addon
---
Because you were stubborn and refused to move servers. Probably because you had friends there **like everyone else** and said i'm not going anywhere. I'll instead complain about queues that i am part of the problem of.
---
how do you do this? thats a great idea
---
&gt; Keanu doesn't leech, Keanu Seeds
---
He would be the guy to do that huh.
---
Is it complex to put items on the AH? The game hasn't said anything about it so far, currently level 6
---
“Thanks fam...ly”
---
Wholesome
---
I have 50 on my 13 lock but that's because I'm a dumb idiot and idk what to level so I just leveled every skill.
---
what happened to Harry Potter and the [insert item] jokes?
---
congrats1  31 is pretty high
---
So romantic like shakespeare, we went out holding each others hands.
---
I need to know the answer to this!! It’s a boiler room in here!!
---
Reroll Warrior
---
I’m pretty sure they ALL have large queues.
---
Think my friends and I are throwing in the towel because of the queue times. Maybe in a couple months we'll be back
---
Nope, I just installed the add one by dropping in the folders. I am also on Mac.
---
Greatest voice acting in WoW's history. You will always hear it in your mind exactly as spoken.
---
Doesn’t even feel implemented ! More servers, free transfers for guilds and people with new servers coming out that are only for people transferring from one current full server to a select few off branches to conserve their names. Easy!
---
Logout and let someone else play you fuck! should never be afk.
---
AFter next week
---
They are undead
---
Paladins are bad at both. Maybe druid if you don't want to roll warrior
---
In fact it s more difficult than I thought. When I summon the camp fire it spawn kinda randomly around my character
---

No. I wish I was in Quebec. It's 100 farenheit in Texas.

Guess I better go and tell the other 90% of Australians to get a real job. 
---
We have this crazy system where we get paid a set amount per hour and at the end of the week they calculate how many hours we work and then pay us accordingly. And if we work more then normal we get paid extra. It's madness
---
The problem is, I thought I would be burned out since I leveled sooooo many characters on so many private servers, but now it's like "holy shit, I gotta make time for classic"
---
Wakes up the next day with a  hangover without a single drink
---
My wife tried to Q me up on day one but apparently after the battle.net maintenance my account didn’t log back in. So when I have her instructions which didn’t include making sure my launcher was logged in, it failed to do anything and I got home to the account login page. I didn’t play that night lol.
---
It's a god damn shiney bauble, buddy couldn't even give us a night crawler worth of effort
---
If it ain’t broke, don’t spend anything on ______.

I've got 11. /Shrug
---
Super stoked for you.  I can imagine that feeling well, yet not well enough :). Have a blast boys
---
I love this subreddit so much
---
&gt; Calling it an "MMO" in any sense is completely inaccurate.
---
Oh man. I better let my raid group know that they aren't playing an MMO :O
---
Yes, but those paladins will be holy specialized.
---
spoiler: you're literally using a tech developed by the government right now, it's called the internet.
---
If you don't want 20 year old technology being used by your government, try funding them rather them properly.  Don't just cut budgets so the billionaires and the big corporations can get richer.
---
Mage. Pretty freakin bad lol.
---
Gray mobs and gray quest give no exp. 
---
I assume you’re just swapping characters then heading back and the bug isn’t on other characters on the account.
---
Cross server battlegrounds to keep queues down.  I don't think people realize how long the queries used to be, especially on lopsided servers
---
"It's great that I'm not running out of mana anymore, but why don't my spells hit like they used to?"
---
And then there's me chasing you back with a Healthstone. I need to be able to just throw them in peoples bags at buff range.
---
Depends on when you play.  I’m a daytime player and it’s great.  It doesn’t get bad until 730pm eastern.  Though I would wait to see about this weekend.  I think that will tell.  I think Monday is a safe time to start when most burn out and return to BFA.
---
Yes that is when i can finally get in
---
Yea I tried to sell a bag to someone from chat, we both ran to the bank to do the trade but couldn’t see each other until we joined group

I can't go into details but you have my word that they are pitching content right now. If vanilla is a success you can almost guarantee they will develop more content for it.

Dear God, fighting mechanicals as a Rogue absolutely SUCKS. Rupture? Immune. Poisons? Immune. Pickpocket? No pockets to pick. Sap? Not Humanoid. Blind? Immune.
---
The magic nipple knows.
---
&gt;  In Classic everything is challenging
---
As someone who is new to classic, what non-instance content is challenging at level 60?
---
Yes I know that
---
AFK scripting and multiboxing should both be banned. Too bad one won't because it gives them money.
---
Right! I wish we could just throw them into people bags at 30 yard range. I'd make a KOBE macro.
---
Literally everyone will do that - problem not solved
---
There's still a good chance they give away time. Bad player experience causes churn, even if players have brought it onto themselves through their server choices. Keeping the player count high is a high priority because once people stop trying to log in every day there's a pretty good chance they just don't come back. Offering incentive for players to move onto a server where they will be able to enjoy the game instead of the queue is good for everyone involved, including Activision.
---
I sent you a pm, thank you for being so forward. It's really appreciated
---
Exactly they have state in one of the AMA's that it is extremely taxing on the server to have thousands of people all in one spot (like the starting zones). For example they maybe able to handle 50,000 people spread out among the whole world, but start to have stability issues if 2,000 people are all in goldshire.
---
This will change at 60 lol
---
GS and LFR in classic. Some men just want to watch the world burn.
---
With my grp we didn't drop a single one ;-;  
---
So we rushed our tailor to get lvl 45 ;-;
---
Clique for mouse over macros, with Grid if you're not using another good raid frames addon.
---
I do, but I wanted the date and time in my pic.  Even though this was taken about 7 hours after I found it.
---
Imagine having to wait hours just to log into your server.
---
This comment brought to you by the smolderweb gang.
---
Westfall server? HMU! Athëna
---
Yeah I got one just today, sadly I had a 6 hour que but no more disconnecting!
---
I still hate them, you don't understand how empty org *is not* until you get invited to another layer for a trade
---
why are you blaming me your third world country sucks lol dude calm down you sound like a psycho...
---
I would, in fact, like to break an arm jerking myself off.
---
why don't you log in before you get home? use steam link app, chrome remote desktop or something to start the game
---
/whooosh
---
Up to you. The queues suck now and will also be 10x worse when layering is removed.

One could argue that’s a good thing in a way. Extremely secure, but I’m guessing operating 40 year old giant computers isn’t a skill many people are well-versed in, let along maintaining or repairing them.
---
Not when it doesn't proc
---
Holyshit, same. I started in BFA but damn, Classic is so much fun than this daily BS shit retail.
---
Liking a certain expansion has nothing to do with my position. If you go beyond Wrath into the old world revamp that comes with Cata you are no longer playing classic anymore. It's a completely different experience, which would defeat the entire purpose classic was released. Full disclosure I've enjoyed every expansion minus Warlords. So the argument you're trying to have has no basis.
---
&gt; retail casuals
---
Better let all the top guilds know that they are just casuals, because all the REAL skilled and hardcore players are in classic :D
---
But it will happen eventually. Because a lot of people will quit or severely reduce their playing hours as they get higher level and realize how slow it is.
---
nice man i am glad for you. i have run dad mine 4 time more and no lack
---
I logged on 3 hours ago with no queue. Just depends in the server.
---
I have 25hrs game time and I have not noticed layering one time.
---
Warriors are by far and away the worst at solo levelling. Rogues aren't great levellers (I'd say only quicker than Pallys tbh) but are still head and shoulders better than warriors for levelling.
---
Hey, i've got the BEST group finder addon here ;)
---
It's called join your servers discord and ask the fuckin question
---
absolute wanker
---
thank u gyoungers
---
Think thats demonic for "I'm with stupid"
---
I’ll be honest, I didn’t start playing until Cata so the Classic launch is feeling really fresh for me.
---
Yea it was great. Honestly the smoothest starting zone experience I've had during a major launch almost ever (comparing to privates).
---
Layers + dynamic respawning let me actually complete a starting zone instead of grinding on red/orange mobs at level 2 for an hour or camping a single mob spawn point.
---
it is efficient for faming clath gear
---
My experience is valid and the circle jerk of the sub is not the only experience either. I'd hope you would have realized that the main stream experience isn't the only one by age 5.
---
What server you play? i met a guy with the same problem as you and he quit warrior, if you play on Incendius, do you know a guy named Rustung? if yes thats me!

You forgot to move for an hour?

AFK is after 5 minutes of inactivity. 30 minutes into the AFK, you get disconnected.
---
Welcome to WoW!! What server are ya on? :)
---
six months
---
We’ve spent years being told we don’t actually want this. I think we get to have a couple days of circle-jerking. At the very least.
---
What /u/omdano says isn't just random nonsense though, there are ways to use deep learning to get better image quality or frame rate in games. NVIDIA's working quite hard on this with methods [like this one](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-dlss-your-questions-answered/). It's the reason why some of their gaming GPUs now have tensor cores.
---
"The decoder part of an autoencoder" doesn't make much sense in this context though. And this isn't your random `import tensorflow` project, unless you're working on the game engine directly it would require some hardcore low level stuff.
---
^(I vote for bullshitting with buzzwords)
---
The amount you need later for LW results in people buying it rather than farm like 100+ mobs. It has higher demand
---
Holy shit! I have the exact same image as my background - The old man of Storr! I had to do a double take. I actually named my dwarf after a town in the Isle of Skye because I love that place so much.
---
&gt; Most tiers you never even change either, I know for my class there is only 1 or 2 that I change on the rare occasion.
---
This is a balance issue not a talent issue. The goal is to make all three choices at each tier viable. And sometimes it depends on what kind of content you're doing be it Raids, M+, or PvP.
---
Now in Classic.... you're rarely going to change your talents. You take the cookie cutter setup for Raiding or PvP.
---
Now you could fuck around and customize shit for like 5% more x and a mediocre ability in Classic. But you can do that in retail too. You can't complain that you're forced into certain talents by the communities expectations in one game, but then ignore the communities expectations in another.
---
Why do so many people insist on playing on the top 3 popular servers. Serious question kind of new to this.
---
Wow
---
&gt; it's just pressing the button for every account at once.
---
Considering a human can't do that this is just a really bad excuse
---
It's like the boomers from Left 4 Dead.
---
And you get a mark! And you get a mark! Everybody gets a mark!
---
No problem! Definitely a slight improvement and having a somewhat accurate estimate is much easier to manage lol.
---
That is correct.
---
Also don't forget to change out your newly learned skills; IE you had rank 1 smite, trained ranked 2 smite just now, you NEED to switch it out from your hotbar to the rank 2 spell from your spellbook, i have found countless players reminding them in general to do this and them all freaking out wondering why they were getting their asses handed to them.
---
Its always  worth it if you consider it fun.
---
Played vanilla, I am having so much fun leveling my rogue in classic. To me it is so much more rewarding and difficult than retail. I am actually happy when things drop VS oh yay another purple that is useless because it doesn't have a socket.
---
Slam has no cooldow, just a 1.5 second cast time - which is shorter than your weapons 2.7 speed
---
Yeah seriously. I made a group to kill Princess and her entourage and 2/3 of ua were there and 1 was running to us. The other guy just pulled and started killing. Why? Luckily the other guy made. it.
---
Same here on ashkandi
---
Deviate Delight is great with little to no queues, come join us. :)
---
No forget. Only forgive.
---
Retail does have massive cities though.
---
Well we just completed it and it was fine, the team I tested it with the other day was just doing whatever they wanted. Team I had today was great
---
Correct, although there's an updated guide now. Still similar
---
Welfare epics would be horrible. However, I can see some highly difficult quest chains or 5 man dungeon additions as possible solutions. BC had some good catch up content towards the end that didn't over do it. Classics issue is mostly the raid sizes / organisation time as a barrier to entry.
---
As long as we don't get timeless isles type bullshit daily quests. Keep daily and timed world quests out of the game. They completely ruined retail for me.
---
&gt; Serious question. What do you prefer in Retail over Classic?
---
Raid prog and M+ with guildies, rotations that have more than 1 button. The general fast pace and fluidity of everything. 
---
Classic is a nice throwback to a different era of MMO's when things were far slower and simpler.
---
And theres not prestige as u have no idea what people are wearing and what they have earned. It meant something when u saw a full Field Marshall set in bgs
---
Kinda makes your feet hurt just watching that, yeah?
---
Nope.
---
Metin2 have this on some servers. Metin2.
---
Metin
---
I'm on Fairbanks so its not like I'm not on a full server. Those minor inconveniences though (which I still haven't personally experienced) are definitely worth not having a queue that is 5x worse than it currently is to me tho.
---
&gt;rolls 3
---
basically improving the game thus allowing more players to be in one area without lagg.
---
Not only that, when it was launched most of us were just kids. Lots of us (including myself) didn't have the money to play wow let alone a computer that could handle it. 
---
Now we're all adults, we can afford it and most computers can handle wow. 
---
Not surprised this has happened.
---
People do this all the time on retail to farm gold. He probably pays for all of his subs that way. I highly doubt he's selling the accounts
---
Mages are great for all game modes! They have a strong area of effect (aoe) spell in Blizzard and conjure food and drink, all of which mae leveling a lot quicker. They have Poly, the best crowd control (cc) in the game, as well as great damage (dps) for dungeons and raids. And they really shine in PvP, where they can cc multiple enemies at once with Poly, Frost Nova, and slowing spells. Portals can also provide a decent income.
---
YEAH BFA IS SHIT
---
No thank you, I understand that's his job, but 37$?! That's nuts.
---
No that's how it was. In defensive it only attacked when you or it was attacked.
---
You're absolutely correct. My point was that a simple vb click macro isn't going to get you banned.
---
Can you elaborate on “gave out”? There are a lot of physical therapy and mobility exercises and motions that can likely aid in regaining range and reducing pain.
---
alt f4 worked as far back as the original starcraft (it's the windows "signal force exit"). Hell I'm pretty sure it worked in the browser, I recall the trick in the original runescape (though that may just be a false memory). QQ was just quitting a match right?
---
My hunter started fishing with her quiver yesterday
---
It's not about writing an essay. It's just that, while the general idea makes sense, the decoder part of an autoencoder makes no sense at all here. It maps some arbitrary space to the game image space, so the output makes sense, but the input can only come from the encoder. The only situation I can think of where you take the decoder alone is in a data (de)compression context. 
---
I'm not 100% sure you're bullshitting, and I hope not since I'd love to chat about that. But this comment raised some red flags.
---
That was proven to be little more than the number of people using a certain add on. And couldn't have included Chinese users.
---
The guy behind the add on posted it without thinking, mostly as a way to toot his horn, but people took it as gospel because BFA bad.
---
The Everquest progression servers used to allow this same thing and it ruined the game. 
---
The last several servers have all been "True Box" servers where you can only run one instance of the game per PC. No VMs. No broadcasting key strokes. If repetitive actions come too quickly from multiple PCs on the same IP you get disconnect. 
---
Works really well.
---
Even got the silly hat.
---
No one's suggesting they're sabotaging their own launch besides you.
---
And FYI, there are 14 US realms right now with no queues at all. Queue times are absolutely not the *only* reason people will stop playing.
---
35? Ohh boy whos gonna tell him
---
Let’s give it a few weeks before we start this. All games are good the first week. The hype is clouding our judgments right now. But I do think blizzard made their dec cost back with the amount of subs for classic.

I'm having a blast. Leveling is SO SLOW that I'm actually enjoying it and taking it super chill and easy.

This, most people I know that came back for classic quit just before BC or never played during vanilla. Then I know some that came back because they wanted to play an easier game.

This post was made _literally_ over 100 times in the past 3 months. This discussion is beat to death already. Im sure this post will be re-done hundreds of more times in the next 4-6 months. All saying the same shit.

I cannot express how much joy Classic WoW gives me that I haven't experienced in retail since Wrath. I've found a fantastic guild that gives me the same vibes as my guild in wrath and I am giddy with excitement and nostalgia. The community is incredible - I didn't realise how much removing single mob tagging impacted the social aspect of the game.
---
If this is the case I'm rerolling lol
---
Im paying $15 a month for this game...?
---
the soviet union hasn't existed for decades lol... you need a history lesson not a reddit account...
---
Use commas you ape.
---
Warlocks are more tanky, especially if you go affliction spec. Destruction can sort of do mage stuff.
---
Yes, the main draw of paladin and shaman is utility over raw healing. Paladins blessings are similar to shaman totems and usually what's best for the shaman is best for the group. Natures swiftness can save a teammate or just take an enemy out of the fight. Instead of a healer think of the shaman as a fluid member of the group, supporting everyone no matter what that means. Need to nuke down the FC in WSG? You're another DPS. Need to hold BS in arathi? You are a healer again. You use NS to cast either instant heals or instant damage. Whatever is needed whenever.
---
You mean you're leveling your professions so you'll have money to get your mount at 40, instead of being stuck trying to get them all skilled up then?
---
At lvl20 I’ve given away 100 T2 waters to some rando and it took a few seconds. I don’t think I’ve lost half my bar but a quick drink solved that issue.
---
That is the theory, my server hasn't had bad ques, but I plan to remore login when my day is done just in case. Roommates dont like leaving the PCs running. And my laptop was set up to remotely wake from sleep by a friend. Pop on, remote desktop, login
---
Is not that long. Takes about 10 mins
---
It's a hard one, but if you know you enjoy healing, are joining alliance, and enjoy the druid fantasy, that seems like a slam dunk to choose?  Druids are raid-tier healers with fun variability and a good levelling experience.
---
yes
---
Classic!
---
Most of the border or map style with built in transparency effects (map style faded square 
---
, or the space preset for example) don't seem to work properly. I'm using the rustic preset and just change the map shape to square instead of faded square. If you really want one of the broken styles you'll have to wait for an update.
---
I'm guessing they detect it by the player staying in the same spot for however long and doing nothing but running or jumping. It shouldn't be that hard to detect when someone is using something to afk.
---
Google 'Classic WoW Hunter PvP tips'
---
Absolutely agree dude it’s so frustrating. I am having to remote que from work at like 11pm to have a reasonable que when I get home at 4....so stupid.
---
Yeah, I mean I work with Deep Learning on daily basis, while I'm still a student, but I will \[hopefully\] have 2 papers released soon. 
---
So, what I meant by the decoder part of an autoencoder, just wanted to simply explain that it's basically just glorified upsampling. nothing special.
---
No fucking way.  If anything it’s just gonna grow more the first month or two.  I could see a 50% drop off maybe 3 months from now.
---
Lol there was a dude making bags in bloodhoof for 3 silver, so I just gave him a gold and told him to make the next 30 free, I hope I made 1 person happy.
---
I think you explained (very well in your post) unintentionally why both WoW Variants can and will coexist
---
I should have put the cameras down and stopped recording what we were going through. There's a lot of things I should have done differently but I didn't. And for that, from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry.
---
Do you have players playing from Japan? What's your ms at?
---
Well if the queues are 3 hours I think he may be correct that the playerbase will tank he will be wrong that 6 servers is plenty though
---
People may age, but memes are timeless
---
How do you have so much gold already lol.
---
godbless the dude who sold me a greater wand for 10s
---
Levels 10-13 I barely got any procs :/ it's fine now
---
As a gnome mage, you do that idk if to give you all my buffs and water or be upset about it...
---
This game will lose probably lose at least 30% in a few months. Which is all that is needed. You gotta also realize that literally everyone is trying to play as much as they possibly can right now because it is new(again). In a few months people will spend less time online. It won't be as fresh.

Yeah this dungeon grinding thing isn't rly faster than solo questing hunter it seems, but I honestly don't care much about the race to lvl60 as much as first MC, and dungeon grinding is what's getting everyone but hunters to 60.
---
You can’t just give a company a free pass because they struck gold they are a unreastically successful company and have been for over a decade and they are unable to provide access to tons of players after 15 years of experience with this type of release. I’m a blizzard fan boy but it’s been what, 3 days sense release? I get the upset patrons but the good news it’s it looks like they’re working on it
---
You can also use an AutoHotkey script to keep you logged in.
---
There's most likely a discord for your server. People will be talking about things like this there.
---
Will spawn rates also increase then?
---
Never really bothered with professions but I really wanted me some bags and a wand on my priest. Picked up tailoring and enchanting and loving it.
---
Yesterday in Tirisfall Glades in Myzael, everyone was spamming movie titles with words replaced with "murloc".
---
Paladins are ok at everything.  They are a support character where they can heal, DPS, buff, and do some CC with stuns.  They don't really shine at anything in PVE/PVP but they are useful as an extra boost for whatever the group needs.  I got my paladin up to Commander back in the day and it was never really painful.  You can live quite a long time and can help out your team in a lot of situations.  But you will rarely be the star of the show, you won't be getting 20 KBs but you will help the player who does get 20 KBs.

I made friends with a mage this morning. Turns out he was asking if i could make bags, i said i'm still a few levels away from it. 
---
He traded me a bunch of linen and i leveled to make the bags for him. Gave him back the rest of the linen and bags. 
---
I think, yes i could have been an asshole and run away with shit, but why ruin the experience and reputation if im gonna be playing long term especially over a couple of silver?
---
i think he made the comment that we are also all so much older so shit like this isnt funny anymore "like scamming people"
---
iLevels are less than worthless in classic.
---
Welcome to the family!
---
Thank you, this helped

So glad people are feeling this way. Yes it is early and most of the people have done these before. But the feeling is there for sure. Having a blast for sure!
---
100%. Cross realm gameplay has always been my biggest frustration with modern WoW. It really kills immersion &amp; social interaction. I don't want it added, but I honestly think even LFG would be okay as long as it wasn't cross realm since you'd end up getting partied up with a lot of the same people anyway.
---
And then it kills you as you run away, or you get far enough to disengage, and another mob spots you instead. That's happened to me so many times today on my rogue.
---
I was working on the Relics of Awakening and Sleeping Druid quests in Teldrassil and just finished taking down one Gnarlpine Shaman when another one immediately respawned next to me as I was replenishing my health. I nearly died to take him down, but somehow caught the attention of two more. A beat or two later and I'm dead, again, after over an hour in those tunnels. It's so easy to get lost in there...
---
The death run through Wetlands is going to be interesting again.
---
Hoping theres some bans coming
---
I thought they were doing rolling restarts to deal with just that?
---
People actually playing have \~5 minutes to log back in and not loose their spot, people using a macro to dodge the AFK timer end up booted.
---
Blizzard doesn't allow conditionals in macros anymore (if, else, else if). That's why it's not working.
---
You could wake up early and just play from like 7am-1pm or something
---
oh, interesting. can you explain?
---
I concur, I have logged into Deviate Delight two nights in a row with no queues!
---
I still can't understand why so many people are desperate to play on some servers. It's the start of the fucking game go to a low pop server and be done with it. Not every PVP server has popular streamers playing on it and they still have 20,000 person queues.
---
Lol of course. It’s very satisfying to 1 shot people.
---
[Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL2Ey936UI1X5nxRLEFj9WwWQh_ocrWQlB&amp;v=mDK2IbUFrT0)
---
There a plenty that have done faster on private servers. Not 100% genuine Ill give you that, but Joana's record is far from "solid" or "the best" anymore.
---
I found a small black pouch on my orc while leveling in tirisfal. So I wonder if its zone dependent?
---
Extremely underpowered in Classic but probably will not get changed.
---
Honestly as something like a priest or mage with buffering and GCD clicking spells is seriously only fractions slower than macros. Unpopular opinion. Macros truly only matter in pvp imo
---
Or multiple people. Or some guy on Adderall. Or multiple people on adderall
---
I already did when I told her I'd be back.
---
I mean it's *difficult* in the sense that I only have like 2 dps abilities and only 2 options being "kill it" or "run away and kill it later".
---
Nah I got in today, no wait time. Rattlegore
---
Agreed, I really don't like this feeling of the entire past 15 years becoming invalidated by classic release but if it provides the data necessary to put butts back in the seats of what the future holds beyond Bfa then so be it.
---
None of these responses answer my question.  I already have vendor price.  This addon was a unit frame visible on the screen that showed the 5 most worthless items from your bags and allowed you to right click them directly to destroy.
---
Ok then angry person on the internet.
---
Ive seen several people say fuck this shit I'm out and just log off after dying to moonstalkers or some shit too many times. Like 3 people so far between lvls 10-20 in dark shore lol.
---
Rest in Piece Warding
---
You're grounded for taking a phone pic instead of a screenshot.
---
I'm really enjoying the community in wow classic. I'm talking to people so much now, whereas in bfa I never talked to anybody. People buff me and I buff them (I'm a priest). I accidentally pulled too many mobs yesterday and a warrior saved my ass. It's just so cool to see so many people playing and helping each other
---
I'm also fairly certain that a lot of things people have been taking for granted will make themselves remembered. Things like dungeon group finders and fast travel. It's easy to find a group when you need it now that most of the server is the same level bracket, but a mouth from now it'll be a massive chore and take forever just to get everyone to the entrance, especially when people don't have mounts. A lot of the time it takes longer to get a group together and reach the instance than the actual dungeon does. There's a reason a lot of things were changed and implemented. People wanted them.
---
So you're not angry at dipshits multiboxing and not letting others play? Fucking moron.
---
Yeah I’m not trying to argue that it’s particularly complex, it just feels rewarding, especially when you get upgrades and new abilities
---
How do I phrase this
---
I prefer the overall 1-60 difficulty curve of Classic as I feel like I’ve earned that progress versus the current faceroll to max and then sitting there grinding mats and drops to try and raise my iLevel to even try the end game content. 
---
I’m a bigger fan of leveling up and going on adventures versus the raids so the Classic experience appeals to me more right now.
---
I’d rather have dual spec than a duel spec
---
Shhhhh dont tell anyone...
---
AutoHotkey allows you to make hotkeys that do things such as press a button every few minutes. Such as when I press F1 it presses spacebar every 60 seconds until I press F1 again. AutoHotkey is awesome. I use it for all kinds of things like making a key combo to type my email out for me. Just do some googling of AutoHotkey script examples.
---
If people didn't do this, we wouldn't ha e such bad queues.
---
If we didn't have such bad queues, people wouldn't do this.
---
Omg I had fogotten that. How do I fond the whole thing again?
---
That was the best shit at the time, our druid culture :)
---
Is dark spear mage really the lyric? Doesn't sound like that at all lol. Maybe distortion?
---
I'm realizing as I play that I just don't want that social interaction, I don't know if I was just more open when I was younger or something.
---
The idea of having to deal with a group of random people is enough that I don't think I'll be sticking with classic, there's a bunch of single player games that are still in my queue that I'd rather play.
---
Me levelling DH in BfA: 
---
&gt;Pulls 10 mobs, eye beams 8 to death, kills the last 2 with a chaos strike each.
---
Me levelling rogue in Classic:
---
&gt;Pulls 2 mobs, dies.
---
"IT JUST TAKES LONGER TIME LUL"
---
My big concern is I started playing onsargeras this afternoon because I figured the name was cool enough and at 5 EST it was high pop with no queue. Right now the server pop is great but like you said what is it going to look like a month or more from now compared to the full servers you have 4 hour queues for?
---
Bagnon3 has it embedded.
---
Holy crap man, that was me! Lol. Princess killed me twice before that, there was no turning back. Can't believe I found this
---
Keanu becomes a baker: Keanu sieves.
---
No. We must embrace the circle jerk early on to keep morale high.
---
In stonetalon I found a warrior priest duo and a boring dwarf paladin. Also most horde haven’t hit stonetalon or higher yet. There’s a lot of quests in the barrens that are loot a boss which are major choke points for players.
---
I thought the same thing. I thought I was going to be one of them. Honestly I didn’t even think I was going to resub. But I am having so goddamn much fun with this game I think I’m in it for the long how. I think it might have remarkable player retention.
---
Thank you for your input! :)
---
This is tbc not vanilla
---
Oof maybe I’m just a pessimist, you have a link?
---

---
This worked for me.
---
I love this so fucking much
---
Wat
---
Only noticed it when i went to where someone from my retail wow guild was to sign the charter to start the classic guild up. They only appeared when i grouped with them
---
Virtually no one is multiboxing in comparison to the total population.  What a dumb demographic to be this outraged towards.
---
Well, all this drama and craziness over queues IS ridiculous and a lot of people are being children about it.
---
You, however, are not. You've known people that toxic since Cata and you still wanna play with them? Why?  You're afraid you won't make new friends so you put up with toxic onces?  Do what's best for you. You gotta look out for number 1 and if you're gonna end up not playing anyways, then why go through all of that? Just ditch, make a new character on a new server, and enjoy your breath of fresh air.
---
The servers were completely down for an extended amount of time, k don't think they'd do that just because of queues,
---
Yes. The screen will show up blue on your phone or tablet. Just tap somewhere on the screen and it will wake it up!
---
The bigger question we should be thinking of and communicating to devs is what we like about classic. How should the devs improve the game without devolving into retail. What are the commonalities between people's reasons for liking classic. Tell devs this and start wow development anew. How it was supposed to be.
---
The player cap affects gameplay as well, so it might not be desirable to keep it higher than in Vanilla after the population settles.
---
Yeah, but that takes a concerted effort from a handful of people. I can respect that. Just takes one pissy troll with a multibox to annoy an entire zone's worth of people.
---
As a hunter, that's basically all you have to do while leveling. Feed the pet and train it. Resistances are pretty useless, you can get it later if need be. Growl is high priority, get the newest rank as soon as possible and then whatever damage abilities it has. 
---
Then stock up on ammo before heading out again. Hunter skills are cool and all, but hardly needed as stuff dies fast enough already. Mend Pet and Revive Pet are basically the only things you need, maybe Serpent Sting.
---
The imagery yes, but the logic is apt
---
I have it, just wondering the method to do it, that's very simple. does it actually stop you from getting timed out? and does it work sitting in que, or only once you log in? can I be banned? lol
---
The game is meant to be challenging
---
Dude it's been out for 2 days. I haven't even been able to login yet either due to work. Cry some more.
---
Also, your guild sounds like a bunch of dickish losers
---
I actually do more dmg with spells than my wand as a priest, difference being is i can only cast 3 spells before im oom so i don't....
---
&gt; o but mythic 
---
Even normal mode raids from BfA (and several expansions before) are harder than e Classic suff. It's not our falt that you refuse to play WoW beyond the easy mode (LFR and LFD freatures) and think thata it's the celling.
---
In 13 hours...
---
It doesn't matter what the hardest content is, when the fewest amount of people actually access that content. How many percent of active players do you really think raid mythic/do +15 keys? 
---
The average content that the average player does is far more challenging in classic than in BfA. Literally everything outside of high M+ keys and Mythic raiding is a joke.
---
Why would you be lost? 
---
Can you imagine if nobody played World of Warcraft in 2004 because they simply hadn't tried it before?
---
Would you tell someone to not bother playing osrs for the first time because they don't know what ToB is?
---
Thank you
---
Does anyone know how long your client sits at the character screen after the queue is done before it disconnects?
---
The priest deck that was a burn deck was the funnest deck i have made in a tcg series!
---
God I can't wait to get into the game and eventually hit SM with a mage.  So many good blues in there, most importantly the Illusionary Rod.
---
Yeah we have some from Korea as well. My korean buds are at 40-50ms. Cambodia is like 70ms. Japan should be between that.
---
It doesn’t. It makes them money.
---
You guys are great!
---
Can you not auto run into a wall?
---
The blizzard apologists will respond and say that you should reroll, or you should have expected this, or you should use a remote desktop app on your phone. But you're right, this is unacceptable
---
Finally somebody who understands.
---
My Job isn't presenting my models for a reason tho :)
---
I'd love to enjoy the Journey but as a warrior I don't get to do that until I get mortal strike and whirlwind axe.
---
I think i’m going to do this for the NAH..
---
Engi is OP for tanks
---
I remember this exact same problem. Alterac Valley had it a lot. Just because you don't remember it doesn't mean it didn't happen.
---
The 25% chance to resist stuns is a game changer for rogues, a stunned rogue is in big trouble.
---
And in phase 2 we can get PvP trinkets which have the same effect as wotf.
---
But ofcourse, canabalising someone you just stun locked to death is the ultimate disrespect
---
Definitely easier to do with runescape than WoW given how the games play, but doesn’t mean it’s impossible!
---
All chat is truly a wonderful place with joking and helping. I felt similar experience only once on retail and it was night chat in Stormwind.
---
I miss doing this up to mists
---
The difference is that the 10s ones are custom made by hand, and the vendor ones are mass produced in the sweatshops of Undercity. Us small crafters can't compete with that on price, but our bags are more special because they're tailor-made specifically to your specifications.
---
yeah sure does.

Someone build a cooking fire under his toon
---
Exactly; it wouldn’t be Classic
---
They fixed exploits. 
---
Exploits. Not bugs.
---
[deleted]
---
You win classic.
---
That's fair.  The only workaround in your case (though it may be forcing it a bit if you're just not feeling it) would be to find a guild you get along with and only really grouping with them. That's less stressful and more fun if you don't like having to form new groups. (Or just play BFA and have it auto-group you).
---
But yeah, fair enough if you're just not keen on it anymore.
---
"Great" is a strong word.
---
Enjoy the dead server in 2 months though. I’d rather be inconvenienced for a week or two and have a healthy stable server and economy a year in
---
Make a complicated script such as push w, wait 30 seconds, press spacebar, wait 25 seconds, press s, wait 58 seconds, etc. and tell it to repeat until the hot key is pressed to stop it. That way it’s less repetitive and detectable. I doubt you’d get a ban. 
---
Are you asking for the actual script?
---
&gt; I cannot comprehend how this game has been live for 15 fucking years and we are having capacity issues.
---
Really ? Well, capacity of machines isn't infinite and there's the calculation they need to do to ensure they don't over provide and then end up with far too much capacity.  It's only been 3 days.
---
Does life tap damage count? 😂
---
Yesterday I spent 7 hours in Q then DC’d at login screen. Lost all desire to play haha.
---
Worse today on arugal than yesterday.
---
I'm in a small guild of about 28 members. It's great to see guildies sending eachother materials, greens, crafting recipes and bags. There's a regular flow of "anyone need X?" messages, with free items and COD trades happening regularly. It's amazing. 
---
I feel I've had more meaningful interaction in the last two days than a large portion of my recent WoW experience.
---
I’ve only played a few month here and there since MoP, but the learning curve and comradery classic is mind blowing for 2019 standards. It’s like I stepped into a time machine. I still haven’t fully grasped it yet.
---
I don’t see myself quitting in the near future.
---
Monday's queue I started at 20k and it took 8 hours. Today's queue I started at 10k and it's been 5 hours and I'm at 1800, this is fucked.
---
I'm on Herod and was laughing about this last night questing in Westfall. There were several heated arguments about it. What I remember from classic was DM for Deadmines and that's what I've always gone with.
---
it takes the time to make the shard, make the item, trade the item. buffs are instant.
---
There's not gonna be any dead servers any time soon and if there is, blizzard will balance
---
Ban this guy for breaking ToS.
---
Yeh and left those exploits/bugs/glitches whatever you want to call them that give the player a disadvantage..
---
If they want to, they could detect the non human like interaction.  I'm not aware of blizzard automatically banning people running auto crafting macros so you are prabably fine. 
---
The way they use to do it was by a GM spotting you and not getting a human like reaction out of you. They would appear and teleport you 20 feet away or talk to you in /say
---
If they are going to ban you, then they will just do it. They won't care if you were doing something crazy to technically not get banned. If your character is performing actions and they can't get a human response, then they pulled the plug.
---
I would like to know witch server is the server thats the place ro be for English speaking people and where the biggest and most famous guilds moved to?
---
I feel your pain, my server finally entered full status tonight, first time i've had to deal with a que. I'm on bigglesworth
---
Remove the word excel and put in the name of any software that’s none of Blizzards business and you will see the problem with the intrusiveness of warden...
---
I entered the character select screen with 15 min left of work last night. I just pressed a button every now and then through Remote Desktop so I could drive home. Even disconnected once and was able to relog fast enough to avoid queue. But I only did that for about 20ish minutes before I got home.
---
That’s nice dear
---
The problem is that now they're stuck with too many servers.
---
Friends are on a server that takes a 6 hour wait time when i get home. Thinking of starting a second account to level on a low pop server while my main account is in the queue for the server i want.
---
Deviate Delight sounds interesting, like its going to be the next Moonguard
---
Because backpack is brown, pouch must be brown.
---
Well, they never really balanced retail server. Or they tried but they still ended up being ghost towns.
---
Damn... So hes paying for 40 accounts? Here I am stuck eating my dollar MC suckkets that I can barely afford.
---
I can give you guys underwater breathing.
---
Lots of us are dealing with long queues. Try to plan around it for the first few weeks or possibly reroll but since its still relatively early in to launch, the server you reroll on might have a queue by the weekend. The queues suck but also realize this first few weeks will be the worst by far.
---
I don't like layers at all, but given the stunts I have to do at the moment to play the game (getting up in the middle of the night, making some dumb excuses at work why I have to leave early, explain my wife how to log me in while I drive home...) I'm fine with it.
---
As a warlock, I also do my duty.
---
Everyone breathes underwater for 10 minutes!
---
Only a tiny fraction of the population does raids. Everything else in classic is much more difficult.
---
I noticed it on release night when i was swindling bags and wands. I had to male people invite me or i would invite them in order to sell stuff in major cities
---
Again? WoW in this version was always an actual MMORPG, it just released again to this modern time. Retail WoW though is really lacking still.
---
Blizzard wants to see if some of those people will leave after a while, and character transfers can help solve overpopulation problems later down the track.
---
I still think they should just offer transfers now, and focus on getting the layers out of the game, but I guess I can understand them wanting to see how many people will actually keep playing.
---
In Westfall?
---
Anyway for the alliance one?
---
He's just a big kitty that loves weed!
---
What's a que? I work from 8:30pm to 4:30am
---
Ive also played a lot of runescape and never played wow before classic. Im loving it.
---
 I have been a little lost sometimes im not going to lie (sometimes that is half the fun when you are noob) but if im stuck for a bit I just search on google what im trying to find and it pops right up. Theres also add ons you can get that help you with quests telling you where to go but I havnt put those on yet. Ive also found everyone to be very helpful I havnt had one person try bait me or give me wrong info like they do in runescape. Also plenty of videos online to help you and once you start playing you pick it up quite quickly as the skills and stuff you need are always at the same type of person in each town.
---
too soon :P
---
Heated Gamer moment detected.
---
30 mims
---
This fixed the issue for me as well.
---
Yeah, I'm still expecting a lot of the load to be from people just checking it out who won't stick with it. We can't really judge until the long-term population has settled out
---
My best friend who plays retail is like that. Every time we call each other on discord I get a presentation on how Classic is bad and how it will inevitably fail, with every day new theories to supports his claims.
---
I got told the game is outdated, gameplay is shit, pvp is one shot fest, in a month it will be abandonned except by Private Servers players, that it owes its popularity only to streamers who play the game only to get views even though they don't even enjoy the game etc.. And those are just what he told me today.
---
I mean, he can say whatever but his desire to see it fail is kinda disconcerning.
---
BOY WAS I FUCKIN RIGHT/WRONG
---
Yes, there's an option under interface.
---
Maybe a razer synapses issues try looking through the settings on it.
---
The amount of misses and parries you get is insane, so annoying to miss damage 3 times then suddenly you’re losing.
---
I agree you are losing the rage but not the damage
---
Yeah. Via interface. Hit escape, then interface
---
You can do it at level 1 technically but the exploration exp you get for traveling to human starting zone will get you to like level 2 or 3.
---
No shit it doesn't exist thats why I said the 2nd world WAS the Soviet union. Was meaning in the past and not now.
---
Esc, interface options, action bars, show right action bar
---
I got showered with bag drops while playing the stress test, but now I'm playing for realsies? Not a one!
---
So just for that you're dubbing BFA as terrible ? Hm.  You'll end up in the same sort of situation when you're 60 and getting raid gear that you are now in BFA.
---
not gonna happen
---
I was in the middle of fighting with a Hunter I partied up with
---
"Oh brb my pet abandoned me, gotta tame a raptor"
---
Side note, does killing someone's pet in a duel make it upset? 'Cause i dueled another hunter and killed their pet 3 times.
---
Sounds like you have some incredibly selfish friends tbqh.
---
Why don’t you make like a tree and fuck off
---
Classic has layering. You only see people in your current layer.
---
Don't premature celebration it, people actually have to get through the queues to play it first!
---
So many post about this. Blizzard has said that they were going to try everything in their power to not let that happen. They’ve released so few extra servers as a precaution to that and have now started raising the player cap to existing servers. Worst case scenario if a server does slow down then they’ll merge it or allow transfers. I rolled a one of the new ones yesterday and both times I’ve logged out at night it’s been full. Just pick a server and start enjoying again.
---
It is when you got plenty of other stuff to do
---
You're basically 3 days late. If anyone was there it was their bank alts lol.
---
Lol, alright bud. Sorry it’s not easy like your pserver.
---
Wow thanks!!
---
Yeah this morning I instant logged in. Was very weird. Seems like the servers filled up instantly tho, so it's like it changed nothing.
---
Fairbanks.
---
is it possible to have a rogue spec thats competitive in both pve and pvp?   i dont like the idea of re speccing every time im going from bg to raids/dungeons
---
Bartender adding works great too if you dont like elvui
---
Yes, it would be better, almost like a classic+, something that would inevitably die with absolute certitude.
---
You suck, noob.
---
is there an addon that allows me to copy text in the chat box?
---
OK so I have no clue if this is where I should ask this question but I would like to know if someone who has never played wow before would find enjoyment with wow classic.
---
More like /r/megalophobia
---
Ur an undead in mulgore... I just did this run... Did they get the newb to run to then u death ran the majority and then they left u behind? Deeks man...
---
Sitting in the same room as him.
---
If you need more official confirmation, he's 46 now. Can be confirmed with /who on Aragul.
---
I feel like I've made some (group) friends in the game after two days. I had nobody to play with in retail... I am hoping they will be online tomorrow.
---
Read somewhere 70% of the subscriptions are Chinese. I think blizzard are crafting the game based on their play style, just like Diablo mobile game will probably be a big hit in china
---
I already knew what it was that's why I wanted it.
---
If youre in EU tell me your battle id. Ill help you :)
---
Other people wanna play too, not just the person using the bot.
---
In 2 years I would like to see an upgrade path to let players migrate to TBC and two years later the same for WotLK.
---
Add in achievements in the next 6 months and really push competitive PvP on the server scale not just battlegrounds.
---
That's all I want.
---
Quick update on this:
---
I did it and hit Friendly with the trolls shortly after finishing up level 11. Definitely worth it, I think, as I have about the same rep with the Darkspear as I do with the Undead at this point.
---
The detour slowed down my leveling, at 26 hours /played I'm level 18; I was in Durotar from about level 6.5 through 13. I slightly overleveled the quests in Durotar but that didn't help me finish them much faster so it was a fair XP hit. I didn't have to do too many green quests but had to run back/forth around the zone more than I might have to make sure things were handed in asap.
---
When I last logged out (12 hours ago) the top level player on the server was a Hunter (named Bowjob) at level 30, the top in my guild were between 24-26. I've also ~~wasted~~ spent time leveling professions, hustling for silvers and stockpiling gear / bags for alts which is more my style than just pushing to grind out levels. Perhaps I could have hit 20 in that time were I more disciplined, but that still feels like a slower pace than usual for the time allotted.
---
Cheers!
---
where did that come from and would you be able to supply a better picture?
---
I think retail just became WoW 2.
---
queues suck now, but i think people are afraid of switching to a lower pop server that might end up being dead a few months down the line, thats why im still on whitemane, but I also don't really mind queues that much
---
What I’ve read says mace is best for shaman but is it worth it to buy a mace from a vendor? Wondering if I’m  gonna screw myself over if I don’t continue to level maces from the get go.
---
That’s why you make your script complicated.
---
How many times are the trolls gonna try to bait us today?
---
Not even more than most, but multiple of the very biggest.
---
IIRC manually controlling as many clients as you would like is fine but technically it is against TOS to use the key presses on multiple clients as it fall under automation, as the key presses are not actually being done by yourself, but a program that replicates your key presses to each client. That’s just my recollection though.
---
I got a red bag drop 30 mins in..
---
Yeah it's a little sad. They're trying at least
---
Do you like mmorpgs? If so wow is the best.
---
how long can you be afk before kicked?
---
This is brilliant lol. I'll stick to logging out though.
---
I've seen a ton of frost mages aoe grinding.
---
Ugh. Guess I can’t queue and then go out without some remote monitoring software to tell me when to come back.
---
Spirit tap is the only reason I don’t have to drink after every kill. You are crazy if that’s not the first talent you max out as a priest no matter what spec you going
---
8h que syndrome.
---
I think there's a lot of ground between "What if everyone could fly at 310% speed everywhere because it would be convenient" and "What if a particular class could actually use all of its features in endgame content"
---
There is no accurate source for that number as far as I know no, only estimates based on polls or add-on data
---
Or, alternatively, don't bot

---
What’s that mean?
---
I just dont buy some of my skills. Not all of them are useful for leveling.
---
I got everything that needed to be done, done before 3pm on Monday. NOW I HAVE NOTHING TO DO.
---
I agree but for some people the direction that questing addons gives them is the difference between moving along in the game and stalling out and quitting. I just want him to know it’s an option.
---
Hey OP get new chairs
---
It's a PvE server, it's for babies
---
Hope this hits realms soon... logged on to check status before heading in to work. Stalagg had 11k queue and was 189 minute wait. Dont want that going into the weekend. Need to be able to grind!
---
It was changed during the day. Yesteray there was only 2 of us so we both had 2 screens so we could watch stuff while grinding. Despite the new room, he still prefered the couch, was cooler than next to all the pc.
---
I know about sitting still but I thought with running you won’t get DC after while so I was pissed at the guy. Thought I should report him but I ain’t no snitch man

Ever heard of having friends?  Try moving a friend group that’s already leveling.
---
Agreed. The social/friends functionality has little to no investment.
---
i didnt get the old history book from duskwood for the first time ever in my life.  even went out of my way to grind for it.  could be related since both are quest starters
---
Your 20 trail is a different game.
---
Ohhh yeah. I’m not into PvP unfortunately. I may try it after while but as of right now I’m sticking to Pve.

Don’t listen to the haters or the min/maxers. It’s all about what’s enjoyable to you

Your thread is looking for sympathy against "bad people" and you're here being a shit person. You're the asshole dude.
---
Yeh I don’t need to, I just don’t play on a server with queues.
---
The osrs route is to add the things that came after that were well received (GE, God Wars, Rev caves) then instead of completely changing the game with some sort of... let’s say... Cataclysmic patch (EoC) they made new things to give players new things to do. So the OSRS route would be to release TBC like half of wrath and then create refined versions of systems from other patches to keep the game from getting stale. 
---
If they do that I really hope they leave a couple of straight vanilla servers so the option is always there.
---
Blade flurry

I envy you

I feel like they had some of these even before the two here. These ones came out around Rath but there was some a year or so before that, I believe it came in a metal can.
---
Are you the jimbo slice from Twitch?
---
Pick a low population realm. Pick whatever character you want honeslty. Hunter Warlock or Mage would be easiest to play though. You will find people to play with while you are questing. If you're having trouble or see someone in the area killing the things you need to kill ask them if they wanna group up. Have fun out there. You got this.
---
There are way more classes that have stuns than fears. Rogues pvp trinket breaks fear, and fear can be removed in many ways while a stun cannot in group pvp. You're really underplaying how big of an impact resisting an enemy stun is.
---
Everything that twitch shows for the classic installation has been working fine. And it’s one click update. No reason for manual installs at all

Man I lost all my friends they out there playing all day like “the que is fine at 7am man idk what your problem is.” And I’m out here like LF friends 😭
---
&gt; Because schadenfreude.
---
This is basically why I even bothered logging in to check things out. I wasn't hyped about Classic. I was pretty sure it would be a dud. And who knows, maybe I'll be right. But right now I'm really enjoying watching people struggle with all the old content, it's hilarious. The thing I missed most was the community of vanilla; the consequences of your actions, your reputation not with factions but with your fellow server residents, knowing your ass is saved because Low Red Moon just showed up at the Crossroads during an Alliance Raid! 
---
Also, I feel like I should be studying for my college courses right now. The nostalgia wave is very real and very powerful.
---
Bummer - I think it would be really helpful. I remember seeing some of the pre-release polls that indicated a server had a low population of healers, or a drastically higher percentage of Horde, etc. I'm sure most of it will level out any way as people create alts to fill in the niches.

Came here to say this. I'm loving our Skeram Harem but god dang guys, it's 2 letters. Who cares? We FINALLY got Classic back and it's great and people look for something so stupid to argue about.
---
Also, meme culture has overtaken it with the boomer/zoomer thing.
---
It's a far better remaster than 90% of what them tripleA devs have done. Lol dude.
---
The leader of the horde playing alliance.... What a disgrace
---
4 new german servers were added all were full atleast once until now
---
yep
---
Just open trade with them next time
---
Ignore people that define others purely based on age.
---
Well, yeah? They fixed the exploits, but not all the bugs. I don't really see a problem here.
---
Haven't used it yet due to herb tracking. Are chests that frequent?
---
Lol that analogy is garbage.
---
Or play at work
---
I didn't see the warning that Faerlina was own and operated by Asmongold. His name is nowhere to be found on creation actually. GTFO with that comment. He doesn't own rights to the fucking server.
---
stuff like this would not happen in retail at all anymore, its so sad.
---
Not really, they’re the single target masters with great cleave dps with bladeflurry
---
Not really. I got into the game in the expected time.
---
Heavily disagree. Dying because you accidentally pulled two mobs instead of one means literally nothing on your skill level. It’s a stiffer learning curve than most MMOs but that doesn’t mean it’s harder.
---
exactly. he isnt even top 10 fastest levelers. for 99% of players you can get a free guide that is almost as good.
---
That's when u dont help them and hope they die from the boss
---
I'm running on Deviant Delight. It seems that server is too new because I can't find a discord channel or anything for us. Nothing even in guild recruitment on the wow forums. It's been a bit of a mixed bag for me but not too bad.
---
I think it's just more of a safe bet to stay on a higher pop server than to cave in and go to a low pop one. It's not super selfish when our whole group have level 15+ characters on that server, if anything me forcing them to change would be selfish of me, no?
---
Please don't compare botting in Classic WoW to murder. One is much worse than the other.
---
Any realm. Horde. Tauren. Druid. Trust me you’ll make friends quick.
---
I know I saw on the Addons sub the other day that a guy had made one that does basically this. Can’t remember the name right now but Classic Friends our Server Friends maybe?
---
No, i don't want automated anything, i'm against the LFG addons. BUT /4 seems like worse cancer than Trade. At least we have things to trade in Classic so it gets used for it's real purpose.
---
I'm loving the community and Classic!  #basicallynochanges
---
i do this a lot.. happens to me a lot also. Its just how it is.. im not even mad. The madness is real
---
you are putting in some work boy
---
you think you don't but you do
---
I uh... did marry her. Like almost 10 years ago...
---
Paladin's in Vanilla are auto-attack ret levelers. Half decent early raid levelers. Then debatablely the best healers in game when Naxx drops. Honestly, not much other than that for top tier.
---
Do the whole damn village!

always tossed my bag makers some extra linen
---
1. Pick a low population server in your time zone. Google which servers are in which time zone.
---
2. Pick the faction you think is the coolest and that you identify with. Horde tend to be more pvp focused and alliance more pve focused but both factions pvp and pve equally.
---
3. Pick the race and class you think is coolest. If you want to heal pick priest, Druid, paladin, shaman. If you want to do damage pick primarily rogue, warrior, mage, warlock, hunter. Though, any class can dps just not as well as the ones mentioned. If you want to tank pick warrior or Druid (tanks make enemies attack them to protect the group)
---
4. You will meet tones of people just playing and you’ll get guild invites left right and centre. There are literally thousands of people everywhere all the time it’s hard not to meet people.
---
It's actually kinda hard to power level, at least for me.
---
I was a dumb 13-14 year old kid when I played classic in 04, I honestly couldn't tell you how to speed level because it took me literally 2 or more months to get 60
---
That guy is underestimating the ability to detect non-WoW programs/services. Blizzard routinely monitors running services.
---
But realistically, anything other than an add-on isn't going to be widely adopted because of the extra work involved. As soon as this add-on is banned, practically usage will stop.
---
First time playing WoW loving it to bits. Only remorse, I picked a Warrior and that shit is hard when you don't know what you are doing. (Like equiping rank 2 skills)
---
Too real
---
Actually: Greed
---
MKe stuff to level up and vendor it.
---
If you genuinely enjoy playing Warrior just keep playing it, everyone's gunna say something like that about every class, just do you!
---
I’m using Azerite Auto Pilot - Classic. Lvl 23 Mage currently
---
It would be really cool if they went back and did some of the ideas they originally had during vanilla that never went anywhere
---
Alenya is 40
---
Retail talents could be good in theory for endgame but they're not balanced well enough and most classes have at most one talent they can swap around.
---
There was one point in which it didnt.

No updates in a bit though.
---
There's almost always one if you're fighting in an area with humanoid enemies. Most of the time it's vendor trash or food items but I've found trade goods and greens as well.
---
Wands are in particularly high demand. I don't think leatherworking makes anything comparable. Your best option might just be to vendor the stuff you craft, it will generally sell for more than the raw materials would.
---

---
Was just doing my thing in Fargodeep Mine when i get an invite by a Paladin and another Warrior.
---
For the next two hours until the servers reset, we went gallavanting across Elwynn Forest, doing quests together.  Highlight was when we were doing the quest to get the Kelp from the Murlocs behind Goldshire, and like, SIX of them aggroed when we tried to pull one.
---
Cue spamming Rend on *everything* like a mofo while the Pally is pulling off flash heals and the other Warrior is chopping them down.  For the first time in a long time, I felt exhilaration while playing WoW.
---
Yes. BGs are team combat so you don't need to min/max on talents as much. Good gear and team work gets you kills more than talent trees, as a rogue.
---
You got it. Literally everyone who doubted classic falls into one of two camps: 
---
1.	Bad at games
---
2.	Mom wouldn’t buy them wow
---
Congratulations on cracking the code
---
It's completely fair to not like those things, but the other side of that coin is that other people like me fucking love those things!
---
I'm so excited to be forced to socialize and use my brain, it's been a breath of beautiful fresh air so far
---
That may change, but it's currently feeling great to take things slow and "old fashioned" or whatever
---
That’s my hopeful plan, but I always read “it’s so hard to get geared at 60!”
---
I don’t see myself raiding extremely hard, so maybe it shouldn’t worry me that much, but I started at the end of BC and beginning of WOTLK, so I missed Vanilla. So I don’t know what to make of “its so hard to get gear!” Lmao
---
Out of all the expacs so far, though, it did have the best story.
---
I am there too and it's amazing
---
I second this. If you like it, roll with it. Even if it is harder to get by with initially or overall- you mastering it and owning it will make the game all the more worthwhile, and you proof against naysayers.
---
I was standing in crossroads buffing everyone who passed. Eventually someone came up to me and gave me a green offhand that was way better than what I had.
---
It's just a game fellas! relax, go outside maybe?
---
#nochanges
---
Yes
---
Correct.  Put your regular pet in the stable, tame a pet with the ability you want, spam it until its learned.

I'll be sure to try it out tomorrow if the queue let's me in. Happy adventures!

Yes this! It’s random to have constant trade cancelled messages on my screen and it’s a hassle when you’re trying to get to the next objective for questing
---
Yep. This will tell you what you need: https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/training.php

---
If youre having fun just keep at it man - its as simple as that.
---
I actually really like BFA (I know, I know - stone the heretic) but I too have been shocked by how much fun I've been having in classic.  I plan on continuing to play both with regularity which initially I didn't think I would do - I thought I would log in to classic and maybe last for a few hours before I wanted to go and do something else and it just hasn't been like that at all.  
---
I agree about the "money actually matter" comment a lot - I have an unhealthy amount of gold that I hoard on current servers and don't even blink about spending a few gold to buy some random firework or something but counting out my copper and silver and knowing that every copper matters because I'm gonna need that mount at 40 is just a really good feeling - it's making me think a lot more about what I buy in regards to spells and recipes which is a nice change of pace.
---
I started WoW with my old potato computer that would always overheat. Now I'm actually considering coming back just so I experience the game with an actual rig. God help me.
---
My rando groups were like that at first. Then i started speaking up, saying hi, thanks for this and that, and just shootin the shit. People will start to open up if you do, and it makes the experience all that much better.

---
Imagine going outside
---
It already has, when they announced it maybe 15 minutes later the queues dropped by a decent amount. So your new queues of 12-20k are here to stay.
---
So unless they're planning on doing another wave we already got the increase.
---
Gz
---
Got it, I misunderstood! My bad.  Whitemane's LFG has been great all day today at least.  Its trade chat and general that I see people being dumb in on my server, and hopefully LFG stays crap free haha
---
Non-issue? He decided to charge for it 3 days before launch, and the people that paid for the subscription didn't even have access to it on launch because he didn't prepare for the server load. Many people just wanted it to participate in world/server first races. I'm sure he's legally required to refund current subs but still, it's not a non-issue
---
I uninstalled Geforce experience because it was causing my graphics settings to not save if I made a change during a session, I guess it was overwriting my config file but also it would never load for me so I just uninstalled it. Yeah the resolution is set properly. I don't have the problem on retail, just classic.
---
&gt; "uhhh don't you people talk?"
---
&gt; "do you guys not have phones?"
---
You're intentionally ignoring the issue. Fucking obviously they talk, they organized to roll on a server in the first place.
---
This is not the consumers' fault. Blizzard dropped the ball then buried it on this Launch. They even had a Forbes article primed and ready to go for damage control.
---
This is what I don’t understand. I see some people in game complaining and trying to get other people to complain with them or even move to retail and no one ever goes along with it. Why play classic if you don’t like classic? You have to go out of your way for it to affect you at all.
---
Damn near the same story for me. Done with work, pick kid up from school, log in at 4pm central. 9k in queue.
---
8:30pm give up, still 4K in queue.
---
My only hope is that it will calm down in a few weeks and I’ll actually have a chance to play.
---
Yeah I got here at 7pm. \~ the same. I'm currently sitting at 4932 and 157 min. FML.
---
For a noob like me I can assure you there's an element of difficulty. I've died more times than I can count but loved every second.
---
I’m in a similar situation, make an alt of the opposite faction on a realm with no queue. Hopefully things are more smooth in a couple weeks. Down the road roll on the server and the higher level folks can help carry hopefully.
---
The thing that basically happens all the time, you mean?
---
People in 2004 that had never played before liked it so much that it became the most popular MMO.
---
Yeah I cant wait until the pallys have blessing of wisdom or kings
---
THIS MAN IS A LEGEND !
---
The traditional time to do the wetlands run is around level 10-13 when you normally get sent to darkshore. But you can absolutely do it earlier or later depending on how hard you want the run to be lol
---
Lol I spent like 2 hours doing that earlier and still can't decide, I like the mobility mage and their control but I feel like warlocks thematically and tankier dps like warriors in gw2 are my style. Too hard. Biggest thing I dislike is micromanaging the pet though it's good when I get it to work but feels tedious tbh.
---
USA is the 7th richest country in the world...
---
As in copy text someone else typed in the chat box? I think Prat is what you're looking for.
---
I'd love to see this.
---
You can always go to other 2nd and 3rd zones like loch to get a few more levels
---
dominos man myself
---
He's a cat.
---
oh crazy, what country are you in?
---
It’s across the board- I was having the issue in silver pine for abit, albeit not on the level of the barrens.
---
I’m not sure if there’s a ticket report feature in game, but I think that would be your bet. I didn’t look to see if the ? Icon is still there to submit tickets.
---
Wow.

Posted on the forums first... are you Noof!?

Ahmpy is 45
---
You care way too much about this game
---
https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25179-ServerFriendsOnly.html
---
This looks like it.
---
Their problem is that they raised the level cap at allt to begin with. It just kills the old content. Molten Core could still be a relevant raid in the future if they keep the max level at 60.
---
A month after the majority hit 60 is Christmas at the soonest. In BFA I was killing Jana day 3 then I just quit cause it felt pointless.
---
Or their bag is full
---
Keanu worship is cringey as fuck
---
Same. I'm loud and proud about it, I don't give a fuck if you got beef with it, don't care. I want to play.
---
Retail is basically a thinly veiled Diablo 3
---
haha fair enough then. 
---
still, the nostalgia turned up to 11. 
---
well done
---
In pve, whatever gets you more stats. In pvp, you wanna try and stick with a shield to make melee easier to deal with.
---
Playing a Priest, all my spells cost a whole lot of mana. Fighting a random Raptor in Wetlands.
---
Mind Blast
---
Shadow Word Pain - RESIST
---
There goes all my mana. Good thing the wand is a laser.
---
and it was everything you hoped it would be?  Not just a nostalgic memory that could never be recaptured?
---
It’s good :)
---
50 boars no lie
---
What faction is better at the moment?  And/Or what class is buffed at the moment?
---
Hahah, yeah you definitely didn't pick an easy class to jump into it with. I think hunter is the most new player friendly :)
---
Run a ping test for a few minutes to see if you're dropping packets.
---
Hey look! I'm an asshole!
---
Fixed the caption
---
So many blizz apologists trying to say “you should have expected this” as if this lets blizz off the hook.
---
No flying
---
Kind of a late response to you, but I've played hunter since the inception of Vanilla. Ever since the trailer with the Dwarf who has the gun and sends his bear to attack something, I knew that's what I wanted to be.
---
That being said, vanilla hunter can definitely pose its challenges. I personally find the leveling your pet as well as yourself rewarding, I'm a super animal person irl, but if its just the kiting aspect of playing hunter that draws you toward it I'd suggest going for something else. Honestly I think Shaman of your three options fits you the best, but whatever you play I just hope you enjoy it.
---
Get an MMO mouse and keybind everything.
---
I use a Corsair Scimitar, I love it.
---
?? It is not
---
Classic has an actual respec cost though retail you just go to town or use tomes it's incredibly cheap in comparison.
---
Just grab a sword and board and switch to defensive stance and you can tank to 60
---
Yeah, subjectively at least I have had no problem finding people to just chill and quest with in areas, none of my friends are doing any rushing
---
that might have something to do with my age and approach to the game though, idk. We are all just old nerds happy to get lost in this world again
---
God I loved running all the way from org to goldshire on my horde back in the day, now I get to do it again wooooo!
---
May be due to being in the wrong region? Me and my wife are in Australia playing on German servers and we have to select servers after every login. She’s playing on German language settings, I use English, so it’s definitely not that.
---
With dustingunn. There was no AH other than IF AH until BC. I forget if there was one in Shattrath or if we just had easy portals back to IF.   
---
There wasn't unlinked AH's because there wasn't other AH's. This may have been a thing on pirate servers, it was never a thing in retail.
---
Feral Druid BiS is a level 29 weapon from Gnomeregan

Try this page for when you get to 60 :)  [http://www.wowclassicbis.com/](http://www.wowclassicbis.com/)
---
Praise Geraldo
---
Except that queues will disappear, and you'll just be left with healthy sever populations.
---
Even "low" pop servers are equal to the fullest realms from classic, according to Blizzard. Queueless realms will be perfectly healthy.
---
Yes. When training your own skills, check the demon trainer for available upgrades
---
Horde or Alliance?
---
awesome lmao, thanks for the help
---
No, this is what FL is thinking about this weekend
---
Kargoz is recommending buying AoE Taunt for Voidwalker when you reach lvl 24. Suffering of Grimoire or sth like that.
---
Imp Fireball ist good before you get Voidwalker, too.
---
Everything else except killing him for a shield is not recommend from Kargoz.
---
You need to get yourself a Barman's Shanker from BRD.  BIS for sure.
---
I'm just trying to rush to 30 for berzerker stance and whirlwind axe. Then I'll take it easy.
---
right there with you bro. I just wanted to play Classic all weekend.
---
I agree 100 percent.
---
You mean spending 9 hours in a queue isnt okay? Gee golly...
---
It‘s expensive, feelsclassicman
---
Fuck me, thanks for mentioning that. Granted I'm a warrior so my weapon is more important, but I'm having a real hard time solo so hopefully fixing that helps
---
I have the green one. I just love how we're just adventures and not champion of whatever
---
Hahaha gotta love it
---
Having this bug too
---
Can't be, really. I selected EU after first installing, CLient is set to German, Launcher is set to English, I live in Germany and don't use a VPN or anything. 
---
Also, Retail gets it right.
---
Topkek 11/10
---
Sigh. All my friends rolled on Arugal in Oceana. We subbed early to save names, only to realise at launch that it had created the toons on a random US server.
---
Now we cannot log in to play with our friends, or even make characters.
---

---
The Brotherhood will not tolerate your actions.
---
only the strong survive.
---
I'd love if they released new 'classic' content with an alternate timeline for the Warcraft universe .
---
They could easily learn from their mistakes and keep the game true to the classic experience while keeping the playerbase engaged.
---
Hey now do you think I have spare bag space to be carrying around stacks of water and milk I don't need while leveling my warrior?
---
They restarted the servers to apply this change so you were not queueing during it.
---
I'll go with that, hope for the best and maybe try to find out about it on the official forums (stupid me didn't do anything but go to Reddit first, of course!)
---
Let’s take a step back before we even laughably compare classic to any of those games. Classic is not difficult at all, in any way shape or form, it’s just slower paced (and more difficult) than retail, which is laughably easy.  There’s nothing in classic that is objectively difficult like any of those games you mentioned.
---
Player interest in BC and WoTK rereleased is definitely high enough that "most people" wouldn't rather see new content added to Class
---
I tried many AddOns (100+). Didn‘t find one, but maybe a world AddOns which reveals the whole mal is sth for yoz?
---
Fiance has been talking to me about trying the game out. I told her she needs to make the Wetlands dash at least once - it's like a right of passage for new players.
---
&gt; the next day so reroll on a new server
---
this is where you lost me
---
Maybe I'm just unlucky with my friends group, they've all taken paid time off to play this entire week but I just have too much work to do more than a few hours a day. Some of them are already around level 20 while I'm piddling around 10.
---
I bet you made some great memories thru it all!
---
Isn't it /gleader?
---
cant decide, help!
---
at least hes honest about that. do you know how many people are all "yeah man im gonna hit 60 in like two weeks and gonna raid MC with you guys and i cant wait to farm strat and scholo for our BiS stuff" just to hit that mid 20s-early 30s leveling "slowdown" (which isnt even bad but for a new player its prob real gross) and say "fuck it im going back to destiny"
---
Justice is hard to initiate
---
Theres still some ski involved. Or at least mindfulness. Compared to retail where leveling is face roll and you can do it while watching porn on your second monitor, in classic you have to pay attention to your hp, mana, and positioning when pulling same-level mobs.
---
While that is true, nobody should be thrown into a 10 hour queue and be told that its his fault he can't play the game
---
Well that settles it, after about 4 hours of play I'm rerolling back to Horde. Hang on Mankrik, I'll find your wife!
---
I got to lvl 9 on herod then wasnt able to get past queues so i started playing on one of the new servers and am nlw lvl 14 and happy
---
From barrens chat on my server - "Keep that keanu shit in retail"
---
GW1 fans are mad that GW2 is an abomination of a WoW clone that bastardizes the lore and utterly failed to capitalize on any of GW1's iconic and integral mechanics in favor of pandering to people who never played WoW but saw [this picture](https://i.imgur.com/leI6UUN.jpg) and became unshakeably convinced that UIs like that were required to play at a baseline level while buying into the memes that the game was only for the hardest of hardcore and required a hundred hours of poopsocking each week.
---
Fuck I hate GW2 for being the shitty, unfaithful, flanderized cashgrab that it is.
---
GW1 was so damned good but no, gotta throw out the interesting lore, gotta-catch-em-all skill system, multi-classing, and simple armor in favor of "Lol we're totally not WoW even though we're closer to WoW than our OWN FUCKING GAME THAT WE'RE CALLING IT A SEQUEL TO" 
---
Fuck Anet, the lying greedy hipsters.
---
Knew that soul shard “smelled funny”
---
Phase 2 is a few months out. By then, people won't be binge-playing for the most part- right now a lot of raiders are racing to 60, people are trying to get world firsts, etc. Once the newness wears off people will start to play less.
---
And some people will stop playing altogether. I mean, Blizz *is* right- there are some 'tourists' that will play around and eventually stop logging in.
---
Things should be fine on almost all realms by the time Phase 2 is ready.
---
If I remember correctly there was one in Uldaman, right? Outside the instanced area.
---
I think this needs a slide at the end where I'm waiting in line to collect unemployment.
---
There's legit, no reason to be in SW.   
---
IF has the only AH until late BC at the earliest (iirc, it's certainly the only AH in vanilla).  
---
Most of the important bits in IF are closer together, the bank+AH are the central area everyone hangs in. You've got the forge a short run through the tunnel rather than running from trade to the dwarf district.   
---
The Griffs are... about the same, maybe a bit closer as they come into a central area rather than being in one edge of the entrance area...  
---
People can totally hang where they want but... if you want to be doing productive stuff (making consumables, buffing stuff, going places) most late game stuff is closer to IF too.   
---
BRD, URBS, LRBS, Onyxia, MC, BWL, Naxx - all closer to the more useful IF.
---
&gt; I really hope they don't do that however. The whole point was to recreate classic, not just launch wow again on the same timeline 15 years later. 
---
I'm not complaining, but what i really want is BC servers and i'd be over the moon if they released those. I don't see the harm if the BC servers are a opt-in choice rather than a forced progression, but i think you'll find most players will choose to continue through the content cycle once classic content gets stale.
---
Casting spells is for non-believers and level 40+ priests.
---
I hope so
---
Don't bring up Activi$ion like Blizzard didn't start making this bed before the merger. We're doing Classic because the company went bell-up creatively speaking a long time ago.

It’s just slower not more difficult

Absolutely, that is what Classic is all about!!
---
&gt; Loot means something again.
---
Mate I was so stoked looting a 6 slot bag, and having a friendly tailor give me a linen bag.
---
Happened to me too. Sometimes its because of world server down
---
Yes, I do want that.  I want the game I fell in love with.
---
Arugal is currently over at least 6000, with an eta of 5 hours
---
Did BFD and got the gravestone sceptre on my priest at lvl 18 and ive been splattering alliance on the zoram strand lol
---
&gt; Crescent Staff 
---
i dont think that has str tho?
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6505/crescent-staff](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6505/crescent-staff)
---
Just wait... inb4 they’re doing this to have an excuse for keeping layering
---
....
---
Man, its the same FOMO I felt over 10 years ago.
---
Logging off at 3AM, then logging on after work at 6PM the next day and half the guild finished their T1.5 sets and I'm still swinging Destiny as a tank.
---
Shit, I should just not even.
---
Wait, is new Barrens chat Keanu memes instead of Chuck Norris? 
---
On one hand, noice. On the other hand... #nochanges
---
New player i’m an orc warrior and wondering if i can learn all professions. If not what are the best ones to learn. Thanks!
---
You'll switch sooner. IF is much more convenient as a base in vanilla.
---
Still no RP Server PogChamp
---
Link to github repo?? I need source code
---
Literally all of those games also get updates, WoW Classic is not going to get any new content. You are playing what you are going to be playing.
---
Yeah I have characters on multiple servers for this exact reason. Popular server busy? Cool I’ll just play on my opposing faction character on a newer server
---
You just proved my point. Quest takes longer because you have to kill everything one at a time. If you can't 1v1 a mob at your level by spamming 1 ability then you must be really bad at games. Difficulty has been shifted to end game content. The end game raids are multitudes more difficult then anything that exists in vanilla wow. Patience=/=skill
---
It's classics way of giving you the middle finger
---
The thing is all my friends are on the same server. Like all the high school buddies that played with me.  That’s classic, so gotta stick to one server lol....
---
wts Light Hide
---
I very much doubt that the average gold for all characters is 1-2g. I have played what I consider an above average amount of time in game, and I'm only level 10. The max amount of money I have had is about 30 silver, before I promptly spent most of it on learning new spells.
---
Same on Sulfuras, it's so silly.
---
I know a lot of peiple hate some affixes, but ive started to find m+to be so much more fun than raids. I havent been able to REALLY raid in 2 xpacs. Butthe m+ have made me want to actually play (i mean classic still makes me want to play more) and its brought me back and gotten me into a guild with people i enjoy playing with.
---
Raiding got to the point (if your group was either not that great or way too great) where it was just the same boring crap every week.
---
Also that was due to servers being down, not just waiting in line to get onto the server you want to be on.
---
Raise realm populations without layering and increase spawn queues
---
How does UD rogue counter mage but orc does not? Mages do not have fear/charm so UD and orc should be equal against a mage.
---
Too bad I was 11 and didn't get that part of the joke.
---
I'm actually amazed you didn't get massively downvoted for having the Modern water on.
---
Warrior would be a great choice, and honestly if you level dual wielding fury it's a lot like a combat rogue
---
Anything that can heal would also be a great choice to round out the group
---
But at the end of the day you have to play this character upwards of 8 days of play time to get it to 60, and there's no way in hell you guys will always be together. so choose something you're going to enjoy even if it's another rogue
---
battle for layer 2, the forgotten front of the westfall war
---
When people say that the population numbers is going to fall of a cliff. I ask why? 
---
People are queueing for hours right now, to play the game in its worst state? 
---
Of course there will be a drop in current players but I would not be surprised if new sign-ups reduce the impact.
---
The monster slept for 15 years and now it's back and it's hungry...
---
I think it's FOMO to be honest. People who genuinely do not like the Classic experience might feel like they should be playing it because of all the attention, streaming,  etc, instead of just self-enjoyment. I am loving Classic, but if the internet has taught me one thing,  FOMO is a super real issue that doesn't get addressed enough.
---
Why is this guy even following the classic wow subreddit?
---
Why do you even care if you can understand it? Lets say it is short for "queue" like "u" is for "you" and you even say them the same way.
---
Really good idea tbh
---
Thanks I changed it
---
I'm not exactly sure, but I don't think it will be added, because I'm not sure that that feature was available in vanilla.
---
My ass hurts.  I need a new chair.
---
I know people at epissed about the price change but he is within his right to do so. Also he addressed surrent subs and he's adding them not like what the origionla thread said. All you are doing is taking someone else's hard work and giving it away for free.
---
It's started to settle down today since Blizzard is now allowing more players into each layer.
---
What was once 6/7 hours was just 2.5 hours for me today.   
---
Queue up, workout, eat, shower and then game until it's time to crash.
---
Brown is less expensive due to having no dye coloring!
---
lol, actually funny with the names!
---
How do you get to darkshores.
---
Hi, /u/Rimiu
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cwvf9z/is_it_okay_to_play_on_one_of_the_new_servers_that/). 
---
I feel so happy after ressing someone who died recently as a priest, then healing and buffing them. Or, if they're dying to move, dropping a heal and shadow word pain on the mob feels so good
---
I had a Voidwalker named Kraktast. That must've been one hell of a soul shard.
---
Nope. Halfway through the instance.
---
I don't see how at this point they can get rid of it. Maybe the game will die down big time but I doubt it will die down that much.
---
Outstanding.
---
I'm not talking about an ingame feature, just an addon made by third parties
---
have to click resurrect first
---
Actually streaming wow through a streaming service is against TOS. It's not against TOS to stream it from your own PC though.
---
There is such an elegant solution for this. Spin off a new realm and tether it to a Full realm like Herod. If Blizz made a statement like “If this realm ever drops below XXXX we will merge it with Herod. And all names are reserved on that realm as well.” 
---
People would migrate over, because a serious Classic players biggest fear is getting stuck on a dead realm. I was on one during Vanilla. My guild was the top raiding guild and we never cleared BWL...think the 2nd best guild killed 5 bosses in MC. If Blizz makes a statement that they will aggressively merge XXX server into one of the full servers 6 months from now if XXX server dies then I would definitely migrate.
---
You should start earlier on. You only get rep for level appropriate quests (6 levels below you max)
---
I was sitting at the lushwater oasis in barrens waiting for the mushrooms to spawn and started fishing while I waited. Was enjoying it so much I forgot about the quest, wound up maxing fishing and got a ton of deviate fish.
---
Well for blaumeux(spelling?) Today the queue didn't get any longer than an hour for me so as long as you go for one of the newer servers you should be fine in a week or 2 I'd think but in reality no one knows for sure.
---
So how many times should I move my server? I already did it three times with my entire guild. Some got in on release night and played for 12-16 hours and we should tell them to throw that away because we want to move to a server where the queues are only 4 hours and not 9?
---
I got a grey bind on pickup Defias Bandana on my Rogue and flipped my shit lol.
---
Yeah, what I'm saying is that I don't think the cvar is available to be able to make an add-on for that feature. Could absolutely be wrong though.
---
I study for an upcoming exam whilst sitting in the queue. It feels great once I enter the world, feeling productive.
---
I’m in the exact same scenario. I’m glad I chose a rogue to level with my buddy because alone it would be such a grind
---
Devs said they can change the size of a layer at any time.
---
You can learn all of the secondary professions which are cooking, fishing, first aid. You can only learn two primary professions.
---
For a warrior I would highly recommend either mining and blacksmithing, mining engineering, or herbalism alchemy
---
The only one that is objectively better than the rest is engineering
---
Skinning is such a great profession in this environment, so many times I’ve literally run across fields of carcasses to skin at my leisure.
---
Makes a good diversion when waiting for other mobs to spawn at campsites as well.
---
Iv had mates who got dc from the queue or their game crash and the kept their spot. I believe there is a short grace period to rejoin.
---
Yea let’s hit max level and Run the same dungeons over and over again then going outside of the game to a 3rd party site to learn raid mechanics for classic. Much better
---
Waiting for replys because im wondering the same
---
Goldcoast to Brisbane to Melbourne to Sydney international. Yeah it happens.
---
Yeah it's one weird class in vanilla and it doesn't help that warriors were gods.
---
Back in vanilla it was so cruel players would make fun of you for not being holy pally.  This would come from other pally too lol.
---
It's still hard for me to grasp that pally is legit in retail and also fun to play because I remember how shitty it was back in 2004-2005
---
did for wrath on my druid
---
Days late. Already high enough level on the team I didn’t want to not give a shit.
---
Hearthstone?
---
Not looking forward to 50-60 dungeons tbh when pre-raid BiS comes into effect lol
---
"You think you do, but you don't" my hairy orc ass.
---
*shrugs* no idea, all I can do is hope. Otherwise just have to learn it all mentally, but it's hard cause WC is absolute maze in some of its parts. So easy to get lost
---
I actually said a loud YES when I had one drop yesterday lol
---
I work at a golf course and we have a 200 player tournament. I’ll be there 5am-10pm both days. Yippee. Lol.
---
Thank you for your service
---
Its like oldschool runescape. Oldschool has more players than normal runescape lol. Its gonna be the same thing with WoW.
---
Had a day off yesterday and did exactly this. Woke up in the morning, que the fuck up then back to sleep. Woke up again after two hour power nap and still 1k queue left so I fecided to put alarm on every 15mins. Sleepy me decided to sleep through alarms and wokr up to 16k queue. Didn't get to play and wasted my only day off cleaning the house. :(
---
This made me tear up a bit. I am so freakin' happy about Classic. :)
---
Am I the only one who had a less than 1 hour WC run?
---
The Brill Chat has been epic. Full of testosterone poisoned 13 year old that want to report anyone who beats them to a tag they feel they are entitle to. It’s been fun walking up to a spawn point and tagging the mob on the first try while they have been waiting in a circle for 30 minutes.
---
Me AM that kind of Orc ;)
---
Skämtet i skämtet :P
---
Wait...people thank healers?
---
This is not true. There was actually a post on this sub not too long ago with a link to a video and it’s guaranteed to make money Leatherworking. he tells you what to craft so you can vend it for a profit. I’ve been following it and making money and leveling up Leatherworking the whole time.
---
Ay, fuk u man
---
I remember that moment in my life... great game after work before work while in college dealing with relationship... at the end of the day... Warcraft will always win
---
All non caster dps has several BiS items in common. Sucks but mentally prepare yourselves for everyone rolling on leather damage gear
---
Lol what servers are you choosing? I went from Mankrik to Westfall and went from certain queues to no queues except during peak hours after work. Even then they were like 20 minutes
---
That's yet to be seen, classic+ is a possibility.
---
The visuals are stunning, but there’s something about running around for 3 hours to get my fire totem that makes it special.
---
Keanu Seeds is the best.  Hands down.
---
I played it only to understand what people liked about wow. It was just another skinner box.
---
Seriously unrated comment.
---
Me sending my friend any greens he can equip.
---
Vanilla had Atlas with it's Atlas maps and Atlas Dungeon Quests pluggin's ... sadly we don't have it for Classic and another great couple we don't have are Fizzwidget HunterHelper &amp; FeedOMatic, ZHunterMod and Mobinfo and Fishing Buddy. 
---
Cartographer, Postal and Move Anything would also be quality of life addon's I would like to see.
---
Also, professions mean something again.
---
See I don’t get this.people say everything’s harder but I don’t see it. Just pulling one mob over and over again is hardly a challenge. It wasn’t hard 15 years ago from what I remember and it isn’t hard now just more time consuming
---
At midnight
---
Nice try but failed miserably. It's a lvl 70 weapon
---
Feels the same as a Druid.
---
If you are in Elwyn forest i would run down to stranglethorn vale all the way as a GHOST. Rez at the spirit healer just outside of booty bay graveyard and jump on the boat from Boot Bay back to Ratchet. God speed son
---
Shit. That's terrible.  Best of luck to ya though.
---
They increased server max populations today.  They know what’s coming.
---
Try using the spell ID. Lesser Heal should be 2917.
---
We ended up on firemaw ;-;
---
By tourists I mean people who just came in to see what the game is all about, won't be hooked and will cancel sub.
---
Honestly Kara and Ulduar were my two favorite raids, so if they ended right after Ulduar release I'd be happy, prior to raid diffuclty being a tickbox instead of crazy stuff you decide to do during the raid.
---
Bro I had a kidney transplant when I was 18 and it didn't start working right away so I gained like 30lbs worth of fluid before I started peeing it off. Since I spent a lot of that time in bed because post surgery, a lot of that fluid went downhill to the lowest point. My legs and balls.
---
Like, we're talking somewhere between softball and volleyball size. Heavy enough I couldn't walk without a sling or a hand holding my sack. I don't remember much from that first few weeks, but I'll never forget *that*
---
I like this, original, not some shit karma whore post. i like this.
---
I'd heard about that, you have something like 2 minutes to return to the queue and save your position at it.
---
They paid for a month of it so taking it away before that month passes is illegal.
---
I don't know why the other comments are incapable of explaining something so simple to you.
---
"got sick" ;-)
---
Yeah, I understand completely.
---
Naxxramas: am I a joke to you?
---
I don't know if this is a meme or if this guys just dumb
---
A warrior taking tailoring is the silliest thing I have read all day. Use that cloth for bandages and to suppliment your constant repair bills
---
Might regret the lemon one
---
You can just keep moving goalposts if that's the argument, the only way to have it be successful then is having 10k queues on all server forever.
---
Current fact is classic wow is an incredible success both playerwise and streaming wise.
---
Blizzard has said they can make more layers and the servers can easily handle it But that bandaids the problem because then everyone thinks their pop is fine then when layering goes away and they are in 100k+ que they are confused.
---
Is Maraudon out?
---
I've had good experiences on BB and not even any loading queue this afternoon.
---
Dammit I was hoping to finally be able to play with mates who started on day one... guess my level 2 will keep waiting
---
Priests are not weak in PvP no, they just have the least utility and mobility of the healers which makes them less meta.
---
Shaman are great healers and bring a ton of utility for the rest of the group.
---
Roles in classic work way differently than in retail, you do not need to spec into protection to tank dungeons at all
---
This site should help you understand.
---
https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/
---
I totally believe that.
---
Don’t be a dick, mkay.
---
In the same boat. What was the time committ for raiding in classic? I hit 60 a week before tbc.
---
They are mindless savages!
---
If the quest turns grey you get a fraction of the rep. Make sure to do all you can while they're green and you'll still get maximum rep. 
---
You can hit exalted before 40 if you finish everything you can, which is good since in classic the mount is the expensive part not the riding. I refuse to spend 80 gold on a horse when I could be riding a tiger, so I've been in nelf territory since level 1
---
I needed to do some manual additions to dependencies in visual studio. It would be a bit complex to explain to a novice.
---
Someone in the thread recommended Autohotkey as an alternative. I think you are better off looking into that.
---
You can redo all your progress in a few hours, if you think you’d like the other toon more then play that one
---
I've lived in Mexico for many years and seen the whole country by car from border to border, coast to coast. Durotar isn't anything resembling Mexico. Actually, I'd say Utah into Death Valley, CA are more like Durotar. Mexico is much more like The Barrens and areas surprisingly resemble Tanaris.
---
This is what my friend told me.
---
Did he just get killed
---
I really hope Blizzard is reading through all of these posts and taking lots of notes.
---
Hasn’t helped a great deal
---
I had 2g around level 14, I'm 18 now and have almost 5g plus some spent. It's slow but not "200g for the entire server" slow lmfao. I stand by what I said, I think the average wealth is around 2g right now per player.
---
Nooo, I've really been enjoying seeing really basic names for the most part. Running past "Jack" and "Livid" is too good.
---
You can flag yourself for PvP in a friendly zone if you are so inclined.
---
Have not experienced a line for quests mobs yet. It’s always different groups of 5 competing, with the occasional “form a line” guy getting ignored.
---
.
---
Who hurt you?
---
You really have no idea how it works do you?
---
Hell yeah. Can’t wait to hit the vape this weekend and get into it. Have decided no AAP tho, I’m gonna take my time.
---
Inspect people?
---
Personally, I feel misses/resists forces you to think on your feet. Not everything will go as planned, so what do you do? Yes you can resheep, but a missed sap and your healer will have to shine.
---
The flaming horse quest was so fun!!
---
Some things are harder, some are easier. 
---
Leveling feels hard because you're literally in whites, you'll never be this under-geared ever again. Do some instances, get some blues, you'll blow through quest mobs. 
---
Things take longer and are more inconvenient, which has value in adding to the world. 
---
But comparing Vanilla WoW raiding to TBC or WoLK raiding, let alone beyond that is crazy. There's a reason we used to joke about how half a 40man raid was AFK on /follow. Many raids used to literally ban DPS meters because they didnt want to encourage players to focus on DPS and risk pulling aggro. Imagine playing like that now?
---
PvP is similar, there's some skill in Vanilla PvP but it's far more binary than later on.
---
Full time job getting marief and want to learn new programming skills...I have veen watching videos of classic before it was officialy confirmed and dont want to start playing becouse in ling term I could use that time to my bigger prio... same problem :(
---
Inspect everyone in the group every single time an item drops? Even though nobody else does that?
---
As a tank, bandaging between pulls while the healer is drinking is critical.  Or if a low health mob flees and I can't risk running it down and have no ranged options, bandaging up can mean the difference between finishing the fight or running back from the graveyard.
---
It isn't illegal, you don't know what you're talking about. You can do rent increases for pretty much anything, if you give notice then it is not illegal or even considered shady. Downvote me, go for it, but I've worked in businesses with rent increases and they aren't doing anything illegal
---
If you buy the last rank the previous will be auto learned.
---
Mine either.
---
i just disabled the fade and it seemed to work! and i get my blue circles, thanks!
---
No queues at all now on Atiesh.  I am sure none on Old Blanchy, which is smaller.   
---
7 times Atiesh has no queue.  Only once it had a short queue for me.
---
Is it supported?
---
Thumbs up for high as fuck!
---
OooOoh mon, as a mage, I have to resist the temptation to just stand outside the gates to the crossroads and buff everyone as they walk in or out. Not just mana using classes, everyone. (What? It has a small skill gain buff.)
---
I'm lucky I didn't roll a class with more buffs to sling.
---
Viper sting. Priests can't remove poisons and being oom sucks.
---
&gt;whereas in bfa I never talked to anybody.
---
For couple expansions (Legion and BfA) I've had only one social experience with goofy rogue who wanted to do M+ but couldn't get into groups so he made his own (something like "lol I am bad sorry"). He was nice guy so me and friends boosted couple lower keys for him and he was really happy.
---
So in maybe 4 years of modern WoW I've got one rememberable social experience. I've had multiple ones now in Classic and it has only been two days.
---
Get away with what? They can’t help if everyone wants to just play on one server. You have other options with no queue. You can play the game but you are choosing not to.
---
I mean if you’re a responsible human being, yes you should be able to balance both
---
That's definitely a threat, for sure.
---
But when you mix up the classes, there's just too much to react to.
---
Somebody with 5 shaman might look intimidating, but when a rogue unstealths and saps one, a warrior charges in and AoE fears the rest, the priest mind controls one off a bridge, etc -- the complexity of that fight is way more than any multiboxer can handle.   If you did arena matches with 5v5, where 5 where players and the other team was all being multiboxed, the players would win almost every time.
---
Depends on the situation. If you as lets say a shaman need on cloth bracers with also a clothie needing... you're an ahole..you cant enlarge your loot pool and diminish his chances because you can wear more different types of armor. You go 2nd in that case....thats vanilla. For end game this changes a bit due to healer bis but i doubt you're pugging at that point.
---
If its your type of armor or noone needs and its an upgrade for you...fair game
---
This is my absolute favorite thing about classic!! I love buffing people. :D
---
I hope they make brand new expansions so we don’t have to redo BC content. Would be nice to have expansions that carry on the classic vibe but with different quest lines
---
Blade flurry, bombs, and dynamite.
---
Encountered him on my bear extinction hunt. Killed around 50 and was 5/6. Son of Arugal came by right when I was busy looting the last heart and bam... Slams my squishy mage ass. 
---
I love classic.
---
Commenting so I can download it later after work. Thanks, op! I'm excited with the Immersion add-on!
---
look up chrome remote desktop
---
Restart. Your gear and stuff will be different by 30 either way. Have the character you want to play.
---
Look at it this way, you now know what to do even better the next time. Pretty sure most of us have level 30s abandoned somewhere. As long as you had fun, it isn’t a waste.
---
shhhh
---
I play on Bloomoo but I don't know who that is.
---
You want nochanges, you got it. :)
---
In true vanilla I believe you get summoning at 42 but in classic its 20, which is why wow head says added in 1.13.
---
Thus increasing capacity
---
Hard is being used a lot in place of long. Which does make it hard in a way.
---
Interestingly, I'm 2 levels ahead. I've found the guide to be quite good.
---
Mobs themselves are not harder is not like your player skill is ever gonna be tested by fighting one mob at a time. It’s just more time consuming to fight one at a time
---
Is leveling easier now? You betcha. because the game design has pivoted away from the leveling game and it’s designed to get you straight into endgame. Now that’s another question for another time
---
Ps if you ever die to a single mob pull that not elite or over level then you should probably just uninstall the game
---
Don’t do it
---
What about people playing legit through that time period
---
Jazzeroth
---
I know there are gnolls that if you pull one, the other one will get aggro'd as well, which can be kind of a pain. tbh there should be enough people in the area rn that you can group for the quests to make it slightly easier.
---
Other people also don’t seem to have this issue, maybe you’re the problem
---
Yes! This is why I love Classic sooo much. It is awesome.
---
Sick!! Photos don't do it justice. You can see the mayhem in the video.
---
Don’t do what
---
The only thing I've been pissed about so far is needing on mats (tigerseye, malachite) you dont need that you Ninja fuck
---
Gear is fair game, I'm not checking
---
I was more excited about dropping a 8 slot bag in Westfall yesterday than my BIS trinket on retail
---
Leveling a warlock (like I did back in Vanilla!), with skinning and mining as I level.  Ultimately want to PVP — when is the best time to drop skinning and hit engineering?  Should I level to max first and then switch?
---
Always thought this mask looked sick as fuck on trolls back in the day
---
We’ll interview Joana and another guy who made his fortune flipping pogs in the ‘90’s and dreams of being able to do it again.
---
When it comes to healing 5mans while leveling priest is top notch. If you're looking at either priest or shaman they're both solid picks, though neither will really outpace the mage or rogue for damage. 
---
Priest has the bonus of being the best dungeon healer, defensive dispels for pvp, but you and the mage kinda want the same gear. 
---
Shaman doesn't compete with either of the other classes for gear really, and has better buffs available through totems, but in pvp your not as strong of a healer
---
Maybe an hour a day? I don’t think I could handle it.
---
15 silver? You must be fucking rich
---
I eradicate filth for the glory of the king under the mountain, Magni Bronzebeard.
---
Hot take: Bfa isnt actuall that bad, it just caters to a very different playstyle than classic. I personally happen to enjoy both, and i still love both games.
---
It isn't illegal to change the contents of a rental or subscription during the rented cycle. It's only illegal to adjust the price halfway into it. For example on a 30 day monthly rental, it's illegal to perform a rent increase on the 15th day or afterwards, and it's illegal to change the details of the agreement without getting a new contract signed
---
really? I'm not even sure how they would know if it was running in the background.
---
If you split all expansions into their own servers then you'd end up with each server being empty.
---
You need to check which pets have which skills, including lightning breath, on a site like petopia. ( pet skills also have ranks ).
---
When on the site you find the pet with the skills you want, you need to tame that pet, and fight a few monsters alongside it, untill a message such as “you have learned a new spell: Claw (rank 4)” appears in the chat window. At this point that spell will appear on the “beast training” skill, located in the tab where you also have your professions and racials, you can then abandon the pet you tamed just for that skill, and teach your main pet that skill yourself ( if it can learn that skill, that is ), using the training points your pet gets as loyality increases
---
First time playing priest. Was melee back in the old days. I think to myself, you know what? Let’s be authentic. Let’s figure out a spec without a guide. Read all the first tier talents. See Spirit Tap and think, holy shit.... that’s amazing. I later look up a guide bc leveling priest is rough and sure enough, Spirit tap across the board.
---
Exactly. Not like you can have both factions on the same server anyway and you’re still good in the rare off chance the lower server ends up dying out.
---
“No don’t play the game, you need prior experience to enjoy any game” /s
---
multiboxing is for noobs
---
Look again, ypu will find it now.
---
The problem is that the content leading up to that difficulty is so faceroll easy that new players do not learn any skills to assist them with stepping up. They are used to the epics just rolling in from the WQ slot machine.
---
That’s nuts. Hope they enjoy the ban.
---
If something has int + stam/spirit and there is  someone that actually uses that and rolls need, you are a greedy pos for taking it.
---
Taking everything for yourself is actually selfish bfa mentality not vanilla, unless you play a hunter.
---
Someone called Kharsek did. They made leveling much faster (millions of exp/hour) and he reached level 999 a few years ago.
---
transcendence eu. german realm.
---
Exactly! So many people are saying something about nostalgia, but I'm over here playing vanilla pservers for years, because its actually fun! It's wayyyyy more fun than retail, imo
---
Is this post low-effort, was leaving it in the video low effort or was it a nod to GoT since Hodor is also in the video? You decide!
---
A golden oldie!
---
Getting a boar so he'll eat everything (instead of the pet you think is cutest) because food is EXPENSIVE, and you want free mage food...
---
Just keep thinking of that sweet horse you get for free while all the other scrubs desperately farm their gold
---
Single target, aoe isnt viable at the moment due to the population.
---
20 moonfires will be murdering you in .02 seconds... as they all come out of stealth. 
---
So unless you're running with 50 hunters spamming flare, good luck with that.
---
I got kicked, now when I log in Im met with a black screen at character select? help?
---
That reads like a movie script. Bravo.
---
You guys are jumping the gun, it's new and in hype mode, might want to save the laughs for a few weeks, see how the population does.
---
I think I'm your friend..
---
Yup! Absolutely. No matter what spec you go or how you jump around. Spirit tap is amazing.  The talent trees are one of the most missed things from wow. You could come up with all kinds of talent combos. And people did. It’s a lot of fun.
---
Agreed
---
I made bank undercutting someone and then when I made more someone undercut me too. Live by the sword, die by the sword I guess
---
In 5 mans you can tank perfectly fine as a fury warrior, you just wont be as good as a Prot warrior. But the dungeons are straight up gear/time checks and aren't so difficult that you need the right talents. All your basic prot abilities are still there for you to use.
---
A fury warrior with good gear will roflstomp 5 man dungeons as a tank.
---
If you can find a spot with no/few people, then go aoe, way faster and good income of cloth/gold/greens. I swapped to it with an AE build and it's really chill, good speed too
---
yojamba down too
---
Nope later on skills and uses xD made a few gold today by dipping into some of the items
---
I’ve just gave up and started spending all my last silver on AH upgrades so I don’t offend people :( 
---
Lol I know a little costly but it’s worked out so far
---
Report them
---
Will be my first time playing... how long will I have to wait for the queues to die down?
---
dude dont use a quest guide,play the game how it was meant to be played and explore
---
How is 3 servers at 4k max pop vs 1 server with 3 layers better?  
---
I can understand the "See everyone" argument, but if your server was a dud because it was abandoned your "Cohesive Single" turns into a mass exodus to another server via realm xfers due to low population.  
---
Is it better to have server refugees on an established server?    
---
Would the argument be the same if it were three different servers that were force merged when population dropped?  
---
I just want to understand why this is such a bad solution to a hard problem.
---
Devilsaurs are elites in ungoro
---
You never ignore chat!
---
Exactly.. day 2 or 3 of a new experience is the honeymoon phase.  Once 60 and endgame grind, how will it be different?  Grinding endlessly for small increases and min/max.
---
It's easy. Work 8 hours. Sleep 8 hours.   6 hours in the queue. That leaves 2 hours to play.
---
How long are they down for normally?
---
Did you try googling “wailing caverns wow classic map”?
---
Was logged in for a while and barrens chat was still going, so not technically down lol. Broken!
---
happy cake day!
---
Because I also want leveling to be fast? Challenging is not the same as slow. They could make the leveling experience challenging *and* just as fast or even faster than today. It's just tuning.
---
Ok? You levelled to 60 15 years ago and have incredible memory?
---
The people who played 15 years ago are not the same audience as someone who’s never played an old school MMO and are asking if it’s hard. You’re not looking at it objectively at all.
---
Dungeons and Raids aka the endgame which is all that has mattered in wow basically since wrath.
---
Can you link me the post? I did some googling and couldn’t find it. Thanks either way!
---
I just don’t want them to merge servers... I hate having 2-3 servers with their server name attached in chats. It is so cluttering.
---
Now your on the triggered loop, dance Pinocchio dance!

Yeah. I'm killing as I'm waiting for quest stuff to spawn and just efficiently using my mana to kill obvious easy kills on the way to my next objective.
---
Logged back in, just at an empty character screen.
---
Regardless they cant loose!
---
Also happening here. Glad i'm not the only one
---
And then there was layering....
---
So they can release the content in waves as it happened in vanilla...
---
I have a crew that will help me with ww axe as soon as i hit 30 so il have it asap.

Have you got back in I cant?

I buff everyone I pass, even those that can't offer buffs themselves.

They probably plan to wait more than 2 days to jump to changing things they developed over 15 years.  Just a guess.
---
I'm sure he does too. Why would the president of a company not want their product to be successful.
---
blizz didnt even think people wanted vanilla whatever number of players they expected has been well surpassed.. how dead is bfa atm? anyone know?
---
Nothing is worth giving up WotF for PvP.  Especially for a melee class.
---
You got papa cow in general chat too. What’s with this
---
not for me just black char screen
---
yea but tbc had none of that do
---
Dude...leveling a priest is fucking rough. Our priests are leveling so much slower than everyone else.
---
Depending on how much you've been able to save, around level 50-55 you should be able to switch.
---
Cuz the servers have just crashed again.
---
Enjoy the re-queue
---
We are all stuck in the barrens right now. Lots of choke points in the barrens and most people haven't been able to play enough to get into the 20s yet.
---
I've been playing Atiesh and there is rarely a queue.

---
Still stuck on the black screen.
---
At the end lol the, didn't think it would be that long honestly.
---
Classic is made is such a way that i think as a casual you will have alot of fun. Alot of quests have chains that usually take like 1h-2h, so you can play classic with no worries even if you can play 1h/day. But it depends on your expectations of classic. If you want to do dungeons/raids than 1 hour won't be enough.
---
You have to find the right balance for you. I work 50-55 hours a week, no kids, live with girlfriend, still find time to grab a few hours each day at least.
---
eat a dick.
---
No it isn't...
---
Thanks!!  I will just stockpile ore
---
No most high end raiders at least the ones I've played with/talked to absolutely fucking despise ap we are only still playing because the raids are good.  We absolutely would raid log if we could nothing else in wow is fun right now other than raids and high M+
---
In loading screen at 80%..  what to do?
---
I feel like an idiot for writing a macro now with it for bosses....
---
What I mean is the balance that patch had, not all the raids and content.
---
I used the WoW to destroy the WoW
---
i did Naxxramas back when Vanilla WoW first released.
---
WoW Classic is an easy game. it's still a casual MMO. there's a reason it was considered "baby's first MMO" when it released in '04.
---
Yojamba is down it seems. Can't log on. So much nostalgia.
---
well that's up to you, there's no need to rush to 60 or anything you can play casually
---
na kicks us out to let others in, its bs lol. has to be on purpose since it keeps happening
---
Normal move, but its never good. Community always suffers.
---
still no good for me.
---
still black screen for me, what server are you on?
---
the servers crashed like 10 min ago, still broke
---
Damn this is exactly what i wanted to comment :D
---
Oh man.. lesson learned then :) make sure you do it going forward, no one else will and you will be the hero
---
If i remember right some classes were broken
---
RuneScape has classes built into the skills. It's just not defined and is more dynamic. 
---
Combat level is your character level
---
Hahaha that would have worked too
---
Lets hope classic will finally cause a 180 degree turn for the retail design team and bring it back to what players really want...a challenge.  Not hand holding or welfare epics.
---
Authentic classic experience
---
Zandalar fo-eva!
---
the good thing about MMO RPG's is that they are made to be played in anyway you want... if he wants to use a guide, so be it.
---
Dude that hike is treacherous. That stranger saved you quite a struggle
---
As you go you will need to tame wild pets to learn new ranks to teach your actual leveling pet. Your spell book has something called pet training
---
No, no TBC, no wrath. We can talk about TBC talents though.
---
Nah, resto druids are needed in Raids. They might not be as purely good as priests, but they are easily good enough and bring utility to the raid. We used to run a ton of resto druids in my guild in vanilla.
---
Hell, I even healed on my alt when we were short as a feral druid with half-baked gear, and it was never a problem.
---
Then finding out 2 quests later you need 12 more..
---
Well that's actually a good point, what if someone was having a baby. They may want to stay logged in and not have to re-queue after they give birth. It's a bit unfair to make them move their birthing pool right next to their computer.
---
Depends on the server, but anything full I could see it lasting another two weeks. This weekend will be an utter disaster
---
Classic has been great... how many times have you had to run for your life from a few mobs instead of just lazily chopping away at 10 of them like in retail? The sense of danger is there again.
---
Define later. When people start making alts or don't want to level alchemy by self picking herbs it will all turn out profitable. Most servers don't have a balanced supply vs demand atm.
---
Hit the loading screen then it froze there. Had to force quit now back to black screen
---
didn't knew naxx was realeased in 04'.
---
While that true it would be going against the design of the game and placing artificial difficulty on yourself. it would be no different for me going in to retail and trying to kill a world boss solo
---
Brilliant. So many salty people here its hilarious.
---
Yeah black Character screen
---
Report them. The more people realize that this is unfair, the less people will do it. This is just stupid and seriously shits on those actually WAITING in queue to play. If you're not at your computer, you shouldn't be on the server.
---
no? but u will be in history of Classic as a 1st 60.

Yeah I was just in queue for 2+hours came home with 30mins to go. Next minute I'm in with a plain black screen no characters no enter world, can't even create a new character. Arugal Oceanic, anyone else?
---
&lt;laughs in Starshards?&gt;
---
we could go join the protests in Brisbane, maybe start a riot, I hear they are fun...
---
We finally got in last night and it’s our home for sure. 
---
For the Horde, baby.
---
Allen Adham has serious design chops.  Lead designer for WoW up until just before launch (health issues due to the stress of continuous 16 hour days).  Responsible for most of the feel of classic wow and burning crusade (yes they were working on that when WoW launched).  
---
Then Pardo took over and you feel the difference in design over the years.
---
not like he is playing a night elf hunter though
---
Don't try to joke to boomers they don't understand humour.
---
I also have been having fun but the attitude that classic is harder than retail outside of leveling is just silly. I think that's all he's saying.
---
Yeah this is very annoying
---
www.warcraft.com
---
this doesn't work.
---
Who is that guy?  Is he somebody relevant, or just a guy?
---
Download questie. Joanas guide is trash anyway.
---
Arugal is dead. Everyone has the same issue
---
Well I don't think they "doubled down" on it. They asked 
---
1. If you needed it and,
---
2. If the rogue could have it if it dropped.
---
You didn't really give them a chance after they asked I don't feel.. they may have been keen for you to join in even if you were rolling on jt
---
I don’t actually think they are doing it. And I said the only reason I can see these people quitting is queue times, not that every realm has them.
---
Doesn't work for me on Yojamba
---
High Tier: Small Brown Pouch
---
Mid Tier: Small Red Pouch
---
Shit Tier: Small Blue Pouch
---
*blows kiss*
---
If you're with friends and talk about it you can need on everything that's an upgrade but if you take a spellcaster piece as a feral druid because it increase your stamina you're doing it wrong
---
Think Ahmpy was higher level.
---
Skull Rock is a living nightmare. Died at least 5 times before I just grouped with the other two guys being killed by constant Burning Blade respawns
---
Stricter Afk tests need to be implemented. They should just be kicked, if they are actually online they will be able to relog in the two min window.
---
Bingo. Anyone over 16 or so in 3 days with these queue times are committed. Remove layering and that's a very healthy server from how contested every mob has been in my experience (dinged 24 tonight).
---
Yeah, it happened in the middle of my WC run last night.
---
The whole group survived the big lag of 28/08/19 though. #iwasthere
---
I just dinged 20 on my rogue and I have 5 or 6 skills on the trainer I haven't yet tried. Don't need backatab or ambush as a sword rogue, rupture takes too long to do its damage while leveling, and I'd rather do slice and dice than expose armor with my combo points.
---
It's just the letter Q with a bunch of silent vowels in line behind it. :)
---
No, youre in the right mate
---
Haven't had a single queue, myself. I would definitely expect one playing on an always high server though. Can't really gauge what servers will be what before launch given fucktons left to start playing
---
Hell yea!
---
Why not a mage named Keanusheeps?
---
You can tank without it, just hold a shield in bag
---
Is boomers a reference to boomkins?
---
My vote is go all the way to wrath then start osrs style. :p but wrath was my favorite.
---
Oh man, I literally just got in for the first time and was wondering why I couldn't create a character on Arugal.
---
I was doing some light RP last night on ZT as we levelled and it threw off some of the people I spoke to, but I think they enjoyed it. 
---
Dey be findin’ their feet, mon.
---
This wont work lmao, its nothing to do with your client
---
its a windows standard wallpaper for locked screens
---
I thought every spirit healer revives you at the spirit healer you originally died and spawned at, or was that a later update?
---
It is accessible. One or two servers are always without a queue. You're paying one sub for all servers, you're just joining the one that's not available right now.
---
Service is always accessible.

Not sure to be honest... I had a great time though!
---
Peel or no heal. Simples
---
1 hr
---
Take my downvote for calling it VC
---
But 4 months down the line we arent gonna have classic plus
---
I mean he worked really hard with it and did someone no one else was willing to do. He can charge whatever he likes. I'm sure if his site could handle the millions of people using the guides the prices would have stayed the same. If blizzard cant handle all the people with so much prep time then imagine how his web service is going. It would be on fire.
---
But you can't really do AOE with blizzard unless you pass up some key single target talents. Thats the thing.
---
Not even close, although it is big, you cant compare to free to play games. Apex hit 50m within 2 weeks or something like that. Which I believe holds the record even over fortnite.
---
i have been tanking in a lot of games.  
---
and tanking does have a grade of responsibility if that alone doesn't guarantee me that i will loot on my own equipment im solid gone.  
---
you did what you are supposed to do.
---
Are you me?
---
Why would you even need a guide for classic? Let alone PAY for a guide? You know there are like, free addons for this too right?
---
It looks like a keyboard recording. Which counts as botting
---
sorry im new to wow, why would you get banned?
---
I never have the space to loot everything
---
Really makes me want to name-change my druids on retail lol
---
I spent most of the afternoon reserving a space remotely on my phone while at work. As soon as I get home, the server dies. 
---
Fuck it.
---
I was driven to play retail. I did a H ashvane pug and the priest who was below the tanks dps wouldn't stop whining. Yikes, hope the servers are back up soon.
---
Explains why I"m seeing this.
---
So is Remulos and from what I can see, so is every other server
---
There's an add-on called censusplusclassic when you go into a server it "whos" everyone over 20 minutes or so it will give you a rough estimation over on the distribution. This only gets data for who is online at the current time. 
---
It didn't help me with my decision when creating another class though.
---
No. I logged out multiple times tonight when trying to figure out and trouble shoot an addon and it put me back into character select immediately. You ha e X amount of time protection. I don’t know how long but when I did it I exited the game and loaded it back up immediately.
---
What does that chest contain?
---
I may have slapped my old 770 in my work PC. Also hunters are really good at grinding while alt tabbed
---
have you been having fun playing the game man? 😎👍
---
Yeah, kinda sucks cause I don't want to miss out on that initial high. But I also don't have time to sit around waiting on a queue. Oh well.
---
Hezrul is bugged
---
That's a false equivalency, as 1 is a mob designed for 1 player, and the other is a boss designed for a raid group ( or random mish-mash of 20 players). Fighting a mob 3-4 levels above you isn't going against the design of the game, trying to fight only skull mobs would be. The levels are colored for a reason. Green = easy, yellow = normal, not too challenging, Orange=harder, but you can handle 1 on 1, Red= you better know your abilities, and skull= you're probably fucked. If the game design was to never fight any level above you, then all mobs above you would be considered skull, dont try it.
---
F.
---
I made my name a profanity, idk if you will get banned for it, but it seems plausible
---
The thing is not everyone did the name reserve. Why waste 2 weeks of game time for nothing?  So they never really got the full number of people who would be playing at launch. And servers have a limit. They can’t help if 50,000 people are trying to log in to a server lets say only has 30,000 spots.
---
Above all of that, they need to raise the server population from 2.5 to 5k and increase spawn rate by 50%. The servers that take literally 2 hours as of today are EMPTY due to layering. I want a massive community i am fine waiting for a boss to spawn.
---
Are you a 20 yr old student with crippling anxiety?
---
Yes you can. You dont have to spec super fucking hard into single target while questing.
---
Got home from work and the servers aren't up. Great.
---
Wasn't aware this was a modern wow sub. 🤷‍♂️
---
Nah man you don’t have to do anything you don’t want to you we’re polite unlike them screw all these guys saying you are the asshole.
---
How long did you wait?
---
sorry amigo, wasn't with me
---
It became like that only late during the day. From hour 0 to the latest fix, it wasn’t accessible at all, Whatever server you asked for. You can’t deny it got out of control and they are trying to keep up.
---
Personally I think Blizzard has managed to  pretty much nail this launch. No one knew this is going to explode. Still they have reacted really fast to make everything work. Of course in perfect world everyone could be in playing with no dcs but it's just not realistic with this amount of players.
---
even stun resist? rogues already have the trinket for fear though.
---
Westfall on Westfall!
---
There are a few of them and you really don’t want to be there right now unless you’re okay getting stuck in queue for several hours everyday.
---
Oh my GOD blizzard how DARE your servers go down when there's too many people logging on at once. Why are you so MEAN *gosh*!
---
This is impacting Yojamga too.
---
when people say 'what percentage of players have seen NAXX in vanilla?' you can instantly tell they didnt play vanilla. The reason people wernt investing time into naxx was because TBC was coming out like 2 months later. And green questing hear from hellfire invalidated even the best vanilla gear.
---
Just submitted a ticket. 
---
Was on Yojamba and server crashed, relogged and my character is missing.
---
I’m so happy we’re at the point of having these posts. I’ve been in this sub for a year and I can’t believe it’s finally here. Queues have been crazy but you can work around them. Up to 24 and there have been so many adventures already. Just had my first pvp skirmishes today in hillsbrad, party v party. We won. It was awesome. Felt like the first blows of the war. For the alliance!
---
Yojamba down! Send in the marines!
---
Same with Remulos.
---
Account sharing does wonders
---
That's why I like using Bartender, you can keep the original look.
---
How are they staying in when they've literally got AFK in their names and are sitting? can you just stay in perpetually?
---
damn. i just hit 18. gunna run that 12 times tomorrow on my druid just to lose it to a hunter or something.
---
Today I got back home at 7pm, started the queue and went to sleep to play during the night lol.... I mean it will eventually get better... I hope.
---
Keanu can make his own clothes. Keanu Knits
---
You on Skeram?
---
Firstly, thank you for this repository. 
---
I'm trying to make two macros, if anyone is able to assist it would be much appreciated.
---
**Pet Control**  
---
1. When I hit the macro, pet attacks my target.  
---
2. When I hit it again whilst having the same target selected, pet returns to me.  
---
3. When I hit it again and have a different target selected, pet attacks this target.
---
At the moment I have one that will do 1 and 2, but I need to hit the macro twice to achieve 3. So if I want my pet to change to the new target, I need to hit the macro twice.
---
&gt; \#showtooltip  
---
/petattack \[target=pettarget,noexists\]  
---
/petfollow \[target=pettarget,exists\]   
---
Pet Call, Revive or Dismiss 
---
1. Call pet if dismissed.  
---
2. Revive if dead.  
---
3. Dismiss if alive.
---
Thank you in advance.
---
as a warlock, I can't give out buffs, but I do make sure to throw up DoTs if I walk past someone fighting a mob
---
Had a mate hit space bar for me every 25 min for almost 5 hours while he caught up and I slept.
---
&gt;invites to party
---
&gt;uses battle shout
---
&gt;leaves party
---
who even cares. it's such a trivial thing to assume someone would brag about.
---
Ok Karen.
---
Nothing says "I really dont want wow classic" like sitting in a queue for 11 hours over two days so I can play it.
---
The solution is to run these places in pugs of people you don't care about, need the item, get it, then if they start drama just fucking leave. If the are gonna get piss about you wanting an objective upgrade, they're not worth your time anyway.
---
yeah but literally no one gets banned for it
---
Just log out and give them a chance to fix it. The servers are clearly getting slammed with how slow the login process is, no point contributing to it! It'll be fixed soon enough.
---
Don't level as resto. Enhancement is the way to go. Don't attack if you are in a group, attacking as a healer only became a thing recently in retail. You used to conserve mana when things were easy on heals
---
Thank goodness.  I thought i was the only one I nearly had a small heart attack :)

That’s the only quest I’ve skipped along the way.

So when the servers come back up it'll just update the select screen and I won't have to relog?

I've seen people say this has happened the past couple days and want to see what worked for them
---
More classes stun than fear. If your trinket works for fear use that and enjoy stun resist too?

---
You just relog instantly and you don't lose your queue
---
Both you and the other person just misunderstood each others messages. It happens. So nothing on you for opting out, that's your choice. Now for the other person, what followed was uncalled for. This is where reputation matters on a server not just for that person but their guild. If they were in a guild, take note of it and just keep an eye if you run with anyone from that guild in the future.
---
Elves used to be all over Azeroth, but not in the way you think. Azeroth used to have one continent known as Ancient Kalimdor, home of the High Elves. The Burning Legion attacked Azeroth and the Well of Eternity imploded causing the Great Sundering, the event that created the continents we now know as Kalimdor, the Eastern Kingdoms and Northrend. The WoW wiki has all the lore from the Beginning if you interested in a bit of a read.
---
Botting (even if it's just a stupid one). No one wants a queue, but everyone doing that makes the entire situation worse.
---
ClassicAuraDurations
---
God, that's terrible news. Shitty permanent pet names you don't get to even find out until well into your character are the worst. Wish they had made it summon a different demon every time, rather than a shitty randomized name.
---
Cant you AOE farm in instanced dungeons?

You don't really get any big upgrades to your healing until quite deep into the tree. I would recommend leveling with another spec and you will still be able to heal fine until around your 40's. Your first respec is really cheap and you can focus resto once you get there if that is still what you want to do :)
---
it only makes the changes for your view, you will look like everyone else what u actually look like
---
looking hideous is part of the fun lol but if i can run around in full bloodfang to level i want to haha
---
No, he's not?
---
so should you just wait to buy the last rank or buy the ranks going up to that?
---
It’s exactly the same. the game isn’t designed for you to be pulling mobs 3 or 4 levels higher than you just like a world boss isn’t meant to be solod. Can it be done sure but it’s placing artificial difficulty on myself
---
Yeah, i am even proud or nostalgic of some, like knuckle sandwich, but i was like “why can’t we have our own sense?”
---
I couldn’t get that to work for me. No countdown for the dots
---
Key mirroring (pressing a button once and having more than one action take place, such as one action on five characters) is bannable.
---
Idk. If you keep lock you can mail stuff to help warrior level. Is there no other names? I was known for two names.on my old server, one ally one horde so you can be too
---
Ive been waiting for this since Cata, my morale is plenty high. Theres no way im going to be done with this in atleast a year, most likely two.
---
you need some counter weights on that thing to rotate smoother. its going to fall apart
---
yeah had this a few times now (but not as long as this one) always stay on the black screen otherwise risk a queue
---
Make a macro so you wont have to write!
---
It should yes, this is the first time I've been affected by it but from what I've heard your best bet is to just wait on the black screen.
---
Blizzard posted on blizzardANZ and advise they're working on it
---
Using r1 pw:s until 23 was something else. Turned into a God after I realized my mistake
---
is june to december 2 months? why are you lying on the internet?
---
I uninstalled my launcher and downloaded a new one as my last update from years ago.
---
If you have the crafting skill you can need imo.
---
I love all the little entrepreneurs trying to make irrelevant amounts of money that they'd earn easily by playing while leveling their char at the same time.
---
i mean you don't know that but yeah blizzard doesn't seem to enforce it even though its against tos
---
They said in blue post on the forums and on twitter that realms have capacity limits.
---
Same lol
---
Any logical person would base their decision on facts and data, you are doing it on hindsight.
---
Youre going to give your self a big headache leveling two characters doing each quests, spirit walks back, preventing his account from getting dc so you need to keep using skills.
---
All to get him to 60 after more than a month and have him not play. Until the next couple phases the fun part is leveling. There is nothing to do at 60 relative to how much time you say he has to play. Plus he wont know his class so thats a big yikes.
---
I that case you definately should marry her!
---
Vanilla WoW is about the journey. Take your time, level your professions as you go, explore. The end game will still be there whether you hit Lv60 tomorrow or in 6mths.

A bank alt is an alternative character that stands close to a bank/mailbox so that you can send all your items and resources via mail to that character so you don't have to go to a city every time your bags are full. Saves a lot of time in the long run.
---
the visual changes are client side only (the user)
---
Why is classic so empty? I remember WOLK stormwind being massively populated. It feels lonely in classic...
---
Im the guy whos mom wouldnt pay for it and im super stoked to get another chance to sortof see what its all about.
---
Yeah, love them for that, in return i always give them free underwater breathing :D
---
afking and aimbotting are completely different
---
Had the same thing happen to me last night.   
---
I stayed on the black login screen and eventually the characters loaded.

i can get behind that, it was damn nice for rogues - don't have to choose between a PVE combat build and a hemo sub PVP build.
---
Ye...
---
AoE leveling is incredibly hard to do on a brand new character without having access to broken items like spell power skinning knife.
---
A friend told me he was in a queue before they crashed, and now he's getting the black character select screen.  
---
So a good chance we're all back in the queue afterwards anyway
---
I feel you dude. 6 months left of my nursing degree but only 7 of that in university. Just want it to be done now !

That's more lady stoneheart

And I was World first undead on the tirisfall zep to Org
---
No one really cares man.

Wtf, did not see this coming
---
I'm not sure what the cause of the back pain is but after a bad injury to my lower back earlier this year I actually found the recovery (and work) much easier when using a standing desk (even got one for home too which I combined with a bosu ball); maybe something to look into if that's an option?
---
ikr. I was in teldrassil and people were running around with motorcycles decked out in full heirloom gear. It just feels so wrong, almost as if teldrassil was heavily commercialised and any sacredness was completely stripped out.
---
for God's sake please use the print screen key
---
Yes, but they weren't there during what Blizz are calling Phase 1
---
Problem is the rogue could have rolled against you anyways. There’s no preventing it unless it was ML. 
---
Maybe you dodged a bullet, maybe you didn’t but not going means you left that drama for someone else.
---
Feel your pain man! 
---
Always played my console while lying on my bed and figured laptop would be best way to go but using a touch pad and having that disadvantage is putting me off, what's it like playing with no mouse?
---
there is a mage streaming who has slept and played properly without account sharing that is higher level them him... peak performance looks like spending hours strategizing on the fastest and most efficient way, not just playing 41 hours straight.
---
New to wow, how do I talk in that chat?
---
Sounds good thank you. I have heard from general chat leveling that enhancement is better than ele ;-; maybe wrong or misguided?
---
Hahaha
---
Good call. Shaman means less gear haggling tho
---
I'm in the same situation. I doubt 5 points into improved frost will matter as you'll still use frostbolt alot. Keen to know and answer to this
---
The trick is you don't let the red things hit you
---
It's harder, but you still can.
---
First of all, the journey to 60 is a big part of the game, so your friend should absolutely try to experience that!
---
Second, a character can only be AFK for 30 minutes before the servers log him off. After he needs to log back in. If you log his character in, or prevents him from being logged off, that counts as account sharing and is bannable.
---
Was 5$ sub now one time 37$, if what I was told is correct.
---
So those are the two options, not enough servers or too many?  
---
Or Blizz could actually get it right and meet demand correctly
---
If someone is multiboxing with 5 accounts, 4 of those accounts are taking slots from other people. I am saying that 4 other humans could be playing. I would much rather have 4 people running around and having fun than a multi boxer playing with 5 accounts.

Feels like a singleplayer due to layering
---
It’s one reason why I picked up tailoring. I’ve also been a great guy and have given out 100 or so bags at cost (2.5s) with smart purchasing on the AH. Sure it’s an extremely small part of the player base, but it’s worth the time. Sadly wool bags are not as cheap and I don’t think I’ll be able to do it when them.
---
Same. While I didn't *hate* Cata, the only other content I would want to go back to is MoP because I barely got to raid back then, but I could live without it.
---
Watched it live on Nixxiom's stream. That was epic!
---
Im going to a wedding on the weekend, i *wish* i could queue with you guys.
---
Is this a Walmart group huddle?
---
"This Hunter2 guy joined our UBRS, ninja'd a warrior item and left the raid..."

Servers might be big enough in phase 1 tho to stay somewhat anonymous

Yes, tried different regions also since that was one suggested approach from google

I've been making a point as a healer to just randomly try and save anyone I see getting in trouble, or to ressurect the ones I see dead. It may not be much, but I feel it very much fits with the character I'm playing (paladin) to try and do it - even if it's gotten me killed on occasion when whatever they were dying to decides to kill me as well.
---
You are going to make far far far far less than you would by spending that time gathering materials and auctioning them to the thousands of other wannabe crafters who are all competing for resources. Sure you can turn a profit selling to vendors but that time you spend crafting is totally wasted when you could strike a gold mine selling materials when there is the highest demand for them than there ever will be in the history of WoW.
---
Yeah because that’s an easy thing to do. You should go work for them if you know all the answers.
---
Lmao is this Fairbanks? I recognize the guild name.
---
Is it difficult to understand the mechanics as a paladin?
---
Name your character similiar to mobs and destroy questers
---
I forgot all about its existence. Until it was too late.

You're right. I'll sit down and shut up instead like a good little soldier and fall in line.

Assuming that all everyone wants isn't just wotlk servers is pretty bold.

---
I’m using about 20 different addons right now, reckon you could make a video for each of them and link them here please? That would be great

Not even going to use it, but ill download it so i can share.

There are some chats that do go through layers although I agree it’s fundamentally undermines the designations of the chat channels...
---
Keanu has allergies: Keanu Sneeze🤧 - wife came up with that one!!!
---
They're fixing it you muppet
---
I don’t know man, the thing about WoW is it hits that dopamine button every time you level/craft/boss/gear/pvp and you feel good about it because thousands of other people are doing it too. It died out (at least for me) because at some point everyone is max level and have completed all the endgame content 100 times. No more excitement. But then 10 years later? It’s fun again. I think kids starting today will get that same initial satisfaction because everyone starting from the same 0.
---
Uuuhhhh, what?
---
I think you just like classic more and therefore want it to be better in every single possible way. BFA is garbage but you can't possibly think Classic is harder than current Mythic raids, or any other expansions hard mode/end raids.
---
If you don't care about raiding that's fine but you cannot claim the raids are actually harder.
---
oce servers gone boom again
---
&gt; All games are good the first week.
---
lmao what?!
---
Just use a Wayback Machine site to use the guide for free :3
---
It’s tough but nowhere near as bad as some people on here make it out to be. Get the Whirlwind Axe as soon as possible with the help from guild mates (or randos) and your life is significantly easier. I always found 20-45 to be relatively easy as a Warrior, but to 20 is a slog and those last 15 can be rough too compared to other classes.
---
I haven't had anything but positive experiences. Unfortunate for you I suppose, but I haven't had a single bad experience yet.
---
Don't project at me because you're insecure and your life is hot garbage. Arugal being the only server at launch has everyone fighting over one realm, friends are being forced to split from their group or wait out insane queue times, none of that would happen with more realms at launch. A more balanced player base and likely, less stress on the servers or even a specific server as you're speculating the cause of the crash like the rest of us.
---
You're welcome, fuck head.
---
Same. Ugh, five hours in queue to finally make a toon on the servers my friends were on... Only to have it error at charcter creation and now it can't find any toons on any servers. :(
---
Meanwhile, guild is busy summoning demons through guild chat
---
What are you showing off?
---
Must be blizzard's creative idea to reduce queue times
---
This is pretty pathetic. In 2019 Blizzard still complain about hardware limitations increasing the server population. They can simply make a single megaserver for people that want more player count and throttle the shit out of people that want low population.
---
Maybe you're thinking of dual-boxing? Multi-boxing just means multiple, no fixed number.
---
i know they r just re skin of nelfs but still it would be realy cool!
---
alchemist?
---
Looks like servers are offline now, perhaps there's a fix incoming? :D
---
If you dont get back in right away be ready for a 3 hour queue
---
What’s your opinions on queues every evening?
---
Funny. I'm a holy pally. :shameless:
---
What if im an alli on skeram?
---
Yeah, sometimes it feels that way.

I honestly can't find any system in it... Sometimes you can log right back in when you dc and other times not. I dc'ed in the middle of a DM run of logged back within 10 seconds but got placed in the queue while a friend has dc'ed and logged in without queue at the same time of day
---
Magic is over? I mean, power to you my dude, people are going to have different experiences. Weirdly enough I'm more hyped now than pre-launch.
---
Crazy some of the shit people chat on here, 200g for entire server rofl.
---
I got 3 days a week around 2 hours to play, so around 6 hours in total. Hopefully it will be fun after the long queue hell stops. I’m definitely hyped.
---
Yup, Now they are dead. Gotta be quick to get in or be ready for a 3 hour queue.
---
Do we just wait at this screen or try logging? Will the status update?
---
I disagree. In a year they could announce free transfers for all characters and six months later dedicate 1/4-1/2 of the Classic servers as ones that will have TbC drop. 
---
People who don't want it can either stick to vanilla or get the sprinkles of the true WoW golden era.
---
Just my opinion obv
---
Sounds like you never intended on liking classic, considering your post history concludes you're pro-BFA and a classic skeptic, even before you played. One of your earlier posts complains about being on an overcrowded private vanilla server and not being able to tag anything rendering it 'not fun anymore.' 
---
I don't see why retailers feel the need to white-ant the wow classic community like this
---
Watched Shrouds stream. He did not even have the money to get the skills from his class trainer.
---
Yeah man you make no sense. You take one breath and it never ends i.e. you're good underwater
---
Time to go get some coffee and donuts!
---
True.  The server im on doesn't have a queue lol

I had over 10h queue yesterday on shazzrah and firemaw is even worse.

Ohh fuuck that's so annoying. Gg

my daughter loved this comment!

Jesus stop being so entitled. Either you pick ques and high pop or small servers without. You have a choice..

Technically no

Some slimes are immune too, And theres quite a few of them.

I'm pretty sure we have to relog

Yep.  Sadface.

Ran into a warrior in redridge today fighting gnolls. He took on more than he could handle however, and literally had a sliver of health left, while the gnoll he was fighting still had half of its health at least. I managed to get to him in time and got off a gouge before the gnoll could get the final blow. The warrior quickly bandaged up and then we finished killing the gnoll together.
---
He then /loved me. God I love this game!

Servers have just been taken offline, should be back in the next few mins hopefully.
---
I love when mages buff me, except that i'm a warrior.
---
Honestly, they had ample opportunity to plan this shit. Obviously Classic was going to be popular, they even had "reserve your name" stuff. This is purely them saving money because they expect people to drop off after a week or two once rose tinted glasses are off.
---
I would be interested in a Classic+ that's been talked about by a few people. Personally I'd like that level cap to stay at 60 but brand new content to be released past whatever happened in vanilla. They could even introduce Outland but in a completely different way. Would love to see what the actual minds behind WoW can come up with!
---
just want a chat bro
---
Same, spent hours in que only to be greeted by a blank screen :(
---
Oh shut up already. How about the one thing we don’t bring back from vanilla is utter bewilderment at the idea of massive servers with tens of thousands of people logged in and active might occasionally have some issues?
---
They’ll fix it. Do something else for a few minutes.
---
f
---
[icehud](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/ice-hud) does this with 0 configuration
---
been using it the last 2 days on classic with no issues
---
It’s been 2 days
---
Anyone know what's going on?
---
If that were true l. You’d be 40 by now. You wouldn’t be sitting in queue cause you’d have been on for 16-18 hours each day and avoid them by logging on early.
---
One of the things I feared most leveling up in classic was doing dungeons and then eventually out leveling that dungeon... wait.. am I fearing dungeonfinder now? hmm...
---
I'd be ok with an eventual "phase 7" that would introduce Karazhan, Arenas and maybe balancing the classes with minor tweaks, but no new talents, spells, flying mounts nor Outlands, if only to keep players interested in Classic when things inevitably start getting stale.
---
Thanks for the suggestion, I'll certainly ask him about this. He might say no since he's made it pretty clear that he doesn't want to "grind for months", but I'll see what I can do. Basically he just wants a built-in level 60 boost token, lol - which considering he's never played before, could be a problem like you mentioned.
---
Let's dispense with this 'selfless' nonsense. They're helping other people brcause they enjoy doing it. It is a wholesome, selfish action that benefits the world.
---
This saintly nonsense needs to die.
---
It's just the retail babies being asshats, give it a month and they'll all fade away.
---
Do the servers actually refresh on this page? Or so I have to login and out? Really don’t want to meet the queue boss
---
Yesterday I asked my wife to que up while i was at work at 12 :30.  At 20:00 I had 600 before me so  I went to put our baby to sleep. When i got back to the computer I just saw how I get afked out of the selection screen.
---
I made a new char on the RP server.
---
Stats scale differently depending on your level in Classic, level 10's with agi cap are insane.
---
I was trying to do the elite dwarves in wetlands and there was absolutely nobody, sometimes i ask guildies to inv for a layer swap to try to find a person
---
All OCE servers are offline now
---
That's amazing. What is it?
---
I do hope they do something, my whole group had to split up to different serves because some didn't want to, or have the time to, deal with the queues.
---
People in here talking about how WoW isn't an MMO anymore, but everyone knows that we hold blame too. Right? Blizzard isn't the only one at fault.
---
Let's take LFG for example? Came out when Icecrown launched in Dec of 09. Whose fault was that? Ours. Why? Because we bitched and bitched about how shitty it was to sit in towns spamming for dungeons. We, as players, were done. Blizzard listened and implemented it. This can be said for a lot of things added to the game. We are just as much to blame as Blizzard. It's kind of annoying to see the player base not accept fault for the changes in WoW. 
---
I am also ready to watch this subreddit and retail WoW's subreddit as people start hitting 60 and gearing for raiding. I am waiting to see how long until the wave of people asking for LFG again starts. I am ready to watch people bitch and moan about 40 man raiding and how much of a shitshow it is to form a group for, because we know it's coming. If people think we are not in a revolving door of history then you are blind.
---
I am glad to see Classic's success so far. I also want to get in and experience the game, because I never go to experience WoW, but I did experience BC+, but I am also trying to stay realistic about what to expect.
---
its probably a mix of the hype and the fact that a lot of the people on there are getting off of work to login. if you queue anytime past 1pm EST you're in queue for a min of 6 hours. People get off of work and want to play the whole day. I'm guessing its people that have time off or are just pushing as fast and hard as they can before they need to back off a bit. just my 2 cents. people can't play for 8 hours every day after work forever lol. not everyone anyway..there are always exceptions to the rule.
---
Hmmm,  rough if you miss the next queue probs several hour wait
---
OCE servers on FTTN and it started raining.
---
May I ask why you're playing OCE servers as an american?
---
Hahaha 100%
---
its good to meet another with the same reservoir. I think the resi looks so clean.
---
As a warrior I hand out excess or lower level bandages or food. I'm trying!
---
It's handy to make macros for each move, it'll use the highest rank spell if you type the name of the move without the (Rank X) at the end. 
---
That's also worth noting if you're not wanting to use the highest rank too.

Had 7k before me in queue and I had to wait about 1 1/2 hours.

lvl 19s with agi cap are better. True twinking wont happen until people can solo WC/VC and have top tier enchants.
---
Then its on. 
---
Ill see you on my agi capped gnome rogue
---
I’m not defending them. I’m telling people whining and crying over it that it’s annoying and pointless. 
---
But you do you, let me know how it goes.
---
They're not defending blizzard. They're telling OP that the constant whining about the servers is fucking pathetic. This is how it works. There are an insane amount of people trying to play.

its a multi-billion dollar company... they deserve all the complaints. they cheaped out on the amount of servers at launch, knowing full well the hype around classic.
---
Which sorting algorithm would you use, if you had to alphabetically sort the list of daddy's OP?
---
It's not VC not a single dungeon in the game uses the bosses intials. It's DM.

i did kinda say after he went on  " so you suck then?"

no reply :/

what is that? is that a new sandbox kind of game?

You know what? I had legitimately forgotten that there was layering. It has been 100% unnoticeable to me. World's insanely crowded, yet I'm still meeting the same people, making friends etc. If I didn't know layering existed, I would have absolutely no idea.

do you have a bridge to sell me too?

Holy crap, People are leveling so fast! Awesome dude. That Rod is BIS
---
"Oh yeah no worries mate we can do that, handled plenty of big systems before, should be a piece of cake"

Or maybe your saying that so you have less people in the queue to get in. 200iq
---
yes that is the PC-O11 Dynamic. Thank you!
---
You will have a great time in Sunken Temple
---
same lol my sleep schedule adjusted to the queue meta
---
Does this count if what I use is my finger every 10 minutes? Lol
---
Why are you assuming everything needs to be seperate?
---
Oldschool Runescape started introducing original content and is so popular that it became more popular than the current Runescape and helped inform Classic Wow. 
---
Why would people want to segregate the community?
---
Might help people know what VC is when it starts popping up down the line
---
Retail (Battle for Azeroth) and Classic are both totally different from the old vanilla versions.
---
As said before Classic is not Vanilla. Think of it more like a mod for Legion. You take the engine (the whole technical foundation for the game) from Legion and build the content (Classic) on top of that foundation. That's why Classic has similar hardware requirements to Legion, because it's Legion with a Classic skin on it, if you will. 
---
There is no way for an old WotLK build to connect to Classic servers. In the best case you'd get a version mismatch error, in the more realistic case you'd simply not see anything.
---
Let’s see if this helps... thanks for sharing!

I think for questing it isn't that essential so i will do the tarrens mill run before i first go sfk.

You can only blame blizz and not the user. They failed miserably with this launch.
---
I was sitting in the server browser the other day waiting for servers to come back up and they showed online when they did so, you don't need to relog, unless something has changed
---
I did have a 3hr login queue only for the servers to go down...big brain plays!
---
Classic isn't an expansion pack. It's the foundation the rest of the game was built on. It's bedrock-level content. So calling me a hypocrite doesn't make much sense because everything else was an add-on to that. But I'm genuinely curious to know whether or not you read my post but more than that I want to know why you'd be fine with eight different versions of the game existing simultaneously. Why you'd be fine with eight different versions of your character existing on each expansion? Or are you advocating for a forced upgrade to each expansion over time? Because you the fight for Classic servers would begin all over again and push people back to private servers who prefer Classic. These are problems that need to be looked at.
---
Yeah, I'm sure it'll settle down in time. I'm aware there's always going to be dickheads, it's the internet after all. But the dude just wanted to know where to find a two-handed sword trainer, not hard to just ignore it or answer the question.
---
Sadly no.
---
As much as we don't appreciate unscheduled downtime, we don't appreciate your condescending tone either.
---
Yeah, sure. Go ahead and shit on the OP yall. He tried, he doesn't like it. You all tried BFA and you didn't like it. Jesus fuck.
---
What ui is this?
---
How about, play the game, enjoy it, be united and on the anniversary of that tweet come back at him and make him eat his words? (politely of course, but just make him look like a clueless individual).
---
Is there any news on the oce servers being down?
---
Queued, slept, woke up to character select, went to the toilet and came back to the server being down
---
No reply sadly.
---
I think you have a very different definition of automation than I do. If a human is directly controlling it, it's not automation.
---
Fuck, I would lose my mind.
---
It may sound crazy but stand out front of WC and /yell Hezrul. He showed up for me within 30 seconds.
---
Being on a pvp server, I am not racing to 60, nor am I racing my friends, I am trying to be ahead of the curve so I can get in and out of STV without getting caught up in all out war.
---
It's always been VC. Can't get it confused with DM. Even though you always reference DM with a cardinal direction... Hmm...
---
Have those too, but I still need to find them again...
---
Or maybe your saying that so YOU have less people in the queue to get in. 200iq
---
In Classic it was DM, next.
---
Yeah - WTH is this s\*\*t
---
Sadly there was no reply.
---
you get a stamina trinket each time you open it, after 10/12 (dont remember) you can combine them into a very good one.
---
Tried to level an alt last night in retail and everything just felt so empty and hollow. You just pull everything and AoE it down, the stuff they drop is irrelevant next to heirlooms, everything is just a gateway to fill a bar for 120 levels. There is no game to play really, it's all just repetitive nonsense that you want over with as soon as possible.
---
The thing is you couldn't do classic for 120 levels either. I really think the retail game is way overdue for a proper sequal instead.
---
I had someone trade me a wand for free. I ran after her yelling “wait” for ages until she whispered me to find out what I wanted. “Have a hearthstone” I say. 
---
“No thanks” 
---
:/
---
I remember in Wotlk. I leveled inscribing directly after it came out. Then when I could make the powerful spell scrolls, I looked up the price. There was no price. Put them in for 10 Gold a piece. They sold instantly. I bought tons of plants for 1g a piece (20 a stack) and made about 2000 gold until people began with price dumping.
---
It's easier to hit 120 soloing in BFA without dying than it is to hit level 10 soloing in classic without dying.
---
They’re gonna quash layers ASAP. Right now higher lvl zones are empty though well because most people are stuck pre lvl 15
---
***laughs in tailor***
---
Yeah we really don't like bots around here.
---
Massive storms in sydney at the moment. 
---
Are there servers located there?
---
bannable but cool. is it the same interval every time? get banned faster if so.
---
Not yet.
---
So what is your solution? Classic+ is probably the worse solution since blizzard cant make good content to save their lives. And how far should classic+ go? You cant just add content ontop of content in classic, since it would just break the game at some point. TBC is by far the easiest way for blizzard and the best way, the question is if forced to TBC or an option to TBC. You will fragment the community in any case. I think this all could be way simpler if Blizzard would create a dedicated good interface for old world of warcraft and actually put time into to overlay.
---
That helped! Thank you brother
---
OOOH. DERP. Looks like I've had rank 1 and rank 2 bite for some time now! 
---
Thank you so much! OOPS!
---
And since this tweet is talking about how they are the richest and how all Americans should be helped it makes more sense talking about GDP per capita than just GDP.
---
Go shadow priest.  Still have opportunity to get heaps of needed (and can still heal regular 5 mans) but also have damage of a lock
---
Go to an area that requires beast kills for a quest item, and profit. I made a killing at the farms of Elwynn.
---
move the servers down to NZ
---
aus cant run it for shit
---
Does low pop servers even excist? Last night I checked there was none in EU
---
You definitely seem like the kind of guy who is always "more into this other thing but you should still all respect my valid criticism"
---
Wowbash lives!
---
she actually was more attentive than i thought. I was doing chores and like every few seconds she would yell the next number (which i didn't tell her to do)
---
I'd heard the term i just didn't know what it meant
---
Welcome back! =D
---
My wifes boyfriend bought me some game time in exchange for some private time with my wife!! Im so excited to play!11!
---
The biggest thing for me is that the servers themselves came and went. My character could have been deleted that night. Now? I could have this character for years to come, like in retail. I can feel attachment without holding back.
---
Look man I will, I'm having a great time playing Classic atm. I just don't get why people feel the need to be complete dicks for no reason.
---
Paladins are definitely not trash you just have to know where to put your talents. Go retribution while questing to 60 coupled with the slowest 2 hander you have and you'll be fine. 
---
Once you've 60 though your only reliable option for doing raids is speccing holy and healing. They are amazing healers but if that's not your thing maybe roll again
---
They will leave or will be forced to obey the rules or banned. Keep reporting, just keep reporting.
---
are you in a raid?  
---
totems/blood pact only affect a group, not the whole raid.

What does “play better” have to do with people staying logged in afk while others sit in long queues. I’m playing on the most populated realm and I feel bad for the 20000 people trying to play while jimmy is pressing space for 16 hours while he’s at daycare.
---
The single only buff i seem to get is my own Battle Shout, and other warriors Battle Shouts.
---
It was fine at launch, but maybe 10-20 hours after launch I just simply stopped getting them, we're all the same level aswell
---
I'm running a census addon on Felstriker - Horde, but only since lastnight so the figures are incomplete. Someone else was doing Alliance side, they posted in /r/Felstriker.
---
I'd love to see some Pornhub statistics for the past hour..
---
Anyone have trouble creating a character in the oceanic servers? I keep trying and an error keeps popping up. Been randomising my names as well to make sure it’s not a naming issue
---
Hi, /u/Necromantic404

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cwx5kt/anyone_know_why_the_oceanic_realms_are_down/).

It is the end of the world... of warcraft.

which means its going to be a long long night.

There would be no incentive for players to move to the lower pop realms, and that has to happen if removing layering is ever going to be feasible.
---
Been playing rogue and haven't encountered this, not using a gouge macro, dots can break it though. I have noticed them turning, but its only when Im jump/strafe gouging, to get behind them faster, the server seems to read them as a different direction, and then turns em
---
I really isn't. Google your optimal spec and due to the dot cap most classes only use 1-3 skills. Raid bosses are also stupid easy compared to retail.
---
Grey exclamation marks mean you're level is too low.
---
you havent proven yourself worthy yet
---
Even getting my first shoulder slot felt like heaps of progression
---
playing?

WEAR IT
---
I approve of this screenshot.

zPerl (you guys remember xPerl?) is available and working atm for a Unitframes addon
---
Also bartender4 is on curseforge and works just fine atm as a replacement for your actionbars
---
Hope this helps! GL &amp; Happy Hunting
---
Congratulations she looks fantastic.
---
I'd instakick a lock from my dungeon group if he isnt sharing healthstone
---
It's amazing how in the same post you admit that Blizzard was incorrect (duh), but then follow up that you completely trust their judgement, and that we are not even worthy of discussing their grand master plan...
---
And btw, wanting to retain the most amount of players is the reason we are playing a 15 year old game, instead of the current one - the fact that they are on that mindset brings me no comfort, unlike you...
---
This time around I may roll hunter just to take the meme that is classic to the max. I'm gonna be rolling on absolutely everything. If I'm not making drama, I'm not doing it right. Also gonna be jumping those ledges like a damn superhero without dismissing and have that FD button ready.
---
I had this thought to compare classic to DnD aswell.
---
It definitely seems like classic has a LOT of inspiration from DnD.
---
A quillboar cast faerie fire on me as a rogue and I knew from Dnd that I was screwed as the spell does effectively the same thing and has the same name in classic lol
---
Indeed, I remember tanking dungeons with my group of friends as a Enhancement Shaman, which isn't even supposed to be a tank on any spec (though it weirdly does have some talents that can help with that).
---
Any word when it'll be back up or anywhere to check announcements? :(
---
Back in original Vanilla I was a human holy priest. I got invited to help heal MC at level 56, so that should tell you the level of how much you're needed.
---
I also specced Holy the entire time I leveled. You might be thinking "How many years did you take to reach 60?", but the fact of the matter is people on my server quickly learned my name. I could chain dungeon runs for 16 hours straight on a weekend. People would pay my repair bills. Yes a shadow priest can heal a lower level 5 man dungeon, but a fully specced and geared holy priest meant that dungeon was going to be a breeze. Rogues could fuck up and make all the accidental pulls they wanted and I'd just keep everyone alive.
---
I was never in want of something to do, I was never bored, and people were always excited to see me. It's really great.
---
Solo leveling in the outside world is the most tedious thing on the planet, though.
---
It is harder than your leveling speed being solely determined by how many mobs you are able to tag in a given time. There is no difference to how many mobs I pull in retail. I will always come out on top. If they had a mob per squarefoot it would do nothing to hinder a player. It would just increase their leveling speed. In classic it would mean this is an area you can't go near.
---

What you lack in numbers you’ll make up for in support, my friend!
---
You are not there to top healing, threat or damage meters. You are there to be a mother flipping holy warrior of light and good, your mere presence rallying your fellow adventures when you face down the biggest evils of the world! What would they do without your auras? Your blessings? Your sheer charisma and willpower, and golden voice over discord telling them *”You got this boys, I’ve got your back!”*.
---
And when things look the grimmest, and you need to make the ultimate decision - should I bubble hearth out of here or not? - don’t falter! Be a hero! Your sacrifice will not be forgotten! Press that divine intervention button and give your life for the team! And you win! You kill the beast! Your friends are forever grateful, and that night, and many nights to come, they will sing songs to your memory. The holy warrior who saved Azeroth.
---
That's a stretch
---
Honestly, I'm kinda happy Blizzard didn't anticipate the amount of people playing Classic, and  preemptively flood us with tie ins and ads. It's kinda a turnoff to be force fed something at every turn. Even if it is something you like.(Using Stranger Things as an example of going too far. So much damn merchandising.)
---
I was under the impression that a restart would reset the instance. Fair enough if not.
---
How is this not phasing? Why even have it, just let us play laggy servers like back in vanilla, phasing is the worst
---
You might not of done certain prequests?
---
you're welcome.
---
This crash happened the moment I went from "I'll poke my head in and check it out" to "yep I'm on the hook". Blizzard is a cruel and terrible God.
---
holy hell thats cool.
---
This is awesome, I hope more people are doing this on more servers!
---
Just more queue whining. Sorry you clicked the post expecting it to be more
---
The common thing for warlocks to do before a dungeon back in vanilla was casting soulstone on the healer and then handing everybody a healthstone. So you better make sure to have enough soulshards before joining a dungeon party.
---
&gt;PS I'm not a native English speaker so you could see some mistakes, maybe even blatant ones. Sorry for that.

Could you not?

I think it would, but dismissing it will make it a bit angrier. Depends for how long  you plan on staying afk in org/IF though.
---
It's honestly silly to not loot everything, so much money lost.
---
Felstriker, the forgotten realm :(
---
implies yet doesn’t confirm.   
---
clarity is cool.  
---
dont sweat the technique.
---
Honestly the majority of dungeons is CC + single targeting guys down,
---
A player watched me almost kill Old Murk-Eye, but let me die and didn't lift a finger to help, then finished him off to get the credit could be that evil.
---
Man just play on a different server why is this so hard
---
there were no classic oce realms!
---
So it's harder and more involved than retail then by what you're saying.
---
*Biggest, most epic queueing session
---
Yeah all of the servers are there afaik
---
Can you check the name of it please?
---
Engineering and whatever else you like the sound of
---
The worgens in mine across from the sepulcher in Silverpine did this multiple times.  It felt like a prison shower.
---
People will again find a way...
---
Ya I don't think I'll wanna be a healer in raids tbh...  What do you think about druid for dps
---
PvP is what you make of it in classic.
---
A player using lots of engineering and open world items like sleep dust has a lot more to think about and to judge than any arena player.
---
A warrior just charging and hulk smashng in Naxxramas gear with 2500 autohits can obviously can get away with more.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM1bSJm6GTE&amp;t=60s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM1bSJm6GTE&amp;t=60s) I will leave this rogue video to persuade you that classic PvP is not shallow.
---
Why are you forced to do anything I don’t get it? You can do anything while waiting including fishing or just play with them from a higher level. ???
---
So far I've met a guy that thought I was someone he knew from GW, when I said I wasn't he wished me well, buffed me and gave me 5 minor healing potions.
---
Then I met a shaman trying to grind a drop, we grouped, killed everything and he crafted me my first green item and have me some heath pots as well. Turned out I wasn't even supposed to be in that cave, I had gone to the wrong place! 
---
Such camraderie!
---
masterpiece
---
The only people who called it VC are the same breed that call a dragon "drake".
---
Lmao felt that
---
client side blizzard mostly just monitors what programs you run plus some kind of anti-cheat to try and detect if you inject code or similar.
---
However of course they could also detect patterns and such as I mentioned above and then send a report to the server with the information. The disadvantage is it might be possible to circumvent but strictly speaking it's quite easy to detect.
---
Server discords are going to happen no matter how much you hate personal reputations
---
There are servers with out it so w.e
---
The point is, in bfa it's rare that youd ever actually pull so many mobs that you die.  It's all relative on some level.  1 classic mob =/= 10 bfa mobs.  Is killing 10 that much more exciting? Not to me knowing I'm never going to pull 10 more on accident, but knowing I may just get spawned on while fighting in classic is much more "difficult" to deal with.
---
Same with night elves. :(
---
This is stupid. Delete it and go think about your poor life choices
---
The tick means the person is retarded enough to get attention.
---
Mail between your own characters is instant, just did it.
---
Yeah for now I decided to commit to 1 character, that’s on me.
---
No, Blizz needs to resolve the que times.  People are just resorting to this kind of stuff because blizz manages to mess up, yet again.
---
I do it manually. I log in, in the morning and have my husband and various family press the jump key every 20 minutes until I get home from work. No ques for me.
---
Hey, I did it today and got all 3 drops no problem. not sure what to tell you
---
Are you trying to use one of the Oceanic servers that's down?
---
I always try and save people when they're running from a chain of mobs. Sometimes they turn and we clear the pack. Other times I grab em and run out of combat. Unfortunately if my hp is low I really can't help either of us.
---
Making me cry on a Thursday afternoon RIP TotalBiscuit
---
I do not call dragons “drakes”
---
No one's even gone a single meter yet, who cares about 'moving the goal posts'?
---
I joined the top population US server just now. took 2minutes to join. people cry about the strangest things.
---
Holy paladin is the literal best single target healer in the game. You are also the absolute best class for pvp healing, so if you want to have a TON of impact in battlegrounds you can play a healer/dps dual spec. You buff warriors with blessing of freedom and they run freely destroying everyone as that negates their biggest weakness. On top of that you have cleanse, a dispel for 3 different debuffs (poison, disease, magic i believe - could be wrong) so having a 3 in 1 dispel is crazy good, you're the best defensive healer partly because of this. You can give allies immunity with bubble, and with some of the bubbles attacking is still allowed, another OP mechanic. And on top of all of this you wear plate, you are the only plate healer in the game, which means when the enemy tries to focus you down they can't even kill you, you're tank as hell compared to a priest, shaman or druid. 
---
Ret is considered not optimal for raiding, but you should probably level with it.
---
„Richest country of the world“ lmao 😂😂
---
He will be missed big F
---
Character creation is disabled as the servers are offline.
---
Yeh hope so as well, but I'm seeing a lot of names that will be changed if they stay
---
Vilken realm? Ska komma in och göra en "Hallandsposten" och låtsas vara med i ert tidnings-gäng!
---
Well.. a lot of it does
---
Because you can only talk and find with people from your own layer, thats why u got layered only once. Try the same people again today, and youll jump between the layers. I believe theres 6 layers at the moment, based on calculations.
---
There's no cross-realm support in vanilla, and there won't be in classic.
---
What is the dps addon?
---
I'm in Aus, but it won't let me make one on the NA servers either..
---
I also cant even make a character on a US server, just says character creation timed out.
---
Should we be expecting free transfers in future (hopefully soon)?
---
I think Felstriker will have the last laugh of OCE Realms... hoping it stays medium pop long term, no queues and happy days! :P
---
Because classic has so much life to it. You need people to get quests done. Just running around everywhere makes me feel like I'm apart of Azeroth. Like I live in it.
---
Blizzard is managing this problem well. It's a fucking huge undertaking to manage this release and to think all the way through to what each region might look like in 6, 12, 18 months to not leave us with dead realms.
---
Thank you for this
---
Dont bite the hand that feeds you
---
Oceanic players:
---
I think I confused my terms a bit but we’re on the same page. In retail, there is one clear ideal stat priority you want for your character to be viable for raiding. You grind and grind hoping to get close to that ideal, and every time you miss the mark you feel like you wasted time; when you get the right stats you just feel relief in not having to grind anymore. In classic, there are certainly BiS items but they have clear means of attainment, and besides that the game’s mechanics are so rough that you could feasibly create alternative builds with enough theorycrafting skill. The game becomes less about striving for an ideal and more about experimenting with stats and talents and feels rewarding when you figure something out with limited means.
---
Just posting what I’ve been told in the guild discord, more than likely its fake

---
Do t go Druid if you want to dps in raids.
---
No way. 90% of current retail players may leave. But people that resubbed just for classic will stick around much longer than that. Sure, some may drop out pretty quickly. But people like me who are just playing it casually for nostalgia probably won't even be 60 by that point. Especially if we make alts.
---
Herb alchemy is a generally good combination. You can take it on any class and be pretty ok with the results. You can even train it whilst leveling and still get a mount at 40.
---
Taking double gathering professions, usually skinning and mining/ herbalism, whilst levelling can be beneficial as it increases the amount of money you get. Even just vendoring the leather and herbs helps. You then retrain to other professions at max level.
---
Tailoring is a nice profession for mages since you can make some epic gear at max level.
---
Some pair enchanting with tailoring, but it can be annoying to find all the recipes, and it's expensive to train. I wouldn't recommend training it whilst levelling.
---
Engineering is always great, gives you a bunch of unique items and consumables, but expensive to train and use. I wouldn't recommend training it whilst levelling.
---
Blacksmithing and leatherworking don't really do anything for you as a mage, but you can still take them.
---
Just remember that you can also level first aid, fishing and cooking, and fishing + cooking can even make you money. Secondary professions are well worth the grind.
---
I'd say the original starter servers and a few ones they added after are completely safe. The rest after those are bit of a gamble.
---
Way back in the day I was levelling a horde hunter and wanted an owl pet. Corpse hopped all the way up to Teldrassil at level 10 to get it.
---
People kept telling me to go to Felwood. Well. That alt never got past level 40.

Yesterday. 22:00 GMT +2. All realms full.
---
Rise more the population cap is not enough. Blizzard has to make more regional servers
---
amazing
---
Fingers crossed!🤞
---
People act like that for every wowkiller. 
---
The issue is, that maybe this time, the famed wowkiller has appeared. Fear is out there.
---
While that is technically correct, the insanely good DPS and slow speed of Cruel Barb does not benefit hunters at all whereas it will last a lucky rogue until level 35. I feel your pain though.
---
They gave out free game time when people couldn't get in during the Warlords of Draenor launch, which was well after the merger
---
Nixxiom is the GM of Gravediggers for those that didn't know

Can't, bags always full.

I’ve seen Finalhero ingame (Faerlina). Could be someone else with the same name on a different server.

I cannot unhear Argual as the sound of an old timey car horn.

I sell Echayakee the white lion for hunters to tame 5s each.

Fingers crossed! 🤞

People are terrified of ending up on a dead server, and I don't blame them.  Just look at retail and it's graveyard of servers with a dozen or so having 90% of the population.  It's an even worse problem to run in to in Classic since leveling is such a bigger time commitment and no guarantee of realm transfers.  I am going to stick it out on Faerlina, 'only' 4 hour queues in the evening and it will only go down as more drop off.
---
Money is a lot harder to comeby in classic,   
---
Consider picking up a skill like skinning and just vendoring the stacks of leather early on.
---
google chrome remote desktop
---
Look into it. There is an app on the app store and then you need to set up your pc. Then leave your PC on (make sure to turn off sleep / turn off after x minutes from the settings). Then you will be able to remotely control it and queue up when you want. IT's quite easy and quick to do.
---
You might have accepted the Def Stance quest already, or one of the equivalent quests from Durotar/Orgrimmar (or it doesn't show anymore since you way overlevel the quest, just talk to the guy to check). The grey '!' might be for the lv20 Shield quest directing you to Camp Taurajo, it's certainly not related to the Def Stance quest.
---
Thought this would fit here.

If we lose 50% of the playerbase I still reckon we're doing better than the BFA numbers
---
You can't judge the success of Classic based on the first week, Jesus fucking Christ.
---
Both Warlords of Draenor and Battle for Azeroth had insanely successful launches that dropped off very quickly after the honeymoon period wore out a month later. It's got nothing to do with Classic at all, it's the fact that player retention for pretty much any game plummets after the first few weeks as many people just get bored.
---
This isn't like the box office where first week reception is all that matters. A MMO has to actually survive longer than that so we can all find 39 other people to fucking raid with.
---
 motw is the best (long) buff in the game!

Eh, I'm leveling one and I'm finding it enjoyable.
---
As a Paladin you get a multitude of buffs, aura, and bubbles.
---
I'm pretty much super durable and nothing really can kill me.
---
Does it take slightly longer to kill mobs than classes like Hunter / Rogue / Mage? Sure. But with the extra survivability I have much less downtime than them. 
---
I can legitimately take on two mobs of equal level without much trouble. And most fights leave me with enough health that a single heal is enough to bring me to full and I keep on going.
---
I have braved the Fargo Deep Mine, and defeated the Blood Fish at Jarod's Landing.
---
Gather, craft, sell. You'll have to fo out of your way to make g, the passive income isn't enough
---
3rd OCE PvP server has no queues either
---
Don't buy all your skills at every level, just buy needed ones.
---
Design new zones with walking in mind...
---
They just posted about opening more space on every realm, so the queues should shorten at least a little.
---
I'd pay 10 silver to watch that.  
---
Haha, just kidding.  
---
Unless..?
---
Start doing dungeons, you should also keep up with your professions. I had to postpone one spell at 15 but then started doing some RFC and it starts raining.
---
Remains to see how min/maxers will have your ass towards endgame. When even picking a race can be wrong.
---
Yes they are. Turns out if people like a product, they get in line.
---
&lt;3
---
Let's not trick ourselves. It's s game that asks for dedication. A lot. But skillwise, it is NOT a harder game. Let's call things by their name.
---
Oh man that was a good read thats the legit experiance there hahaha i hope she doesnt let that get to her not all players are like that
---
They could put that out as something optional and make it like an ascendance or something, thats the new xpack, dont like it? Thats fine stay in bfa. Lol
---
&gt;all
---
Whatever that means
---
So THAT'S how you make them...
---
How was the lag?
---
&gt; they'll probably have to reconsider removing layering any time soon. I don't care, it's the least bad option.
---
I can see Blizzard not merging realms for P2, but to split them. You already have 80% of the population permanently on a specific layer. Just port all of them over to a new server.
---
It's not easy on the technical side, but certainly would help them get into P2 without **having** to bully out many players.
---
A lot of more casual players will take a while to hit that. Remember at its peak, a much smaller percentage of active players made it to level cap than after Wrath. I didn't hit 60 til a little after BC came out. I'm interested to see how it goes either way, hoping it succeeds though.
---
Don't pay attention to streamer gold, they get handed most of it.
---
You doing this solo? What level and what dungeon?
---
Or horny furries
---
&gt;so it's not as necessary to change the default sorting.    
---
It's not that.   
---
People want to come to a thread and see what is happening now, not 8 hours ago. It's useful to have it sorted by new so you can see what is currently happening.    
---
You lose a lot of usefulness by not having it sort by new. New people to the thread will only see the old, outdated information because it's sorted by best.
---
Healing paladins will get raid spots easy though.
---
You could check out Steam Controller. It's heavily configurable with key bindigs, zones, and mod shifting. I saw people playing WoW with it. Check r/SteamController for more info.
---
Only level 9 btw :(
---
Feel like I met this guy on thrall....
---
Is this the post to write that I nearly cried when I logged in
---
I think the recently increased cap helped. Gandling had 6k ques but yesterday I only had to wait for 1100 ish to get in. The original servers still have 10k ques tho.
---
Very easily, actually.
---
ISboxer allows you to open up small screens of your other ones, making it like a mini game on your main screen.  It’s do-able up to 30 (more, if your fast) characters at once.
---
Or you can be super lazy, just wait until halfway timer, and spam click and re-cast.
---
Both work pretty well, on retail anyhow.  On classic with fishing being a bit harder, your going to have a harder time until you max each character and Ontop of that gear them for fishing.
---
&gt;If you did arena matches with 5v5, where 5 where players and the other team was all being multiboxed, the players would win almost every time.
---
I mean, that's straight up not true. There's people who got Gladiator in 5's with Multiboxing. Being able to instantly delete someone is a huge advantage.
---
Just 3 more hours to wait after you're home. Noice
---
Fuck me the moment we are able to transfer in fuckin leaving Arugal.
---
Aroooga
---
Yeah. My mates and I got the shits with the queue for Arugal and rolled alliance alts there last night. We got straight in and had a blast
---
Loot EVERYTHING and vendor it or put it in AH. Auctionator addon might help.
---
Oh man. I'm playing a horde rogue for the first time and I'm only now realising that I'm not getting one of them
---
 /cry
---
The first million are awesome wholesome posts like this. The next million are queue whiners
---
Maybe it’s all about mindset. I expect most drops on retail to be crap for me, so when I get something nice it’s a wonderful surprise.
---
You can use https://deathblind.com/alliance-leveling-guide if you want an alliance one.
---
Tell them it's 2019 lol
---
I'm enjoying it more than vanilla because I have a better attentions span and patience, and I understand the game mechanics better.
---
Just spam your pet ability or fight like a dozen mobs. It really doesn't take long to learn pet skills.
---
Easy: If Classic succeeds then the efforts of the last ten years will prove to be a failure in some people's eyes. 
---
They made everything easier and more accessible because the was "What people actually wanted"
---
If people now return to Classic en masse, it only proves that the devs were extremely wrong.
---
Vuhdo has a classic version for healing I believe
---
Right? Also, they've noted that our 4 servers are down in their breaking news announcement, but wouldn't dare specify an entire CONTINENT (lets not get pedantic about what a continent is here) is down.
---
It's just four servers. It's not an entire continent guys.
---
Maybe I should pve before I'm too invested then. But I really do enjoy the fear of being jumped when I'm levelling, makes it slightly less mindless.
---
The problem I've had with pve and playing flagged though is absolutely no one will flag before engaging you (so you are always jumped) and it's extremely rare to see someone engage in a fight they are not positive they will win.
---
It happened to me yesterday. Click select your realm and pick the same one. You don't have to wait the queue again but it reloads the character selection window. That worked for me after trying to enter the world 20 times in a row and getting the same error.
---
They are not doing a good job here. They started with just 2 pvp servers in eu english. Now there are 14, all full. That's a pretty huge misscalculation if you ask me.
---
Regarding queues I'd rather not have them and just merge servers later on if needed, so no, they are not doing a good job.
---
yeah no thanks, you wouldnt even have aus servers without us lmao
---
Sub 20 mage is useless. Mid 20's is when you pick up steam
---
Because it is bullshit that clogs the servers and has always been against the ToS.
---
Go solo or team up with other people this is supposed to be about playing with other people and not exploits that actively harm other people's ability to play. 
---
Or not, you know, just my 2c

Fuck PvP. I don’t wanna die every 45 seconds because some lvl60 wanker wants to feel cool smiting my lvl12 arse. I want to die every 45 seconds due to my own inadequacies tyvm.
---
I see. Then what do people usually do to gear a PvP character like this? Do they have a purely PvE alt on which they farm items?
---
This sounds like every IT job I have ever had.
---
Does Win10 even allow programs to check what else is running? I thought with the modern approach they try to separate programs more and only give them access to their own sandbox.
---
I don’t envy the people who have to make this decision. You could give everyone what they want: Classic+, BC, WotLK, launch servers that persist forever, and seasonal servers but you have a very fractured player base which I’m sure was a big concern with only adding classic much less these hundreds of other servers.
---
I'm slow because of work and kids and only made a lvl9 so far. Thinking of changing realm already cuz of queues, or just wait it out.
---
We jettisoned to Felstriker as it went up, couldn’t be happier with our choice.
---
WoW Classic isn't hard, my fkin sides 🤣
---
What are you even on about?
---
The server populations decreasing will be a real thing, why do you think the most stable private servers saw initial spikes and then a massive drop in players? 
---
They have fairly decent communities, some are more accomodating for groups of friends to level together, and the list goes on. 
---
The realistic stance is that WoW Classic will see a decrease in concurrent players over the next month or two. If it exceeds that, fantastic, I am not rooting for a WoW to die because I simply don't care either way. 
---
Anyrhing moderately negative about WoW Classic on this sub provokes some of the most insane responses, like your own. Please don't ever think that WoW Classic is hard, it's just a time sink.
---
because it's popular and everyone who doesn't have  a reason to like it more than bfa wants it to fail
---
I helped a rogue yesterday, healed and helped him kill the mob, then I buffed him. Then continued my own questing. 
---
As I’m killing a mob, the rogue appeared behind the mob and helped me kill it ( even though we weren’t in a group), then proceeded to give me a scroll of intellect.
---
These small social interactions are so awesome, I’m loving it!
---
&gt;sell bags man, people will buy em
---
This. Especially if you grind a bit on level-appropriate humanoids now, save some wool/linen (depending on what you can feasibly kill), and start selling them/putting them on the auction house Friday or Saturday night when people with work can really start grinding.
---
That is a pet bar, the benefit is having marginal control over your pet.

&gt;Nonsense. I have vivid memories of playing Q2 CTF 20+ years ago
---
Thats the point, internet only became widespread in Brazil by 2008-2009. You had it since the 90ties. The internet culture around here is still juvenile.
---
I know how expansions work. But how would that work if there was both classic+ and TBC servers? That’s two different games, like classic and retail.
---
You lost me here:
---
&gt;When WoW first came out, a large number of WoW players were in their early teens. At that time, they had to go to school, some homework but mostly a lot of free time.
---
This is not true. The majority of WoW players were adults. I don't know why Blizzard continues to perpetuate that Classic was filled with teens / kids with lots of free time on their hands.
---
Most people were in their mid to late 20s and beyond.
---
Twitch app or just straight up google the name of it. That's what I do, at least
---
Idk how they gonna get people to play the retail from
---
This point on
---
Open your spellbook, drag Tailoring onto your action bar, left click it, select what you want to craft and click craft.
---
Yeah should be easy mode.
---
I'd definitely look up dungeon info on classic.wowhead or something, but once you know where to go just join a group and you'll learn fast
---
I am from the Philippines and play at US Pacific servers because I know that OCE servers are shit. So many SEA players thinking that OCE is fine but it's not. We seriously need SEA servers atleast 2 for Classic and another 2-4 for Retail. Until then I am sticking to the well maintained US servers. Ping is around 150 so it's not all bad for me.

I've been making and selling linen bags for cheap in Razor Hill and Bloodhoof Village. It sparks up great RP opportunities as well.
---
&gt; Beyond Accounts being free 
---
You can't play WoW Classic without an active subscription, so multiboxing will not be free.
---
A mob only has 16 slots for debuffs, in a raid of 40 people you have to prioritize which one you want up there. 
---
Since one warlock alone uses multiple slots you'll be limited, tank debuffs and +dmg debuffs are more important.
---
Contact Houston and ask.
---
Nothing wrong with that
---
Easily if you outlevel them and have good gear, in this conditions you could even farm some mobs in the raids
---
As a rogue if I see someone fighting 2 mobs I always kill 1 and gouge the other
---
Thing about WOD and BFA is that they both came off the back of a relatively successful expansion.
---
Mists and Legion were both rather popular, at least compared to the expansion that preceded them. This then gives people a high expectation on future expansions so they're more likely to buy and try, only to find out a month later it kind of sucks.
---
At this point every second expansion (starting with Cataclysm as the "second") WoW has should be considered controversial at best. Chances are the follow-up to BfA will be flat out amazing as Blizzard conveniently learns everything that players wants and implements it with minimal flaws.
---
"I like to play with my friends, but they don't play as much as me. I'm way better and dedicated than them. These friends suck because they can't keep up. I can't stand how slow my friends are, so this game sucks because I have to play alone."
---
How about less of 'me' and more of 'them'?
---

---
Shh don't tell them.

Uhh what? I raided classic with a top guild and all these people saying it was "easier" the mythic raiding are wrong. The amount of prep work required for these raids was significantly more intense AND having to raid with 39 other people though fun was very difficult sometimes. Considering the fact that all of this was before a lot of guides and even DBM was around, it made things way more difficult. Also the amount of coordination required for certain fights with 40 people was incredibly tasking at times. MC was easy, Onyxia sure. Once you got to the end of BWL things started getting interesting.. opening AQ40 was a huge grind, farming nature resist gear to kill one boss was a pain in the ass.. the trash going to the last boss always put you to sleep because it was awful. Naxx was fun, stitches sucked, both dance bosses sucked, farming shadow pots was horrible, and the horseman fight broke up tons of guilds. Oh and have fun with DKP and potentially having to roll against 5 other people of the same class for that upgrade you need. With that being said Vanilla was great overall tho, and I hope you all enjoy it like I did.
---
its around #25 in nz
---
It was so much fun day one.  My friends and I ran straight from Ironforge to Teldrassil, to work on Nelf rep for the mount.  When we got to Menethil, we were 100% sure we were the first people on this server to set foot in the Harbor....then we saw a level 1 Rogue parked on the boat already.  
---
We danced with each other, joked that he got world first, etc.  
---
Then we kept seeing the guy - doing quests outside Darnasuss - hey dude!  Turning in quests in Darnassus - hey dude!!  Then in Auberdine again - same guy!
---
That's what I like about Classic.  In BFA you will basically never see a person again, because a "server" is actually a collection of many realms, with a shitload of people phasing in and out of your existence at any given time.
---
Druid and Paladin: you picked the only 2 "Jack of all trades" supporting classes. If you want core raid DPS, other classes are far more suited.
---
But gain no class is trash as a whole. Each just has its own roles or niches it performs best, unlike retail where every class can do everything.
---
You might not be raiding as much as you might expect if youve never played classic before. Also, don't discount the leveling experience. Thats a major part of classic and both druid and pally are outstanding in dungeons and group content. Just have fun!

Then they opened a 4th and it is still sitting on low pop.
---
Banned for anti afk attempt is my guess
---
Also the original servers (which are now the fullest) are the ones filled with people who had demonstrated some level of heightened interest in the game by reserving character names as soon as they could. This also bodes well for the long-term strength of that server’s community.
---
reinstall bnet man
---
Meanwhile I resurrected someone in the barrens, healing him to full and even buffing Him only to go oom and pull two patrolling mobs, and he runs off and doesn’t say a word and leaves me for dead 🙃
---
All of the above
---
thank you for this.
---
Bad. Just bad.
---
i was doing quests in the barrens today before the servers crashed and i noticed this warrior called isfraael, he was struggling to kill a lvl 12 plane strider at level 15. i walked over to offer him help but he spoke in some weird slurred bogan language and i gave up. some people and video games just dont match. good video
---
Get bags, loot everything you can to vendor, don't waste gold on item upgrades while leveling.
---
reading r/classicwow is work, no? Otherwise i'm screwed...
---
 Could you link to the classic add-on? Can’t find it.

PvP really just starts in phase 2 I guess....

Does the adjusting of layering happen automatically or is it manually? And what is 'sharding' by comparison?

---
this exactly.
---
I heard there was a maintenence to add server space planned? maybe it crashed and they thought fuck it lets get it done now?
---
did ya not knew it skeeter?
---
That’s a terrible argument and not only is it fallacious it’s incredibly short sighted. 
---
If they had released a ton of servers from the start, people would have merged towards a handful of realms regardless. This happened in classic before there was this incredible level of dead realm anxiety that seems to be happening right now. Go look for yourself, when the game launched they quickly had to release the Free Character Migration systems because realms were full and others empty. In the days leading up to classic launch the forums were full of horror stories about being stuck on a dead realm. 
---
Also, not anticipating a decent chunk of the population leaving the game at some juncture is like seeing a couple that met at a concert who have been together for 2 days and assuming they will be married with kids in the future. 
---
This is the honeymoon phase. People have got to experience all of the good classic brings and none of the bad. 
---
The herd will thin. More servers weren’t the answer in classic and thy weren’t the answer now.
---
he was probably just tanking for the group. warriors have it very rough levelling and they are meant to use 2handers. also agility is good for them
---
All of the above, plus a healthy dose of social interaction
---
Having a full tier set out of MC in 20 runs isn’t realistic is it? You get one drop per class and up to 8 of your class in the raid.
---
Yes that’s the thing ain’t it. I’m hoping I can do the same but on a OCE server...I see a number of old mates/players/guildies playing classic so.....fingers crossed.
---
Do you expect him to do quests with a shield?
---
The point is, leveling is much harder in classic compared to retail. There is no skill required to level in retail. And  leveling 1-120 still takes a long ass time as well if you don't have heirlooms and xp pots n shit. You also need to invest a lot of time in retail if you want to have success at the highest levels. Because getting to max level isn't really "'success'" in classic or retail. And to say that investing time into something isn't difficult is kind of a farce as well. Most successes in life require a significant time investment. Just because something takes time, patience and perseverance doesn't mean its easy or takes no skill. Its just a different kind of skill.
---
So I am trying to figure out what to play, I am going to be on a PvP server (I will only be doing PvPing). I was going to roll Druid as that was the first class I picked back in BC up until I stopped playing in Legion yet I noticed they're pretty trash for PvP in Vanilla. So I was thinking either Shadow Priest or Frost Mage as they seem the best for PvP.
---
Im PvP flagged, but on a PvP server, turned it off now to see if it'll work

Hah, my walker has the same name!
---
&gt; Will I enjoy the leveling of rogue compared to warriors?
---
Both are difficult to level compared to other classes (warrior being the worst), as in enjoyment: highly depends on what you want but I personally like rogues more in regards to low level gameplay.
---
So instead of a population spread over 3 PvP servers, now we have 1 heavily overpopulated server, 1 mildly full server and 1 low population server. No matter what, 1 PvP server was always going to be too small, and now people who planned beforehand need to reorganize their entire group to move to a new server.
---
It's just you. I'm on a server with a queue and there are literally hundreds of people in the barrens in just the crossroads, to the point it's lagging like crazy and impossible to quest.
---
Rezzing a player who just died, healed him to full, and buffed him before pulling two mobs and him running away, leaving me for dead. 
---
Good times
---
Yeah same
---
you can buy brown from vendor at 5s. It's not much if you farm some mobs, skin them and vendor sell the skins. You can easily have 4 bags in 30-45 minutes, which is worth investement.
---
until you have an earthquake and the servers are even more screwed
---
Fear Of Missing Out
---
Tell you what though if anyone could do it it’s lock. If you can handle threat well you can juggle mobs between voidwalker tanking and fearing while burning them down one at a time. Feels great every time.
---
If you want. It's much of a muchness really, if you want to squeeze every last copper you can invest in leatherworking.
---
Did the same thing just before the server's went offline. A mage died doing the Serena Bloodfeather quest. I wasn't quick enough to heal him in time, but being a 20+ druid i couldn't hit that battle res fast enough. If anyone has died doing that quest, the run is brutal. Anyway he in turn said message me anytime you need wool bags (he was a tailor) with just the mats.  This game is just something else
---
This is fucking quality. I'm gonna steal this for my shitposting groups
---
I’m not a coder but maybe we’re having trouble because we’re IN the OCE? Not just the servers down but our access too? I’m the same I’ve been waiting all day for a space in the RPPVP in US and now I can’t even create my char :’)

Fear of missing out

No.

Yeah lets see how it looks in 2 days, when the bid is actually over.

Yojamba STRONG
---
Oh hell naw, Classic is definitely harder, and I proved it to myself yesterday by rolling up the same HUman Warrior I made on Classic on Stormrage Retail.  No heirlooms, just quest rewards, mob drops, and crafted items.
---
Classic, one mob takes almost 30 seconds, and you're at nearly half-health by the time you're done.  ALso it took at least four or five hours to get to level 10.
---
Live?  Mobs barely dip you to 3/4 of your HP.  They die in two or three Slams.  Greens drop all over the damn place.  *I soloed seven Gnolls that were at my level and never died thanks to Second Wind.*  And then I hit 10 in about an hour in a half of playing.
---
Classic is definitely hard mode.
---
OCE had one PVP realm initially when my guild set up. Didn't really get a choice there buddy. But great advice. Thanks man. Blizzard is doing an awesome job because **I** can move server from the broken af server everyone I know is on. 
---
Oh wait, OCE servers are down right now. Can't even do that.
---
I haven't started classic yet but will be picking a subscription up next month. My friends and I have already assigned professions so we don't unecessarily have the same profession in our group twice. And everyone helps with mats and gets crafts in return. I love our little group (we all know each other irl), one of them was even my best man at my wedding xD
---
Since I'm not playing yet due to work, they are already saving gear for me (and my name) for when I start &lt;3 I'm doing classic, easy mode xD
---
They did a good job of always having a server with a very low or no queue around. So there is always some place to play.
---
My friend is a statistician and he told me.
---
As a hunter I feel bad for never giving anything back and stealing all enemies.
---
Did the same thing last night for hours...
---
Hours wasted. The market velocity is crazy at the moment.
---
I need something to do though
---
THIS! Our guild will all have it then.
---
Is this rs3?
---
&gt; How did they botch the launch?
---
surely 10 servers are enough right guys?
---
thats why tbc was best expansuon. It had  old rpg elements with playable specializatuon
---
No. Even at the lower levels BfA is shitting items left and right.
---
Imo found the fire one way harder. 
---
Took make ages to find it. Kept going back to Durtar orc Spawn.
---
I was referring to the fact that you're reposting something and the image quality is abysmal.
---
Thanks for this!
---
Actually, rogues aren't gear dependent. Eviscerate isn't dependent on stats, hitting like a truck whether or not you're using a worn dagger or Dal Rends. There are many videos on YouTube demonstrating rogue dominance, even while naked. You may be interested in giving them a look!

Hi, /u/billybobfranklin

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cwxf7i/how_it_feels_trying_to_play_classic_on_an/). 
---
Fear of missing out?
---
My guild was planning on rolling on Arugal, but only 2 of our 30+ group were able to get in. So we rolled on Yojamba and it's been at high/full every since we logged in. Its the perfect size now.
---
Ahmpy fell back after his break for much needed sleep
---
You're like comparing a few bad situations on your realm to a few good threads on reddit
---
Nah not that I can see. Nothing on twitter and realms still down.
---
Something something Bonnie &amp; Clyde
---
Isfraael would struggle with level 12 planestriders in retail tbh
---
Kill warlock, sit on top of dead body waiting for them to pop SS. Kill them again
---
Sydney.
---
I haven't seen a single queue but I picked a low pop server, is that going to hurt me in the long run? 
---
I'm a very casual player with no endgame ambitions
---
My gf has decided that she wants a buzzard as her first hunter pet, and specifically it has to be the brown ones from Westfall. The guild is gearing up to take a roadtrip to Westfall tomorrow to escort her to her buzzard, oh and she is a Troll and we are on a PvP server. :|
---
It's going to be an odyssey of epic proportions to the point of highest Alliance population on the server, but we are determined to make it work... somehow!
---
But that’s stealing! 😱
---
(I also stole it from fb 🤭)
---
Meanwhile my friend just made almost a gold because people were putting stuff on the AH below vendor price XD
---
thx alot!!!!
---
This was driving me crazy, especially with the error speech.
---
Isolated it to the Details addon and this option. When disabled the errors stopped right away. I posted a ticket on the developers curseforge
---
I got my collectors edition in a box somewhere in the basement
---
But then you lose the ability to play with all the other people you know. I'm not looking to play multiple characters across different realms.
---
I googled a bit and it seems that 1 scrap sells for 7c and one light leather for 15c. You need 3 scraps for 1 leather.
---
While i think these comments about people not knowing what they want are stupid. I also think that people who claim they were already proven wrong are not exactly clever too. Launch hype is the phase of "You think you do", "but you dont" will be when after a few months are realms are low pop. I dont think thats gonna happen, but we dont know the future so nobody was proven wrong yet.
---
druid was kegit during tbc as tank.
---
Haha, struggle is real!
---
Honeymoon period and the definition of success differs from person to person but my mark is the 1, 6 and 12 month lines. What Blizzard need for Classic tobe financially successful is much different than what a player might want.
---
Generally speaking, games tend to suffer from player loss after 4 weeks or so from game launch. MMO's in particular often fare better because players seem to understand MMO's are grindy by nature and "good things take time".
---
Virtually every other major MMO that tried to compete with WoW ultimately went bust or went free-to-play 6-12 months after it launched. That's why the 6 and 12 month mark are my measure.
---
The bar should be retaining at least 150,000+ players by the end of the year because that's what Nostalrius supposedly had in 2016 (active users, not registered which is a meaningless number because anyone could register for nothing).
---
I fully expect Classic WoW to maintain those numbers easily. I'd be seriously impressed if Classic managed to maintain 1 million active users for more than a year, though. That's competing with Destiny 2 at that point.
---
I do not think Classic will ever reach it's sustained peak of 4 million back in 2006.
---
It kinda works for guild wars because the end game is mostly cosmetic stuff and there are alot of stats that just don't exist in wow
---
You can only make so many different item sets with the amount of different stats you have
---
There would quickly be no point in farming new gear
---
As a big Fire Emblem fan I think I'll get this addon as soon as I'm able to play the game.
---
In general wpvp would be nice if all mmorpgs started having them more again, I never liked bg like stuff much in any mmo.
---
No one buys accounts nowaday
---
WoW isn’t hard. It’s inconvenient. There’s a difference. Vanilla requires time not skill to be good. Although it’s less feel bad than BFA because Vanilla doesn’t care when you spend it, whereas BFA wants you to spend an hour a day.
---
There are crazy people out there ...
---
Water is not that bad, as you can do it bot by bit while questing.
---
Unending air
---
totally with you !
---
"Yet to be seen" is a problem. Oldschool Runescape was extremely popular on it's launch ib 2013. After a month of 3 the population dropped to 1/5th and kept dropping hard, untill Jagex suddenly released a content update, something that was not really supposed to happen. Ever since that first update the population has been increasing.
---
People came for the nostalgia, but quit as soon as they figured there is no future. This is also a game where you invest 1000hrs building a character. If Classic doesn't show signs of content updates it'll go down the same route.
---
Wait! That Isn’t  the proper reddit etiquette?
---
This is the ideal classic lobby. You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.
---
Same friend. Desperate to relive the dungeon memories of old but have to wait til the weekend :(
---
Have you met a harpy?
---
I've got 2 macros so far. /wave and /train because social interactions!
---
Touché
---
Undead here, I got one. Not hard at all (got two drops in 10 min). You just have to swim a bit.
---
Pro tip if you're a warrior (tank) or druid (feral): make your own group and only invite casters.
---
Why do you assume he’s doing that to be manipulative. I know tons of people who talk about things they don’t know because they for whatever reason have an opinion on it.
---
I think you think he’s thinking too many steps ahead trying to give opinions on things to get a certain reaction from viewers. I get the impression that when he’s not being sarcastic he’s just a passionate guy to a point where he talks about stuff he probably doesn’t know enough about. 
---
So in other words call him an idiot, but I don’t think he’s disingenuous or some kind of manipulative mastermind playing the “humans are mirrors” game
---
more or less. Fewer female trolls in Durotar, though.
---
The feels. I think I forget to really point it out, but yeah the random disconnects are not okay and do need to be fixed.
---
Sounds like a sweet boy. I am the doucheman stealing mobs from everyone and wanting you to die so i can get the boss/quest enemy
---
Before trying private classic server I 100% thought it was nostalgia as it usually is. However classic is just a lot of fun, mind you I've never played vanilla

---
This is what makes WoW Classic Great...this nightmare fuel.
---
Hey what does that have to do with anything
---
Same
---
My server had a queue one time at like six pm 2 days after launch, not a big deal
---
None loo
---
Still a weekend
---
&gt;How do you propose you feed it video instead of a single frame? Video is just a series of single frames.
---
Exactly, most of the papers I've read upon your advice have treated a single image as a single input sample, with no elements in the architecture for temporal features.
---
&gt;I'd imagine even the good ass machine would struggle unless you are running a dgx. Besides do you know how to reverse engineer the (any) game client to hook your capture -&gt; net -&gt; replace pipeline? If not oh boy you're gonna have some considerable overhead that will cause some nice frame drops.
---
I hope you get what a 
---
&gt;Hobby
---
means, I'm not marketing this as god's super sampling tool. I'm just doing this for fun, I'm not selling this to blizzard or to my local grocery store, not that It's gonna work out at all.
---
&gt;This is simply not true. They train it on each individual game and still the results so far are sometimes decent but often very bad.
---
Well, sadly while looking at their page for it, no information relating to this information was found at all. Could you link me to the source? must be an interesting read.
---
It's always Sydney for servers, idk what he is on about. Syndey is the beat place for them and every game always goes there.
---
Works for me. Must be a conflicting addon or smthn?
---
BfA is a lot smoother and slicker in comparison. They sanded off all the edges, but so much got lost in the process.
---
IIRC yes
---
mistakes were made
---
They have to be in your party
---
Rogues have a much higher skill ceiling than almost any other class. 
---
There really isn't much you can do as a Warrior or Paladin that adds much complexity to the game or to your class, it's very binary.
---
No, I was correct at the time of posting  my comment, even.
---
How about stop looking for 12 hour hold posts with less than 20 upvotes and less than 30 comments to incorrectly correct people??? Like wtf lmao
---
Your post history is hypocritical at best, likely a troll or just stupidly forgetful.
---
That's pretty much my mentality too, since it's not like I'm not gonna play it. I just don't expect to do much if I get to 60 and I know what it was like.
---
My bar might be lower than other peoples though, I don't know. I expect Classic to keep at least 150,000 monthly players by the end of the year because that's what Nostalrius did in 2016.
---
I don't expect Classic to do much better than that unless Blizzard ignore the purists and, like Old School RuneScape, add new content. Whether you agree with that or not, the reality is OSRS is insanely popular not just because RS3 alienated tons of veterans unlike anything WoW has ever done but because they were prepared to change and add things based on popular vote, and vote players did.
---
that’s pretty manageable luckily - i’m in western aus so pings are 220 - 250 (or at least used to be before i had fibre)
---
I'm not sure of any addons but mages have a really good focus target sheep macro. I'd share it but cant on mobile atm just look up what I typed on google and it should pop up
---
Unfortunately it's impossible to say but the first announced servers should theoretically be "safest" in regard to population / longevity.
---
Oh whoops, it was supposed to say 32 silver. The bags aren't quite that expensive.
---
Thanks so much of doing the hassle of finding this out, was driving me crazy, thought it was trying to cast something somehow and was worried about pulling extra shit.
---
Cool ty
---
Yeah but you actually get time off unlike americans
---
Oger would be perfect, just shave Kultirans and rename them.
---
Is the trinket there right now? Not something that doesnt come til the pvp patch?
---
Just trash retail wow. I stopped play wow after Wotlk because of the downfall in quality. Now I'm back baby!
---
you dont need to wake up early if you just dont go to sleep.
---
Ok stay poor it doesn't hurt my feelings
---
Bloodthirst in classic in a flat amount I believe, and its low, it also had a cooldown, and getting rage is also low,
---
you might say they are difficult in PvP because you have to constantly gauge if you should be tanking, healing, or dealing damage - but your gear and spec will likely reduce the headache and let you focus on a single style
---
Fair enough.
---
They basicly said that either was on the table depending on what people think. Although I agree BC is more likely, also because they said with the ground work of classic remaking BC would be quite easy.
---
i've literally never even seen a queue. remulos oceanic.
---
It’s always been DM, only ever heard VC much later in the cycle. 
---
Like stated before most people who ever called it VC came along later, and decided that using the boss initials made sense? 
---
For most players it would be months before they even found out dire maul was a thing, even then a bit didn’t. While deadmines is and was probably the most iconic dungeon, being  the first step into instanced play we all saw in vanilla. 
---
This has always been my hill to die on since late vanilla/early BC. Here we are yet again.
---
That's a bit dramatic. There are several servers with no queues.
---
Yojamba is where it's at brother
---
What is that addon on the right giving you hints?
---
Even greys turn to copper.  Shit adds up, eventually.
---
Me when accidently launching retail....
---
Does it still cost $20 to change server? It would almost be worth that to me if I could never play. Then just pay the $20 to switch back if other servers do drop in pop.
---
After typing that out I think that probably was blizzards intention for some $$$
---
Literally no one forced you to play on launch.
---
You could have easily avoided all of this by waiting a couple of weeks before playing.
---
No queue times on Hydraxian Waterlords.
---
ores were so cheap on the auction house yesterday, i was literally making a profit from vendoring bronze pants. got blacksmithing from 80 to 127 for free
---
Tougher then Priest?
---
This was on a rpvp realm?
---
Dying over here because I just showed my girl this episode last night lol
---
I'm on Zandalar, feels like every inch of the game has a person in it scrambling to tag a mob. 
---
I think the cities are kind of quiet, but that's because everyone is out in the world.
---
No queue times when the realm has gone down :)
---
Remember we can't all hold our breath as long as the forsaken any more. Unending breath is a valuable buff to collect bread from underwater chests.

---
my brother, the same here :D
---
Yeah I have the same issue with my character on Bigglesworth too :S kinda annoying.
---
Narrator: The warrior did.
---
It also had flying mounts and the worst attunements the game has ever seen.
---
And a 15minute monologue from Kael'Thas everytime you pulled him.
---
And SL/SL Warlocks.
---
OCE didn't have multiple servers to begin with, we didn't have a choice to move to a low pop before the game came out, or even for a while after. Now there are multiple, they've filled up too. Sure, the US realm overpopulation maybe couldn't have been predicted, but not giving OCE more than one option to begin with was a downright oversight that shouldn't have happened.
---
I've heard in a shaman guide that up to lvl 40 the most efficient combo is a slow 2H weapon + Rockbiter. So my advice is to go with a stave (they're pretty easy to come by in the early quest rewards). Try to use it from the beginning to increase your weapon skill as you level.
---
Dragons call EU. Was medium is now full. Mostly 5k with 45 minutes
---
I don't think it's harder, but engaging is the right word.
---
In BFA I can do M+ and read reddit while spamming a rotation of buttons.
---
In Classic I feel I need to pay attention to avoid patrols, watch my health and mana, watch my timing of abilities.
---
[Me getting home from work to find this shit.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/461/623/b21.png)
---
Guess someone isn't getting there reputation!
---
Its not worth it quest items have like 2dps lower. People waste so much money, how will they afford mount?
---
One of the items I'll keep in my bank forever are those leather pants in the NE starting area you get from a quest. They look SO hilarious on male Nelves.
---
Nope. Back in time we there battling at tarrens mill like hell. You can just opt in or out. But out only after like 5minutes i believe.
---
We're talking tier and other gear for BiS. Not all tier 1 pieces are BiS and by the time you're running MC for the 20th time you won't be needing anything most likely.
---
20 might not sound a lot but that's 5 months of raiding and that is a lot.
---
I just loot everything and sell it to vendor. Except for decent gear (I am level 17) which I auction for silver on the side or sell to people straight up. I noticed farming one area of easy to kill enemies around your level is a good way to both get exp and items to sell so you are still progressing while you make change.
---
This is the best thing I read all day, thanks XD
---
Added more slots kek
---
Well, it's an easy math. 3x scrap is 21c, 1 light leather is 15c (same amount of scrap). 
---
I'm going to do this anyway as I picked up skinning and leather working so we'll see how many spare mats I actually have to vendor.
---
Meh each to their own. Mindsets like that are why gay marriage was a big issue. People like different things :)
---
I agree there are many downsides to playing on the most popular realm including the cue times. I wasn’t complaining bout the queue times but offering a solution to an apparent problem. Pearsonally I haven’t had to deal with the queue simply by loging in at 4 am when there is no queue and playing for long stretches before logging off. The queue is moving extremely slow because players are idle in rested zones using various means of staying logged in.
---
I disagree, classic comes with the subscription. Like it or not a lot of players right now are just players that want to try out what this all amazing classic was. Not seeing a downfall in players in the near future would be kind of ignorant. I rather have blizzard thinking a lot of players will leave and be wrong than having a lot of empty servers later on.
---
*Chodesickle*
---
Brilliant!
---
People keep saying move servers to a less populated one. 
---
There wasn't a server on OCE under 4k queue at 8pm last night. 
---
Blizzard fucked up.
---
What I do (which some people might think is scummy) is for example today I worked from 10am-4pm and I used chrome remote desktop app to control my phone and queue from work and so when I got home I only had to wait for like 1k queue
---
lol, are you talking about the internet? you sound classy. "Listen to men listen to me". man, that ego.
---
Weapon training for my warrior, 10s each. My last repair bill alone was 6s. Choosing to spend money on cooking recipes over skills. I had to bum a few copper off someone to afford a flight path home :/
---
I mean, Do you still think it could be true?
---
I swapped from 2H mace to 2H sword at level 13 and that felt rough to skill up. Imagine doing it at, say, level 45.
---
Where can I get ahold of Wool as a horde player? I'm lvl 15 mage, but I can't seem to find the wool anywhere and I'm not sure where to head first when I get a high enough lvl
---
Thanks man
---
&gt;Free transfers
---
Thats it. We're good right there. Let the players look at the queues and fix it.
---
High to low causes people to go "ewww, *low pop* someone else will move"
---
As shitty as it sounds, that seems to be the best option.
---
People who dont care about "low" will go low. People who want a higher pop but full is too much will roll med/high. Itll fluctuate and cool down once everyone gets to where they want to be with their crew.
---
I totally understand the demand as I am a priest and currently making lesser wands to sell but where do our BUYERS get the money? The only economy seems to be Bags and Wands
---
I think you're mixing something up, Shadowmourne was obtained in WotLK. (Not class restricted)
---
The real bfa
---
 I use bandage all the time and it always goes on me, whether I have something targeted or not, idn what to say
---
You draw in one breath, and utilise that breath and it's oxygen for an "unending" amount of time.
---
Cease breathing is asphyxiation. You are drawing in nothing.
---
Shoulda just said you were high man
---
That was my personal favorite moment so far, fighting the Burning Blade in the cave outside Orgrimmar. My friend and I barely 2v2'ed a couple of mobs there and on Discord we were like "Well the odds were even, so we came out pretty well there!"
---
We'd almost died 2v2 against normal enemies. How much of an experience is that.
---
32g lmao, the bill gates of azeroth
---
All OCE servers are down, I'm so upset :( but also there is layering on the servers so you only see a layer of total players apparently.
---
Where can I find that leaderboard?
---
Legend!
---
You can setup a macro keyboard to just move a few steps or cast a spell every 5 minutes. I highly doubt this is detectable or even against the tos.
---
It happened to me lastnight. Also seemed to have lost access to my character on the Skeram server.  
---
And unable to create anything new on the other servers, due to a time out.
---
It’s definitely worth spending precious silver on bags so you can hold more trash to vendor, they will pay for themselves pretty quickly.
---
Solid advice, thank you! I've been buying them all like a madman. They get quite expensive
---
Get ready for 5 hour queue
---
Probbaly an addon, the question is which one.
---
I remeber playing with aussies and losing our tank for the night from storms :(
---
I agree with your post...buuut in order to play Classic you NEED to pay.
---
Holy shit I did not know this
---
My son's stuff tend to be "so last week" from one second to the other...
---
Bro every tailor and their mom will make you these for “something something 6 linen something something tips appreciated”
---
Everyone goes at their own pace heh
---
Oh cool ok. But is there an app or apk that can let you map them on your phone touch screen?
---
I had my first death yesterday, after grouping with someone for a quest. They ran in headfirst, pulled 3 mobs instead of the one they hoped, and then ran around like a chicken pulling 4 more before he died. 
---
Fun times!
---
Could you please tell me name for the item? I want to google how to get this one.
---
Or you can write a mini guide, but I can search for myself
---
Shot clipping is definitely still a thing. Try loading up your auto shot and casting arcane shot/serpent sting straight after (before the autoshot goes off).
---
I see what you did
---
Hey. Haven't played since cata. How much gold does a token cost and how many tokens do I need to buy playtime?
---
Blue checkmarks lmao
---
I get it, I do. But all our realms have these queues and issues now... Unless you get up in the morning and pop yourself into the queue, go about your business for 5 hours and come back, you won't get to play no matter which OCE realm you pick.
---
Take em to the top boys!
---
I can annoy enough people in general chat til they quit
---
Bandages sell? Damn. I thought the whole market was just Bags and Wands
---
I introduced vanilla WoW to my SO a year or two back, through private servers, and they had so much fun always nagging me to go back and play more. We only got to lvl~45, but made friends and lits of great memories.
---
It proved for me that there's something great there, something forgotten in most of todays titles, and I suspect it's the grind (and difficulty); everything feels so "earned".
---
We warlocks come into our own when we save you 15 minutes running across Azeroth:)
---
I even re rolled a few times until I got attached to a character! Enjoy it, it’s a journey not a destination
---
Lolll
---
classic should just take the OSRS route. problem solved.
---
I just want a leather belt +4 str +4 stam
---
That is fucking brilliant.
---
And when you choose to walk instead of paying for a 1 silver+ flight path.
---
I would def download if it had that. Yes.
---
Its used to turn in for a quest.
---
There are many times it is impossible to just pull one mob or there is an item you need to grab with many mobs around.  I sometimes have to CC and kite while trying to use everything I can to kill off the guys before all my CCs are on cooldown or I run out of mana (mage) and I die.  That is just one example.  I have to strategize and think to get things done without dying multiple times and just wasting a ton of time or making no progress at all.  
---
In retail I can literally close my eyes and mash random keybinds until the whole room is dead without going below 95% health/mana.
---
This isn’t just a WoW problem though, it is a problem in most games these days.
---
The game itself was pretty good, but things like using skills or looting.. god.. took a few seconds to loot anything. But TIL (ok it was yesterday) what that sentence in the Classic Guides mean. They always wrote things like "It replaces your autoattack" and I was confused what they mean.. yea, looks like they LITERALLY mean that.  So it looks like that one skill simply "amplifies" your next autoattack, so you do more damage and generate more threat.
---
I am so used to Rogue, where you could time your sinister strike right after an autoattack or other games where you could do some fancy autoattack resets (league of legends for example), that I haven't expected something else.
---
&gt;There's a reason we used to joke about how half a 40man raid was AFK on /follow.
---
It's not a joke. Our bottom half of the raid had the same combined performance as the top 3dps and top 1 healer.
---
17 dps doing what 3 competent dps were doing, and 3 healer healing as much as 1.  
---
They were only useful for buffs and damage sponge. And we still went as far as 6/9 AQ40 and 12/15Naxx
---
I did the same thing years and years ago, when i first started back in BC. I rolled a warrior, i saw a druid shoot a ball of wrath. I was like :O HOW DO YOU DO THAT?!?
---
The idea that different classes have unique spelle blew my mind, so this guys question brings back a wave of nostalgia and reminds me that we all start somewhere.
---
Loving classic more every minute i spend in it :)
---
There is no increase except dmg! So no reason to cast a lower rank
---
Let's all point and stare and laugh, children.
---
I mean I died like 30 times before level 10.
---
All were on purpose though, poor man's teleport to goldshire or logging camp.
---
Arugal OCE. Eh like anywhere from 2 hours to 6. :(
---
5 minutes until you have to requeue
---
They didn't want to miss out
---
When you voluntarily logout you have about a minute to get back in

We're getting it on OCE servers right now. Just waiting for them to announce 3 days free game time for the inconvenience.
---
I wouldn't mind if there weren't some group of friends there
---
Tried this, it only shows my HP, not my target's.
---
Any fix on this?
---
Wakanda, yomama, yogabagaba, yolonda, abumbah = yojamva realm.
---
All I have to give at the moment, as a lock, is unending breath.  But hey, I gave it to someone tonight and they immediately jumped into a small pond and lurked in the water for a bit.
---
At least he probably farmed 3 levels and could move past those quests
---
If you’re very casual, absolutely not.  Honestly chances are your server won’t stay low pop anyway.
---
I had to mute a few people on Mograine barrens though. Nonstop edgy chat, going on about things like infinite genders and Islam
---
What if it was an AutoHotKey script you wrote yourself? Is AHK a bannable offense?
---
When I run past mobs people are killing, as arms warrior, I swing!
---
made a slight adjustment to throw in a hunters mark on pet attack.
---
selects nearest target\[if a target is already selected it will attack this instead\],sends in pet,casts mark and casts pet ability.
---
works nicely, thanks for macros

I played 1 server. It became full and unjoinable so I created another character and started again, that then became un joinable and now night 3 I have no servers to play
---

---
Only problem is, it makes it all the harder to actually leave and go to work.
---
&gt;If a game expects you to do 1 thing, and if you don't do that you die, is harder than a game that expects you to do 10 things, but if you don't do any of those it doesn't punish you.
---
but retail raids expect you to do a shitload of things and are also extremely punishing.
---
Yup that's the one. Got fucked by those quite a few times
---
I am from NZ and I laughed so hard @ this 10/10
---
Wait, you've been vendoring it? I stashed it in the bank like some weird hermit assuming it's gonna be worth something later.
---
Lovely but I fear our server will be even more full now as a result , with people who have no respect for the RP naming rules. You don't have to role play (I don't personally) but you still have to respect the naming rules,  there has been a massive influx of immature disrespectful players from full pvp servers which is what a lot of us came to this server to avoid. I do hope the big steamers on our serverwill tell their viewers to respect the naming rules and mentality of an Rp server.
---
I play with a multibox (4 warlocks 1 priest) and I literally save people with heal + killing their mobs (taunt with pets). I resurrect them when I fail to save them.
---
All Eu servers are full at prime time.
---
The real stupid thing, is they constantly warned everyone not to roll on full servers and to expect queues if we did... BUT WE ONLY HAD 1 MOTHER FUCKEN SERVER.
---
A game that has just launched shouldn't be having this many problems. And yes you do pay for this game, the only thing free about it is that you don't have to own a retail copy anymore just gametime.
---
Obviously, people have work/school, but still I'd agree it's not a great sign days after release if what you're saying is accurate. It means the more dedicated part of the community is somewhat lacking compared to the higher populated realms, which is bad news for longevity.
---
I was buffed so often that for a moment, I thought that it was my Rogue mate lol.
---
Literally noone: 
---
Me: \*Int Buff on Warrior gained\*
---
Me: "Ehhrm.. Thanks, I guess?"
---
**OH MY GOD.**
---
*I don't know what that means..* 
---
Am I.. Missing out?
---
Is there no option to transfer servers at the moment?
---
Long is 12 hours. Very long is 24. The shortest is 8.
---
Tried with one month old son, doesn't work. Turns out he doesn't realise he has arms yet.
---
just leave it logged in and when you log in on the other computer it will log out it and log you in as long as you were still in.
---

Where did you find it?

I think it could use more jpeg
---
Keanu becomes a butler: Keanu Jeeves.
---
Actually there job is too make money - did you pay for your sub?
---
Blizzard is practically betting 'all-in' on 85 % of players quitting in the next 6 months. Otherwise there's some serious deep problems ahead in 6 months (eitherway killing Classic's server communities - the one thing people have been missing from retail - and leaving layers on, or switching layers off and some servers having like 15 hour queues). I would had betted perhaps 50% quitting, but 85% sounds so drastical. We will see. Should layers still be on when p2 is launched, I'll be more than glad to be part of the 85%-supposed-to-be.
---
Yojanba didn't have any que all day
---
I took the day off work to play today after running some chores this morning... I feel ripped off.
---
yeah doesn't really work with leeway.
---
Naxx on release was actually really poorly balanced, a well designed raid let down by poor mechanics on initial release. 
---
Besides it's just a game, stop trying to defend it, you look pathetic.
---
I do toss our fears when I see people about to be gibbed,  it mostly works out.  That counts for something I guess
---
PW:S --&gt; Mind Blast --&gt; SW:P --&gt; Wand until dead, maybe throw in another Mind Blast if you're feeling adventurous
---
Repeat until level 40.
---
Instructions unclear, got stuck with friend playing feral druid. I'm a warrior. Wat do
---
A lot of people can't rush through the game with these queues. Don't worry about it.
---
Yessir
---
Can I tank as a warrior that is specing arms for leveling, if I equip a shield?
---
Probably cause they are all in queue haha
---
Then I can’t help you man, idk where your guild went wrong raising you
---
You seem like a fun dude lmao
---
People are like " this is trash ". Like fine go back to BF(G)A(Y} we dont care.
---
It was the friendship they made along the way
---
I really don't undertsand why anyone would want to play on a low pop server, why even play an MMO?
---
&gt;Warriors have loads of mechanics that add depth to their class, stance dancing, trap dancing, dead zoning races classes, warriors have to be reactive to a lot of CC fear etc. Not proactive. 
---
Not really, not in PvP at least. And "stance dancing" is one of those cool terms we put on something to make it sound complex, when in reality it's "Swap to Berserker Stance and press Berserker Rage when the screen starts to shake". I guess in PvP it's "Swap to battle stance and press Overpower when you see a dodge".
---
In PvP a Warrior is going to be in Berserker Stance 95% of the time, and your go-to strategy and most effective strategy are the same: Frontload all the damage you can and hope to kill them immediately, or cut off a heal with pummel/intercept then finish them. If you get feared, gouged or sapped, you're already in Berserker stance, so you just break it immediately.
---
Warriors are a fun class, probably the most fun class, but their skill cap isn't anywhere near as high as Rogues.
---
&gt;Paladins have to strike a balance between damage and surviving, fake casting so they dont get interrupted etc. Choosing to use their CC at the right time to interrupt spells. 
---
That's just every healer ever. The only difference is a Paladin has Plate and 2 Bubbles. Also: CC = 1x Hammer of Justice. Unless they're retnubs I guess. Druids and Priests at least have to work for their "CC", and Shaman interrupt is on the GCD I believe.
---
&gt;The thing that makes classic pvp difficult is that not very class has a hard CC, interrupt, disengage etc. As a hunter vs a warrior for example you have to be inventive in how you create space each time, plan to take the intercept and how your going to get away from that.
---
That's why I said it was basically very binary.
---
If a Rogue opens on a mage with an Ambush+Backstab, then he's probably won the fight right there. He's got a very, very high chance to win.
---
If a Hunter opens on a warlock with bestial wrath, same deal. Or a mage, or Priest, or any squishy really.
---
A Paladin should always beat a Warrior. Actually, Warriors can mostly beat Shaman, unless they're Orcs, but they'll lose to every single other class unless the class is played by a retard.
---
There's very little outplay potential and very little ability or time to really showcase much skill. Rogues are an exception due to high skill cieling (even if it's not needed most of the time due to the sheer power of CB/Prep specs), Mages are similar (again, not needed because Frost is ridiculous) but yeah.
---
Wish they could take those aspects of WoW and make content for classic without ruining all 1-60 reps and items.
---
&gt;I haven’t even gotten to meet up with my friends
---
I haven't even gotten to logging in even once.
---
Update:
---
&gt; Our engineers are still working on resolving the issue, we’ll update as soon as we have news. Apologies again, folks. 
---
S priest and mage do some solid things in PVP although I prefer fire mage for pvp for some big burst and nuking. 
---
I rolled druid! I love it and I have 100+ days played on druid in Vanilla. It can get frustrating when youre feral and have to run into danger to get close, but survivability is excellent.
---
\*I do not work with or for or have anything to do with **WoW** servers\*
---
However, this is surprisingly accurate.
---
In 10 years I’ll still remember the Tauren that saved me from a worg today.
---
My go to for automation based on screen state as well. It makes these sort of tasks really simple, down to even just a 5-10 line script.
---
Macros are bannable? TIL.
---
But the Zergling comes from the Collectors Edition.
---
I have the same problem, my guess it is a bug so it doesn't save the server you play
---
BM is probably not the best choice for pvp
---
&gt; The gear, the danger and the adventure is still there in retail if you start a new character and use no heirlooms. It's even more of an adventure if you roll on a brand new server and no one transfers over.
---
No it's not.
---
I have 6 characters on retail, 2 120 and 4 at around 110 - 115.
---
I didn't die a single time with all of those characters while levelling. I was never even in danger with any of those characters. I was able to pull 6 mobs and solo them without my pet dropping below 50% with my hunter.
---
But nice try.
---
My character on Fairbanks is getting a Character not found error so it's not just OCE servers
---
Gonna be totally honest, this was me. I knew Classic was coming, but it was totally off my radar, until like 2 days prior to launch. 
---
I started reading about during the final 24 hours and considered that I would never get to experience *this* again. This launch-- all the good and bad of it-- isn't something I can buy anytime I want it; it was now or never. I didn't wanna miss out on the experience.
---
You need to sub to play. No way round it.

No changes

I shamelessly used this just a few minutes ago when I had to go to the bathroom (Oceanic servers are down/resetting and its peak hour)
---
i have reported for this reason a few times already
---
I bought a 6 slot from an NPC.. had 3 bronce left, but was still really happy! Sad that the bag immediately got full. I need more! The fact that you have to have the profession items in your bag makes it really hard tho.
---
Blacksmithing: Smithing Hammer, Radiant Stone(s)
---
Mining: Mining Axe,
---
Fishing: Lure, Bait
---
Cooking: Wood, Flint &amp; Tinder
---
1-2 healing items, one instant healing potion
---
x amounts of loot that can be used for any profession (non-grey items)
---
x amount of quest items

..a few more that could be argued about if you should take it or not
---
Bye boomer
---
damn, ive been playing what I consider alot and hit 12 :(...they must be playing nonstop.
---
Correct, but also: Shadowmeld still exists.
---
Who says Vanilla/Classic was worse?
---
And you're still dead. How is it different if the result is the same?
---
Wtf
---
Aight, thanks for the quick response.
---
After four hours of queuing I managed to log in and eventually grouped up going around Westfall. 
---
This is my first time playing WoW, and my healing skills were definitely put to the test! It feels so good getting that clutch bubble/heal off when both my party members have pulled mobs above their level. 
---
I can see myself playing a filthy amount of this game.
---
Trade window can be used to interrupt someone gathering from a node.
---
I’m pretty sure that’s C# program and not a script.
---
Not doable atm, too many people questing in the areas u need to aoe at.

Ouch, I played Horde - Barth and Ally - Frostmourne. I loved overpopulated servers haha, always something to do!

for some reason i just love how Infinite genders and Islam are in the same sentence.  Almost jealous of you getting to read that spammy edge chat.
---
What they are saying is right. A multibillion dollar company that skimps out on serevers deserves all of that. As soon as i saw there was only 2 oce servers i knew blizzard had chimps making that decision. Yes you can do other stuff, but you shouldnt have to. Blizzard again, a MULTIBILLION dollar company should have planned accordingly.
---
I haven't gotten any idea about stuff like that yet, where can I learn more? Thanks!!
---
FBI OPEN THE DOOR
---
Playing a game always is a subjective experience. Of course, there are measurable aspects which can be objectively better (like performance, graphics etc.) but the most important thing about a game is how you feel about playing it.  
---
If you like something, it means something to you, and you want it to be liked and/or at least respected by others. A lot of people got a positive experience out of classic, made great friends along the way and had an overall enjoyable time. The same people did not get the same positive experience out of the later expansions. That's not because the game got worse per se, but because people and their perception changed gradually. Your old friends may move on and stop playing entirely, you have seen basically everything of this huge world and so on. It's not as appealing for you personally as it was before, but the magic of the "good ol' days" is stuck in your mind.  
---
Alot of people tend to rationalize their preferences, because they simply want their preferences to be not only subjectively but also objectively superior. And that's basically where the argument begins. Most commonly, things being cumbersome due to timegating or simply being unrefined, suddenly turn into "being hard" and "needing skill"(and ffs, i hear this ALOT in my pnp group).   
---
"Back in my days, we had to walk to get to xxx."   
---
Hows that hard. Walking 30 Minutes to get to my destination because riding is for level 40 and costs about as much as a private jet is not challenging, it's cumbersome and a waste of time. Also, Mob Battles are not "hard" because they take longer, since it's just time-consuming and not mechanically challenging.  
---
A lot of the challenges that came with classic were due to the semi-new concept, the inexperienced players and the technical limitations, and would be trivial compared to todays standards (considering heroic or mythic raiding, don't tell me bout lfr, i know that's for bonobos).  
---
 I started playing when tbc was out, and i stopped when cata came, but i checked back in every two expansions and i always had a good time. I'd also say that MoP and Legion were objectively better than tbc and wotlk, but the memories i made in tbc and wotlk are irreplaceble, and i treasure them dearly, so i PERSONALLY still prefer tbc and wotlk. I also tried playing a warrior and a lock in classic later, but i stopped, because it bored me pretty fast. All i did was basically pressing 1 for an extended ammount of time, and that's not how i want to spend the bit of free time i have every day.  
---
So, do I like classic? No. Is it a bad game? No. It was great for it's time and important for MMO's as a concept, and if i started playing when it first came out i would probably have loved it. But I still think the re-release is a bad idea, since it shows blizzard came to the right conclusions considering the bfa feedback and reception, but choose to rather cash in on some nostalgia instead of spending full ressources for improving the main game.   
---
That is understandable, since as a company, the main goal is making money. But as a player, i'd rather have a good new expansion to come back to once bfa comes to a close.
---
Dude, it's 3 days into launch, and a shit load more stable than their first three launches. For all you know this might be a 3rd party malicious attack. Do us all a fav and cancel your sub so we don't have to deal with toxic player base.
---
i had to do it too, feelsbadman
---
Ah true, I always forget that lol.
---
I'm a rogue and did this to a healer+mage. My brain just saw the color blue and the word Agility and slammed that need button.
---
i should look into this
---
I am at work too, while I can surf then net now and then..I can't really play from work lmao.
---
It's really not comparable. Vanilla isn't hard, it's very tedious (especially at later levels) and there are many things that aren't designed very well (like farming as tank or healer vs. paying for respec). Raiding is mostly hard because you have to find 40 people that can show up on time rather than any serious mechanical complexity.
---
95% of Retail isn't hard either, but the parts that are are demonstrably harder than vanilla. The last two fights of EP alone probably have more going on than the entirety of MC and BWL combined. 
---
Both have easy and hard parts, but those don't really overlap. I would say Vanilla is more hardcore just because it's a hellgrind to get anywhere, while BfA is much harder at the upper echelons.
---
I ran into a hunter with almost full cloth gear, most of it spr/int and what must have been the shittiest bow ever equipped by a lvl 24.
---
Not all changes are improvements
---
This kills the hype for me atleast. Having a job, I wont be able to play on the same realm as planned with my friends, they took a work off lol. So now im debating if i should play at all.
---
Also you might want to opt to gain undead reputation instead, because getting a level 40 mount for 10% cheaper is kind of a big deal.
---
Yes it was possible at first, there was a toggle to switch from new models to the old ones, but they removed it unfortunately quite some time ago.
---
It's also not possible to do it with addons and I advice against using mods to change the models, there has been a ban wave on BFA for it because some people used mods to cheat and they won't be tolerant about it anymore.
---
I think you mean that's how insanely large this release was.
---
what do you mean by saying "these many problems" the only problem that there is to deal with is the INSANE amount of people trying to log in AT THE SAME TIME. And still the ones that manage to log in MOST of them like 95% or so dont have ANY ISSUES. If there was any other game with this number of ppl playing there would be insane lagg, and yet after 35 hours of gameplay only got like 10 dcs...jesus you are dramatic.
---
The character selection screen blacks out whenever a realm is offline, OCE servers have had this happen about 6 times since Classic launched.
---
May the gods have mercy upon your soul, my friend.
---
I'm still waiting for queue simulator. A simple website which I can access that randomly shows numbers and simulates the queue.  
---
So I can get the full classic experience even at work.
---
Hell, even people without playing classic could experience classic that way ;)
---
Yes, but they are still prone to having issues. It's no different than any other server around the world. Shit happens, it gets fixed. People need to stop whinging and bitching and wait it out like the rest of us.
---
That makes me feel so much more useful. Mark, Thorns , AND a moonfire whenever I can
---
Lol? it seems quite logical  that the highest pop oceanic server will continue to be the highest pop oceanic server. Unless you think Felstriker is suddenly going to go from Low to high and Argular, High to low
---
Wow retail is a bonus for those who have a wow subscription, this argument goes both ways.
---
They don't have time for explanations they're too busy fixing the servers
---
Leveling is a pain in the ass but tanking dungeons makes it all worth it
---
Half of the warriors, half of the rogues and 70% of the pallys wont make it to 60, wanna bet? Solo leveling someclasses past 30 is rlly annoying
---
Do continue ....
---
I Literally just spent 5 hours in a “120 minute” queue..lol
---
Same brother! Was looking for a DM group for about 20 minutes. Then someone in general says they need one Dps for only VC kill and I had to get his head for the quest anyways so I tagged along. Ended up getting a green macaw from the pirates and then, a black water cutlass, and then cruel barb from van cleef who I beat a warrior in a roll for! Then I ran a dm with my guild afterwards and got a red defias mask! Gonna go for dual wield cruel barbs if I can get another lucky drop tomorrow! I’ll also settle for a thief’s blade haha. Congrats on your drop.
---
This is honestly a fucking joke. Half the reason I quit, back in Cataclysm, was because of bullshit like this.
---
Yeah that definitely sucks, but I think that is still a rare situation on the whole.
---
man i hope we get some fuckin transfers
---
Had  a warrior and a rogue level 1 twink back in BC, those were fun. 
---
When a rogue could learn stealth and dual wield, and put armor kits on legs. 
---
Was killing level 18s as a lvl 1 with 7-800 hp
---
Saw a mage pull 3 level 12 mobs as a level 10 yesterday, I'm also playing a mage so I tried to help out, poly one, nova and help nuke. Welp this guy didn't know I cant poly tagged targets, he gets greedy tags all the mobs thinking I'm trying to ninja his sweet mobs. After 2 failed polys, he gets two shot and I just stand there and /shrug his corpse hahaha
---
Melbourne to Bali via Singapore, that was a favourite of mine.
---
I actually hate this..
---
They should just reset the entire game lore that was built since TBC and rebuild an entirely new, parallel universe with not shitting on the gameplay like world quests, flying, LFG/LFR, Heroic/Mythic shit etc.
---
you dont get my point. Fine, have a nice day.
---
Not yet. Addons exist for this purpose on retail, as well as agglomerated data from all realms and per realm, but it will likely be around few weeks before we start seeing reliable census.
---
Yeah so when this used to happen Blizzard would give 1 day credits to players, I can show the credit history from 2007 if you want.
---
or 3rd option is that the servers are down.....

When you realise you have to loot each body individually.

same as when an NPC helps kill it. Their contribution is lower, so the xp is lower than normal.

You need to be partied for the contribution to not be penalized but then you have to split the XP.

Came in to mention this... Does this not provide further insight to the issue ... Beyond infuriating how poorly catered to oceanics are. If they wanted the authentic vanilla experience we'd be offered a month of subs free because the servers have been so borked and when they used to fuck us over they used to make gestures to say yea we fucked up... Right now best I see is "limited time half price server transfers!"
---
Thanks alot, I was wondering all day what was causing it
---
&gt; There’s a lot of quests in the barrens that are loot a boss which are major choke points for players. 
---
Tell me about it, i did the verog quest but people kept taking the tags before i could, took 3 tries to make me create a /target /cast macro. But that wasn't that bad. The worst one was the godamn quest outside the WC enterance for the 99 year old port. The guy you need to kill for that spawns at one of like 5 locations and is on a 15min timer. I got there right as he died, made the macro and sat there spamming it for 48minutes. Tons of horde came and went at one point there was \~40 people standing around waiting for him to spawn. Meanwhile my hand is about to fall off as i've been spamming the same key for so long switching fingers/hands, rebinding it to the mouse-wheel... anything that would let me continue to spam it. Then right before he spawns, someone finally invites me to a group and i get the tag.. i don't recommend anyone do that quest the spawn time is ridiculous.
---
I was happy to get names from Roman, I'm a history nerd.
---
Base it on population.
---
u/lastWallE didn't explain exactly what you asked. There's 2 types of outdoor zones in WoW: friendly and contested. Friendly zones are the first 2 zones of each race, so like Elywin Forest and Westfall for Humans, Durotar and Barrens for Orcs and Trolls, etc etc. The difference between PvE and PvP servers happen in the Contested areas. 
---
On PvE servers, when you enter a contested area (for example Ashenvale), you don't AUTOMATICALLY get flagged for pvp. Meaning you can play there as normal and if you encounter a player from oposite faction neither of you can attack the other unless you manually toggle pvp. Whereas on PvP realms, as soon as you set foot on a contested area, you're automatically flagged for pvp and any enemy faction player can kill you on sight (or vice versa).
---
On the case of OP's picture, which is from a RP-PvP server, all horde players were in enemy territory so they were all flagged for pvp except alliance players, but alliance players had to manually flag themselves for pvp to fight the horde. These types of Guild vs Guild battles happen often on RP-PvP servers, where one side roleplays for example like the defenders of Westfall and the other side roleplays as an invading horde. 
---
It's pretty cool, ads flavor to it rather than it being just some mindless pvp!
---
Level up your lock picking,  not a buff per se but will pay dividends later

Why do people want this to fail? Like, is it some kind of really weird, misplaced jealousy over other people having fun and enjoying themselves? 
---
I've had a fuckin' blast so far.
---
I absolutely consider that cheating. One player, one input.  If you're gonna multi-box, put the inputs in one at a time like everyone else...
---
Do you remember not being able to afford your gear repairs? Money meant something in vanilla, I'm looking forward to earning my mounts instead of just selling a token.
---
Once you get out of beginner zones you'll feel difficulty picking up. Especially around level 9-10 it ramps up quite some.
---
wow retail is there waiting to be played, but no everyone will cry about how classic doesnt work lol. Your money = both of them, people asking their money back is something that will never happen, even through the legal route. Not being able to play the 1 for a short period of time doesnt mean that you didnt receive the product that you paid for.
---
Not an addon

Thinking about starting a new character but I never understood the concept of rolling. Is there a site that lets you roll a class/race combo?
---
I’ve played Vanilla but only as a warrior and only branched out to other classes post BC. So I was looking to try something new but am too indecisive and want someone/something to make the choice for me.
---
How did they released only so few realms?
---
There arent many alliance guilds on barthlias, bet I'm in it lol
---
i tried that ddnt work for me, couldnt find my game even after i tried to manually add it
---
Somebody get dis man a shield
---
Or jump on realm with no queue
---
Im rolling a warrior and have herb and alch at the moment but not sure if switch to mining skinning woulf be better since there are so few herbs in the barren
---
Well i dont know, the servers are already lagging. I mean dreadmist died yesterday xDD
---
I picked pure farmer for my guild, herbalism and mining. Yeah tailoring would have been nice but eh
---
Lok'tar*
---
This is most definitely against the ToS. As far as how generously Blizzard will swing the ban hammer regarding Classic, this is still up for debate.
---
Doing engi just for this isnt worth it.
---
honestly pathetic, you could get more XP by just grinding. The way we do it in aus is 100 people crowd around the spawn point spamming their best attack. Auto target takes over and luckiest man wins.
---
Iv been told to go skinning/tailor as selling the skins (even to vendors) can help a lot towards your mount at 40 haven’t tried this myself as I’m new to classic but hope this helps
---
Thanks man, gl to you too.
---
That speaks for itself, the fact there was such a surge of players at launch shows there is interest. Whether they'll stick around though, that remains to be seen.
---
THAT IS WHAT I AM WAITING FOR!
---
I chose skinning, it can generate a small amount of income which will help you get all your skills and what not (just vendoring all the leather), there aren't any great farming options for mages in phase 1 so you'll need all the money you can get.
---
Enchanting is much more of a gold sink, something I would consider a bit later
---
A man of culture to be sure.
---
The thing is, this doesn't really solve the underlying problem. Imagine if everyone did the same as you did, the queue would simply start sooner.
---
you do realise he holds the record for fastest leveling time in vanilla...

Oh I totally agree. It's just an annoying situation.
---
Lolol q
---
never
---
But you can recast it without the need of taking a breath, so undending with extra steps.
---
mob pulling is not a skill? see you in game. i was talking about raids btw, can you even read?
---
What makes ret pally so hard to kite? As far as I know they dont have much tools to use to close the gap other than a stun and increased movespeed paired with engineering.
---
Pretty sure Rexxar has him beat.
---
Real Mob Health, I think it's called.
---
It doesn't actually show the mob's real health, but it monitors the damage you deal and Tey to calculate the mob's hp.
---
I was the only leather in my WC but the group fell apart after 2 bosses
---
At least I got the pants
---
I (warrior) took that Viren's Revenge quest to kill some birds in Lock Modan, and started killing them while suddenly some mage came and invited me in party right before i killed the bird. I stopped auto attacking and accept the invite so i could have share the kill. We went through the quest and returned to quest giver when suddenly that mage open up trade window and gifted me fucking +4str +2stam mail belt. 
---
That was fucking bis upgrade for me at 17lvl. That was fucking awesome. 
---
We finished the whole quest line killing Ol'Soothy.
---

---
Can't wait to see keysmash named orc women flash into the middle of Orgrimmar and die so their bodies spell out the name for a shady gold website.
---
Java?
---
Do you think everyone has to wait in line to play? 
---
There are realms with little to no queuetime. 
---
"Tourists" are not elitists. I don't think they are stuck to those popular realms like some other fancy people...
---
Mage is crazy squishy for the first couple dozen levels though
---
I mean, I can understand this being the case, but a heads up would have been nice
---
Felstriker is mid to low pop, 
---
Yojamba is high to full, 
---
Arugal is full to fucked.
---
Upgrades an upgrade.
---
Roll hard!
---
IMO if they add new content the game will go on for a while. If not probably dies out within 2 years
---
he might make a couple hundred this time around if he's lucky tbh
---
You buy a subscription.
---
I don't think Blizz is going to enforce the RP rule for the first month, or at least until population lowers a bit, unfortunately
---
Jesus christ what a fucking dumbass
---
Buy gametime
---
Sorry for OT:  
---
what addon do you have, so you can see the vendor price
---
also, isnt there a functioning auto-sell junk / trash addon, havent found one that worked yet.
---
Sure, they wanted less work, but they also came to the conclusion people were sticking to a meta and ignoring the vast majority of specs.
---
Sure, some may have been using the less-used specs, but not enough. It was an illusion of choice. I still think they should've kept them, but I totally get why they trimmed the fat.
---
[get game time.](https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/world-of-warcraft-game-time)
---
nah we line up too
---
just go play retail
---
booooooooooo
---
I was there!
---
Whose?
---
If sharding is something you wanted, I got a perfect game for you...
---
Lol I'm the Tauren. More like he didn't invite me. That's the guild my main is in. Didn't get around to inviting my alt.
---
im a new player and i used punkrats video addons for leveling in classic, just download addon and extract the file into addons in the wow folder. it was easier than i expected. i was doing the twitch client add on for like 30 mins never worked for some reason so i just manually added the addon
---
Due to queue times people cant. Yes they added servers, but people wont switch as they have to start over again as well as friends wont switch with em. It did not work like it should have. 2 servers for OCE, if they really wanna fix queue times, they have to give a free character transfer, so people can swap to lower pop servers. NA apparently is still having massive queues with long waits.
---
That's like seven hours away :(
---
I think its because that classic is bigger than just classic itself to them. They have something to lose. Most of the complaints I have seen are that modern wow will have less content and developers to work on it.
---
Of course there is more to it than just that.
---
no, it means people weren't even farming AQ 40.
---
Does it matter? Go live your life for a bit and try again later.
---
Charge rend is the best buff i can give as a warrior
---
Unending*ish*
---
The obliterum money machine =)
---
They gave free time because of the queues in classic.
---
The design of the core of the content - the content content - if you will - is a lot better in the expansions than in classic wow. Unfortunately, this is completely ruined by the convenience-focused system into which it has been embedded.
---
If you don't have an active sub and have enough gold on your retail account, you can buy a token directly from the character screen, so you won't need a full retail install.
---
Start to download retail and click play as soon as it lets you.
---
Troll RP is da easiest to do well, 'tell ya.
---
Alongside Dwarves, it's kinda the same when you think about it.
---
You literally have nothing to lose and I couldn’t care less because I did it myself today.
---
I am filled with so much excitement writing this but i am a guild leader of a small guild with about 30 members and today we have finally done our first dungeon together as a group and throughout the whole thing i was extremely excited and having so much fun because people i had brought together were having so much fun and it felt great im in love with wow classic!
---
I’m super new to wow, and picked a rogue. Got to level 18 now, but really don’t like it.
---
How would the life of a priest healer be? How would I earn gold? Thanks guys!
---
I got a small black pouch drop, was well happy haha
---
You know you can buy 6,8,10 and 12bags from the bag vendor in your capital city right?
---
Well... Get out. The rest of us have guilds and goals hampered by lonewolves like you that join only because of the server size.

Good
---
It's like splitting the zones into different layers so there's not 1000 people in durotar etc I think
---
Same here. Haven't had to queue yet.
---
False. Plenty of realms have no queues.
---
Clearly not important if no one remembers his name.
---
I have never player classic before and im wondering if warlocks were any good, what are the pros and cons of them?
---
thanks
---
See? And this is why you can't expect to be taken seriously.   
---
You come here with ridiculous claims " Frontload all the damage you can and hope to kill them immediately, or cut off a heal with pummel/intercept then finish them. " This is plain wrong and you will lose 80% of your wPvP encounters against hunters and frost mages if you play like that.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCghvUv6vup2WUL1BAVtab4g](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCghvUv6vup2WUL1BAVtab4g) Watch this guy (Ogrtd)
---
Or Monkeynews to learn how a good warriors engages a frost mage and wins.
---
Which makes it slower. That has nothing to do with difficulty.
---
That shield bash macro is a must for any warrior
---
Time investment =/= hard
---
Okay yeah because retail wow has put the difficulty into the end game. When was the last time you actually raided outside of LFR or normal or did a mythic+ higher than 7?
---
Depends on what you mean by “active players” - like online at once (do people in the queue count?), or all of the people who have played for any amount of time on any server?  Something else?
---
To be completely fair, “WoW is a dead game and the people who play it are losers/dated” is a narrative as old as the game itself. 
---
I think the current big backlash from a small section of the community has just taken that old narrative and scaled it up to match the hype. 
---
Its also fueled by sentiment in Blizzard itself (“you think you want it, but you don’t”). I’m sure with the current numbers Blizz will happily eat their words. That said, despite disagreeing with how Blizz initially responded to the call for Classic servers, I get their perspective. Vanilla is probably internally seen as an incomplete experiment from the early days. BC or Wrath might have been closer to the true “vision” which could only be realized later. I’m sure some players share similar opinions — which they have a right to hold.
---
In both cases, if the game continues along current trajectory, the blatant success should rise to meet anyone who has negative things to say. Plus it’s not for everyone, and that’s fine.
---
Why do so many people want Retail to fail? Is it really that difficult to just enjoy your game of choice and respect everyone's personal opinions?
---
I like Classic and Retail, I don't like people bitching about either.
---
he healed him, too.
---
About your FP issue : did you accept a party invite from another layer before taking the FP ? (even if it was an hour ago)
---
Afaik you can only be layered if you recieve an invitation (or join a guild from another layer i guess ?) but there's a CD before you can change layer, increased by PvP, looting mobs, being in combat, looting nodes ect, to prevent abuse.
---
It looks like you managed to keep the CD active until the fligh point and then be layered.
---
/commend
---
My classic weekend was meant to start 3 hrs ago...feck meeeee
---
Same! Shit and I thought I was the only one having this issue. WTF really Blizzard
---
Everything you need is in the WTF folder. Have a look at the subfolders within and it will be obvious what you need to do.
---
The best thing about classic is that we got our buffs back. Oh and no flying mounts xD
---
because rogues and warriors operate on a fixed resource system, they don't keep multiple spell ranks, their spells simply replace the lower ones with a better one.
---
That doesn't work with casters as higher rank spells also cost more resources and you have to manage and ration that based on the needs of getting to the end of the encounter.
---
Lakeshire.
---
Nope
---
They’ve dogged the boys
---
Stealing Memes from /r/arugal smh
---
Nah, I know that. Which Is why I recommended sleep. Que comment was if you guys have herod level ques that sleep might not be worth it. Waking up to sit in a 5h que xD
---
Just reminding, they conceived the no layering by phase 2 plan at the same time when they thought it was ok to give EU 2 pvp realms.
---
Just one year?  Why not 2, 5, 10?  You'll be right eventually, right?
---
Warlocks are lots of fun, incredibly survivable solo and you get a free level 40 mount. And it’s cool to go level up your abilities in some dark basement or cave and feel super dark.
---
&gt; If im in a good mood ill give you free underwater breathing.
---
And then, only to Undeads!
---
Tailoring is very neat. If you keep ip up ro your level, you can keep making yourself cool gear. However, I'd very much advise against leveling enchanting before 60. If you do that, you will be *broke*, as you'll need to disenchant the loot you'd normally sell. You won't be able to afford new spells. Seriously. I tried that once.
---
Instead, I recommend you pick a pure money making profession along with tailoring and then swap it for ench once you hit 60. Otherwise go with the alchemy/herbalism combo, which is perfectly fine.
---
Much envy.
---
Oceanic servers died as we just got half way up the ship in deadmines.. ugh!
---
You are right. Have been working too much with web lately...
---
See where you plan to lvl, for example if you are a night elf and are staying in those zones you would be fine with swords, staves and bows. When you get higher up 10 silver wont be a big deal since im lvl 16 and each new skill is 16silver or more
---
So not Tailor? And I'm not too sure of all the professions, which gathering ones are good?
---
Some friend have gone over to BFA - maybe this is Blizzard game plan all along !
---
Logging onto an Oceanic server...
---
I don’t think that queues entitle that, but the servers being down during peak time should attract some consideration.
---
im with you man this is way too much for the experience 180$ per years man these fan boi are out of their mind ,
---
Update: I have confirmation from an inside source that servers are down in an attempt to fix Hezrul.  
---
Fingers crossed boys.
---
No, I wasn't much for the gold farming and I just like to try and enjoy the content. I know there was the Garrison and other things, but those were kinda...boring.
---
It's because if you started after classic, you were told the game.you enjoyed saying sucked and vanilla was the greatest etc. Some people probably want to see it fail so they can have their experience justified or some weird shit.
---
I never played vanilla started in wrath and love it. Started classic and loving it. Let people enjoy what they want to enjoy they are different games and both enjoyable if that's what you want to do.
---
u must be new when it comes to bliz

yeah lol
---
Found the troll
---
I rerolled on Skullflame yesterday because of it. Haven't seen a queue there so far.
---
The Classic client is actually Legion in disguise, so while it may not look like much, the engine of the game is much more modern compared to Vanilla on private servers for example. 
---
Chances are that Classic will give you the same error.

---
I don't think they should. This kind of server instability should have been expected when starting classic and I guarantee you that, while I haven't read it, the ToS would stipulate that server crashes and down-time are normal and they don't owe you a refund if that's ever the case. It's entirely a courtesy and nobody should be resentful if they don't deliver it.
---
Tailoring is very neat. If you keep ip up ro your level, you can keep making yourself cool gear. However, I'd very much advise against leveling enchanting before 60.

---
It’s amazing to me that classic has attracted brand new players after 15 years. Crossover from retail I expected. But last night I met a guy in game who was brand new. Now we’re friends and I look forward to helping him get settled into Azeroth.
---
So good to be home:)
---
Dont you own anything you can sell for 15 dollars?
---
Well, it was a thought xD
---
Everyone knew beforehand what was going to happen. I'd be surprised if they would give anything.
---
I'll mail you a chair... like dude..... 14 hour sash in that.. u crippled?
---
yeah hopefully we get some free transfers, i dont wana sit in queue for 6 hours starting at 5 pm
---
Why did the programmer need glasses?
---
As a paladin I feel bad giving back a 5 min buff that will run out before they have a chance to use ut
---
All I know is I’ve had more fun levelling to 14 in classic than levelling to 66 in BFA.
---
Absolutely, I enjoy it because of it's facilitation of social interaction. Me and my friends are only level 12 right now but we are taking a massive hit to xp in a group, in favour of sticking together and trying to kill insane pulls for fun. 
---
But in no way is it difficult and if 12 year old me could get to 60 easily then thst's testament to how easy it is.
---
Wow maybe he could never have any enjoyment in his free time and just pick up another job. Just live like that for two months jeez

And as more updates happened, we ended up getting more players from retail coming over and now they #nochange crowd have mostly quit. They're made fun of all the time on that sub lol

Where is the point in that? There aren't achievements there. You gain nothing from it.
---
Open day stress test would have had EVERYONE log on, also people with no interest of playing + doing that isn't free for blizzard, they still have to pay for servers etc, this way they ensured people were at least kinda serious, its 13$ to activate your account and name res, and 2 weeks you couldn't play, so that would be 6.5$ "wasted" to reserver your name 
---
I activated my sub 2 days before release of classic to make my characters, the EU shop even crashed 2 hours before the launch of classic, because so many people wanted to activate their subs, nobody expected that to happen, but it did, no one expected this to be this massive, even the classic fanboy streamers didn't expect this.

No multiplayer online game has ever launched without problems , their plan was sound and would have worked for 500k-1.5 million people that wanted to play classic, instead 5 million people wanted to play

Lol yeah man! I got gifted grey shoulders and actually equipped them. I haven't equipped a grey in retail since.. well since vanilla lol
---
as i answered, there are Q on every server right now in GER
---
so when the whole playerbase would be even on every server, there would be still a Q of arround 2k for every server
---
Damn man, have you ran dungeons as well? I'm trying to gauge whether or not I should bother with RFC
---
are you at least sub 20k in queue? XD
---
No problem, most people isn't even lvl 20. It is a good time to reroll on a Spanish server
---
In a perfect world yes, but in the current world where my bag space is limited and I carry 2-4 shards on me at a time...I’m not going through that effort for every random person I run by.
---
I mean, I am doing okay now. I cancelled pretty much everything I was subbed to for a couple months to try and catch up on bills and it really helped to have the extra $50 a month from subs. It all comes down to my paycheck being bi-weekly making it harder to manage the money.

Pls no queues on DD :((

Thing is he doesn’t run out of mana because he out damages me with a wand. Lol
---
Chrome Remote Desktop is pretty damn awesome too.

sure, no disagreement here. If they offer transfers I'll take it. If not, I've already grinded/ground my professions and secondaries close to 150 already so, I'm not into starting again already.
---
Bump for the notification
---
You guys on Ashbringer?
---
Are we going to do shit like this for every "first" blue drop now?
---
My shitpost has been stolen
---
You can't poly tagged mobs? Damn
---
why are you playing classic if you just want to add in all the stuff that is purposefully not in it
---
Or the opposite, run with people you know so that ground rules are laid about who gets what and you can regularly run dungeons for gear. Good guilds/groups will have regular runs to gear ppl.  I remember people would get bad reps for being ninjas and it did spread. When you get to end game a lot of raiding guilds/groups do have contact with each other and if you ninja stuff your going have a difficult time getting a spot.
---
me, as a hunter right now:
---
\- why does my pet just run along side mobs instead of hitting them sometimes
---
\- why does my pet magically lose aggro every time i proc rapid shots
---
\- why does rapid shots have a 99% proc rate when the mob is on 5% hp fml
---
cause if i knew the name of it i can research it.....
---
Honestly end game you can stay dps spec till AQ 40 or shit maybe even Naxx.
---
Anytime man! I'm new as well, but I do my best to help around

you wont be sitting in a queue tonight.

There are elementals in Ashenvale and thousand needles too.

That sucks if they intentionally stopped us from going to US servers while OCE servers are down. We paid for the damn game. Let us play!

Downloading at 6mb/s from some places, just downloaded the new nvidia drivers at 200kb/s...
---
Followed immediately by the dps needing on tank gear then further complaining about how squishy the tank is. Ahh the good ol days!
---
Just an automated system bro, all the communications team went home XD
---
Scrooge McDuck over heeeere
---
If half the population leaves, it’ll still be a highly populated game. 4-5 hour que times prove it’s not too early.
---
Sorry, not a Blizz engineer. But I guess they have their ways.
---
Ahh yes, although no buffs for alliance scum ;)
---
Thanks for reminding me I can still buff, friend.
---
Same. Full time job, first kid is 4 weeks away. I'm starting into the abyss and its song is sweet, but somehow I still resits... Send help!
---
Are you the guy who got his Uncle to ban me when I bm'd you?
---
Not that im braging but im pretty sure wow has the biggest comunity along all other popular mmos. So ya you wont be alone
---
Hope you aren't on Oceanic
---
*Warrior rolls NEED*
---
"You know, I'm something of a hunter myself."
---
X
---
Do you have an idea of the average number of additional players who will be able to connect to each server?
---
Yeah i went red faced when i saw this.
---
Also -  will be going through the list and updating every one/ removing people below level 35.
---
Don’t know why this was downvoted. Everyone else is using it and causing these massive queue times. Personally I have one on one of the wicked busy servers and one on a less populated. Both are lvl 10 hunters and I don’t play a ton so I’m prob gonna just stick with the lower pop realm. But if everyone is doing this teamviewer, he might as well too.
---
Same thing. The one day I finish early and servers are down.
---
I love seeing this :-) It may not be efficient but it's community.
---
But it has nothing to do with this conversation. No ones talking about becoming part of a specific generation lol.
---
&gt;what? everyone knew that it will be huge
---
There is a difference between knowing, assuming and hoping. No one knew how huge it would be.
---
Keep in mind that you must level those new weapons before you can use them effectively.
---
On your first char it's not worth it to buy everything, not even all your abilities, unless you already have money to waste, save it for the mount.
---
My suggestion is to stick with what you have and learn a new weapon only if you get a significant upgrade, then switch and level that weapon.
---
What a sad, sad life you must lead. Only desiring accomplishments for the sake of showing them off to others, rather than for self-fulfilment. I pity you. To each his own, I suppose.
---
Details
---
I mean, soon enough you'll give me honor. That's a kind of buff.
---
It looks a lot better to shareholders when you promise 6 and deliver 20 vs promise 2p0 and deliver 20
---
Retail connects, so I don't think it's an issue with just the internet.
---
&gt;Classic+ would need to be a completely separate project from Classic with it's own servers.
---
Why?
---
It got so bad that we had to do a +10 key for the week. How are we supposed enjoy playing wow when the servers are down and all we are left with is playing wow.
---
Made me giggle pretty hard.
---
??????????????????
---
jesus, what happened to you. go ahead and stop logging in then, guy.
---
"temporary gills"
---
ah thanks, i didnt see it there will check again when my servers back up
---
Do we know what the realm faction balance is, for EU more specifically. What are the most balanced realms?
---
Never have they offered people game time to incentivise a server transfer lol
---
Unavailable servers yea but no way in hell would they try to bribe players with free game time, that's bad business
---
I'm crying right now 🤣🤣
---
thank you very much
---
Would tou stop pretending you are a medical expert amd know my situation? Thanks.
---
5 sec rule?
---
Yeah but it’s the best way to level in group. The majority of dungeon grinders will be experienced players so it’s fine.
---
Greens?! I am happy with a white upgrade. I am level 13 rocking some levelless armor :( Really struggling to upgrade.
---
While we're at it, frost or fire spec?
---
You could get around this with a VM. WoW in the VM, every input will be from the VM software. Autoclicker runs on the host machine, sends an input on a timer between 15-28 minutes. Every input is sanitized then.
---
i've found 3 boe blues in the wild so far, but I don't think any of them are worth more than a few gold at this point
---
Why? Low pop is still more than a full vanilla server, and this server is medium / high all day.
---
thanks I will keep that in mind, sounds like a good plan
---
QQ
---
Adding more layers is just plain stupid. Blizzard said that low pop servers on classic have similar population as high pop servers in vanilla. Instead of adding stupid layers just add more servers. So what.. they will be high on launch and then drop to medium in 1 year. That will still be more population than a full server in vanilla wow. And how will they fit a nowadays full server into 1 layer? IF and Orgrimmar will be OVERPOPULATED in 1 layer with this population. I don't like this at all.
---
There's people on my server that were wall running in sentinel hill inn for the entire time i was in the zone, like 2-3+ hours. Didn't log, seem silly to autorun and come back to move your mouse every 30 mins.
---
Personally I leave w bound to forward (so that I can keep running forward while using the mouse to spin around and shoot behind me as I jump) but I rebind a s d to abilities and mainly use the mouse (holding down m1+2) for movement. Also I'm a fan of using shift+[key] binds so that I can have a lot of bindings without having to move my hand much from wasd position.
---
no update on servers cming back up yet. https://twitter.com/Blizzard_ANZ/status/1166996236051738624
---
Yes, all OCE users are. Check the Twitter
---
You think it might be more than just WOW?
---
everywhere else is up
---
like every single other server in the world apart from OCE
---
Haha! Well played. I enjoyed that.
---
Same thought. Was in OG yesterday and it was crowded as usual and 5 minutes later I read a massage, if OG is really almost empty. After a group join and five minutes he could see what I saw.
---
I used to be a druid in vanilla. While you aren't going to the most lethal as a druid, you can still be a threat. The main point is, to use all of that versatility you can bring to the table. Especially in world pvp a druid has some very handy and powerfull tools at his disposal.
---
Seems Blizzard agrees with you as well, and has for the last 15 years.
---
Huh? It's been out on the UK since Monday 11pm...
---
I think a lot of people are excited for end game pvp / pve and want to get there as soon as possible.
---
I have been on my realm with a queue, spamming Census add-on and I usually find around 13k unique names in 45 minutes....so around 12k is my guess.
---
Yea I have some friends who never played wow that checked it out on release, but got bored after a day and quit..
---
only for server outages. Never had they offered game time and free transfers.
---
Just getting the free transfer was a bribe
---
anyone facing a problem where you can log in, pick a realm, but then get suck at character creation? it keeps saying “character creation timed out” even if i hit randomise and create as quickly as possible. occurring on all US servers i’ve tried (that aren’t full), both factions, with and without addons. 
---
i was able to create &amp; play on oceania without any issues on tuesday but now all the oceania servers are offline for me.
---
Apparently even though you can connect to NA servers right now you can't create characters there, nor can you see any existing characters you may have had there if connecting from OCE.
---
username checks out
---
By listing the OCE servers as US it makes this look better than it is. 4 servers offline is something people could maybe expect. An entire country down though is rediculous.
---
I'm going to take the bitching route ! Each class gets its own merits and flaws but you seem to be focusing on lvl 60 content, which imo is not the right way to enjoy Classic right now, unless you're in a big guild going for firsts. End game content is months away, and you will spend hundreds of hours levelling until then. If small hindrances like farming comps for poisons or needing ammo are enough to make you not want to play some classes I'm afraid Classic will bore you quickly. To me, levelling is all about enjoying the grind, so pick a class you have FUN playing first.
---
Or play a night elf, shadow meld is a god send if you have to afk frequently
---
I've Mained Prot and Holy paladin. Prot Warrior, Destro Lock, Elemental Shaman, Frost Mage and Fire Mage, Mistweaver and Brewmaster.
---
With the exception of the Prot Warrior each spec have several talents to move around and change depending on situation, type of content and level of difficulty you are doing. If you consider each "node" of talent points as 1 talent, instead of the 5 it takes to max it out. There is more variety, and more impact in Retail talents than in Classic talents.
---
However it is shitty as fuck that there is only one every 15 levels, making progression feel really bad when leveling.
---
And then they updated T.O.S. something that makes half of this subs posts at any given time being actualy retarted.
---
What you're basically describing is what makes most people like Classic: there is no class that is optimal at everything, they all have strengths and weaknesses.
---
Yeah, polearms happened to druids either in TBC or Wrath.
---
Honestly, that's a horrible idea. 0.5 less casting time on Heal and Greater Heal is absolutely essential unless you want to constantly get sniped by people who specced correctly.
---
Hi to clarify, i'm not trying to create a character on OCE realm. This is a US realm i'm trying to create a character on
---
I spent all my silver in Org so I couldn't fly out, and had 45 minutes on my hearth. I did RFC again.
---
I pulled a mob just before another guy got there for the same quest, quickly lost as it was 3 levels higher, and this guy invited me to his party as I was ghost running back and said “Let’s try that again, shall we?” I don’t know why it simultaneously felt very nice and threatening. Ended up being a really cool interaction.
---
Yes it’s tameable. No it will not have the smoke effect.
---
If you think Blizzard is going to be making new content for Classic like Old School Runescape has you are quite delusional. They'll just re-release TBC once they run out of Vanilla update content.  
---
They're not going to mess with lore or add content and characters that "suddenly disappears" timeline wise.  
---
Classic exists to be Classic, not a new project.
---
The weird part is that HOTS has both an ANZ server and a Singapore server, so they do know that players from other countries play in these regions and have provided more options for a smaller game they abandoned.
---
This is so fucking hilarious. Especially from an Everquest vet like myself. Vanilla was the most casual MMO ever at the time.
---
Whoops. Fixed, thanks.
---
I hope it occured to you that a server with a 20.000 people queue has more people that play in uncommon time frames than a server with just a 1.000 people queue.
---
Yeah having done 3 dungeons so far, all I had to do was poly mobs and chain frostbolt. In one section I got to spam decurse on some mobs. I've seen one mob in a bfa dungeon do more dangerous things than every boss I've seen in classic combined so far, excluding hitting the tank for 45% of their hp every swing of course
---
Thank you for this. I finally understand!
---
Yes. Same situation when using a vpn routed through US.
---
Brokentooth is good because it has the fastest attack speed in the game which makes it do a lot of pushback to casters in pvp.
---
It's only subscription
---
You need an active subscription to play classic, it’s included. And it is entirely worth playing, it’s a super dank exsperiencr
---
Glad you’re enjoying it, keep up the good fun
---
I'm able to create chars on US realms for some reason
---
Yojamba forever
---
"Hold my beer I will update them. Whoops!"
---
5AM is the sweet spot. Any later and the queues will be starting.
---
Sure, it's a good tip to /join LookingForGroup. It's good to post LFG messages there as well, but you'll miss out on a lot of people if you don't use trade.
---
You can always brew some of this : https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7676/thistle-tea
---
Nah I’ll be playing NA servers but thanks for the consolation!
---
still I expect it to all go really bad again tomorrow when the weekend hits
---
like day1 bad
---
honest work
---
What addon is that hp /rage bar?
---
 [https://twitter.com/Blizzard\_ANZ](https://twitter.com/Blizzard_ANZ)
---
I guarantee it's a top concern of theirs.
---
So that when you accidentally missclick you get to play a Sub-optimal class for 2 days while you grind 50 Gold.
---
Amazing gameplay right there. A cost to respec only hurts the game in the long run, as it makes people reluctant to do things they are not optimal for.
---
"Well I could go PvP, but I'm a Prot warrior and PvP sucks as Prot."
---
"Well I could tank UBRS for this group looking for a tank. But I'm a Retridin for PvP and Retridins can't tank UBRS"
---
I guess the real test will be are the servers still crammed in 2 months? Will it still have the novelty factor it currently enjoys ?
---
EST server. Even for west coast players it’s 2am. Week days I would expect this to be a regular thing.
---
You only need a sub to play WoW Classic, you also only need a sub tot play current WoW till level 110

---
Yep, I ran some "test runs" on pservs to get an estimate.  
---
I know some values were off, but still, pretty good idea of where you should be at in 10 hours / 20 hours in.  
---
My estimate was BLOWN out of the water by the INSANE number of people on the same quests as me.  
---
I only took half a day for launch and I play warr so I'm really not ahead of the curve. I'm right in the middle of the pack and I have to play SO MUCH to compensate for all the roadblocks.  
---
Dropping some quests left &amp; right because they are straight up stupid to do.  
---
Dungeons seem to give some decent XP, and I can tank so there is that I guess.  
---
Some short holidays are coming early in September, I hope I can make up for my slowness since launch then.  
---
But I'm already way late on my plan.  
---
Kind of a poor experience so far. But maybe it's also just the Barrens that have always been a shitshow. Maybe next regions will be easier to cruise in with some more spells, talents, and shorter distances. Avoiding STV like the fucking plague it is on my PvP server though.  No way I'm spending days on end stuck in trash lvl 30 PvP action.
---
All oceanic classic servers offline since 2.45pm AEST apparently.
---
Always have potions/food on hand to heal/restore mana.
---
As a Warrior I will give you a SHOUT but it don't last long. Sozbros.
---
I help everyone I can, UNLESS they stole my mob -- happened once so far, where a lower level dude was already half-life, infight and firsthit the mob I wanted to pull. Well dude, watch me watch you die and take my mob in peace then.
---
Don't be a dick, and I won't be a dick to you.
---
Ouf you must live a hard life running around the internet calling people losers and autistic. I feel sorry for you poor thing :(
---
You must really love your character name.
---
"What does this large red button do.. hmm, lemme press it"
---
Found something called Shadosfang seems pretty shitty as a mage ended up getting like half a gold for vendor.
---
The items will sell if people are willing to fork the money for it. If they dont sell, who cares? Prices adjust to what people are willing to pay.
---
blizzardcs twitter account probably?
---
I'll definitely be wanting engineering at level 60 but I will also want access to alchemy, even if it via a guildy. Almost need to level both mining and herb now but that's highly inconvenient!
---
My thoughts exactly. Especially the "catastrophe of cataclysm"
---
Yeah the president should fire him
---
&gt;So why does being able to show other people that you did something "useless" suddenly make it worthwhile? 
---
Because you can actually prove it. This is the same reason why people like beeing able to look at the gear of other people or why so many raiders liked sitting around at the bank in Orgrimmar in their gear.
---
As a warrior, if I see someone running for their life I might help out if I'm in a position too. If I'm low on health, sucks to be you. My buffs dont work if you're not in my party.
---
Yes, everyone in Australia has the same problem right now.
---
This is going to come off really selfish, but in a PUG I don’t really care what other people “need” - I don’t have any attachment too them.
---
In regards to Dal’Rends and a few other nameable weapons I would give them the pass unless they were my BiS.. but only because in that exact moment it is nice to let that person be excited / happy. I know it feels good to get that huge upgrade.
---
But I really don’t think worrying about every person on the realm is a smart time investment. I’ve been that guy before and it becomes boring real fast.
---
Don’t play on OCE servers
---
The level of immersion in the world coupled with the music is top tier.
---
Retail might be great, but leveling 1-150 (or whatever it is) with 3 or more expansion missed is quite a wall to cross (i quit after TBC, played 24/7 at 60 cap). I've seen offers of starting at level 130 or something, but then it feels like i've skipped years of content and have no clue about where everything is in the world. No experience with all the new stuff added and if its actually good or not tho.
---
This said, i like the simplicity of classic wow... easy to step into and every zone is filled with players. I wouldnt start playing WoW again if they implemented 'classic feedback' into a new expansion, for me its just simple nostalgia and enjoying the little things like player interaction, playing the auctionhouse and dueling friends in front of cities.
---
Bfa development team must feel disheartened right now
---
:D ye
---
It will come back. Both times we've had the OCE realm die I had the same issue logging into OCE servers.
---
Hey man, to adress this, I have used "loremaster" to communicate more easily to people what my goal is, to pretty much acheive loremaster (without the achievement being ingame).
---
Why do I want to do that? I like it. On one hand, it is me being completionist. I finally have a chance to play classic, so I want to do it all there. I also read all the quests for entertainment, so I want to know all the lore. 
---
In short, it is one of aspects that makes it fun for me :)
---
He predicted it correctly for me. I didn't think I wanted Classic, but now that I have it, I'm not sure I'll even go back to retail.
---
Yeah, all of us OCE customers can't make characters anywhere. It's weird.
---
You're definitely not getting left behind. If anything you're sitting out the teething pains that servers are undergoing right now. You've probably seen all the queues and disconnect problems due to overpopulation/underestimated interest. Let the dust settle and you'll be all the happier for it!
---
how does that even work? did they just shadow ban everyone who has a character on an OCE realm from creating a new character?
---
Someone in my guild finally learned tailoring so now we're all busy grinding cloth to overflow his inventory with.
---
Get dis man a sheeld
---
There’s a few I tried out but not working. Let me know if you find one please
---
Dwarf Paladin is the closest thing to his secret favorite, Halfling Bard.
---
First time playing wow and im currently lvl 10 and addicted. My name is lemoncloak in ten storms realm. Feel free to wave.
---
I think they need to do that another 2-3 times until we have "acceptable" queue times in EU :D
---
Aren't WoW Tokens actually more lucrative, because they cost €20 instead of €12,99 while still only giving one month?
---
You can't have peak population 24/7 otherwise when it's ACTUAL peak you're sitting in a 20k queue to play, which means you had to login at 12am to play by 8pm lol.
---
You can join a max population server during off-peak and be like "oh the grass is so much greener here" but try actually playing on that server without access to your computer 24/7 and you'll find (like some of my friends) that you literally haven't even leveled to 2 yet.
---
Take your time and have Fun, it is viable.
---
Buffed a rogue on my way to rachet, and he hunted me down to trade me a weak troll potion and an armor potion!
---
Yeah everyone does. You'll get access again when they fix this, I'm sure. I had the same shit with my OCE characters last time before the realm went completely down.
---
There are no packages really. To play both the retail and classic wow, you need only game time / subscription (except you have to buy the newest expansion to play it's content in retail, the BfA). Classic is essentialy for both groups, the newcomers and veterans so don't be afraid to give it a try! Just keep in mind that classic may be a little more challenging at the beginning but you will get the hang of it. There are also discord servers for classes and Classic in general, there will be plenty of people that will advise you ^^
---
Wake up at 5 and log in instant. Early bird gets the worm is really true here. lol
---
Not that rare, many of us are people who come home around 17.00-17.30 and have obligations to around 19 each day
---
Don't buy gear. What you get from quests and dungeons is fine while levelling. 
---
Don't buy every spell, just the ones you need (if new to the game, check out a guide to levelling your class)
---
Take skinning, skin everything, vendor the skins.
---
Loot everything. Selling greys adds up.
---
&gt; Each class gets its own merits and flaws but you seem to be focusing on lvl 60 content, which imo is not the right way to enjoy Classic right now
---
Well I don't think picking purely for levelling is the right idea, because I play enough to inevitably get to 60 and if I don't enjoy my class then I really doubt I'll put in the time to get another up there.
---
&gt;and you will spend hundreds of hours levelling until then
---
Which is why it's important I pick a class that gives me the best chance at enjoyment imo. I don't want to pick a Warlock and spend 9 days /played just to realise the Soul Shard issue is something that absolutely kills my enjoyment and have to do it all over again.
---
&gt;If small hindrances like farming comps for poisons or needing ammo are enough to make you not want to play some classes I'm afraid Classic will bore you quickly. 
---
They aren't. There was a lot of other issues with rogues/hunters that I listed. Those are just some of the things that contribute to me being less interested in the class.
---
 Is queue still very long? Is there still players camping on mob spawns?
---
Clearly not if Blizzard has allowed it and continues to allow it for over a decade.  And before you default to saying "because of $$$" ... actual botters pay for their accounts also and get banned.
---
Found a 10 slot on [Foe Reaper 4000](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=573/foe-reaper-4000), it was fucking Christmas! (I killed it with a friend, both lvl 13 when it's lvl 20, plus it's insensible to taunt, fear, etc., I died but my friend just finished it)
---
God damn that’s why it was so inaccurate! Thank god I saved your post and now read this comment, haha! Cheers!
---
That is fine, I just wanted to make sure you know what you are getting.
---
NICE.
---
depends on the type of person you are, but there will definitely be guilds which you can join that will not require weekly raid attendance and will still be quiet active. The leveling experience is similar from 1-40 40-60, quests with a few dungeons in between. However the rate you will level will go down. If your someone who doesn't mind grinding then it won't matter whether you have 40 hours a week to grind wow or 5-10 there will definitely be something for you to do and aim towards.
---
Honestly it’s likely they weren’t 13 year olds, just that they were back when vanilla first came out....
---
Blizzard ANZ said on Twitter they didn't even know what was going and initially directed everyone to BlizzardCS. 
---
However the shit storm would be fucking hilarious if it was true.
---
Skullflame had no queue at prime time yesterday
---
You guys realize, you can do the same thing in retail, right?
---
Ive been walking instead of flying everywhere. I cant afford 1s10c to fly to SW from westfall. How would I be able to train my skills. I'm already several skills behind heheh
---
Still waiting for my first bag to drop.  Lvl 24 lock.
---
I hope this is true.. get your new char names ready bois
---
the fact that it was 4:16 and not a specific time and that it started with "its up" makes me think it really was intentional and why not now many more new blizzard viewers will see another blizzard product with the term "hearthstone' in the back of their head and more familiar.
---
Level 18!!!!!?
---
The compass isn't working for me :(
---
Yes, gonna wake up at 5 on Saturday and log in. No time to waste, a whole new wave of people are coming with the week-end I think.
---
Yeh I think the term comes from D&amp;D initially, and other games where you'd literally have to "roll" random stats. If you got shit stats and didnt realise, you'd be told to reroll.
---
Now it's like, I'm rolling up in my pimp pally digs goin BLAP BLAP BLESSING OF THE PIMP.
---
How about separate levels for each expansions ? :) You level up your character on Vanilla and you get lvl 60 Vannila character, then TBC hits and you will have to lvl from 60 to 70 but it will be your character TBC lvl. If you go back to Vanilla content you will still be lvl 60. But then your gear would have to scale down or you could have separate character sheet for every expansion. So you could say that you want to work on your vanilla gear, go to vanilla content and do some raids and get new gear. But you can still PvP in TBC with your 70 lvl and gear. Just idea what do you think ?
---
u can level all classes to 60
---
u can gank people in world pvp
---
u can do battlegrounds in phase2
---
you will be a little undergeared with just dungeon loot ( in the mid to late phases) which is more problematic for melees in particular I think cuz they are cannon fodder in big pvp
---
you can farm money and build up a twink ( low level pvp with *the best* items)
---
They can probably see in logs you been opening/closing you inv all day with 5-sec delay.
---
Sucks that grobbulus filled up. I wanted to play rppvp so badly but blizzard is a shit company and only made one server
---
On my paladin there was this gnome warlock who had accidentally pulled 3 or 4 gnolls. I ran in, healed him, and started hitting all the mobs to attack me. Though he was gonna turn and rub, but we fought off those goals and a few more patrols, just barely making it. The gnome gave me a health stone, thanked me, and went on his way. Idk, running in there and almost sacrificing myself made me feel like I was actually playing a paladin. Felt good
---
He's not pretending to be anything. Would you stop crying on reddit and get yourself together if there is indeed no way for you to play? Thanks.

---
I don't know how you'd do that in python, but I once did something like that in C# using autoitscript.
---
0. play a sound to let you know the loop is starting
---
1. open window with WinActivate ( "title" [, "text"] )
---
2. take a full screenshot
---
3. minimize the window with WinSetState ( "title", "text", flag )
---
Another option would be using CheatEngine or something similar to read the memory and figure out where the queue data is.

Just to add something that the other guys didn't mention. While sunder helps, consider grabbing shield block and revenge.  Use the first to proc revenge if you are proc starved and it'll really help especially in situations where your priest is rage-starving you with the bubble.  Also sometimes you gotta just let some shit go.  If people are actively splitting damage and full dotting everything (lolocks) eventually they'll pull something. Just hold what's most dangerous to clothies and let the casters go if you have to.
---
I'm low 20s and have done everything up to SFK as arms, in really bad gear, and things have been just fine.
---
They're mixing up max level dps optimal stats with optimal leveling stats. The sustain from Spirit is unreal.
---
And a fraction of people would use it. It wouldnt work out.
---
Running 5- and 10 man dungeons at 60 can be very fun. You don't have be working towards raiding or anything, just enjoy the actual dungeons for what they are, get good enough gear to be able to to pvp somewhat decently.
---
Just cast wisdom. They will be able to regain the mana they used to buff you or have less down time.
---
Yeah i found that difficult, i was hoping he would attack what i target automatically but he only does that when i get damaged or if i tell him to, is there anyway to make it so he auto attack what i target all the time
---
you burn yourself out, anyone who uses that argument is a delusional maniac. you have no reason whatsoever to go and rush to neck level 65 or higher EXCEPT youre playing in the &lt;WR10 dayraiding Week 1 or 2 Bleeding edge guilds. it's just your autistic completionist inside you that kicks in and/or tells everyone a high neck level is needed to kill boss XYZ. there IS no burnout, you are burning yourself out whereas you could just chill and still be not one more boss further behind or ahead. 
---
Also a lot of top guilds quit because of pretty much anything, every raid, since raiding was a thing. A lot of players shuffle around, new guilds come and go, and if CE raiding is your thing or has been your thing for the past couple of years, classic WILL leave you hanging in that regard. The bosses are not mechanically very challenging. So prepare to watch a LOT of people quit vanilla when raiding there becomes a thing.
---
And buildings too. The barracks near Dalaran or the pirates' cove buildings in Tanaris come to mind.
---
I can relate to that , more than i should lol
---
Did it rollback at all? No progress loss?
---
Jesus you both seem fking retarded
---
Yeap we all are exited, hype is unreal
---
Yesterday managed to get in for the first time because of damn queues and had a blast. Quested with people and added some, amd thats in 2h of playtime. Game never felt so good and alive.
---
So good luck to you during your grind :3
---
I asked here instead of somewhere else because all of you know how classic is and how it works and could tell me wich one is better instead of people who only played BFA.
---
But what do you do with the second mob?
---
how about handing out a renew and maybe a smite? shadow word pain ?
---
Thank you, this list is MUCH better
---
It's because they are pussies. They want Classic too, but don't have balls to participate.
---
felt dumb for making 6 silver rods and putting them all up at the same time, but surprisingly half of them sold within 2 hours
---
i feel rich
---
AUGH UUUUH
---
Same, same !
---
If it automates any kind of action, yes. Just having the programm open not using it to cheat is fine though. Plenty of people use it for work.
---
My weed dealer is on holidays, lord have mercy! 
---
How long til we get legal weed down under? Was in Colorado earlier this year and its fucking amazing; trying to located weed appropriate for medical usage is near impossible..
---
Australia still kicks the US’ ass though
---
I don't personally consider it a joke.  I consider it an observation.
---
Nice server cabinet. Be a nice quiet room
---
While there might not be AS many spots, there will definately be healing spots for druids. 
---
Could you elaborate on "classes like Paladin or Priest are better"?
---
Really it's not that different from the real world. Whatever that is.
---
If you have the money buy a motorized desk instead. The pain is from sitting too much, the medicine is exercise and standing more. With a motorized desk you can alternate between standing and sitting.
---
Also, exercise.

Ilvl 420 toon... Why mention that?

Ask any guard in a major city and they'll tell you where to find them. Good luck!

Icy veins has a pretty neat aoe (leveling) guide%

https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/classic-mage-leveling-guide
---
Good to see it's done jack shit, 6k queues on Golemagg EU already
---
That's exactly how Oldschool Runescape started.  At first it was a fun nostalgia thing until it started becoming more profitable then the main game and they figured out it was finally time to start listening to the players.
---
There are macros... Hunters, more than any other class, have a range of macros that make life easier.  Just Google "hunter macros vanilla" and you'll get some good suggestions.
---
You mean the pants that are really shorts?
---
send me a PM if you want an inv to our guild friendo!
---
Except the first one, none of these statements were EVER said by Blizzard.
---
Take it out to a nice dinner.
---
I've cherished every moment of my online time. It's truly amazing. Sense of community is real. Seeing players and helping each other out. Getting greens that feel like huge upgrades. It's bliss
---
I like your style
---
Yea I see  your point, exactly, you never know how many people are on classic reddit striving for something that is not in the game, I can easily see somebody going for loremaster actual achievement by not knowing acheivements are not there :)
---
Best thing ever.
---
Thank you.
---
none of those games except dota 2 had a big launch. they grew over time to this level.
---
Yeah someone shouted at me “tutsky! Back in the line!” I was just marvelling at this very British introduction to wow
---
wait ... aren't the barrens full of these cats?
---
No no no
---
Retail needs to die a this point. Classic only highlights the absolutely dreadful state of retail at the moment. The devs are probably very disheartened seeing millions flock to Classic and hardly anyone playing BFA. That should be a wakeup call for them, and I hope they listen for 9.0
---
Slow more than anything else. One mob at a time!!!
---
It’s like buying friends to play with because you don’t have any. With the added bonus of ruining the game for everyone around you.
---
kek
---
What server have you been playing on and would you recommend it so far?
---
Man why you gotta rub it in, I had to call in extra employees so I could stay at home and pass him..
---
Stormwind
---
Should I reroll to another server to be with my friends? We are all about level 14, but they are on one server and I am on another, would it be feasible to catch up? at most i will be able to play for an hour or so more than them a day. The server I am on isn't too high pop so i wouldnt switch for that anyway.
---
Good to see it's done fuck all, 6k queues on Golemagg EU.
---
Across from the ah there's 2 repair vendor and a weapon master
---
Fixed! Thanks.
---
lol, you aussie are salty today. Is wow not going well? I just hot my cat form. Super improvement
---
Oh boy, that was a mistake lol.
---
Isn't that trinket BiS for lvl 19 twinks?
---
Saying twinks feels weird now. Before I was just a young kid playing wow, now I'm a grown up that knows several actual twinks.
---
Fuck .. i just sold of my bronze tube that came from the captains locker in Westfall ... needed the cash hard for skill training :(
---
No it isn't, the challenging content in retail WoW is harder than anything that was in Vanilla WoW.
---
I main a demon Hunter... Tried to pull three mobs with my warrior. Got bitch slapped.
---
Hmm. Yes and no.
---
I think part of classic is giving your character a kind of *identity*. You're not just a Hunter, you're a *Beast Master* Hunter. If re-specs are too easy, you'd pick whichever spec works the best at the time -- for instance, you'd change spec to grind mats, and then have a different spec to do a dungeon, and another for a raid... all within a day. It waters that identity down.
---
On the other hand, that kind of happens anyway since optimal raiding builds change as you move through the raids -- then you have classes like priests who need to be shadow any time they're by themselves, but holy/disc any time they're in a group. 
---
I think the progressive price increase is a good middle ground. It lets you respec fairly often, but not so often as to damage your character identity.
---
This is also happening to a friend of mine
---
It's been amazing, I started in MoP so i haven't gotten to experience talent trees and weapon profs, so my friends and i are having a great time, also reading quest text is amazing! Scrolling quest text is so abysmal though
---
Only people who ruined this is your guild shouldve stuck to their guns lmao
---

Can spell ignorance without IGN
---
I've died about 10 times so far. I'm level 15. 
---
Classic is brutal and I love it. 
---
And if you say, that's not difficulty! You just made mistakes. That's why you died. 
---
Well... Yes. But then nothing is difficult by that standard. Just don't make mistakes.
---
I died about 15 times last night on a quest. But I finished it. It hurt so good and I’m having a ton of fun.
---
I started in TBC so first time playing classic for me. Having so much fun. Bought a lotto ticket after a 6 slot bag dropped. Hahaha. It’s the little things.
---
Buy a wand bro, con conserve that mana. as a level 6 priest with a lesser wand, i'm destroying and saving mana
---
If you have a smart phone, I plan to use chrome remote desktop to log in.
---
Hunter pets arent bad if you wanna pve, broken tooth is basically only for PvP.
---
Any class is viable end game if you are not in an insanely hardcore raiding guild.
---
"DAE get really hyped when you get this arbitrary item that removes  this tedious thing that was already replaced in the base game in retail. WHY DID BLIZZ REMOVE THIS, I LOVE NOT BEING ABLE TO CARRY ANY ITEMS"
---
Honestly, it amazes me how many buffs I get from random people in the starting area. It for sure is a pleasant surprise.
---
did the same thing
---
Lol gotcha bois, seeya on Yojamba
---
Got it  on my first kill. Would honestly rather have had a Cruel Barb. The blue chestpiece you get from the kill quest is ptetty damn good too.
---
Well the point with playing alone or friends is the fact it ''inspires'' me to play and get better than them. and have an easy group to dungeon with and quest together. when im alone im like meh ill do it later instead of right away.
---
It's all about the savory deviate delights!
---
"**Macros** can be created and executed within a single software application or by combining steps in multiple applications. The latter requires the use of **automation** software". 
---
Just got this with a quick google search and no, that's not automation. Multi-boxing is basically using Macros to operate multiple clients running at the same time.
---
Pre-launch I went from Golemag &gt; Shazzrah &gt; Firemaw. Managed to get to 5 on Firemaw at launch and haven't managed to log back in since. Went to Firelash and reached 10, but now that has a queue that seems to be growing day by day.
---
Where in EU is safe? I don't mind a queue  long as it's reasonable. I'm trying to play after work, so can't sit for 2/3 hours or else the night is lost.
---
Sweeeet
---
I’m having so much fun with shaman. The class just feels good to play. Definitely don’t roll shaman so I get more loot. Thanks
---
[Based on our perception of whether or not they are indoors?](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qBitMMvIWN0)
---
They're not going to open up free transfers this close to launch, it's still easy to reroll since not a lot of time has passed. Maybe in a month or two if servers are full.
---
Now thats a big off there. But they updated the servers and raised the max player cap. I see this as a win
---
Wasn't scrolling down at the trainers, what a dumbass.
---
Two handed axe of agility dropped yesterday during a group quest - both me and pala went "ooh" in group chat. Naturally I instantly went "hunter weapon!" And everyone sided with me due to the agility, not that that's a big concern (versus DPS) at level 15. Paladin passed :)
---
Let me know if he find solution, ill keep u update if i find something its really annoying
---
Bloodsail Buccaneers, and would definitely recommend it! Obviously it’s an RP server,  so if that interests you this is the time to get into it. I find it adds an extra level of immersion, and again some really interesting encounters I’ve enjoyed.
---
also went trough the anal \[randomAbility\] Goldshire/Elwyn chat, loved it.
---
Love how the login takes up the big screen while your kid watches cartoons in the smaller screen. The priorities are clear.
---
I dont know, never played alliance. There are different weapon trainers in each city.
---
That one is a rare spawn in the badlands and is one of the best pets for hunters because of its unique stats
---
Only really click evocation, never remember to use some of the other stuff and havent sat down to change keybinds. Been just tryna level.
---
As a shaman I literally need every stat and gear lol. At least I can’t use bows and swords
---
"/console rawMouseEnable 1" fixed it for me.
---
Go play with your friends! Thats always more fun
---
Hey, do you keep track of asian server?
---
I meant the number of people using the system for good reasons is rare compared to those who are using it bad faith. For example sitting afk over night or for 9+ hours as they go to work and come back for example
---
Keanu plays a hunter. Keanu needs
---
Ive been having trouble deciding between Druid or Paladin.
---
Druid
---
Pros
---
* Least played class
---
* Great leveler
---
* High PvP Skill ceiling
---
Cons
---
* Low demand for endgame content
---
Paladin
---
* High demand for endgame content 
---
* Amazing aesthetics 
---
* Best PvP healer
---
* Low skill ceiling 
---
* Highly gear dependant
---
Mine was pretty chill. Everything was 100% smooth. No talking, no mishaps, expert pulls.
---
Dankmeister did fall in the lava though. We had to help the priest find his body. Then it was back to the grind.
---
Thnaks a lot man I will do that instantly when I get home after work haha
---
It's a good point, it seems people Want it to fail, interesting...
---
If you want to play together with your friends, reroll on their server. Better earlier than later.
---
yeah that's rough, of course he is playing a rogue haha
---
Why? People love old school Runescape. Same concept. Same arguments that it would be dead a month after launch. Now it's 4 times bigger than rs3, years later. 
---
Classic will thrive. Some players will drop off of course but it will do very well.
---
Yeah i found that out pretty quickly
---
How is Rogue easy mode? It's one of the hardest, albeit not as heard as Warrior.
---
Warlock is top 2 leveling class along with Hunter
---
Crag boar, ribs.
---
I'm assuming that a single layer would actually be able to hold the amount of people still. I see no people aroind in my layer, so it's time they reduce layers
---
Maybe prepare a dish similar to what his fav race eats
---
Put a campfire under them. They will die
---
Thanks for the detailed response. Fist weapons look awesome so I'm happy i'll be able to use those (IDK if that's a stupid idea or not) eventually.
---
&gt;  just be prepared to struggle a bit when you first start using a new weapon type 
---
I don't think I \*haven't\* struggled yet, haha.
---
My bad
---
So the problem would be fixed by just assigning people to a default layer, so they see some people who are the same some of the time. Pretty easy.
---
Oh man, you NEED TO DO A QUEST at lvl 10 to get Def stance, sunder armor and taunt.
---
Good luck!
---
Hi Rain thanks a bunch for the Lion. I really wanted him as I had him in vanilla and my goal in vanilla is to re create my hunter to the point that i had got it back in vanilla.
---
The plan was simple wait in stealth &gt; steal the lion tag &gt; kill any horde that would try and kill it. 
---
Any way cheers for that love him to bits died about 7 times getting there too but worth :P already had a few comments about it.
---
[https://imgur.com/W8TV4an](https://imgur.com/W8TV4an)
---
No kidding, right?!  Who’s cuttin’ onions!?
---
You can make any class work if you are good at it. If you want to play druid, go for it.
---
The thing is, we got successful private server so why wouldn't vanilla work.
---
Zzzz. This is why talking to theorycrafters and followers is annoying.
---
Everyone's in whites and greens right now. We're gonna be in blues and greens for a long time yet. The point where a Mage isn't getting blown up by Ambush+Blackstab (timed with the tick) is a long way off.
---
I get it. You like Classic and want to play up the complexity, that's why we get idiotic non-comments like
---
&gt;&lt;CLASS&gt; have to strike a balance between damage and surviving, fake casting so they dont get interrupted etc. Choosing to use their CC at the right time to interrupt spells. 
---
But pretending Classic PvP isn't binary and trying to deep dive into an example with some "Well aktually!" bullshit isn't going to make me want to talk to you, it makes me roll my eyes and move along.
---
If you don't think Warrior should front-load damage, you go ahead and save your MS CD. Maybe it'll be handy later or something? I'll just keep doing me.
---
I’m on Skeram and have yet to be in a queue lol

---
Everyday the queue is a little smaller
---
Who is this guy ? Also does he has an Error in his account name by purpose or by a prediction ?
---
Also fuck him.
---
That's definitely a fair call, but, as a brand new wow player (long time mmo grinder) who plans to stick it out I think there's a lot more of us pure mmo fans who felt like they missed out on wow the first time around. Also, at least in the high pop, people willing to wait out 5 he queue times probably aren't quitting next week
---
When I first read that I thought he said FU or something like that, not a home homophobig slur. That's sad and disappointing.
---
Hol' up, youre telling me that I can in fact update my spells?
---
No you should apprehend greedy people and put them on your greylist, not inviting then again if you can help it
---
I really like the look of your robe. Where did u get that?
---
Hell, I ran into two of the same people even after logging out and back in. Layers are pretty well implemented, imo
---
You can also directly message me on reddit =)
---
I mean this was mentioned multiple times to those visionless people.  I just wish they made a couple of servers without layering so those people could go and sit in front of lv3 quest mob for 5 hours without any layering.
---
Wand spec BiS omegakek
---
Apparently he used a homophobic slur.

Absolutely legendary: Keanu decrees
---
Talents in Classic are fairly subtle, with the option for most classes to pick up obvious play-style changes (through talent abilities) every 20 levels or so. When you get Mortal Strike at 40, it's a game-changer.
---
But subtle doesn't mean they aren't impactful. The way Classic is tuned means that a 35% increase on Rend's bleed damage, or saving 3 rage per Heroic Strike makes a big difference in your ability to kill things.
---
If you want to test how impactful talents are, reset them and don't spend any points. It's like playing on hard(er) mode.
---
He is not the Guildmaster he is just an Officer
---
ZT is the best.
---
I'm enjoying it a lot.
---
Questing in the old zones (barrens currently) brings back so many memories.
---
New quests leading me into stonetalon mountains...it's amazing.
---
Did one run of rfc yesterday and i'm planing to do wailing caverns today or tommorrow. Damn i can't wait for it!
---
So so good. Glad we're back home.
---
Question: can you go back and accept/complete quests that are way below your level (i.e. grey) and if so, do you still receive the same rewards, such as reputation?
---
So this really makes me wonder if it's because this time around they are hosted in Australia, known for its shitty internet. Previously (when I played), perhaps even now on retail, Oceanic servers are hosted in LA data centers.
---
I don't know about that, but I've heard that you'll be pulled to a layer with your guildmates if possible. If you have people on at all hours, that effect would basically result in your whole guild on the same layer consistently.
---
No, but you don't multibox to have 25 Shamans. You multibox to level them up and sell the accounts, which is against the rules. Therefore, multiboxing = intent to break EULA.
---
Isn't that the 1st of May?
---
No man you're not the only one dealing with this. Literally my best friend and I said we're both grown-ass adults with families started to have passive aggressive behavior with one another because we Duo played 95% of the division 2 together and would often wait 30 to 40 minutes for the other person to login but I just feel like that can be expected from one another in WoW. If anything everyone should be encouraging each other to go do what ever you want in the game.. Shit happened, half the continent crashed people got called in to work.. 
---
I feel like the people that don't have time off or didn't take time off are slightly upset with themselves for not taking time to play and are now taking it out within their guildmates that did take time off. So if you have friends out there that did take time don't get online and yell at them you can't come home and kick the dog after bad day at work.
---
Hope it buffs out soon.
---
Tauren females have BiS /dance.
---
Re reading his tweet, it sounds right. When I first read it I thought he said FU or something like that. This is disappointing.
---
Yeah the stats make a difference, so 3int would give to. 30 more mana. Strength will increase your damage in bear form, etc. Like I said, you can learn to use different weapons in Darnassus, Stormwind and Ironforge. Just Google alliance classic weapon trainers and you should find them, or ask a guard in any major city
---
You think you want it.
---
Maybe they want to incentivize playing on the international realms then. I recon we’ll see population drops in the next few months anyway, so maybe they are trying to steer us towards playing there, to keep at least a few servers halfway populated. But that’s tin foil hat talk, hopefully ;)
---
I've sent in my voidwalker to help a warrior taking on three mobs and barely escaping alive, only to die myself. At least I feel a little good.
---
Yeah it is. Not 100% sure about Vanilla. But i would go there every time it spawned in TBC with my friend who ran a 19 twink. It was alpha omega to hit the hours, when we were at LAN parties. Good times. He eventually got it. Some of the most fun memories i have from BC is from Gurubashi Arena.
---
In literally a week or two max, every server is going to be easily accessible. Time to find a new guild if you ask me. Yours didn't seem very stable and I don't know if I would even want to raid with them given the opportunity
---
I actually love that there is no mythic raiding and only one raid difficulty in classic, I don't care if the bosses are simple. 
---
Only reason I pve on retail is because I wanna have the gear for arenas. If you wanna do any serious arena you need every gear piece you can get because gear and procs basicly play the game for you in BfA. It used to be about outplaying, but now it's nothing but getting the most insane gear and playing the most obnoxious comp available to your class. I hate it and is one of the many reasons I'm leaving retail.
---
I sat in Brill for 2 hours making bags for people and I was happier and felt more achieved than through the entirety of Legion and BfA. This truly is the ultimate game for me.
---
Water breathing is the most underrated Buff on the game. Change my mind
---
I guarantee you that there was at least 1 tech guy at the company who tried to convince the people in charge as they were shaking their heads, that the server needs more attention and this will not go down well. Only he/she was ignored, because money.
---
Sorry cant increase server cap our 1998 hardware is maxed out RN
---
Archeage had pretty long queues on launch, i wouldnt say it is doing that great nowdays.  
---
I dont think and don't wan't classic to die but WoW is huge and Vanilla had such an impact in gaming history that its going to make a huge noise on launch, but no one truly knows how successful it is going to be. We can only wait for the hype to fall off and see how many people will keep playing, everything else is baseless assumptions. 
---
Tbh i'm not even impressed with how long the queues are, considering how bigger games have become since then and how classic appeals to old players to check it out.
---
To be fair at deadmines level, that was probably his first ring. At least it had a stat that is useful.
---
So if you open it at 2:59 will one spawn at 3:00?
---
Instead of helping and using my soul stones to summon my void walker. I spent the entire cave cooking spicy health stones for the fam. Warlock best healer I.m.o.
---
The last actual social experiences (outside of my guild) I can think of that I had in retail was way back in Wrath when I organised Gold DKP runs to Onyixa's Lair (the level 80 relaunch version). That's only because I actively caused them with the loot method. 
---
I think real social gameplay must of died somewhere during Wrath for retail.
---
I usually just rez dead people i see
---
Better be free, they are the ones who fuucked up. EU had only 2 pvp servers at the beginning, let that sink in  lol
---
We are not cows. We are Tauren. Our bovine brethren are different. Please cease you insensitivity.  Earth Mother guide you
---
If that's what you think then you don't understand the situation at all.
---
That's why I'm telling you to go wit hthe flow even if it sounds stupid. Gimmicks and quirks of classes can be hit or miss depending on people. I remember enjoying picking herbs for my rogue back in the day, it was part of a routine and we made it fun with guildmates. Classic is very social, most of the mundane or downright boring stuff gets much more interesting when you interact with people. That's just my opinion, but it's coming from someone who almost had a 60 on each class... And I can ensure you if you don't pick a class you love leveling with you'll never make it to max level.
---
It's Classic WoW. You're probably still going to have one of those 6-slots in your 40s.
---
Because they know those dungeons after playing BfA for a year. They have been playing Classic for 2 days.
---
Canopy Leggings?
---
Jokerd 49
---
I find a good balance to only upgrade by AH if a gear slot is severely under my level or if sonething really good is available really cheap
---
When he says "gamers not wanting the thing they think they want", he's not talking about people new to wow.
---
Imagine trying to run to orgrimmar to buy a guildcharter to create the guild and being locked out of the game because all major cities had connection issues. Imagine being set back to a 6 hour queue.
---
Not everything is the players fault "lmao".
---
The only people still complaining about queues are causing their own problem.
---
im lvl 10 and have 3 silver lol rip
---
Really? I bought em for 3 silver each at the auction house yesterday. Guess i learned the hard way too.
---
Wouldn't you be the one who cares way too much about this game if you're this triggered over people not queueing?
---
Yeah hunters get endlessly nerfed and changed, hard to want to go through that
---
a) He was groomed for it, like every "inhereting" president/CEO is
---
b) Being right in a Q&amp;A x years ago isn't a key competence of a company president/CEO
---
You ain't no artisan
---
There actually is sharding believe it or not, even with so many people on screen. Most times when I join friends we need to be in the same group to see each other. Blizzard said they will probably remove the sharding mechanic in phase 2 of content release once server populations have stabilized.
---
The pain. I felt it... I loved it. Then I got cat form
---
Thank you all so much for last night, it was absolutely epic.

IIRC they give the same rewards but significantly decreased exp and they still give the same amount of reputation. The single best way to farm reputation for epic mounts of other classes in classic was during the AQ event though. You could farm high level mobs and turn in stacks of materials to gain reputation with whoever you chose. That is how my undead rogue alt obtained the first cross factional mount on my server in a race versus everyone else.
---
Did you just assume my anatomy? Triggered.
---
My wife and I divorced because of this. She won't let me put it in her queue-per.
---
I played a mage, but I only went to level 6 and rerolled because I found I was hitting mobs with my staff so went back to my first char which was a paladin but I don't want to play it again so went back to a hunter but not sure if I want to play hunter to be honest.
---
I really want to play a mage but I just felt that it was very annoying to hit kobolds with my staff.
---
Have you tried using the in-game raid frames? They are like the retail ones and can be positioned where ever you want. Should be in the interface settings and raid frames. Can be used in any amount of teams, just enable it.
---
Dad's as mom
---
Dude I play on ZT and I'm getting the same thing . I feel like a giddy schoolchild just thinking about the hours that I've played so far. I could literally talk for hours about what's happened in game so far and I'm only level 15 ..... I fucking love classic
---
Skipping work is exactly what it is
---
/ty gets the job done
---
Whomever made the choice to roll on a different server abandoned the guild . Let them have fun in their server and recruit more.
---
All jokes aside, I hope yall get back in and have fun :)
---
Work on your personality bud and take a shower or two, you are not entitled to knowledge.
---
Best idea
---
Yeah we back homie &lt;3
---
I think it's more likely that it came from Tolkein. 
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirion
---
Thanks
---
You could always go back to retail 😏
---
**Tirion**
---
In J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium, Tirion upon Túna was the city of the Noldor (and earlier, the Vanyar, who later moved into Valinor's interior) in Valinor.  It was from here that Finwë ruled, and where his sons Fëanor, Fingolfin and Finarfin lived.

YES.

Naowh 45
---
Yea, I don't want to say that it's not possible :D.
---
Setting the window active and inactive again is a solution, but not what I want, because I can't really play games while waiting in queue if every x seconds/minutes the wow window pops up :D.
---
And CheatEngine will most likely result in a ban, I guess?
---
I actually get the number with pytesseract really accurately. It's just quite annoying to have the wow window always active and in front of everything else...
---
But well, maybe I have to look into the OBS source code to get what I want...
---
I don't think there's anything wrong with retail it's just a different kind of rpg. In classic you're an adventurer. You start off with nothing and work your way to greatness. In retail you're already great, you're the warrior in full T2 gear everyone in classic oodles at when they go to iron forge. You login and do the big fights then log off. 
---
Blizzard never figured out how to keep that adventurer feel after 60. Imo that's their real challenge.
---
Westfall Tunic is definitely the way to go.
---
makes sense, but i've seen it from people who don't even play wow. i don't really get it.
---
I've set my graphics to 3 (classic) just to see the glorious old water!
---
Yeah fair enough. Guess I'll just go with Druid since it's the one I'd play if none of those issues existed. Always loved shapeshifting and seems a lot more fun in classic. Thanks!
---
This is great, I've been brainstorming about how i could get in queue before leaving work. Saved for when I get home, cheers!
---
This is exactly what makes classic so great
---
Layers do kill the server community. Every time you log in - or change layer - the whole server population changes. Everyone you meet is a new one. The whole point of server community is that you do know other players on the servers and your actions matter. With 10-20k players (vs. 3k in retail vanilla) it doesn't mean jack shit.
---
Layers do not belong in vanilla. They never did. They were implemented only for the launch. There's no need to defend them to exist post-phase1. They mess up with world bosses, world PvP and server community. With layers on post-phase1, WoW classic would be just another retail expansion - just with different content and instances.
---
https://i.imgur.com/akh1r3p.jpg
---
Here's the dessert section from the WoW cookbook, hopefully it sparks something!
---
Tricked the system ;-) I might just make a macro and never log off since the queue is over 5k most of the time. I could also go to bed extremely early and wake up at 3am.
---
Infinite cats and infinite laptops
---
I am thinking about ditching two of my friends to join another server. Playing on Shazzrah is no fun at all... mostly just sit in queue unless I leave the PC on for the day and queue up at around 12-13.
---
My friends that play have scattered throughout the servers now, which kinda sucks.
---
I kinda wish we were allowed raid groups for quests just for the first weeks though. I ended up dungeon skipping the Barrens after 15 because of how many 6-10 minute timer quest mobs there were with like 5 groups at each. 
---
I can't imagine classic feeling any less immersive grouping up in 40 man raids to finish Boss quests in less than 30 minutes. Its still working with others, you just don't have a single group taking a ten minute quest spawn.
---
Man. That is still something.
---
Fuuuck, I forgot about that. 😂
---
Thanks for the reminder!
---
Thank you for the advice, will have a look at them!
---
I remember in vanilla my first warrior was a troll fury warrior and I was stacking spirit for the HP regen, lol.
---
I have played both Shaman and Druid at this point, and you will end up having to o use your weapon for mobs as they get stronger due to mana issues. I think this is similar for most caster classes
---
Sweet. Thanks for the crash course!
---
technically only if every realm is full
---
iirc last night only 1 or 2 wasnt full in my region so that wont apply
---
That is intense lol
---
or ''harder'' bosses.
---
i think ''classic was easy'' is a red herring, only the community &amp; not being able to skip dungeons / raids matters. when they failed that, starting at woltk, where i stopped my sub, they failed.
---
grind is real, and without grind people would complain lack of content. we will see if vanilla was at that sweet spot.
---
Welcome to the Light my friend.
---
Excuse you, we buff water breathing AND detect invis. 2 of the most needed leveling buffs.
---
Doesn’t seem to be!
---
I asked a question. I never played retail. Classic is my first time.
---
It's as great as I expected and remembered. The sense of community is there again. Chats are alive, people help eachother (even in passing), buff eachother, group organically for harder quests... I also love being poor and having to prioritize where to spend money, having to work to level professions/ skills, and so on. 10/10 best game ever once again.
---
I've made a Char on Hydraxian cuz of the queues on Gehennas, and I respect the unwritten roules on RP servers. And planning on go back to Gehennas as soon as the queues are better. Cuz 12k ppl and 9.5h queue is not what I want right now (or ever).
---
My build right now is 5/5 wand specialization, 5/5 spirit tap, then working down holy focusing on damage talents (holy spec, searing light, etc) until I get 5/5 spiritual guidance, and then working down disc until I get divine spirit.
---
Healing is so easy as a priest, and shadow is so poorly optimized below level 40, that the above build is actually the best healing *and* damage build for leveling.
---
Brilliant, thank you! Also you totally read my mind as to why i was wondering, i joined right at the start of TBC so missed the AQ event first time around :)
---
Inbefore queues get stronk at 4 am lol
---
**This** will teach the industry a lesson. People said the industry changed so much, that's why they cannot return to the old roots and make games like old WoW. The screenshots show otherwise...
---
C#
---
90 silver?? holy fuuuuuck that's big money right now just to use a weapon type
---
Lmao I wish I could see the persons face who opened it
---
Great, thanks! :)
---
You mean you don't have a ~~minion~~ friend who is a tailor?
---
But shaman goes with weapon and a shield so can melee right? same for druid regarding shapeshifting. However mages ... I want to play one also for the utility kit. 
---
Is also worth to mention that I will play mostly on my own that's why I'm considering paladin and hunter also.
---
this is actually brilliant customer service.
---
I sincerely hope that phase 6 is at least 1,5 years or even better 2 years from now. It's a impossible decision to make compare to making classic.
---
This has been a blessing for people who had to work all day during the week, weekend here I come
---
Logged in at 6-7 pm and had to wait 45 min. Maybe you were lucky?
---
I believe that is correct, 1% dodge and 750-1250 absorbtion on use with a 30min cd. Pretty damn strong for level 19.
---
And TIL what twink actually means, never thought it had a meaning outside of WoW.
---
Good man. 
---
My 8 year old daughter plays the same way, but I’m letting her figure her out how to play without me breathing down her neck.
---
Yesterday my friend told me "come lets play a bit classic" i was "nah want to paint some Warhammer" after a bit discussion i logged in and made my hunter and damn that was the best dicision it was a huge throwback into old days. I was even happy about those god damn weapon skills!
---
daaamn thats dope
---
I am curious how many of these posts are actually classic people that try to make impression of them being foremer BFA guy who suddenly enjoys the game despite hating it at first.
---
But on the other hand, seeing how many people were watching and playing classic on release,... it is not unrealistic that these are real!
---
The names though...
---
 Download the twitch desktop app and then go to mods then click world of Warcraft in that section. All you do is click the addon you want install boom, done.
---
Nice! I considered going hunter again, really only to have humar the pridelord again  but i decides to go mage for a somewhat new experience :P
---
Same.
---
Recieved one buff from all the druids I have buffed on my way to 22. And I buff generously.
---
F*ck I hate swearing (hence my down-vote)
---
Roll. Allways roll.
---
Litterally thiefs... Omg
---
It still has gold and a few other bits in it
---
I'm not sure if you've noticed yet but the times are not consistent or true in any manner
---
Hey, following your little guide and it's been helpful.
---
1 question, i just got a wand but i still have a main hand slot available. Should i have a dagger equipped there or something else?
---
Ah, a fellow Skullflame homie!
---
I forgot to use my talent points. I was up to three by the time I remembered. Was just lost in the game.
---
You can't have your cake and eat it. Concessions need to be made in order for people to actually play. 
---
It was never going to be the perfect vanilla experience be thankful we can play on official servers as it is.
---
Or just be my brother and almost roll for a mace Hunters can't even wear. And every 2-Hander. I'm always surprised how much Hunters need Int, Agi, Str, Stam, WP or literally any other stat including the Damage of the Weapon in his Eyes. He literally is "The Hunter".
---
The chose short term outrage about queue vs. longterm server/community stability. In December we wont prolly remember this struggle at all.
---
Not in a guild bit that is a possibility.
---
It's basically sharding except not shit, it's what sharding should have been.

---
I played Vanilla and Classic is as grindy as I remember.However I am planning to use my experience to avoid some of the issues I had when I started.
---
They're about 140 gold and one token gives you 30 days.
---
TBC rep values were higher.
---
So we can say that WoD was a pretty successful expansion? Because as i remember it had a huge launch too.
---
Win+Shift+S
---
Me too! Hail Hydra :p
---
No, it is not possible at lvl 40 with classic values. If you start at lvl 1 as a human in teldrassil you’ll end up with ~4000/21000 into revered. It’s possible to get it before 60, but it requires morrowgrain or cloth turnins.
---
Do I need to buy you a drink before sexy milking time ;)
---
It will not be there at 2:59. People are always camping it around the spawn time. Literally always. Even during TBC when I tried to get it, I never actually managed to be alone to loot it. I've always had to fight to get any chance to loot it.
---
Mine is called Thanlos. It's going to snap it's fingers and get rid of at least 50% of retail wow's player base.
---
from what I had witnessed they‘re pretty accurate (well maybe 30mins longer). and that was with queues ~12k people in it
---
Individualism killed wow. No one needs anything from anyone and everyone is special.  
---
In classic you are just a foot soldier, worthless alone. If you want something you are gonna have to work your ass off with other people.
---
This is just like millionaires who get bored because they have everything. Same mentality.
---
Am I safe to assume people would be fine with queues up to 60 minutes? Is it where the patience of average Joe runs out?
---
imo they need to add nomi to classic

I guess for the next week or two there isn't any market for materials, since ppl don't have gold yet. I'm pretty sure those guys making gold with skinning are just straight up selling their stuff to the vendor. I mean everyone is killing skinnable stuff. It's essentially free real estate 😂
---
Slow MH fast OH
---
I'm confident I'll make it to 60 and enjoy the game for a while after that. I'm not alone in this, and I don't understand why so many of you are determined to tell us otherwise.
---
Aah that sucks..  
---
Thanks for the info!
---
I miss the days of beta where it was much easier to get a cross faction mount. You could just get a priest to mind control the vendor for you because riding skill was generic and not specific to mount type. lol
---
You could also get cross factional mounts in beta with many orcs running around on human horses and night elves on raptors.
---
Thank
---
&gt;Whomever made the choice to roll on a different server abandoned the guild .
---
But thats the thing, it's the majority who did. Most of them know each other IRL as well.. So there is kind of a "we are the majority, so its our way or not".
---
If you need it you need it just be prepared for rage 👀
---
doesnt seem to be!
---
Do you think its possible to catch up then? bearing in mind im on a warrior.
---
I hope you burn.
---
Does anyone actually wait 3 hours to play a game? That sounds absurd
---
Yeh, it is kinda ridiculous how many people don't know what was and what wasn't in Classic.
---
We all need gold mats are fair game
---
I think theyve said offocially that the number cap is 30k.
---
Servers are so busy that people probably won't remember your name. Just roll need on everything!
---
\^\^ I was trying to complete some underwater quest in Darkshore and drowning got me twice...  
---
It was camouflaged chests, okay?
---
Allied races for Classic!
---
Just got finished with a three hour run, presto shaman rolled on 3 fang drops, won them all. I at least got my bow. Still sad though.
---
It does affect them, in some ways it is a referendum on modern culture
---
You want your MH weapon to have the highest top end damage, usually that means it's the slowest weapon but once your start crossing tiers (Dungeons into MC, MC into BWL, etc) this won't always be the case. You want your offhand weapon to be as fast as possible for poison procs and if you're combat swords, sword spec procs.
---
Yup, I played the content of cataclysm for a few days then cancelled my subscription. It had already changed in spirit by that point, with the dungeon finder already having destroyed part of the core of the community, but that really topped off the removal of the charm the game had.
---
https://stackoverflow.com/a/753157/10617365 first result, same code.
---
All caster will have this problem early on. I play a Priest after 2-3 Smite the mob is on me and it is easier and faster to hit in melee than to try and cast.
---
Staves are really hard-hitting in Classic so there should be no dmg loss, at least early on. Later Mages can destroy everything they pull in a few casts, only downside drinking after a few mobs.
---
Cheers !
---
I’d happily move to another server if I didn’t lose my progress.

Zandalar Tribe is absolutely epic. Had so much fun yesterday.
---
Blizzard is handling a impossible task imo.
---
I know it's not high ilvl now and it's irrelevant, but the point I was trying to make is that it took me a lot of effort to get prior to me un-subbing, it's still one of my very early characters (I think I had it in TBC) and have gone through everything with him, the good, the bad and the ugly. Thick and thin. It's the fact it was so easy for me to drop 12 years of character "progression" in order for me to escape back to a time where the game was in its golden era (I say this loosely, as I class vanilla, TBC and WotLK as the golden era).  A time I would happily spend the remainder of my WoW years.
---
They won't get banned, they're the poster boys and girls.
---
This post is based off of user submissions, so if anyone submits one then yes i will track them :)
---
As long as the game mechanics are the same and feels the same, I don't mind if it looks prettier.
---
Nothing is really "difficult" in Vanilla. And the game is researched to the bottom, so everything is easy to learn.
---
Be advised that the *raid* tanking may require a lot of grind.
---
Tbh , like someone else pointed out . They don’t seem like the type you want to raid in classic with anyway . Will it be their way or no way when it comes to who gets loot as well ? There’s going to be plenty of guilds to pick from !
---
Good for you! I'm also playing a shaman, I love all the choices in Totems. Looking forward to healing later :)
---
If you have vacation or whatnot, log in at 7 am, thats the best time and then dont log off ...
---
i think there is some huge disconnect in what you are saying vs what people saying retail is harder.
---
at the top end of content, retail is miles and miles ahead of classic in terms of mechanical difficulty, just compare the safety dance from naxx with god damned hans and frans in mythic. there is just no comparison. 
---
but compare LFR tank and spank fights to classic...
---
in the goal to make everything accessible, blizzard have cheapened the reward and experience of doing something. they have dropped the skill floor way lower but I would 100% argue that the skill ceiling is also raised a lot.
---
Only because we’ve lost a bit of perspective on how basic vanilla was, and how legit hard and time consuming it was. The current game is great mostly because of QOL updates. 5m buffs were not cool. Unconnected flight points were not cool. Rose coloured glasses and all that. I’m enjoying it. It brings back memories.
---
dont addons like gatherlite or whatever already know the herb spawn spots?
---
Look at this guy! Already lvl 14!

[MFW](https://media1.tenor.com/images/0cf8b8b298edf6e0f297839451042dd6/tenor.gif)
---
Are you seriously asking if it's possible to catch up to level 14? That's like 4-5 hours of determined levelling at best man.
---
No sadly. You have to collect them first and then they show
---
Also rogues will have a lot of cooldowns making overpulls easier to handle and you can just vanish if all else fails. First aid is definitely your friend between pulls to minimize downtime.
---
as long as I'm logged in it's great, but the queue and crashes are destroying the fun.
---
free transfers pls
---
A problem arises when you think about that this isn't really represantive for the whole game. As soon as you are out of the starting areas it gets way more smooth.
---
The shaman can use more weapons, true, and druid eventually gets forms as well. But until that, you're using your autoattack with staff/mace what have you
---

remote control your computer from work and start the queue 2-3 hours before coming home.
---
I think it was just again this certain "vocal minority" that didn't want them. Seemingly they thought having 1.000 players at once in the starting areas would be a great idea.
---
I know I'm the living meme here, but as a hunter if it's an upgrade for me I don't care - I will roll need.
---
The classic community has some loud and toxic elements.
---
Multiboxing was perfectly allowed for all of WoW's  history,  including vanilla. Hard to make a case that classic would be somehow different.
---
And you're hitting the nail on the head on one thing: it is not versatile. we can not adapt as well as a group consisting of individual players to different situations, which means that on even numbers against an organized opposition, the boxer generally loses. This is why boxers have never been competitive in arena or RBG.  People over state the value of just the focus fire we gain tremendously in any situation that is not 5v1 to begin with. If you're comparing a group of characters to one, then of course the group is stronger.
---
The reasoning why it is allowed goes more or less like this*     (* this is my interpretation of the matter based on the official comments on the matter that I've seen)
---
1. Can I buy 2 or more licenses?
---
 --&gt; Yes. This is sometimes required, for example when a parent buys an account for their kid. Additionally free market and all that jazz.
---
2. Can both be online and played at the 
---
same time?
---
--&gt; Yes. Similar reasoning as above, both individual game licenses so they have the same "rights" as any other license.
---
3. Could I control both myself?
---
--&gt; sure. As long as you indeed control them.
---
Now, the reason why multiboxing software is OK is because initial iterations did not use any software. You'd have a contraption that allows you to press a key on multiple physical keyboards or have one wireless keyboard sending to multiple PC's receivers.  As no software is required, a ban on software is more or less arbitrary.
---
Think of it like this: you put a popsicle stick over your 1-5 keys and press down on it. One physical press, 5 keys got pushed. Did you automate 4/5? If so which ones? Blizzard says this does not fall under their definition of automation of gameplay. This is what multiboxing software does. It is just a bunch of fancy virtual popsicle sticks.
---
In EverQuest there was a Bard guild with NPCs named Sansa and Joffrey.
---
&gt; I see some people in game complaining and trying to get other people to complain with them or even move to retail and no one ever goes along with it. 
---
I think you answered your own question.  These people are playing retail.  Sunken cost fallacy.  They can't stop playing because they feel they'll lose their "investment".  BFA lost a lot of players, so naturally, they want classic to fail because they feel it will bring players back.  They're not going anywhere regardless.
---
I randomly rolled a character on Hydraxian Waterlords EU and I haven't seen a queue yet. It says the server is medium pop though.
---
What I don't get is whether the server queue is a temporary issue or it will stay like that as long as the pop is more or less the same. In this case people either will have to move elsewhere or wait for the hype to drop a little.

---
It’s not that it’s hard it’s just completely different from every other position/role
---
&gt;it's still easy to reroll since not a lot of time has passed
---
I took 1 day off for the launch, played a 24 hour session. Now I'm back at work, fulltime. That means the 24 hour setback would take me at least ~5 days to get where I was. I have my responsibilities as an adult. I was really happy with a headstart but I guess it went to waste anyway.
---
This is a disingenuous argument. Whilst yes, I can log onto X server WoW is a social game with probably most people already having their social connections in place (guilds etc) it's not really fair to say "Well you can ditch all your social connections and go play on this server"
---
Sweet man. Just 5000 people in front of me and I’m good to go!

Shadowfang is very rare zone drom Shadowfang Keep. Its very good twink weapon. That was a mistake to sell it for 1 gold.
---
TOS is bad argument as TOS says the can ban you for whatever reason.
---
It's fake news to say "macros get you banned but mechanical devices do not". On Blizzards end mechanical devices show up on logs just like bad macros, repeating actions on same interval
---
Yea like the other guy said, you will need a team, or prepare for everything taking ages to complete and you will die a lot even in a group, when you get to westfall you will realize that from ALL the quests you can get(like 5-6) you will only be able to solo it without much stress, you need to grind exp too, Warriors need gear to do well.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cw4rbj/race_to_world_first_160_table_live_updating_as/ is the only thing that I've seen lately that gets updated somewhat. At least you'll get an idea where some high level players are.

Let me guess... 3 hour queue so ye both pissed off to the local bar for a pint whilst ye were waiting? :)
---
So, let me preface this by adding I won't be playing too much as I also have other games in really enjoying atm. I'm currently considering mage, warrior and priest. If prefer playing undead but I can go for another race of its especially good for the class.
---
Seeing as Holy priest is supposedly super tedious to level solo, it can be safe to assume to won't be too common, especially since so many people tend to be practically afraid of healing. So it should be safe to assume that finding groups for group content should be fairly doable no?
---
Mage has a lot of useful qol utility like conjured water/food (and teleport?) plus those deeps.
---
Warrior is warrior, nuff said, also, can tank. Hooray.
---
Shaman for dat windfury is also a thing of course but I get the feeling there will be a lot of those running around for that very reason, and if I go with warrior I would probably be able to just exploit all of those guys for that anyway.
---
I have a level 4 or so mage already I played for a bit today as I had some free time... Erh any input would be appreciated. :P

I've never played WoW before, back in 05-06 I was playing different MMO, not so rich but also kind of similar, so for me its nostalgia too and the bonus is, im discovering everything.
---
I like the difficulty, the social aspect that works. And yes, little details will actually tell you, its a game made with passion.
---
So - so far so good.
---
Haha no this Guy/Girl could be exactly me 😃.
---
I'm playing on medium, 8k+ queues
---
As a warlock, I give them Unending Breath so they dont drown in their own tears when they die.
---
Many people have guildies, friends, and/or family they want to play with. Once half of your social group is on a server they are unlikely to switch.
---
That being said you've missed a big point. If everyone did what blizzard said and spread out perfectly there would be 4k queues on every. single. server.
---
Deviate delight? I was planning on making my horde there.

Fist weapons as a druid won't really work. Mechanically you can equip them and you do gain the stats but druids get no chance on hit mechanics when they are in a form (cat/bear) and the stats on a lot of fist weapons simply aren't that good for druids (Plus fist weapons are very rare in vanilla)
---
Haven't subbed yet, and im glad. The queues be it for login or even quests look like hell and with my 2 hours of free time a day, not worth it at all
---
Can you play classic with a free trial account?
---
As a druid I throw out rejuvs, buffs and cleanses as I go
---
Probably a dynamic spawn rate
---
Ah that makes sense! Thank you :)

healing dungeons with my druid, this is how i feel when cloth drops.

Yes. Retail is bad.

I was on the alliance side of this. I am a newbie to World of Warcraft, and I have never ever tried anything like this before, but it was really, really fun even with all the lag
---
lmao this is one of the funniest comments I've read today, cheers good sir
---
Found the troll.
---
i love gunshot sound. But incoming forced bows on high-levels make me sad
---
Great to read something like this.
---
There is no excuse not to Play it if you enjoy it and get good times from it. Even if you work as hard as you describe.
---
Now I work 40hrs a week which is not even close to your times. But with Family and other stuff there sometimes just is very limited time.
---
It's great to see that you enjoy it so much to spend your precious spare time playing the game.
---
Keep up the good work and don't slack in your Job ;)
---
How can you have a server community in a realm of 20-30k players (versus vanilla's 3k full realms)? Due to the layers, everytime you login, everybody will be completely random and unknown to you. What's the difference being in a realm of 30k splitted into 3k layers, and retail's 3k realms combined to a 30k crossrealm? There's still 30k players eitherway, and no sustainable server community.
---
Nah, that's Brock, his younger brother. His older brother, Barak was Potus for a while.
---
it will stay in queue for you but to check it you will need to keep remoting back on to check on it.
---
That's bs.
---
Blizzard screwed over people rolling on a server as a guild.
---
All of these people had to pick one of the servers available pre launch and everyone of them is full.  If you work until 5 you will never get to play that day due to the never ending queues.
---
My friend got a green axe last night while questioning. I felt better for him than any gear I got in bfa

I like to just tag someones mob, well not tag, but help with one spell as i run around, or I randomly heal people when they having a tough fight by the read (especially low lvl warriors)... and they would wave at me and thats cool.
---
it is an interesting question and i think the answer has to do with the long term. If the game stays solid and has good player retention then lower population servers are fine. However, if too many people are just popping in to check it out and then move on 2-5 weeks later then the low pop servers will become ghost towns.....but then again bliz will offer free transfers for those who need to get off dead servers.....
---
Same.😅
---
Almost every instance of queue times I've seen have shown wildly ridiculous times.
---
Good points there! Mining is harsh on your bags.
---
I opted for skinning (short-term income &amp; convenience) and mining (stockpiling for engineering) but I will certainly be picking up herbalism once Engineering is sorted.
---
Just like jagex knows rs3 is a lost cause because they went too far with cosmetics and micro transactions, retail wow will be the same, they'll keep pumping out the same crap and rake in as much money as they can before it dies
---
Taking a Cruel Barb as a huntard would be like a rogue or warrior needing a blue ranged drop for tagging mobs. It makes you a piece of shit.
---
Thanks. I normally play Horde but if the leveling experience is a lot better I may go Alliance
---
Never mind the big "Wall Of No".
---
Where do you get this from that more people want to play classic than retail?
---
Attack them back, if you die, call for assistance. People will come to help you.
---
They have. Yojamba is usually full or high and shadowstriker where I play is always medium, I don’t think we need more than that.
---
:D
---
sad. ;-;
---
I'm not fun of challenges, never played Souls series for instance.
---
But classic implements them greatly as part of the adventure so I don't mind.
---
I saw a guide stating one of the best ways to make money and enjoy engineering throughout the grind is sell grenades for those who didn’t take eng yet. It’s not exactly something you could do atm but it will probably be your bread and butter for income on those professions. You still get to enjoy all the perks of leveling with and you could always pick up fishing/cooking for more money as well
---
First two expansions were snowballing the vanilla succes it seems ... after phase 6 Blizzard will have some impossible decision to make...
---
They are losing people because the agreed upon server is unplayable for anyone not logging on during the morning
---
I played wow from 2006 till 2013, then came back occasionally, but every return made me bored within one or two hours(too easy, no community feeling whatsoever, etc).
---
Also, the difference between when I was early 20’s vs almost 40 with kids is also different.
---
But I start to play classic evening ago and already level 6, and genuinely feeling the magic again!
---
I’m not leaving this game quickly!
---
Queues this early in the day? Shit the bed.
---
40k population servers might not even possible. Plus, 40k population servers are not at all what was in Classic and might cause problems down the line.
---
Yepp anyone can attack you in areas where there is both horde and alliance quests. You lvl by dying alot. Pve normal server you can turn on and off pvp.

Had to wait 2 hours in queue while the rest of us were farming mobs to not do the quests he was on in the meanwhile. Next time we'll get wake on lan too lol. Although, the hibernate has been turned off :D
---
TFW you are told by devs that low pop server is not dead but actually 5k players and youre not sure whether to believe it.
---
Is this how a lot of people feel? 
---
I was told alliance isn't any better but my ignore list has to be at near capacity...

Went and took a shower &amp; did skin care, came back to a DC’d laptop. Now I’m at 5.3k &amp; 208 minutes ha ha haaaaa kill me. Proof we should never shower.
---
Ok, was that an answer to my post because you only tackled half of it
---
Can you play classic with free trial accounts?
---
I agree with you. I'm not, however, talking about the launch. As the launch is over, we should get rid of the layers. I'm fine with layers in phase 1. But I'm afraid Blizzard will keep them on on phase 2, and that's my point.
---
But what really terrifies me is Blizzard increasing server cap (by increasing amount of layers) yesterday. It postpones the worst possible problem (having 3k online populations by the end of phase 1). Now the realms have atleast 20k concurrent players, some saying 30k, and many more sitting in queues. I'm afraid Blizzard took a step back and plans to keep the layers on on phase 2. That's stepping over the line for me, it would make Classic just another retail expansion but with just hard reset and different content.

So you DON'T want the true classic experience?

What happens on roll play servers? I’ve always been intrigued

Gehennas on EU is complete chaos hahaha

People have waited in 10 hour queues etc. I managed to be there at midnight when servers launched - what a fucking mess that was hahaha!!

I'm using titan panel. It has a xp/h and various other xp features built in.

Yeah that one pure RP server in EU is medium pop at peak times but thats still no queue and I bet in the game it doesnt feel a bit less populated than on others.

Hello, I need help with my stance change/weapon equip macros.  For some reason after swapping my shield with my 2H via the macro, the shield will not stay in the bag position it was in before it was equipped. It will always go in the first slot of the bag it's in.  Here are my macros:
---
    #showtooltip Battle Stance
---
    /cast Battle Stance
---
    /equip Severing Axe of the Bear
---
    #showtooltip Defensive Stance
---
    /cast Defensive Stance
---
    /equip Thun'Grim's Sword
---
    /equip Charging Buckler
---
[You can see it here.](https://imgur.com/a/8AXPwlM) The first picture shows where I have my sword and shield located before using the macros. The second picture is where I use my macro to equip my 2H axe. And the third picture is where I use my macro to equip my sword and shield again, but this time it places my shield in the first slot of my bag. It doesn't matter where I place the shield, it will always move to the first slot of the bag it's in. 
---
Is this something that can be fixed with another macro?  I've tried variations like /equipslot 16/\`17  and equipping a specific bagslot, but they still moved the shield around.
---
Yup, we have 16 debuff slots in classic, not the original 8
---
Wait, what?
---
I think if they’re going to give out free time for the queues, they should keep quiet and only do it once the game has settled down a bit. 
---
The problem with implementing it now is that it would  result in people requeueing after they finish playing for the day and queueing when they know they can’t play that day. This would without a doubt make the queues worse for everyone. If they wait a few weeks/months and then give out game time, it will be for genuinely waiting in the queue to play instead of people abusing it to get free game time.
---
Happy cake day!
---
AH ok seems legit xD
---
What happens to her (lore wise) is she mean or something? she was my favorite alliance.
---
Damn my queue is going down crazy fast compared to yesterday
---
A server not beeing full outside of prime time is not a "dead server".
---
Yeah but Blizzard can't really take responsibility for you taking time off work.
---
I, like many people now, am just sticking with the RP server for the time being until things calm down.
---
Really can’t decide between Druid and warlock.  Played warlock tbc through mists and then Druid till BFA.  Stopped with warlock due to it feeling it had become distant from what I originally enjoyed about it.
---
Love the idea of a Druid in classic and just being able to do abit of everything, will likely only have time for 1 character so this seems a good choice.  Although from many videos I get the impression they aren’t the best overall.
---
I like the idea of the classic warlock, watching hours of videos has reminded me why I originally loved the class.  Although going back to not being able to flex into a healer of tank role would be a bit of a set back.
---
I plan on levelling and primarily dungeons, pvp wpvp at 60, no raiding. Will have a group of us to play with so should be alright for all roles so that isn’t a set back.
---
Any advice would be well appreciated.

Rip dude, hurricane dorian might fuck up my nolife streak. Anyone else in florida prepping for the hurricane?
---
No offense but you've been playing swtor for the last 8 years??
---
Plus, 25k players at once on a server might cause different issues, considering that the original had like how much at once? 3k? 8k? Surely below 10k.
---
Sadly, no. You need to have an active subscription to play.

From what I remember, you could do scholo and strat with 10, and ubrs with 15

---
When I tab target I find I have to press t, right click or use an ability to start auto attacking
---
Most 5 man dungeons could actually be done with up to 10, barely anyone ever did it because xp was hugely nerfed and you couldn't complete non raid quests, but it was doable.
---
Can't you use my dwarf instead?
---
And someone at blizzard just tried to tell me server architecture has come a long way since vanilla....
---
It is significantly better but I have no idea how they could release expansions and have that not be the case.
---
As much as I hate new WoW some of the issues with it seem to be the inevitable result of  an mmo that's lasted for years.
---
Make a /startattack macro to auto-attack
---
Polelearm is in Stormwind.
---
WoW has 2 zone types. Faction zones (places like starting zones, cities, etc) which do not automatically flag you, and Contested zones ( stranglethorn, redridge, 1k, etc) which when entered will automatically flag you on pvp worlds.  On normal worlds, they don't flag you.

At work so can only really update the list with given information :)

For a while. I can't remember how it was solved, but I definitely remember having to login many hours in advance for a few months so I'd be online for the raid.
---
I think the sketchy part is that he went offline to sleep for 6-7 hours and also gained levels in that time. So the longer he goes before sleeping again the more suspicious it is.
---
Waited 8 in Eu yesterday
---
Good idea!
---
Better tip:
---
When you see a lowbie jumping off the tower in orgrimmar, buff them fortify for a quick laugh.
---
Only roll that would piss most players was if hunters rolled on melee weapons, and no, no matter how big upgrade you think that melee weapon is for you cause of that extra agi or crit you don't need it if there are melee classes that do. Same as melee classes don't roll need on range with good stats if some hunter needs them.
---
It’s so much fun randomly meeting other people and getting caught up in an adventure. :)
---
I think if they change retail in too big a way all of a sudden that would create an outrage as well. Some people like the streamlined, ease of use, individual experience that comes with retail I guess.
---
I'm almost certain the rep is lower. Don't think they removed that scaling until later expansions.
---
There is a grace period for those who are dc’d. I’m sorry I’m not sure how long is though. 5-10 minutes probably.
---
When the population is healthy, for an outside observer its kind of like if way more NPCs were wandering around playing out their own little storylines. If you’re taking part, and this is my personal take on it, it’s simultaneously like writing and acting. I get into my character’s head, how she thinks, feels, behaves, and act that out in writing. Which is why it can be very fun but also tiring if something particularly intense happens, like well loved character dying for plot reasons.
---
Pretty much all consistent plots are played out in dedicated guilds with their own themes. One guild might be a night elf only Cenarion Circle guild, another might be an all races mercenary guild, treasure hunters, Arcanists, Thieves, dark covens for warlocks, all kinds of guilds for whatever character or experiences you’re interested in.

Literally every new release is always a success but you need to wait a few weeks for it to settle down - Sea of Thieves (fail), No mans sky (fail) etc. We need to wait a few weeks before making statements.

stuff like this makes them aware i guess. so pretty cool for all parties :)

It’s the most fun I’ve had in a game in many years... I’m only a lonely lvl 23 priest but I’m progressing right along

Hello, tanking is not hard. But your dps and heals have to play with you.. I've had some retail dps recently and it was horrible to tank for them
---
Druids are actually great for end game content when your group can afford flexibility.
---
Yes, you will never shine and be the best tank, the best healer nor the best dps. But you can be all three at the same time, which is unique.
---
You bring awesome utility and, let's be honest, you'll most certainly be required to spec as a healer for raiding.
---
So, if you like to work in the shadows and to help your friends shine, then Druid is the perfect class for you. Otherwise, Paladin it is, by the light!

Just one thing. Which makes for a better game? One where you push buttons in somewhat interesting manner or one where you make friends, have fun when encountering hardships and feel rewarded when you succeed ?

I wish I could upvote everything about this more than once.

These kinds of posts are always so fun to read. :)

Yeah literally this, it was played for a few weeks but after a while people bashed it because they was nothing to do and it was a shit expansion. Same will or MIGHT happen with Classic, we shouldnt celebrate yet its out only a few days.

You can enjoy both! But some people have a weird mental barrier where they ask themselves “okay, I need to put all my time and effort into just one of the two, so which one should it be”?
---
that is normal
---
What do you like?
---
Do you do some role-play? Is there a class which fits your criteria?
---
Just roll with what looks cool to you!
---
Same. For most games I will turn off in-game music have a playlist on Spotify going.  
---
Not for classic, the in-game soundtrack is too damn good. They really nailed the atmosphere for each region's music in Vanilla.
---
To be fair we don’t know shit about BFA’s numbers. For all we know this will be a net positive in gained retail players. That’s certainly the intention behind classic for blizzard.
---
Yes and yes. Pretty sure

Dude it's literally in the title, zandalar tribe eu.

Im averaging ~1 hour a level with doing professions on the side. 21 hours in and I just hit level 20 thanks to having to travel to wailing cavern

Personally been loving the new ppl. Had a Hunter in Teldrassil yesterday ask why his pet disappeared (it abandoned him because he wasn’t feeding it xD) and we all told him and taught basic mechanics to him and he was really fascinated. It’s been a good time so far! :)
---
As a priest I can wand down as many 2-3. It’s not much but it’s good enough for me.
---
i hand out water breathing like it's candy. it's less relevant in classic but still
---
How are you speccing?
---
Could be worse. I got underwater breathing buffed. In Crossroads.
---
Not entirely accurate. The base level of instanced content is more difficult in classic than in retail. Retail has a much higher difficulty ceiling though, as M+ and heroic/mythic raiding is vastly more difficult than anything in classic.
---
I love the charavter models and spell animations from classic, but i love the zones from bfa
---
Int helps with gaining wep skill faster :D
---
Questie is used quite a bit. It comes and goes though, like literally. It'll just disappear from your map while you're doing a quest then it'll populate again later on. I've heard of a few other quest trackers but haven't personally used them.
---
HoJ isn't good for hunters though lol. We have hinterlands trinket and ony chain trinket
---
Too many mobs for a warrior early tends to be two.

Yeah I'd say that was lucky

not the models

It was a 100 word essay this morning.

I never found the  soul shard mechanic to be an issue.  If anything you end up having too many shards and just dumping them all the time.  If you plan to log on at raid time and expect to go you might be set back but I feel all classes need to log on a while before and get some farming done wether it be potions and other mats.
---
Not exactly sure what that is, so probably not! Haha
---
why are you repeating yourself?
---
facts facts facts
---
Yeah people aren't even close to hitting the stuff that was painful in vanilla. There will be a lot of complaints and a lot of people quitting.
---
Personally I'm having a lot of fun right now and will play till I'm not. Good enough for me, but I'm not gonna pretend that I wasn't annoyed to remember my poisons have charges now for example.

Hey, gotta spend those hours in queue doing something.

The opposite. It's easy for people to have alts. I am actually thinking about pausing my warrior at 36ish (want to get those charms farmed before it becomes a competition), simply because there aren't enough people on level to do the dungeons yet. I had to skip blackfathom deeps completely. I haven't even tried looking for gnomeregan but I haven't  heard it mentioned in chat. At all.

GO to westfall next maybe?

Lol harde leven , i feel you

I have been nicer and more openly generous in these 3 days of classic than i have in 9 years of retail

Oh so you were leveling while doing world quests then?

Got 3 of them now. Not sure what to do with em.

i lvled and made much gold on the beginning with bags and wands :)
---
Nowhere. You can go to Westfall now.

---
I would aim for medium. At worst, it will fluctuate between high and low after hype dies down and still be really active
---
We’re back boys!
---
Yesterday someone complained about high latency. I got jealous as that would be the most authentic of experiences.
---
Maybe you missed a quest chain. A good solution would be to install questie add on and then the map will display where the quest givers are.
---
There are some quests on the right side, although 12 does seem low. Make sure you didnt accidentally miss any.
---
That said, you can also take a tram to Stormwind from Ironforge and quest a bit in Westfall
---
You ran out of quests in the zone, it can happen a lot if you stay in one place
---
BuT lAyErS aRe BaD!1!
---
Dont you have a quest to burn the battle plans over there?
---
Might be a layering thing where the server tries to keep you in your layer already full with your people.
---
She’s cooked mate.
---
Fr lol tfffff
---
If I’m not mistaken F is the default assist button
---
jesus fuck i hope 50% of the playerbase quits. It'd still be massively popular but infinitely less cancer for organizing group play.
---
My first thought was literally "Who the fuck is Justin Davis?"
---
Hydraxian Waterlords EU reporting in!
---
Good point, I have been waiting this discussion eagerly. But most likely the comparison is not the right way to approach this. They are simply not in the same genre. Which is actually weird. Retail has turned into its own genre, or sth...
---
Is he really guessing the theorycrafting community? There was always a big amount of people calculating everything from Vanilla.
---
I'd highly recommend getting teamviewer or Google remote desktop on your phone. If I didn't, I wouldn't be able to play for 2 hours when I get home but thankfully I'm in right away cause of the app
---
Thanks! I'll give this a go!
---
Try 50
---
Fuck I love people who hate people who hate swearing (hence my up-vote)
---
What realm is this? I need in.
---
Lol thats cute :-)
---
Watch me fear you and rocket away
---
Level 2 lol
---
Classic bowhead has times, but they have a real long refresh rate
---
Even to get my first green sword i was way too happy like out of the world and excited !!!
---
Solid pro tip
---
The thing is, there are no rules to this race other than Blizzards. You might call "sketchy move", I understand, and I agree - if I wouldn't want anybody to contest me on anything, I'd opt for transparency myself and stream everything by my own will and of my own accord - but lack of transparency is not a proof of cheating by itself.
---
And as per Blizzard rules, unless he gets banned by breaking the TOS, he gets the title. Nothing more to it. It's like you said, "check the rules for the site". The rules here are very lax, but they are what they are. "Should be required", I agree, but it isn't, and to be honest, it's kind of fair. Nobody streamed the vanilla 1-60 race and it was okay by then :)
---
The complete way to play
---
Interesting. Moms in that time were famous for shutting down the PC during Vaelastrasz and yelling into the teamspeak :)
---
looks like it :/
---
but now with the online players increase, this wount happen again i guese
---
News flash: people sleeping at 4am
---
Only if they want to be the last 60 in classic
---
You do realise server sizes back in the days were around 2,5k?  
---
So basicly they allowed another server of people to connect to an existing server, which is kinda worrying that the realms they now have are too big.
---
whats the point of tracking people under 35 when there are tons of ppl pusing to 50.
---
You shapeshift.
---
I'm not saying you'll do any proficiently, but you can still help with the healing if your healers are oom, you can still help with the dps if your team doesn't need your extra healing and you can tank for a few seconds using taunt and all your CD to help your main tank breathe a little.
---
Also, your raid-wide passive buffs are really strong, you have that sweet battle rez and the healers will kneel in front of you to receive your innervate.
---
And that sweet Paw buff is really good too!
---
What’s the difference between these 4 servers in terms of people on them? 
---
Is everyone English speaking or is there a mix with other Asian counties on board ? 
---
I am looking for a server to play on as a Brit living in HK
---
Or just google a guide. The search caps out at 50 players, hardly useful for anything.
---
Dude why? Because I stayed up past 6 am both nights, and still didn't wanna stop. Its addicting for a reason. Its just great. The first night hype kept me up, ngl tauren warrior is probably the worst slowest start zone experience.  After I hit barrens the next day tho. Addiction set it. Can't stop me now.
---
I'm only level 3 on my main,  as I only got to play about an hour Tuesday evening.
---
Yeah. Been doing it in vanilla and I'm doing it again.
---
/steam tanks rumble in the distance
---
I can offer thanks, because i'm a low level hunter that brings nothing to the buff squad :(
---
Quick, everyone, stop playing, Oceanic is down!
---
The level of the mob is everything imo
---
Glancing blows severely effects dmg and fighting a mob one level below you vs a mob one level above you is basically night and day
---
Is Wow still $15 a month?
---
Only the really, really sad ones.
---
No but seriously, even future tanks dont level as prot. There's no reason to. You only really swap to prot once you actually start raiding (so you'll stay as dps spec all the way pre-MC generally).
---
Protip to all non buffers, set a macro for wave or thanks and cast those bad boys. You will be the real MVP.
---
That named mob that drops the crystal hits like an absolute truck.
---
What he probably meant was "retail". Even if he meant "BFA", the experience of 1-66 is mostly influenced by BFA, too (scaling etc.).
---
How is it better? Just curious
---
I also love the new water, but I think its great people can choose if they was it old school or a bit modern.
---
Man, there's so much potential to be a bro as priest.
---
Anyone without Fort? You get Fort!
---
Almost dying to getting swarmed by 3 mobs? Lemme give you that Renew and Lesser Heal!
---
Friend Request? Um... no thanks, tho.
---
Nope, but it's an example. You are not much weaker while levelling from 110 - 120 than when you are 120.
---
A fresh 120 character is marginally stronger, only when properly equipped it becomes a huge difference.
---
Also... Fury Warriors don't lose a lot of self heal below 120.
---
this question makes me so happy
---
Hah thats not bis.. oh nvm..
---
People just want to be angry at stuff. We get the same with Stadia.
---
&gt; Time investment is probably the ultimate difficulty curve.  
---
no its not, its still the difficulty of the action you invest time in that matters, it takes time to learn to do something difficult. If you have 2 people doing the same thing and one takes longer than the other, you wouldnt say his job was more difficult.
---
he is not realy playing the game so no, this is not account sharing,
---
but still, it might be a kind of cheating
---
You played horde on PvP servers and alliance on PvE. In general PvE players are friendlier
---
At least they helped. I’ve had it happen where I save someone fighting 3+ mobs and they leave me to fend for myself.
---
Debuffs are limited.  You will just cast shadowbolt.  One might just be on curse of elements duty.
---
I feel the same way, but times are different.  Classic is a different gaming experience than a lot of gamers today have ever experienced.  YES I do hope that the success is real, and the populations don’t fade considerably.
---
If you have strong aoe in your group you can use explosives to up the pace of your dungeon.  You need a strong healer but it's doable.  Part of the reason that engineering is so strong in general.
---
3k is nothing in today’s day and age. Try 30k and we’re talking. Other games handle this just fine.
---
No youre a fucking healer
---
Everyone knew before hand this was going to happen yet blizzard ignored the problem...
---
This time around it would be wives  that do that :D
---
it's called nap time
---
This is a fake question, is it? In classic you have to be a discoverer. So just go and look what is out there. There is an uncovered map, isen't that enough?
---
:)
---
Dude this is so me. I could've wrote the same text. I'm really enjoying all those "old" rpg elements. Things MATTER. That's so awesome.
---
True, wotlk was wildly different. And well we all know cata onwards is not even classic. Completely ruined. Feels like a failed reboot, not a continuation to the game at its peak.
---
All dungeons can be tanked as fury or arms just by using a shield. There is really no.need to handicap yourself by leveling as prot, seriously.
---
Yesterday I pulled 2 extra and had to use all my cds. It was scary. Only died twice since launch tho.
---
Good luck mate!
---
Can you complete the quests as a 10 man dungeon group?
---
Well the hunter aspects really aren't too bad, you will have one bag less and need to remember to buy ammo/pet food, but it's less of an inconvenience than having to farm soulshards/skill materials (rogues)/having multiple gear sets in the inventory (warriors and hybrids).

What is the current state of STV? I haven't gotten there yet. Are people going crazy with PvP?
---
Hydraxian Waterlords was on high pop last night, but we still havent seen a queue at any point.

I see some people equipping the bandana and then turning off headgear display. ???????
---
No because other are better dude
---
If you can not remind me i need to be level 20 to get cat form id greatly appreciate it. Ive only been able to log in for a few minutes so far. I dont wanna think about that. :p
---
Had you read the conversation, you'd see that it was about low level leveling. But thanks for giving your 11-120 perspective like anyone asked for it.
---
Maybe you'll think a bit before replying next time, I dunno.
---
They were last updated 2 days ago when they were viable contestants.. as I mentioned below i'll be cutting down the list to only &gt; 35 when I get chance
---
It's fine, just report them whenever you see them.
---
Just hit 14 last night with about 12 hours played.
---
Well to be fair you don't need the dedication to BfA that you need in classic. Classic is a fucking grind
---
Everyone says Alliance is the best leveling experience, does anyone have a recommended route? Will be a human so thinking of starting Elwynn -&gt; Westfall  but then a bit lost from there
---
You the real mvp, giving out that weapon skill training buff for us melee boys! Much love.
---
Yeah, Blizz put out a report yesterday '**Arikara** **will not have the smoke effect when tamed**.'
---
Yeah this guy is just being a dick, I personally don’t get the WARcraft vibe when I pass the enemy faction and noone can fight each other..
---
I guess i’m just toxic for wanting faction warfare.
---
I'm aware of that, but sadly work didn't think the Classic launch was a reasonable excuse to miss a day. Bastards.
---
The Totem of Infliction quest had some too.. kinda:
---
“This Totem of Infliction will help to protect you against the evil which lurks throughout Azeroth and beyond.”
---
Underbluff
---
It’s a bit too easy to blame it all on Activision.
---
one of the most famous shit posts of all of classic was that you could literally level in classic while watching porn.
---
Damn, sorry to hear that, but yeah that can happen as well, if I were to go past you I'd definitely help you out :)
---
As a warrior with no flashy spells, and a wooden stick with a big rock attached to the end of it,  who frequently runs by generous warlocks priests and druids,
---
 god bless you for saving my life on numerous occasions.
---
I think it comes from the Ford quote: "If I had asked people what they wanted they'd have said faster horses." And there's some truth to that. People of don't know what they want or what's optimal.
---
That said, you can't pull this trick during sex or something, so there are obvious cases where this doesnt/cannot apply.
---
People say that "the community" asked for all of the shitty changes that led to retail. This isn't fully true because you can't attribute each change in this fashion, it's really all about "mentality".
---
And so far, the mentality is "accessible = more revenue". But it's  not that simple and players have been saying this for years. 
---
Theres also the issue that people with the original vision have left over the years. Changes were eventually made without thinking hard about what the game was meant to stand for
---
This is about a paradigm shift, but blizzard/activion just can't stand being told that their mentality for years has been wrong. This is only so painful now because they havent been able to sit down and have a converation without all of "appeal to nostalgia" fallacies.
---
My guild picked the server recommended by blizzard to avoid long queues.
---
Moving to some fresh server they opened that day is not an option.  
---
Btw, there isn't any low population servers in the evenings. Just high and full
---
Druid here, died like 10 times by now. fuck the ban'ethil den
---
Haha yeah sometimes it's like that, and after killing 3-4 mobs simultaneously you feel like a beast (with like 5% hp left, totally calculated), and sometimes you fear the mob and it pulls like 3 others ...  "Hoof it!"
---
Part of the ship, part of the crew! Part of the ship, part of the crew! Part of the ship, part of the crew!
---
I'm a warlock so I just buff everyone with water breathing and hope they give me a useful buff lol
---
Only advantage of engineering early is being able to learn recipes while they're cheap and not take up valuable bag space with them by holding them for later.  There is some early gear that isn't terrible but in general it's really not worth it money wise.  It's also very expensive.
---
No most quests can’t be completed in a raid group.
---
U know the record is total ingame playtime right
---
I think BfA is garbage, but honestly they're not wrong.
---
I spent nearly 3 hours tanking harvest golems in westfall for randoms who were struggeling and it was so fun. Im not normally that helpfull but the community is making this amazing.
---
They destroyed southshore. Southshore! My favorite place. I logged out there in wotlk, logged in for a bad time in cata.
---
Here you go: [https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic)
---
New servers don't help if people are unwilling to play on them, but most are too stubborn to play on different realm and keep on whining about queues instead.
---
How’s that not useful? The majority of those 50 people are going to be leveling and will be in relative zones
---
I'm speccing into arms but seems to run defence stance and sword broad most of the time in world grouping.
---
If you want a class with very little downsides I'd suggest Mage, good at leveling, great in PvE content, good-great depending on skill level in PvP and they have no drawbacks I can think of, other than earlier levels being a bit of a bore, but a lot of classes have to deal with that.
---
Only downsides I can think of would be pretty boring rotations and casters/mages being pretty popular so you have a lot of competition for loot.
---
My girlfriend has watched me play WoW for years but refused to get in to because of the flavor of life account unlocks that I had, which made things unfair to her as a new player. Just the fact that being able to get on a mount at level 1 while she couldn't made her salty, so she refused to play. Classic has been the perfect reset button and she's been playing with me since it launched, now she's completely addicted lol.. I say don't be this guy, get her introduced too
---
Thanks for the feedback everyone! You guys/gals are great. I’ll just stick with arms for now until MC!
---
For timed events maybe, but not in general.
---
Cata was the turning point.
---
I love this meme. 8/10 guy with a 5/10 girlfriend drooling over a 6/10 girls.
---
What can you say..  horde have more trolls? :P
---
Horde dominate pvp servers and alliance dominate RP servers. You can definitely predict some of the personalities which choose those server types (crude jerks and sensitive wimps ) obviously it's not everyone. For every 6-7 good experiences on horde, I get one bad one but it's not a big deal at all. Chat can get annoying with all the "go back to retail" jokes and other dumb jokes.
---
Oh it's available for mobiles? That's awesome, thanks. My work is blocking everything, but if that's possible by phone it would awesome.
---
True, but the exp dropoff is very generous, and when so much of a warrior is "how much damage did you bring into the fight in banked rage and your swing timer", I feel it's worth fighting low level mobs. 
---
Also, your armor does more for you when you are higher level relative to the mobs that are attacking you (armor calculations are done using the ATTACKER'S level versus the defender's armor), and their armor does less (same reason. Attacker's level, defender's armor). 
---
It is much harder to run, as hamstring is much less useful in panic situations, as is probably piercing howl (I am not fury), but overall, I feel like warrior has a huge incentive to fight 2 mobs as a matter of course.  if you look at the fight club DPR spreadsheet that got floated around, even at 29, cleave is still a CLEAR winner in damage per rage, after rend. Sunder armor is cute and relevant against very difficult mobs, but against easy mobs, which are the warrior's bread and butter? cleave spam is just more damage per rage spent and it continues to work if you end up in a group for a quest with a mage, who makes sunder a lot worse.
---
Exactly - so missing out on a BiS item shouldn’t be that much of an issue, because you guys aren’t mindlessly farming gear?
---
Idk, I haven’t really played Retail since WoD. I’m just saying I will be rolling on anything I need pretty much.. I used to be a Huntard so I guess i’m playing the same as I used too.
---
I would love to see the development on classic continue maybe with an alternate timeline. Some new raids etc.
---
I never spent time in queue in vanilla.
---
cheating how? this is just being smart.  
---
Nothing smart about getting AFK DC-ed and having to sit in hours of queue, thats just being dumb :D   
---
There are a lot of apps/programs that let you remote control your computer and you can use that to un-afk yourself while elsewhere.
---
See weapon master at level 10.
---
Stormwind can teach both staff and swords to warlocks
---
Darnasus can teach Staffs
---
Ironforge can teach swords
---
38 hours lol you're a bot
---
Still expensive to multybox and gearing becomes quite lame and micromanagment becomes impossibe if enemy knows what they are doing
---
I like you
---
But wait how do you forget to roll when the dialogue pops up? Or do you mean /roll?
---
Your main hand weapon should have the highest max damage. (usually comes from slow weapons)
---
That's because abilities like Sinister Strike and Backstab use your main weapons MAX damage for calculations.
---
I will say as a druid who is level 27, its hard to buff players when your flying by with cat form with 2/2 talent that increases movement speed. If I buffed every player I ran past it would be like I didn't pick the talent in the first place. But see me in a town and I spend an extra minute throwing out the buffs.
---
I'm starting to lean that way.  For some games, I love to take in the panorama and play it full screen, but for others it's just not worth it.
---
Currently using Shadowed Unit Frames.
---
Very customisable!
---
How about you learn to behave? Whats the difference between 1 - 20 levelling compared to 110 - 120? 1 - 20 is even easier for the most part because low level levelling was nerfed.
---
It's pretty normail to die really, *really* often as a mage in classic before you hit around level 20. I've been playing since vanilla, always mained a mage and I've died a couple dozen times. Those first couple of levels there's just not much you can do as a mage when you aggro another mob, other then try to run away or die. But it's worth it, because later you will be able to solo a lot of mobs that other classes can't and you can AoE farm like crazy.
---
Hunter weapon working as intended
---
Glad to hear that! I know these "I am excited, I have to write it for people to read" feelings haha. Good sign :)
---
I’d be fine with longer, my limit is the time it takes me to go out for groceries after work, cook dinner and then consume it. That’s usually about 2 hours total. Basically I want to be playing by 7pm
---
4 hours of sleep and 15 hours tuesday, Wednesday and like 8ish on monday’s release. Also off work Thursday so chalk up an extra 15 hours roughly for Thursday LOL
---
As others pointed out, it's basically slang..... Buuuutttttt..... A pretty good idea for a little web app.
---
You are correct.
---
It's hard to see you from down here :(
---
The world is so big and there's so much going on but I try!
---
pfft what a Noob
---
Well you are the server with all the streamers haha
---
I knew it before I opened this thread. ;D
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Theres a GM waiting for them to ding 59 and then ban them.
---
Hold up, ima need that loincloth of the bear.
---
Your big advantage as a druid is that you can be totally flexible and play basically any role in a dungeon.
---
That is if you are willing to gather and keep gear for all of the roles. Spec of course matters to but not to the extend that you can't do the other things at all.
---
No, only raid quests
---
What did it for me was when they changed to the new talent system. I loved the original talent trees, so much customization to YOUR playing style. Then they did this basic ass windowlicker talent tree shit.
---
Hmm
---
Noted
---
If you didn't get reset in the queue when you did this then I think it's worth trying.
---
Try logging in on one pc and then another with the same account and tell us how that goes for you
---
I've got fed up of queues and moved to Ten Storms, for now it's no queues and one of the least populated, but still reached high pop when I logged off at 10pm
---
&gt;The devs are probably very disheartened seeing millions flock to Classic and hardly anyone playing BFA
---
Good, fuck em. Maybe they'll learn something for once the arrogant gits.
---
All weapons are Hunter weapons.
---
WP
---
I think if you get dc in queue, you lose the queue spot. 
---
Also if you keep logging in through different IP addresses you might get caught by an auto-system and get suspended ("someone is trying to hack you" / "you shared your account") until you sort it out. Is it really worth risking?
---
Just set a teamviewer on your home PC, and login from work ~1hour before you go home and get into queue.
---
Fair point my dude, fair point.
---
I macro /ty  because everyone is being so helpful.
---
The intention of this, is to create a ladder like system similar to what D2 has.
---
Blizzard wants to move on from WoW. They want to focus on the next WoW, where they will have tens of millions of subscriptions.
---
Problem is, as a corporation you need to protect revenue.
---
How do you protect revenue of a product, that is subscription based? Continue pushing out content updates.
---
How can you get around that? Recycle the same content over and over.
---
Within a year, there will be an announcement of "ladder" and "nonladder" realms. Each year, new realms will spinup and everybody gets to experience Classic again, or kov along to TBC, etc...
---
I was like I love it, to my friend I was playing with. It's been way to long.
---
Always troll in general chat, always be good to others in /say and in party its my mantra
---
Yea, I log into teamviewer with my phone and load wow and select server. If I manage to get past the queue before I get home I just open it up every 15 minutes and jump and it's all good hehe.
---
Only ever played casual, stopped after WOTLK, started again with classic and probably will never go raid. I loved it then, I'm loving it now.
---
Exactly. If he is right, he will be able to openly boast about it forever, write articles how "he knew it all along"
---
If he is wrong, noone will care in the slightest. This tweet will just be lost in the depths of the net. 
---
He has a lot to win and nothing to lose. Easiest trick in the book.
---
You're logged in at 6:30am of course not a lot of people are going to be on. Stalagg is one of the biggest realms and alliance side is just fine, I play here and it's about 46% alliance - 54% horde from what I've seen.
---
Take my down vote sir
---
The raiding in classic is a joke compared to retail though
---
It already is, as it's on his photo.
---
Click the taskbar &amp; press print screen.
---
:(8)
---
If you going restro dungeon farming could be good for you to level should find loads of groups LF healer in main chats
---
Imp is better than void walker FYI ;)
---
If you can skin the dm N dogs and solo them then skinning ends up being pretty nice.
---
" want your mount at 40 you tend to spend a ton of time fishing to make up the cost difference. "
---
laughs in paladin\*
---
i mainly keep it kinda leveled due to masssive production of grenades, i think i spent like 5s to buy some wooden stocks and some flux.

This is how i feel. Disappointing really.
---
&gt;you are not entitled to knowledge.

I have read **a lot** of retarded comments on reddit. This... This takes first prize.
---
I've got a friend who has really bad FOMO. If he ever hears that 2 of us were hanging out its always "thanks for the invite" and all that shit. Gets annoying.
---
I’ve noticed my pet also auto cancels attacking if a mage polys a target in a dungeon which i couldn’t quite remember happening back in the day -
---
I’m not complaining though, it’s saved my dumb ass a few times already
---
&gt;You should be happy  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Plan your sessions around queue times.
---
Oh should I be now? You sound like a Blizzard shill.  
---
As for planning sessions, It's hard to plan around a 4+ hour queue when I get home from work at 430/5, have a wife and 2 young kids and am a homeowner; (for all those that know what that entails) Must be nice to have all that free time to plan sessions around.
---
I think it was only Stormwind or cities that melted. Had a similar issue on launch where Elywnn Forest was fine but everyone was running on the spot in Stormwind.
---
Iron bars are selling at a crazy price at the moment.
---
But it is part of the experience of the game.
---
Solo levelling as resto lmfao
---
Booooo
---
Boo! It was funny!
---
You can filter it by available/unavailable so you don't have to scroll all the time
---
Haha yes! That scene will never get old.
---
Smolderweb.  We were on Stallag before.  It ended up being the 2nd highest pop server, of any type or region.  10+ hour queues.  No thanks.
---
Seems a very good reason to me, though.
---
I get it, had the same plan.
---
Waiting to tag a mob and competing to grab quest items was the main reason for me. But I could not contain the hype and started Monday.
---
I have to say it is much fun to play already! Besides the queue and sometimes competing for mobs, the whole vibe is great.
---
So if you want to play just go for it, only Elwynn forest was too crowded in my experience.
---
Trouble is all that happens is their game gets changed, I mentioned to someone I saw that their grossly inappropriate name will be reported by a lot of people.
---
They quite replied 'so, all that will happen is the name will be changed'
---
The player who doesn't care about the server rules  however remains.
---
I'm just saying that if you're in a party with someone who explicitly says ahead of time they're looking for a specific drop, and that drop is only a mild upgrade for you, it's pretty rude to roll on it. If it costs basically nothing to be nice, just be nice.
---
Again, not saying to always run every single roll by every party member in every group. But it's better for the overall health of the game if you aren't 100% selfish when you don't think there will be repercussions.
---
My friend have organized a trip to a nice beach and I 'll probably go for it's the last chance for this summer. 
---
But i' m so sad to not be able to nolife for the whole weekend. Also because there's the G2 VS FNC semifinal which would be something great to watch while grinding.
---
Just set up a remote console and que before you finish work
---
I'm not hating, I am on 19hrs and 23 so I was thinking how engrossed have you been to spend 20hrs doing other random bits and bobs haha. I have also been thoroughly enjoying it.
---
You definitely missed quests. There's one in Ironforge that sends you east of the lake, and someone in the town - whatever the name of that was - should send you towards the excavation site.
---
Look into weak auras.
---
I'm a warrior so I'll just be crying poverty pretty much the entire time I'm leveling.
---
New players should not use questie—they should read the damn quests instead!
---
Same here
---
Oceania doesn't have RPPVP? How sad.
---
The true terror is when the no life max lvl hordes will start camping there for 12 hours in a row
---
 I'm not hating, I am on 19hrs and 23 so I was thinking how engrossed have you been to spend 20hrs doing other random bits and bobs haha. I have also been thoroughly enjoying it.
---
My ass and back hurts looking at these photos.
---
Early days are by far the most fun. waiting to play the game with less people seems weird when half the fun is playing with people.
---
Install bootcamp and play on windows. Old macbook can still run it that way
---
Its not hard to understand the appeal of not being hand fed every little thing in the game.. or maybe it is.. idk
---
And if everyone does this?
---
well its "improved blizzard" not "improved activision blizzard" so...
---
Yeah same here. I was waiting at the top of the tower in OG where the flight point is expecting a zeppelin. After 5 minutes it dawned on me.
---
On launch day I had an absurd que time for Herod (the usual 500 min). I looked at my phone for a moment and suddenly I got in. I don’t know what happened , but now I have a level 8 in Durotar. I haven’t be able to play since due to the wait.
---
Proof or get out, sorry.

Thankyou so much for this. My moral compass is now under threat.
---
I purchased it years ago for 30-40 pounds in tbc, and that accouont seems to be void, so there is slightly less guilt.
---
So even less reason to be this ecstatic
---
It really FEELS like you're playing Legolas. 9.5/10

I realized I misinterpreted your  comment ...

Taken from the Wow Wiki: SI:7 (Stormwind Intelligence),[2][3][4] also spelled SI-7,[5] is a secretive military force of Stormwind's sovereign monarch.[6] It includes rogues specializing in special operations, espionage, assassination and stealth tactics. It is referred to as the Alliance's intelligence agency[7] and Azeroth's most elite spy organization.[8]
---
Boo
---
He can play whatever way he wants. That’s the beauty of Classic.

As another noob to classic warrior can I ask a question? Is it alright to level as protection or should I do arms until later?

"queue meta" is a thing =(

I forgot how much I hated the Ban'ethil Barrow Den
---
Nothing wrong with that, sticks and stones etc
---
The floor of Classic is more difficult than the floor of BFA (leveling.)  The ceiling of BFA is much more difficult than the ceiling of Classic (mythic raiding vs raids.)
---
Really the only thing Classic is teaching at this point is people hate having gear spoon fed to them and want the leveling experience to actually mean something (at least the first time.)  
---
It's too early to make a judgement call on raiding and the dungeon finder since not many people have started seriously doing any PUG dungeons and nobody has hit end game yet.
---
That is not true
---
Welcome to masterace hahaha

This is a streamer's guild btw

I had a hunter takes the Wc mail belt (8str, 3agi) in a nerd roll from my warrior yesterday. I was pissssed. He told me he thought they wore mail

---
Massively we thought the server was going to crash but apparently outside of this battle everyone was fine
---
Cooking is a bitch in Durotar / Barrens, literally no mats to get you started unless you fish : /
---
Most drops actually matter. Like economy for your character, getting 1 silver from selling stuff to a vendor is pretty pog. I got a bag drop yesterday and literally was so excited about it. When you find a chest, its great. Leveling profession feels just satisfying again. Its work, but its good work. Getting a new weapon drop and having to level maces or whatever the new weapon is again instead of being able to just equip it and continuing.
---
The best thing imo is the whole looking forward to getting certain spells. I got bear form on my druid last night. Having to go do a class quest for it, finally getting it, it feels amazing! Now I'm looking forward to getting more skills on bear and finally cat form at 20. 
---
The community (at least in EU) seems wholesome as fuck. Met this random guy doing the same quest, we partied up and did it together, found a chest, we both rolled for it and respected the roll right in front of the chest. He got herbs which I needed since thats my profession, so he traded them to me! 
---
Found 2 rare mobs last night as well any my friend got a sick green tunic for his druid and just after that I got one too. Just feels so rewarding.
---
Stormwind does not have a harbor.
---
Quests do not auto track.
---
Mages do not have water elemental.(right?)
---
Vanilla player models look like shit. I mean look at hair models of female human. It is too "edgy"
---
What do you think? It's not like we just talked about it for 5 comments. 
---
I'm done sitting here and explaining stuff because you like to play stupid. People don't like this aspect of the game. It's a major complaint. You can enjoy it all you want but that's not going to change that fact
---
The kodos must be protected.
---
I’ve already met 3 people in classic who started playing wow after MoP and they all told me they were loving it :D
---
You’ll need a big bag for all those bags.
---
Its just more optimized, like you'll be jumping around zones doing 1-2 levels and changing and then going back to that zone 2-3 levels later as the quests were originally too high etc. It's definitely quicker although some parts may not seem it. Sage is a good guide.
---
I think your best bet is to get that done now while Blizz are dealing with the queues and disconnect isdues. By the time your thesis is done, the servers will probably even out and become more stable.
---
Honestly, I'm pretty much playing Classic in the hopes that they will release TBC servers down the line.
---
Nothing to do with Activision. There will be a Classic team that control all of this with an agreed budget on resource with contingency plans based on certain scenarios.
---
This is how the world works, The CEO of the company I work for isn't standing over my shoulder checking my work and dictating how to do my job and Neither is Activision micro-managing Blizzard.
---
Cool Thanks alot ! What server you playing ?
---
Was so happy when i got this.
---
All blizz had to do was make a "herod 1 herod 2 and herod 3" then when population goes down, eventually merge into a single herod
---
The bonuses aren't very good, but it's just a great looking solid set and feels "right" on a rogue!
---
Laughs in macros that use the most up to date spell.
---
/rclassicwowcirclejerk
---
Anyone after the name “Jim” on razergore? DM
---
no, before launch if a server is full and 15k people in queue it would be full &amp; if a server was full with +200 queue it would be ''medium''. it was **in relation with other servers,** right now it is not.
---
it was and always it is about concurrent players that specific time.
---
Although this place is for asking what should one play, I'm wondering if I should play at all. I don't really have any proper history in WoW. When I was younger, I couldn't really afford paying for the game, so I played a bit on private servers (maybe a month), where the XP rates were obviously higher. I've also tried some 7-day trial, and the most recent one, which is until lvl 20 (where leveling was quite fast, but somehow too fast - one quest gets done while others are already basically useless/too low level).
---
Although I can now afford to pay for the game, I'm wondering would it be worth it? Considering I work full time, and also attend college, I probably wouldn't really be able to spend time on it, or it would come at the expense of studying. And if I would play, my progress would probably be really slow.
---
Any thoughts?
---
Having millions of people waiting in queue is far worse than having them playing. Ultimately they’re trying to save money in the long term by not investing too much on servers as they probably predict a player drop off, but are directly causing that drop off by not accommodating the players who actually want to play. People are getting tired of this shit and no casual wants to sit around in a queue for hours and hours.
---
I asked the same thing about furbolgs, you win.
---
Repost
---
lvl 11 after \~8 hours played. leveling in a group of three, completing class quests for each other, just running around mining, skinning, herbing...no hestitation at all. enjoying the journey.
---
Hammer out all the important questions so one of you can reroll ASAP. True efficiency!
---
As someone who mained pal in vanilla, gear helps. Ret is actually pretty strong in pvp with good items
---
Playing AV with my cringey RP macro. 
---
Met my wife in that AV at 1:30AM, killing Balinda
---
still weird to not see "crossroads is under attack!" spam while leveling there... i'm pretty sure the time will come soon enough tho ^^
---
no way, i have to disagree 100%!! sure the modern models look good but they lost so much character... rip asian human and crazy dwarf
---
Every single form of content, including LFR and almost any dungeon level, is harder than classic.
---
hi, ive I've done this and it works and i kept my spot. been doing it since wrath queues.
---
those are the same type of people who play OSRS, they're not going to leave
---
I know I'm an asshole for doing it but see it like this: if I log in when I get home from work I won't complete half the queue before I have to go to bed so the only way to be able to play ANY wow classic for me is to log in before work and let my desk fan press spacebar
---
I can't switch server either since it's the only pvp server in my language
---
I think u get kicked out after 30min
---
Maybe just progress with classic but change the route after TBC? Wotlk was fine but it went downhill after that for me.
---
Thank you this was driving me crazy during wc last night
---
Pretty much anything these days, classic is pretty fucking light on resources.
---
What part of the poison quest?  Ambush auto kills the first two guys.  Ambush auto takes 50% off the top guys health.  1pt evis turns the middle guys to slime.  Nothing in that quest requires Any particularly spec.
---
No. Had to move and start over 3 times now.
---
Just a heads up druid tank is viable for 90% of the fights and even optimal in some cases
---
Post removed, fuck you mods
---
Well, I did screenshot this from my sister's snapchat so technically they can fuck off
---
I have an older wow account, but I never played for more than a few days here or there! 
---
I'm currently loving classic, and can see me sticking to it this time round! :)
---
MAAAAAAAAAAAAAA, BATHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, BAAAAAAAAAAAATHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOM :)
---
Yes, it's worth using because you have no instant attacks other than Overpower.  Deep Wounds should be triggered by any crit, white or yellow.
---
Well in that case a set of Wrath servers would be an interesting experiment to test this. :)
---
hey guys I'm actually in this server in the horde side. I'm very susprised so far that rp players are often so nice!!
---
do you guys think horde is fine for world pvp and raiding and such here? is this a good server to stick to?
---
Do you have an email? I can send you a PDF of a guide I'll be using
---
Nah dude. You fuck off.
---
Decided to play against better judgement. It’s literal crack
---
Yes the other layers were a hoot. Chat going crazy, running towards it only to find... nothing. Nothing except a single undead rogue who wandered from the pack.
---
I can bearly kill 2 mobs has a druid
---
Okay I really want classic to succeed as so many of my irl friends are finally back to the game and we are having a blast even though we play casually (we still go to work and play 3-4 hours a day maybe) 
---
When that is said I think it’s rather quick to tell if classic is a success or not. It’s been hyped to death and its launch time of course a massive amount of people are trying it out, but like any expansion launch I think it’s safe to assume a lot of people are gonna drop off. 
---
Give it a few months and if people stick then yeah it’s a massive success.
---
I mean you'll be faster than people with less time than you and slower than people with more time than you, generally. At 2-3 hours a day you're probably not the slowest and not the fastest, there will always be people around your level for the first month at least,maybe less on the upper ends of no-lifing depending on your server
---
I can only read this in deep, tauren voice xD
---
To me it sounds like rogue is your best bet. It's really good in both endgame PVP and PVE and it's a rather flexible class that is harder to master then at first sight. A good rogue is an absolute asset to any particular setup.
---
The downside to rogues is that they're an absolute pain to lvl in classic due to hardly any kiting abilities and their innate low armor. You have a lot of downtime healing up and you can only realistically pull one or two mobs at the same time. Since you say the leveling speed doesn't matter I suggest rogue for you personally.
---
No its people that keep joining full servers
---
Amazon prime you some chairs now
---
Not in EU really
---
Plus, I'm all for an empty server but my friends who are lvl40 by now aren't
---
Can you manually switch to a different layer?  You can do so in GW2, ToS, etc.  Not sure if you can here.
---
I don't know about him, but you convinced me, good luck for your project.
---
The video part isn't that important IMO. Things like upsampling and anti aliasing are rather deterministic, it shouldn't really change much from one frame to the other. Even if it does, it would only be on a few pixels scale. You could try to treat it as a set of independent frames for now, and only worry about it if it causes problem. If it does, even RNN-like structures can theoretically be trained by GANs. (You plan on using GANs, right?)
---
IMO one of the main problems you'll face is in the lower levels, to use your model once it's been trained. I assume you'd want to integrate it into a game engine you have full control over? There will be interesting details to consider. Like your original frame is going to be generated on a GPU, you'd want to feed it to your network directly from there. Potentially across different GPU computing libraries.
---
Not everyone wants to play PvE to avoid queues. My friends and I are PvP EST. We were going to roll Herod and went to Stalagg when Blizz warned us. A few got in on launch night and power leveled, others didnt. The ones that hopped have had to hop again since then because literally every PvP EST server has a queue at night. This isn't a player issue, this is a Blizzard issue. They need to offer free xfers from any realm to new realms to resolve this. The longer they wait, the more "server community damage" they will cause.
---
His popularity in general or this recent memeing? I feel even the Barrens chat humour has been in fairly good taste, now thats really saying something.
---
There is an attack button that she can click or set to a key bind, or she can create a macro that does it.  There is no assist option in vanilla WoW.
---
Making proffesions cost money while leveling. You can try grinding some Human mobs for some drops(you can try farming some animals with fangs they sold nice to vendor), do instances and sell junk. It is better to go back to vendor and sell stuff when you got your bags full. Moneu IS struggle in classic for many ppl.
---
You don't need to buy all the spell ranks the moment they're available. Buy only the ones you need during leveling.
---
Try selling the greens/crafting mats either on AH or in the trade channel.
---
Still a little early to gloat about success, but it did surprise me how popular the start of Classic has been.
---
Frost/arcane. Check icyveins for builds :)
---
Yes you can play wow classic and be just fine.
---
Give it a wave
---
Yesterday I spent 1 silver in something and was like "dude you are robbing me here, that's my hard earned money"
---
Great stuff!
---
Hunter ranged weapons at that level are like 6-7dps.  That ap is basically a 10% dps upgrade each.
---
&gt; the dude who tied a pencil to his oscillating fan to hit his space bar
---
That was pretty funny, though. Still shitty, but funny.
---
i have that, and bound to both directions of my scroll wheel.
---
zip zip zip zip tag i win!
---
I think you mean bfa is for 120-120. And only for 3 weeks after the latest raid comes out.
---
When the latest XIV expansion launched they made the afk timers a few minutes rather than bear indefinite as it normally is. They also did restarts every night to kick people off who were still afk at 3am. Those legitimately playing could get back on but people just afk all night would wake up and find themselves booted and at the back of the queue.
---
Looks like Stureplan
---
More layers does increase population, otherwise why would they be worried about queues after they remove layering? It's like throwing a pizza on a pizza rather than cutting it into slices.
---
Very interesting. It’s almost like they are slowly opening it up. Whatever that means....
---
There were some people complaining in westfall, but it's a PVP server, things like this happen
---
what's the difference between yellow and green server names?
---
so 40 minutes of questing
---
Thanks bud x
---
Hahhahahah
---
Me? I don't take this so seriously. I didn't play during launch and I've just been having fun interacting with people and exploring the world again. I have a daytime job and a household to take care of, I could devote every single free minute to WoW, but I'm really not _that_ interested in it. You're just a lying troll, there is simply no way that someone who doesn't absolutely loves this game and has been grinding every waking minute since launch is 32, look at the Method streams lol, those are about the most hardcore WoW players you'll ever find and they're in that level range. Stop you bullshit, nobody believes you and even if you were telling the truth nobody would care about your dumb complaint. If you're gonna shitpost at least make it funny or something, this is just sad.
---
TBH FOMO is what makes me log in retail.... And FOMO AGAIN is what makes me queue to play classic... No luck on my free time tho, still lvl 1 rogue :(
---
Barrens chat feels empty honestly
---
Yojamba!!!
---
You get 2 from the fishing vendors
---
An Macro helps a lot. A pet in Classic is like u Said. Kills all or nothing.
---
Well on the pet bar there is a command for attack, so if you press it or bind it to a hotkey you can tell the Imp to attack (because you want it to be on passive setting). 
---
You can also make a macro and combine it with a spell if you wish. If you put ”/petattack” on a line in a macro, it will make the pet attack.
---
IIRC, pets (and warlock's minions) have only three "stances": Aggressive, which transforms them into war machines hellbent in destroying anything that moves; Defensive, which indeed makes them attack when you are attacked; and Passive, which they technically do nothing unless you order them to.
---
No, there isn't a stance where the pet will attack when you attack. You have to do it manually, either clicking on the command, or pressing ctrl+1. I do that with my hunter.
---
Yes, that is I.
---
Razor fen kraul isn't a "few" levels.  Its basically 18+ hours of leveling later.
---
Getting to 20 is easy, honestly. It's the last 20 levels are brutal.
---
You don't seem to understand how the hunter weapon claim works ;)
---
You are not supposed to train every spell. So that part is working as intended. I want for skinning until 60, and vendor the bad leather. Works ok so far.
---
Better to hold (or press once to spam, again to stop spam) for greatwr automation
---
1 - 15 is nothing compared to the rest of the grind.  Don't worry about feeling behind theres no rush
---
Go into keybinds and change pet bar c 1 to shift mouse wheel, or get a macro such as 
---
/cast Immolate
---
/script PetAttack(target)
---
I think it'll work, i personally just use shift mouse.
---
I realize this meme pertains more to Dark Souls than to World of Warcraft. But after last night's session, this randomly came up on my YouTube recommendations - and it really hit home.
---
I love Classic as a game, but I love it more as, well, a community. And I love the fact that the community came back. I spent an hour chatting with another tank I knew last night, catching up on our lives. Just us, fond memories, new revelations, and endless sea of pigs to kill.
---
I'm home again.
---
Yeah Blizzard has on multiple times that multiboxing is fine, which is crazy because most private servers ban it lol
---
I guess the fact they make money off accounts helps them with that decision
---
Gotta admit I got jebaited, and it was pretty funny too
---
Good job. Not even in OCE.
---
I still don't grasp the pricing of stuff at all. Only really got into WoW at the end of WoD and it was a mess then. I'm going to try and be more active selling stuff on the AH on Classic though! I'm doing herb and alchemy. Should I sell pots?
---
That too, but also people who hold server space because they are entitled
---
when you get quest rewards pick the ones that vendor for the most.  theres pretty big differences
---
&gt;Everyone says Alliance is the best leveling experience
---
Do they?
---
That ap is significant for the amount of ranged dps your bows are at that level.
---
usually, we do the same.
---
Nope if you roll pvp you’ll get ran over in the early levels
---
This
---
I'm a mage too, and the only drops I'm getting are leather/weapons i can't use. I did receive a dagger with +1 Str, but come on...
---
However, if you're in a guild or have friends in Classic, ask to swap items. Or sell and look on the AH. some lo level items are barely above vendor price.
---
20\~ or so, what?.. 
---
That's about the time I've spent in hours in queues so far, people just "checking it out" will not be sitting hours in queue...
---
Exhibit A: Pandas.
---
My plan: get it queue when I go to bed. Wake up 5 hours later and hope to play. Never log off for 3 days.
---
If they wanted to do the dungeons without ever dying they could, but it wouldn't make for very good viewing.  They don't want to show a stream of pulling one mob at a time, drinking after each pull, and then pulling another mob. 
---
Classic dungeons are very easy if done correctly, they are much more difficult if you do them incorrectly and over pull.  Streamers are going to do them incorrectly because the correct way is boring.
---
My tinfoil hat theory is that many people at Blizzard are afraid of Classic doing better than retail, as it will highlight the failures of the last 10 years of WoW development.
---
I thought they changed the way layers work for classic though? 
---
I was under the impression that you could seemingly randomly get thrown onto another later and have everyone around you disappear. 
---
Now you're on a later from when you log to when you logvout, unless someone invites you to a party from another. 
---
I think the way they're doing layering is the only reason no one is complaining... although i couldn't see them complaining anyways with the way the queers are.
---
Damn... Where do i get my daily dose of po... i mean goldshire now?
---
Isn’t this bannable?
---
Why do we have to assume that? Where did you get those numbers from?
---
I call it "F the main tank" but that's just my sense of humor
---
I miss UBRS 15 groups
---
Where do you get your "100%" from?
---
As a warlock I try to give out unending breath whenever I can. Its not much but its what I've got!
---
"Falling into lava bad" - He said with a smug smile on his face, not realising that yes, it is in fact bad.
---
If you are hardcore and know exactly what you’re doing, without slowing down. You can get 1-20 in 8 hours played.
---
For someone like me who is pretty much new to the leveling experience I think I hit 1-15 in like 12 hours.
---
Still almost 10k queue on firemaw, and it's not even prime time yet.
---
I got three of those slippery suckers drop for me in quick succession! I was jumping out of my chair by the third.
---
Dude, I got murdered in the spider cave at level 4 in the undead starting zone
---
I laughed my ass off
---
I didnt hear VC until BC. DM was Deadmines. DMW or DM West was Dire Maul West, and so on. It wasn't confusing. People just seem to want to pretend it was.
---
He asked, I answered, then you came in like a flaming retard commenting on how things WERE when you correct my statement on how things ARE and double down saying "yeah but it was like that when I corrected you" which obviously is complete bullshit as you can see. 
---
Why are you like this? Just admit you were mistaken, I was correct, you were wrong, and move along.
---
The main issue is the low amount of servers (from the very beginning), not the low realm player cap. I believe we agree on the same things but are just arguing about separate things.
---
The fact is that by the end of phase 1 the layers will (or should) be switched off.  It will be a shitstorm when players from most populated servers will be forced to migrate to low populated server, a more massive shitstorm than the one we experienced in launch, am afraid. But it's the only way. Should the layers still be on when phase 2 comes, classic would be just another retail expansion with just a hard reset, as classic would miss 3 very important aspects what vanilla had the retail doesn't: server community, world pvp and world bosses.
---
I'm surprised you people think this is an ok behaviour..
---
I'm leveling a leather user (rogue) for the first time ever.  What other classes sould I expect to fight for the gear? Hunters can use mail right?
---
Dude the dungeons are so much fun, doing RFC is actually challenging and fun.
---
Retail dungeons were just speedruns, with no mana problems or threat problems or strategy or anything. Retail can still be fun, but you NEED a dedicated 5 man with friends or you will just not have fun- nobody wants to group up or waste time questing, and not talking to anyone for hours is depressing. Don't wait for end game to start grouping up and questing/dungeoning together. In Classic, you need to work together or you will not survive.
---
I would go for imp if not cc is needed
---
Me and my old original guild decided to move there on tuesday.
---
We're over 60 hardcore active players playing on Alliance.
---
We're sticking with it through thick and thin.
---
Welcome.
---
Such a wholesome post, and the slight grammatical errors make it even better. Glad you're enjoying the experience! Keep on it :)

Ok but as a warlock this represents me completely
---
Unless the wife is the one playing Classic\~
---
Easy way around warden for a mouse clicker . Remote pc into your main pc from a laptop with a clicker with varied times 3-4mins or what ever.
---
I played a warlock human and troll on retail. Never ever played a gnome character in 14 years of playing, honestly I think gnomes are awesome + your character can fit through gaps all other characters can't. And there fall damage noise is so cute ... You hit the ground and they kinda go *owww*
---
yes! it's just so rewarding to get something you know you really worked for. 
---
I just bought my skinning knife and can start skinning mobs. It's ridiculous, but this 82 copper cost me some serious grinding (and two deaths)
---
Paladins are fantastic healers in dungeons AND raids, its essentially the only thing they do right at cap. 
---
Take this with a grain of salt as I was horde in retail classic but you shouldnt have a problem healing dungeons with some Intellect gear. I do not think a dedicated Holy Spec would be necessary until Sunken Temple or BRD. 
---
Theyre crazy manaeffecient and at the end of endgame they were bottomless manapools that flashed light at anything that took 2% damage. 
---
Look into mouse over macros for healing as well as a Pally Buff tracker. Good luck.
---
You just have to be patient, choose mobs carefully, manage your hp/mp, use polymorph, nova etc. it has been a breeze so far for my mage but some parts do take more time if you take no unnecessary risk. I see a lot of people who use no spells other than fireball/frostbolt.
---
Mage even pre-20 for me remains top 3 easiest class to level.
---
Salty
---
Thanks mate !
---
Thats a horrible way to make money. You could grind 5s by the time you walk halfway across a zone.
---
&gt;  turn retail, someday, into a more fun experience? 
---
Iirc that's what thesy said in one of the interviews. Not exactly the same words but I believe it was Ion who said they hope to (re)learn a few things when Classic launces.
---
Fuck thum, roll on it!
---
The video is not funny actually, it's sad in my opinion.
---
On what grounds?
---
what are you talking about? wow vanilla is pure of perfection, a masterpiece.
---
Love this meme, I can relate since I play a Priest and spam buff every single soul I see. Sometimes I even buff People flying above me on gryphons if im fast enough.
---
For healing all you need is the gear in pre 55
---
Gotcha. Thanks!
---
Not with auto walk
---
But it does if you press W
---
Text color is garbage. redo this for upvote.
---
Imp is your dungeon demon, succubus is pvp demon, voidwalker is your grinding/questing demon.
---
I wanted this myself but couldn't find anything. Now I just go on "feeling" and actually it's working out great
---
It was like WoWs version of the CU that happened to Star Wars Galaxies imo
---
Eh that's cool, still be higher pop than classic realms
---
In dungeons I always tell the tank "heres a healthstone. Lemme know if you use it and ill give you another." We gotta get our rocks off somehow!
---
Viable? How about they are the strongest healer in game.
---
How about we fuck on!?
---
10/10 meme
---
Thanks for all the welcome comments and advice here! Noted and message well received with thanks!
---
Depends on how you define difficulty.
---
Complexity of rotation, requirement to remember tactics and move during the fight and responding to unexpected situations are what I consider to make WoW more or less difficult, and in those cases Retail is much harder than Classic by a long shot.
---
Classic requires more time investment though, which is why more casual players will be turned off by it.
---
I don’t. But that also make them not the best melee, healer nor caster. As they are utility and all-round instead .... right?
---
Gone to .org looking for a sword trainer for my Tauren, then thinking Tauren couldn’t use swords because I couldn’t train it. Then getting roasted by trade when they told me I had to go to undercuts
---
Gotta say, my favorite dungeon is GR...or is it CUS? Oh who cares, the one with the trolls...the sandy trolls.
---
But why?
---
Yeah better make a bus service and only carry 20+ people at a time.
---
Dreadmist EU here, only had a couple of queues with only 1 being longer than 10 minutes. Even at the times when theres no queue the servers are still rammed with folk. Low pop is the way to go lads 💪
---
Whoaaaa, not the devs. Guarantee they had nothing to do with the call to make those changes. It was project management and other depts.
---
Any time you can play is worth it!
---
I don't think you understand what I said.
---
There can be drastic differences in population between "full" servers.
---
As a Warrior I play in a 5 man party. Gathering quests take forever though
---
They get FoL at level 20, really can't heal well in Dungeons until then.  You will need a healing set too because your mana pool will be pretty small and will have to drink after every fight.
---
Yeah.. I don't think so.
---
Yes.  I play on Blaumeux and it was “low” the past two early mornings.  Full and queueing after work
---
That sounds really cool :) thanks for the heads up!
---

---
Also it allows for variety in groups. You don't need tank, 3 dps and a healer, with 2 mages or hell even 3 you can control the fight to a massive extent, and you don't even really need a dedicated healer atleast for RFC. You just juggle the threat between eachother. It's awesome.
---
I see you too have a good taste in beer.
---
Just go enhance and heal as needed. Respec to ele at around 40 so you dont have to keep multiple pieces of gear available. You could ofcourse level as ele but its mana hungry, and resto is just pain.
---
Putang inamo
---
Yojamba horde definatley has ques, felhunter is the only OCE without.
---
You realize they can run Dungons on there own right? And some even have done Raids by themselfs.
---
You can prob get rank 8 as causal. Possibly even rank 10 after long enough if you can go a little harder towards the last rank. I don’t do end game raiding either Bc of the same reasons, and I was always stopping at rank 8 (rank 10 wasn’t worth it for me as a shaman) and could hold my own quite well, although sometimes it would be difficult. It’s just more of a challenge. You basically have to accept the fact people will be better geared than you, and you lll need to use everything to win those fights. I highly suggest getting engineering. You will just have to use more consumes in pvp to try and get an edge. 
---
What class are you? Sounds like a rogue to me?
---
the spell tooltip shows how long your dots will last

PROTIP
---
By default, weather density is set to 1 (0-3 with 0 being off) 
---
You can change this by putting   
---
SET weatherdensity "3"   
---
at the end of your config file in the WTF folder and saving.  
---
Enjoy much more intense weather! It's so great.
---
It’s Samwise!
---
yeah its definetrely not the end of the world. As a warlock its a minor inconvenience but hey - thts how it is.
---
Nope, you can enjoy the cheese.
---
Yeah, but the mobs are irrelevant to the quest
---
Same for wl
---
Yes I did realize that.... by realizing I didn’t have to play WoW.
---
Then you’ll be dead soon!
---
Willing to pay for a copy of the guidelime guide ;)
---
let me in. LET ME INNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
---
That's where my buddy and I farmed most of our linen
---
I love giving the buff to undead for just this purpose. It makes me chuckle
---
Get to level 16 then it's smooth sailing. You're so close.
---
OK, I apologize :)
---
What controlling and management fucked up. I have nothing hut highest respect for the devs.
---
What I don't mind is a LFG tool similar to what we had in TBC. You get a list of people interested in a dungeon and then you message them and group up and hoof it to the dungeon.
---
However, I am not ok with instant teleports to dungeons, autopartying and cross realm groups.
---
Warriors, Locks and Hunters that do raid and will get better in phase 1 and beyond will eventually out scale you if youre only wearing pre raid BiS.
---
That is how gear works.
---
Can we switch these? I gotta say, I prefer Iron Man, but those are fighting words.
---
Eh, at this time of the day queues are really low in most areas. It was like this yesterday morning as well.
---
Have fun playing though!
---
You can skin Worgen... just sayin'
---
Shit you could play on Herod with that schedule and have no queues
---
The difficulty comes from the relative power of the player characters.  In Classic, you're exceedingly weak compared to the god status you have from the get go in Retail.
---
You feel for it fool! Thunder Cross split attack!
---
Same , not gonna wait 6/8 hours in q .
---
Isnt raiding, and everything required to get there, and integral part of the games content?
---
Most people are just going to say “you should have waited a week after launch to take time off” because launches are always clusterfucks and we all knew there would be q’s. The fact that your friends can’t be bothered to take 5 minutes to get together with a plan just means you should all go your own ways. They don’t care about each other obviously, and more care about getting on the grind.
---
Lvl 6 takes what, an hour or less?
---
This. 
---
Me and my friend rolled on Bigglesworth when it first released since other servers were full, and now that one is full. He hasn’t played in a day or two, meanwhile I’ve gotten a lvl 12 pally on sulfuras. 
---
I can only hope he gets on sulfuras before that becomes a constantly full server. I have a backup to my backup on Thunderfury, but it’s all so tiresome
---
JFC... I need to learn sword with my rogue. and while we're at it, club. 
---
No.. I need to get MONEY to learn sword and club. lol. 
---
Does anybody know if we have connected flight points yet?
---
but how?
---
dude come on, you know the fire breathing, tail swiping, don't stand in fire raid bosses of classic aren't as hard as even a 5 man mythic boss on retail lmao
---
Yeah they often messed the patch up and it took a day or two to make it playable fairly often.
---
Hu3Hu3 BRBR hahahaha
---
If you're concerned about feeling left behind, then you're definitely not in the category of people just "checking it out".
---
While we don't know how many are, there will be a lot of people who don't stick with classic and drop off within the first weeks or months. The numbers are guaranteed to drop quite a lot; the real test will be to look at averaged player numbers 3, 6, 12 months from now.
---
No, I don’t think that’s it at all. That was almost a good opportunity to use that word though
---
The DC rule is epic haha. A strong worded email littered with drunken spelling mistakes no doubt!
---
I keep it simple and /roll. Lowest takes a shot! Guaranteed great times ahead!
---
just gave my first dungeon a go -- deadmines.
---
took over 2 hours because people kept going afk and had to be replaced. 
---
ez 20-25 minute dungeon if people are capable of sitting in their chair for that long. dumb as fuck.
---
Seee i dont even have anything on 60, soooo....
---
Yeah, Vanilla was all about the gear.
---
Which is why, as a PvPer, I enjoyed TBC and WoTLK much more than Vanilla. I could actually progress without a near impossible time-sink grind.
---
What's that timer when you reach the character screen?
---
Let's wait till weekend and see what happens.
---
Blizz adamantly says - they dont think so. Since low pop now are still bigger than a healthy server need technically.
---
I vaguely remember running dps leathers on my warrior, can't remember when or where or why only thing I do remember was it was fun
---
With a voidwalker right? With my imp (still lvl9), I die if I aggro more than 2 !
---
First night, 24k queue after work, no chance.
---
Second night, logged in on lunch 17k queue, got home to 8k remaining, no chance.
---
Third night I'll be logging this lunchtime to around a 10k queue, hoping i can actually play on a server with my friends tonight :D
---
Who the fuck IS Justin Davis?
---
they're talking about free transfers. paid transfers will most likely be introduced. wouldn't make sense for blizz not to do it. question is when.
---
I personally wouldn't restart if your friends are on a completely overcrowded server. it suck. it's very likely that some of them stay full permanently. imagine crashing during a dungeon or even raid and not being able to get back in due to a queue. no bueno.
---
Firelash
---
There are some but imo it's not worth playing on a dead server endgame
---
I strongly recommend looking into earthbind kiting with 2handed enhance. It will change your life. Learn to prioritize Mana on lightning shield over other spells to save Mana for heals in a pinch. It's strong as heck.
---
Don't buy every skill available. Lots are circumstantial, others are niche utilities, some are only really useful if you are a different spec.
---
Cant we just enjoy classic for a while before bringing up all these ideas for endgame. It's been a few days and people already trying to give reason to add stuff.
---
it's not against tos to be online
---
^(warlock)
---
Wait, it rains randomly?! What?!
---
How much are linen stacks selling for. Are bags still profitable lol?
---
Me right now. Rolled on Sulfuras and have made it to 12 so far and the longest queue was 5 minutes. 
---
People choosing to roll on the most populated servers after blizzard said they would be populated and then complaining about it makes no sense
---
Where can i get me one of those
---
Thinking that this time I wouldn't die trying to get through the Boulderlode Mine
---
I grew up with people playing amd me playing WoW im only 2 months older then WoW its the reason why i game i was so into wow that i brought the art books and lore books to school
---
Move to Dragonspine, queues are reasonable
---
So you know that if you imp tanked on the pserver with your warlock. It wont work on classic, Imps are alot squishier. usually dieing in 3 hits or so.
---
I can't remember the exact name of them, but the WA pack I picked up was under the warlock section of the Classic wago.io page.
---
Pretty sure it was https://wago.io/plnU7EMi1 but not at home at the moment to double check what's actually installed.
---
&gt;3.5k is too low. 30k is more like it for a healthy populated server.
---
What the heck am I reading? 3.5k was the highest population server cap on retail vanilla servers. I don't even want to imagine what it would be like for 30k players to be in the same server - either way, it's not vanilla.
---
Definitely gonna try afterbwork. TY
---
I mean in generaly. He said couple times that "Im not that good of the person, stop it." Which kinda proves the point tho.
---
Modern solutions include a completely random autoit script that does multiple different commands at random intervals at random lengths.
---
Actually it has improved. Yesterday at 1pm UK time there was a queue of 17k. Now at 1pm UK time there is a queue of 10k. 
---
That's an improvement.
---
Joined this server yesterday. Hope they will do this more often as I am sad I missed it! But great to see stuff like this happening :D
---
Without even a clue of what my account name and password are, I think I'm good. :)
---
Oh no, I was saying I hate the night elf zone. Completely separate comment lol
---
This is just good old fashioned kindness. I sent them back a couple of minor mana potions and a nice note :)
---
Welcome to the family of knowing how good vanilla was, brother!
---
Correct!
---
It is Titan Panel!
---
ThAnKs FoR aUtHeNtIcAtOr BuD
---
*not seen* me and the  warrior bois in the corner looking for scraps
---
Because the community is extremely toxic watch this will get downvoted into the abyss proving my point
---
I see a lot of priests around, but for dungeons people still seem mostly look for tanks and healers (though there are some LFM 3 DPS calls).
---
Get outta here with your useless buffs :D
---
The shit they say in World chat is great too!
---
And a pally I’m sure to throw a buff on a melee class as they run by. It’s only for 5 minutes but it’s better than nothing!
---
Same! I started cooking cos I love cooking irl, and I didn't know what to do with all the food so I just started handing it out to lower level players. Warriors particularly were very thankful haha
---
Yep, Prat
---
I'm trying to assemble a collection of 9 characters with each class and race represented once (and one race doubled up because 9), but I'm having trouble figuring out what to do with a tauren. I'm not necessarily a slave to the meta but I do like my class/race combo to be at least synergistic, what classes benefit most from tauren racials?
---
Just wait until lvl 20
---
Eh, have come across plenty people insulting "retail babies".  Assuming some are just trolling but over the years have realized some WoW players take stuff like that a bit seriously.  Wouldn't say classic is all that more difficult, just requires more time.
---
Regardless the slapfighting is ridiculous whoever initiates it.
---
Error, Justin
---
Yeah I wanted to play as a paladin, and my buddy wanted to play dwarf so we went with Alliance haha
---
"some wire tripped me lol sorry" - blizzard probably
---
Naked death run up stv coast is the quickest I think.
---
I would probably use the vanilla mounts a lot more if they weren't still so low-poly. As a DK I have been wanting an updated Forsaken mount for a while now. 
---
In Classic it's not as bad because everything is low-poly. But in Retail it looks really odd when everything else looks so much better.
---
Yeah, I ended up just going to bed early and waking up at 1 to play. Then went back to bed lol
---
Race doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things, it's only minor differences. Choose what looks best to you.
---
Class does matter: if you want to be able to play alone (solo) don't go warrior. Warlock and hunter excel in progressing without outside help.
---
not rly. its the ppl with macros and autoclickers.
---
You think you do, but you don't.
---
Only by being invited to a group by someone in a different layer, and even then there are restrictions. You can't just ask a friend to invite you when attacked in PVP and get out without a fight. It was made this way to specifically stop people from (easily) abusing layer switches.
---
I was just thinking I should do exactly that! I always feel a little bad when I get buffed and have nothing to give in return.
---
Item level is what you want to look at. Not sure on your second question though.
---
There actually is r/classicwowplus
---
An 8 slot bag dropped for me earlier and I’m pretty sure i ascended being
---
Yea, after a long while of countdown.  I suspect it bugged out and that #2/3 was actually #2xxx/3xxx.  I forced a shutdown to requeue and it bumped me to #6xxx~ and them immediately to #6.
---
Never! Was great to experience.
---
I feel you my man. Can't wait to tear into Arugal again.
---
Only buy essential ranks of spells.  
---
Buy bags asap. They extra bag space pays for itself within a few hours.  
---
Take skinning, and vendor everything you skin, (AH is flooded).  
---
Avoid production professions like alchemy (they cost money, use up mats you can sell for money, and the AH is flooded by people selling the items they used to level), but if you do then lookup which items you can make are needed for quests and churn those out, as everyone will want to buy them. I think [\[Strong Troll's Blood Potion\]](https://classicdb.ch/?item=3388) and [\[Frost Oil\]](https://classicdb.ch/?item=3829) are the main ones for Alchemy. Though potions that are useful in PvP like [\[Swiftness Potion\]](https://classicdb.ch/?item=2459) can be profitable down the line, at the start of a server they are in high supply as they are rewards for several quests.
---
Prat
---
Every time I find something Green, I link it in my guild, and someone always can use it. Be it linen cloth, recipes, staffs. Gave a mage a Shadow Wand that dropped from some random mob and he was ecstatic. Don't just mass sell, check if your guild needs it, and then use trade chat if it's particularly good. Or auction house.
---
Yes, I agree but you can see that Blizz is trying to balance something they cant really predict. I believe that wast majority of servers will be alright  - long term.
---
It's okay, his mom can probably help him out!
---
They pay a monthly fee ..let them afk if that's what they want lol.
---
Amazon.
---
So the middle scrren is for porn?
---
As far as I can tell, stabling the pet does not affect its happiness.  But yeah, dismissing it certainly does.  However, flying to town means that you land without your pet out so if you just don't summon it until you need it (leaving town), this doesn't appear to affect its happiness.  
---
This has just been my impression/observation.  I could be wrong.
---
Doesn't look like it's changed much to me lol
---
Yeah but excluding server downtime when you actually logged in and the server was full that was the wait time you could expect.
---
I give bandages to people that buff me as hunter since i cant buff back
---
Here's a more in-depth explanation from the AMA the dev team did last week: [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ct08c7/welcome\_to\_the\_rclassicwow\_subreddit\_ama\_with\_the/exi8loz/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ct08c7/welcome_to_the_rclassicwow_subreddit_ama_with_the/exi8loz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
What server ? I’ve experienced zero server lag or issues at all (except the queue) spare maybe the first hour of launch.
---
Don't worry, there will be people leveling alts. :)
---
Just make the patterns random.
---
Dude imagine playing Hydralisk as a class.
---
And those hogging server space while at work, so those of us who log in when we get home have a queue and you don't, it's selfish
---
Everything except the skeletons. Supposedly they removed them to prevent spam and "hate speech", when in actuality they're just bowing to Chinese censorship.
---
10-20% is also a prediction.
---
Yeah, I read it again. Statement still stands.
---
Queues start right in the morning here now, since everyone and their mothers downloaded Chrome Remote/that other app and queue up while at work. Yup, weekend's gonna be rough - I'll be up early AF, that's fort sure.
---
It’s the right choice
---
That doesn't make it time gated though... 
---
People were grinding nightborne too cause they didn't play, and flying, that doesn't make it time gating
---
AI eventually gets to the point where it's such a huge chunk of a mage's mana bar that they're basically spending an entire drinking session just to buff one or two people.
---
There's something about Classic. The way the leveling is balanced. I distinctly remember this feeling when I got my first character to about level 20. Up until that point I was kind of confused and frustrated with him. I rolled a totally different class this time around and felt that same feeling of understanding. Up until that point I just wanted to reroll to my original class. Now I identify with my new character and love playing him.
---
I hope end game holds the same appeal.
---
As a Warlock I feel left out. Wish I had a buff to pass out. :(
---
From someone who works a 9-5 I have not been able to play classic yet. I get home from work and sit in queue for 2 hours then it’s already close to bed time . Would love to play!
---
Ever heared about the launch of a game called No Man's Sky?
---
Naah, thats such a small minority that there is no sense to bend over backwards cause of em.
---
Do you expect me to get off work at 3pm and start playing at midnight?
---
I met with a tailor who already had high tailoring. He worked with everyone including other tailors like me. People trade me linen to change for bolts. I trade to this guy and he makes the bag the original person wants. I skill up he skills up the other gets a bag
---
Why are you acting like new players start the game and can immediately jump in to mythic keys? There’s a looong way between starting the game and that point
---
Most likely from simple buyouts.
---
I always hope for the mp5 buff from paladins that I buff, it really helps me be able to buff more people.
---
I was in westfall, leveling peacefully. Damn layers.
---
Awesome!
---
There's a couple points I think need to be made here. 
---
First, even in 2004 WoW's graphics, while artful and aesthetically pleasing, were even then considered to be on the low-end side, because Blizz wanted to make sure as many PCs as possible would be able to run their game.
---
Second, most players had reached level 60 within the first few months of Vanilla's release in November of 2004. Yet, subscription numbers kept climbing. Not only were new subs coming in, but most players were *staying*. I was one of those players. I hit 60 about 2 months in, and I, like many others, *kept playing* the Vanilla content for next two years until moving on to TBC when it released, and then to WotLK when it released.
---
I quit playing WoW during Cata. I skipped MoP entirely. Came back to check out WoD, and quit that before even hitting max level. Legion released, and I played that for 2 months before quitting, because the game felt like I was just logging in to do upkeep. BfA released, and I played that for a month before quitting that for the same reason I quit Legion. I can't recall a time when logging into Vanilla ever felt like a chore to maintain upkeep.
---
I hope Blizzard makes their designers play Classic.
---
They could learn a lot of lessons and bring life back to retail.
---

You come close to your boar's face, look him in the eye and open your mouth wide.

Then, proceed to close it and do open again.

Do this until he starts mimicking your behavior.

Serious answer: Tame a pet that has the ability natively (Boars dont) like a wolf for example. After a while the ability will be in your pet spellbook and you can teach it to others.
---
Use this:

---
Man whatever. 
---
I went from Thalnos to Incendius day one and finally Kirtonos. Two times I had to queue it wasn’t longer than 45 mins. Same for my friend. 
---
There are options. It sucks when your friends are in a crowded server. But aren’t they in long queues too? Why not all switch to a lower pop one? The one I settled in has a healthy population and if there is a queue, it’s during prime time and no longer than an hour. 
---
The game is hardly unplayable or not worth the asking price.
---
You learn a pet skill by taming a wild pet that already has that skill. In your case you'll need to tame a pet with the bite skill. Which one is that? Google something like 'wow classic pet skill list' to find a table of where to get what.
---
true but it was changed at some point during 2005
---
Like, it's a fucking MMO not the grocery store.
---
That's good. I made my solo alt on bloodsail since I know my friends won't rp with me lol. There wasn't a queue and it was high pop but it wasn't peak hours so I wasn't sure if there wouldn't be one at peak hours. Theres so many people though! I was surprised the rp server was so popular.
---
Yes, but they've stated that many players in one area increases server load exponentially, so if people spread out more 1 layer can support more people.
---
There are servers without queue times. Blizzard was very up front and honest about picking your server wisely due to queue times.
---
It’s not blizzards fault you’re stuck in queue timers, it’s your fault. Grow up and accept responsibility. Pick a server with no queue time or stop complaining. Thanks.
---
Find a pet that have the skill when you tame it then use the pet and get your loyalty level up with the?new pet and it will teach you the bite skill that you in your turn can teach your old pet bite.
---
Well then me searching for a HD picture of that place was a waste of time. 🙃
---
Are the number of servers indicative of relative player base? I'm, having a blast with this game, but it struck me there were so few servers needed.
---
So you want more realms but not more layers? Do you just want to have low population servers? Because if that's the case roll on one of the lower population servers. They will be 3-4k population by phase 2 when things settle down.
---
Don't vendor that leather, use the auction house! Did that on my Warlock in Vanilla and was rich by the way I reached 60. Granted this economy is brand new but I think the end result will be similar.
---
People keep saying unsubstantiated claims like this, almost as if they want it to come true.
---
waiting in line to kill a boss for a quest. some high level D\*\*\*k comes up and keeps getting the hits so nobody can complete the quest.
---
We should be reporting them I guess
---
There hasnt been any queue times in the mornings when I've been getting up so all that would happen is  I get up early to enter queue, it puts me in game and i decide i dont need to sleep anymore lol
---
... Aaand... RIGHT CLICK!!!
---
That's perfect amount of sleep
---
&gt;However, I am not ok with instant teleports to dungeons, autopartying and cross realm groups.
---
Yes, I also would not like to see those things in Classic. But I really want some alternative to spaming a chat.
---
Me and my buddies were talking about this we decided it's a dick move but ifn your full and dont wanna trash a couple silver for 4c then sorry next guy
---
I hope he’s wrong but a post like this when it’s been out three days doesn’t prove him wrong.  This shit reminds me of times my team got reverse swept in the playoffs.  Stay cool and don’t gloat until you win 4 games.....
---
Thank you so much for this post! I really want to tank aswell and while I'm only level 8 at the moment I was a bit scared because other people would call me out for not having much vanilla experience (besides my limited time on nostalrius). 
---
I will go on and keep playing with my warrior.
---
Get ClassicLFG addon! 😂😂😂
---
I like the cluster fuck boss camping. Feels like a new game lol. That aside this is probably the best thing actiblizz has ever released and they didn’t even make it!!
---
Fair enough. Judgement set is one if the best looking sets ever too. At least in my opinion.
---
The biggest sigh of relief is knowing this is it. There's no expansion looming over our heads. At least, for the moment.
---
You can take your time and enjoy it.
---
Unless we're only seeing a small corner of it, it looks like an awful enclosure for that type of animal too.
---
theres hundreds in queue because people are macroing to stay ingame when @ work or asleep.
---
Is it? I don't see how having a problem forming a raid adds to the experience.
---
Dont forget before tbc came out you could buy the rank12-13 gear without needing the rank i do belive this is their plan later on
---
Same :)
---
From what I've seen 90+% of the actual groups trying to do it (not just streamers) don't see great success. It's just a fad right now.
---
You paid for the retail experience, which is unaffected by Classic. They owe you nothing.
---
That's macros, not RDP, remote desktop requires keyboard interaction.
---
All eu was down for some 45 minutes yesterday. Stop crying
---
Yes with VW. Imp is so squishy. So send VW in to mob1 and cast corruption,immolate,curse of agony, then fear mob 1 and send VW to attack mob 2, put up dots on mob2 and then put up dots on 3. Mob1 should more or less be dead by the time fear wears off, mob2 will get finished by VW and you can take mob3 on 1on1. Keep juggling the fear and use life tap when appropriate and you can more or less keep on going with no down time.
---
This priest always appreciates the gesture!
---
That's absolutely amazing. High five to him even though he is horde.
---
I play a drood cow on Westfall and except for the 2 times someone has thrown the word "noob" around, it's been pretty pleasant.
---
I've only found 1 potion so far haha. But I'll probably continue to help people out, and even though greens are apparantly pretty damn rare, if I find one I dont need Ill give it to a player who does, instead of selling it. And me too, it's been quite a while since I've been actually wanting to get home really fast to play a game. And I love it, cos even though I can only play a couple hours a night due to work, time flies! I'll get on and do a couple quests or just mess around with people, and boom bed time. That's how I knew this was gonna be an amazing game.
---
For me it's more like "Your alarm clock is set to 2 hours and 35 minutes before your usual wake-up time".
---
Hahahahahaa wtf I just read, ppl are obnoxious
---
Not everyone even wants to raid tho. you're talking about a smaller portion of a larger fan base. No one said the mythic bullshit isn't difficult. But the overall games a fucking joke and lacks life.
---
It’s part of the classic experience
---
If you target any mob the tank aggro'd and "assist" the enemy mob, it'll target the tank quickly for you, assist again to target the tanks target. Takes less than a second, no clicking. I use this on my hunter to assist my pet when he pulls groups.
---
On my server there are more people there skinning than there are people killing boars, lol.
---
How did the server hold up? Was it a BFA-type Battle for Nazjatar shitfest?
---
I wen't back to the start area with my priest and handed out Fortitude like candy to low level players and their health literally doubled!
---
I wonder if some of the new players were wondering why their health just got cut in half haha
---
I think you need to escape your `#`
---
This reminds me of starting to play wow back in the days xD  
---
Me: "Buy WoW, Undead Warlock, Powerlevel to 10!"  
---
\*Next day\* Guy I barely know: "Hey come to my server"
---
Me: "Switch server, Undead Warlock, Powerlevel to 10!"
---
\*Next day\*
---
Cousin: "Hey, come to blackmoore and play tauren!
---
Me: "Switch Server, Tauren War..fuck, Druid, Powerlevel to 60 in merely 9 month!"
---
I mean do you want classic or just a classic skin?
---
To be fair you had a community who held dps/healing meters to such a high regard that only the most optimal specs were accepted and so it felt like there was choice but you were often pushed by peer pressure to do what was considered most optimal. The new system does away with that and it becomes about picking the best talents for the situation (aoe, single target)
---
Join us on Skeram! World PvP is gonna be sick and very balanced.
---
How is it ruining it for you? Its monotonus and boring. If other people do it, you dont have to
---
Great link! Enjoy some shiney
---
Check other replies to my comment. Google desktop controll. You need to install it on pc and smartphone so that you can acces tour pc from your phone and stay logged in or get in queue early.
---
Only at 40.  For the first 40 levels, rogues, druids, hunters, and shamans are all going for some of the same gear.
---
Your asking it to show something that doesn’t exist.
---
Youre upset you dont have 4 friends, arent you?
---
To be clear, I’m saying a new player will have to level to max and won’t die once doing it. That’s a long time to suffer through boring easy content.
---
That’s quite a generalisation you’re making since China is as big as Europe.
---
 I always throw a MotW, Thorns, rejuv on when I run by a warrior.
---
I know you'll be carrying us later. I see you.
---
Don't delete it. It's just generated when your client crashes to give Q&amp;A team some info.

Ignore it.

Gotta love it when customer service reps are actually allowed to be people and not corporate automatons &lt;3
---
Neber change a winning horse. If it runs, keep your hands off of it
---
Yeah I ended up waiting 9 hours I think
---
Would they allow a transfer from PvE to PvP?
---
Good for the neckbeards?
---
Fuck you
---
Communication is key.
---
Make sure she understands how important this game is to you, and this initial hype phase in particular.
---
Also, make sure she understands you love her and you'll do your best to balance things.
---
If she doesn't understand or you fail to explain.... Well at least you'll get to 60 faster :)
---
Its like life tapping to get enough mana to drain life to get enough life to to life tap and around and around we go.
---
They slowly removed the dog out of the game
---
Dealing damage to a mob tagged by someone else means they lose XP from that mob based on the percentage damage done to it by you.
---
Essentially if you bite off 50% of a mob's health the other guy will lose a significant amount of XP (and you of course get nothing).   
---
It's like this to combat level-boosting (one guy tags, others not in party kills.)
---
Healing and buffing on the other hand does not reduce XP gained :)
---
Ok explain how having to do 2 months of dailies and weeklies doesn't make void elves time gated
---
Or free server transfers
---
The casters from the official race 60 stream announced: It is confirmed that JokerdTV is account sharing with his brother. They furthermore said that account sharing with a family member is not against the TOS which means no punishment will be given.
---
&gt;at level 11 I am up to 2 gold purely by skinning and vendoring the leather
---
Ok, how?
---
I also skin. I skinned every mob I killed + some more lying around and am lvl 15 now with about 80s.
---
I haven't bought any unused spells, only lighning bolt, flameshock and rockbiter upgrades. And I don't drink at all, although i use bandages I make from the linen drops.
---
So how on earth are you at 2g, or are you severely slowing down your leveling speed just for skinning?
---
Queues went down yesterday, if it's still a 9hr queue, it's your fault for being on an overpopulated server. I had 20mins at 5pm yesterday
---
Prediction: Vael will be a Pushover in Classic.
---
With better Threat Addons, better players, better Tools and timers for displaying mobs, and better understanding of Mechanics It will be exceedingly rare for the classic "Bomb exploded in Tank group Wipe" or "Bomb exploded DPS group we will now run out of Tanks faster than boss will die" wipes to happen. Making Vael much easier.
---
If you can, try to let priests get the killing blow on whatever it is they are fighting. Spirit Tap only works when they get the killing blow and it's really good for their efficiency. I'm a former priest main and I keep forgetting to not go RAWR LOOK AT ME I'M A WARRIOR BAM POW.
---
How do you keybind the second action bar above the main one?
---
I don't know about that exactly, BFA was a time sink in a worse way. I think it's more that they went too far with "Complexity of rotation".
---
Sure I have a lot to do and A lot of flashy things are happening, but by giving me so much to do in exactly the same way I feel as though I have less choice in combat. Classic is too simple to be sure but my ret paladin in BFA is gain holy power, spend holy power, use cool downs, same as everyone else.
---
Having more buttons to press at the right time doesn't feel more difficult, just more mindless once you get into the swing of things.
---
Although the complexity of raid mechanics are definitely in retails favor.
---
The PTSD is kicking in. Decided to not roll warrior this time around.
---
"Why did you put the enchanting trainer in an instance?"
---
"Cocaine is a helluva drug.."
---
Haha yup - the lock life is the way to go! With life tab and wand I’m basically always at full mana. When mages give me water I’m almost tempted to say no hahaha. No down time is amazing.
---
As a rogue you should never go anywhere without Thistle Tea in your bag! I think you get the quest for the recipe at level 24.
---
But no. Waiting for energy is part of a rogue's life. Your auto attacks are a huge part of your damage, at least as combat.
---
When can we get the BC and Wotlk hype train started?!
---
Lmao this guy
---
Extremely relatable...
---
They don't operate out in the boonies of the US, either. At least, I assume they don't because anytime I've tried to look for a ride with Uber, the closest one is always an hour away.
---
Might also just be a smaller temporary enclosure while the zookeepers clean their real living area.  
---
Don't want the animals running around and possible injuring them.
---
there is only one german pvp server so no option for low or medium pop
---
Had a shammy needing on cloth last night
---
Well yesterday i was in que for about 5 hours on Pyrewood!
---
You're a beautiful creature, and dont let anyone tell you otherwise.
---
Plus you get to wand hop like a gansta. Wand is bomb!
---
&gt;I am literally having my childhood memories and feeling of nostalgia crushed  
---
lmaooo wait a week dude chill out hahaha
---
Savage pvp is the best thing's wow created
---
Sorry you assumed presumptions were made... Now go rub one out you sexually frustrated neet.
---
Should have rolled Hunter ;)
---
fing murlocks
---
I've seen only one level 20 on my server. That was last night, and the guy already had a few blues too. So, seems like he's no lifing it.
---
Then they started purposely disconnecting people and suddenly 15k people could play the game.
---
You guys got layers?
---
lol, I forgot about that. I am dumb. Thanks!
---
Sure thing friend here it is:

4 weeks annual leave, 120 hours sick leave, 3 days family and carers leave and a rostered day off per month of my choice.
---
Still don't think it's enough haha, would not survive working in the US.
---
I think what you’re saying is fair for sure.
---
Obviously min maxing has always been a thing, I guess I was just surprised to see it for the lower level instances.
---
With the power levelers though it definitely makes sense to see these “speedrun” type groups forming. It just bugs me a bit personally for Deadmines since it’s such an entry level dungeon.
---
"Special note about WeakAuras. While the addon is available for classic, many pieces of functionality that we are used to, such as dot timers, are not available due to APL limitations in the game in classic."
---
but yeah. I am gonna try again with Necrosis and the aura tracker.
---
/u/Talcho okay I've been reminded lol now have you heard back?!
---
Well it's more that there's actually a deadzone where ranged ends before melee begins.
---
Which is larger on taurens...
---
Westfall is hilarious, you can see so far into the distance and it's nothing but red spots moving all over the place.
---
His statement for anyone curious:
---
"[...]I have switched to a different members platform, so I will need some time to insert those that have bought with the previous system.  If you bought previously and want access ASAP I highly recommend just refunding the previous monthly (or quarterly) order and purchase with the new one time payment.[...]" -Quote from Joanas website
---
You take the server with the lowest queue i had reserved shazzra but went flamelash on launch no queues at all
---
No need tobbe butthurt about my comment
---
Agreed. the entirety of the first 4 zones for humans are really good because IIRC they were the first ones completed with a unified story in mind. Once they did that they realized it would be hard as fuck to do it in every zone, so the stories became more compartmentalized
---
There was 4500 people in queué at 13:00 bst
---
Same thing but in Barrens. I’m normally the dude that tosses a heal out and a buff/DoT. But you’re trying to tag my mob? I let him die and my party got both mobs.
---
# TRAITORS TO THE ALLIANCE
---
Coming from the dude who sounds like he’s hasn’t seen the light in 4 years or a women besides his mom since kindergarten
---
Yes, you dont even have to drop engineering, there is a book for that. Though the video I watched warned that book might not be available in this phase so please double check if you're going out to hunt it.
---
A more accurate equivalency then: Pulling 10 mobs at a time as a Not tank character.
---
I recently leveled a Windwalker Monk and died many times because I wanted a challenge and would pull 10+ mobs at a time, only to realize it was one too many and die.
---
No. Its just for your convinience, timing and such.
---
Never understood the rush. Congrats you made it to 60, now please wait 3-5 days for others to catch up so you can do end-game content.
---
So, I've just finished my exams and can finally play Classic :) I wonder, if  by picking newer servers, with smaller queue I will loose something important (for example smaller community, smaller economy). Do you have any advice? Endure those few weeks of queue and go into Golemagg or just pick newer server?
---
The people who want classic to fail are the same people who want lfr gear to be equal to mythic gear.
---
That definitely goes both ways. How many times are we gonna repost the same stupid quotes trying to validate ourselves about playing a fucking game
---
but I want to play on a pvp server, pve is no fun
---
Your Weapon Skill with 2H Swords is near zero. Keep hitting the mobs, weapon skill will build and you will stop missing every time you swing.
---
It's almost as if people don't wanna spend 80% of their freetime waiting to play a game. Seriously I can't really get mad at these people.
---
It runs on health potions
---
Boxers grinded to Warlord in classic, they will be in BGs
---
Benediction players, assemble!
---
It's literally the same code as in OP's screenshot...
---
SUS
---
I felt that..
---
Unless you killing shit for a dropped item.
---
Then it's 55mins at least
---
Warrior is known to be one of the hardest classes to level, unfortunately you’re going to have a rough some especially if you ever go solo until you hit level 60.
---
Its not a shit show if you're the only one who can wear leather in the group *points to brain*
---
On a more serious note I was quite surprised when the prot warr decided to pass on the blue posion mace to my rogue.
---
Strange feeling that this post will only make the problem worse...
---
Nice me and my friends are playing ally there too
---
Often enough, Agility &gt; Str for warriors for the crit, and leather piece stats are better allotted with +hit or +crit.  Devilsaur armor 2-piece, for example, is easily best in slot for warriors pre-raid.
---
Potions made to level ur alchemy --&gt; put on AH cheap.
---
Extra flowers u dont need font leveling anymore --&gt; Put on AH so ppl buy them to level their skill (better than making pots)
---
Lategame u gonna earn the money without raid elixers, ofc some specific earlygame potions do well on AH (giant growth)!
---
would he get more than 3.7times as many buyers is the question though
---
I was part of that playerbase. I picked Thalnos two weeks ago. My friends did too. We all left for Incendius and then Kirtonos launch day in search of shorter queues. It’s well populated and rarely a long queue. We’re happy and playing without delay. 
---
But yeah, stay on the server that’s overcrowded and say it isn’t fair. Look, I agree they should’ve had all these servers open and ready to go prior to launch. Not to mention them saying move to lower pop servers didn’t help because most servers didn’t open until launch day. But there are options now. People just don’t want to switch servers. Ok, deal with your queues then.
---
google how to make druid macros
---
Tried both, had major issues with questie, icons disapearing for no reason after 1 hour, my map was empty of icons lol . i uninstalled.. classic codex looks better
---
Sweet thanks for that! do you know what the book was called?
---
(or the video maybe so i can watch too?) 
---
Tried looking on wowhead and couldn't find what i needed :(
---
Classic doesn't *require* more time investment, it just doesn't penalize you for playing at your own rate.  Not just with leveling, but at max once you get a piece of gear it's yours to keep.  There's no artifact power grind, no titanforging, no daily quests, etc.  All the time you spend in Classic feels permanent and not a chore.
---
Brother logged without a Queue, wife logged within 30 min at 12, that's what i know
---
That's kinda the reason I rolled mage, I can go balls to the wall and potentially kill 6+ mobs with aoe. That being said, I can very easily screw up a step and get killed in less than two seconds.
---
Risk vs reward
---
You think this is whack, think about all the other things in your life that you're wrong about
---
Parts of this are still true on retail, I had some BOE bracers drop last night that TitanForged (this mechanic is pretty stupid) and are now sitting on the AH for close to 600k gold. When playing classic I get a white one handed sword from a quest and am legit excited because it does double the damage my current sword.   
---
The biggest things though for me is literally the community part of it, grouping to kill murlocks, grouping to kill princess / hogger. Its a fun time.
---
The problem is they cant remove some of the things they've added. Imagine the chaos if they removed LFG or LFR some people have never played the game without it
---
I can’t be arsed to test it myself either, but I didn’t know about warden so when you mentioned it that was my first thought.
---
That's the stupidest thing about all these queues I see. They're 1 by 1. Not a single place in the queue is 5 people wide. That is madness.
---
If you are a dedicated enchanter, who logs in at certain times per day, who always stands in one particular place, you'll make a name for yourself on your server and people will start seeking you out. That'll be another *you're in classic now* moment.
---
I made it to level 8 before the murlocs in Tirisfal gave me my first death.
---
I hate murlocs. -_-
---
When you see a chest. Say “chest, roll please”
---
Yeah i had a sham needing all cloth last night
---
Then that means you chose it, there are other options, hogging server space is the dick option
---
Make sure you have a decent weapon for your level. Warriors are very gear dependent and a high damage weapon is important to have.
---
Also what zone are you in? If you guys are in westfall, it’s gonna be tough till around lvl 12.
---
They changed all of Org in Cata. They moved just about everything around.
---
Fookin LEGEND you are!
---
Thank you very much.  That has been driving me crazy.
---
Yeah, grad school has sucked. I want to binge wow but I have to wake up at 6 am. So I've been rocking 4-5 hours of sleep. Monster is the only reason I'm still alive.
---
What level should I leave Elwynn forest and where should I go next? I like doing quests. I am a human priest playing solo
---
Armor type doesn't matter. All about those stats
---
At level 9 I grouped up with a dude to kill a level 12 elite.
---
A 1H green axe dropped that had +1 strength. This was technically an upgrade for me. I was still having to melee mobs, but I got my pet next level so I wouldn't need it for very long.
---
I told the dude my predicament. He didn't need it and said "take it bro." I appreciated his courtesy and decided to greed. I won it anyway.
---
End of story.
---
There is no book to change. You will have to.level the whole thing up again. You have access to the items that don't require you to have the certain skill
---
I hit my goal last night of dinging level 10 so I can: A) get my talent tree started, and B) head to the barrens.
---
I started playing in WotLK and a bunch of my friends who already had Horde characters wanted to try out alliance so I never experienced Barrens chat. I am excite.

And people wonder why people who play classic get a bad rep. My condolences to your parents, kid.

You're on Faerlina too.  What a surprise.  It is like the surver is full of people or something.  I will take them sweet buffs later on, though.
---
Launch day my boyfriend (he rolled mage) and I were running around brill and I set my imp to aggressive to try and ACTUALLY tag quest mobs that 100 other people were fighting over (it worked!!!). And then we got to a less crowded area and I forgot and it um... it didn’t end well for us.
---
Pro tip to the other locks, don’t uh. Don’t forget if you’ve done that.
---
Hell, that's grad school without WoW though...   
---
Good luck in your studies! Just a friendly reminder to prioritize your education :)
---
The ring needed them and the ring was for raiding.  Facepalm.
---
What is layering for 500 Alex. If they had removed layering from your server Elwynn Forest would have felt like Times Square.

There should be a bar right outside this so both sides can buy each other a drink afterwards.

There were two children in SW talking about Panderens and debating if they were real or not,
---
The game has a sense of history and cultural context in itself. These details are very fun to catch in hindsight.
---
My wife and I are playing dual Hunter and only playing together. We have saved 3 or 4 warriors who pulled too many mobs. Gotta look out for each other.
---
My server whit all my friends has queue of 6 hours everynight
---
- I work full time so by the time I would get in, I got to go to bed
---
- I can't chance server because my friends are allreally there and level 20
---
So I wish I could play classic 
---
But its been 3 days now and I still can't
---
As a Mage, I buff anyone I see. Warrior? HERE GET YOUR WEAPON SKILLS FASTER! \*casts Arcane Intellect\*.

I always watch behind me as I run past as they do a quick stop-jump-jump, and I jump-jump in return. It's great.
---
How? I always seem to lose 60%+ of my hp fighting other bears/wolfs in bear form. I kill them faster out of bear form
---
First time playing so is there something I need to do in bear form? Or specific gear?
---
Remember according to Moore’s law the best way to get the right answer is not to post a question, but to post the wrong answer.
---
there was a dev post explaining the low, medium, high. It’s changed twice already since release. Before release the low population server was equal to a high-full server during the classic era. Medium server was already bigger than the most full server in classic. Now since release and the huge surge of players every server has login queues so they made it to dynamically change from low-full depending on how long the queue is. Every server including those that state low are 4x or more bigger than the servers during classic. A simple search can probably find the dev post explaining this.
---
Until people have a lot of disposable income you may see things selling for very cheap. If you have the bag/bank space just hold onto anything you think may be desirable. You could always vendor it if you need the coin or disenchant it for mats.
---
I think blue items will end up being useful when people have the money and any items that would be desired by twinks should be held onto.
---
Exactly!! I love how me and my friends have to talk about where to do X quest and discuss whats the best and most efficient way to get there.
---
I love how we even had to talk about which professions to choose! "Im a rogue so I should probably pick alchemy and herbalism. I can also give you free pots" "I'll be a tailor so I can give you bags" "I'm a warrior so I'll go Blacksmith, I'll also be able to make weapons for the rogue maybe"
---
For the first time in years, I actually love playing with friends, and levelling professions
---
Does anyone else feel like they might not even end up playing because they can't decide a class or race? Just choosing based on class roles wasn't enough for me to settle on one thing but thinking about all the details, pros and cons makes it worse because of all the tradeoffs.
---
Dude this is me, except I'm not new I'm just the only one with a job and everyone else is at home power leveling 24/7.
---
Same here, playing late at night after work when my gf sleeps, just high as fook, leveling, making professions and being friendly to anyone I meet, I love the chat in the classic
---
Doesn't matter as long as we can repost his opinion for easy karma!!
---
BFA bad. Classic good!!
---
I actually installed chrome remote desktop today to try it out on my phone. It's REALLY responsive. Was kind of surprised to see how responsive it was. Will give it a shot today and see how it goes.
---
I'm planning on transferring in 3-4 months time from Skullflame when the queues die down on the big realms, i actually want to play now though and not worry about an 8 hour queue.
---
I'm making a lot of friends, I'm so happy playing Classic. There's not a single doubt that it's better than retail, even if it's clunky and had really bad quest design sometimes.
---
We appreciate folk like you *cheer*
---
Seems like a bit of a dick move tho. Sure furries might seem creepy to some, but skinning them is a bit too far don't you think?
---
Thankfully any sort of script used to AFK dodge is grounds for an account ban...  and fortunately from what I've seen folks are actually taking the time to report blatant afk dodgers. It's only a matter of time till blizz rolls out their first banwaves.

Stop feeding the troll.

Hey me, get outta here!
---
I sell most lv 10 greens for 25s and they sell constantly.
---
Ahhh. Was confused for a second. Was like yeah zep is outside the city duh lol
---
Retail fanboys who cried and screamed and were appeased for the last decade with “quality of life improvement” changes to the game that are scared now that their retail experience may become a ghost town as people opt for a more challenging and alive world. The only challenge in retail is after you get to max level, and it makes the other 90% of the game dull and unchallenging. Not everyone is dead set on end game content, a lot of people just want to explore and have fun in the world.
---
But it also has some of the most memorable dungeons and cities imo. I'm not saying to bring it back exactly the same but I would like some of it. 
---
I don't think flying is that big of a deal if it's limited.
---
nooo dont tell them the secrets
---
Bears and wolves in the forest too... Just laying there.  Lol
---
Pretty much what everyone else has said. General/Trade chat tend to be about what you’d expect in my experience, and you’re definitely not forced to participate in RP.  I haven’t really done it in years, partly because of burn out, partly because I just couldn’t find the right guild after previous ones disbanded or went inactive etc. And as mentioned, there are absolutely social and raiding guilds on RP servers. It’s just easier to find RP and RP guilds on those servers :P
---
By ‘starting trouble’ I generally mean in-fighting or someone was an a-hole to someone else within the community. People who don’t RP who try to start trouble are generally muted/blocked/ignored etc because most of us are used it and just roll our eyes.
---
Fun side note: There’s an often unspoken (and sometimes explicitly stated) rule against being caught anywhere near Goldshire. For what should be obvious reasons. ‘Tis a cursed place.
---
I mean yes, I get that it kinda sucks for everyone that is stuck in such a long queue but so was I and I'm not paying a monthly fee to not be able to play the game.
---
I'll be sure to find that low pop when literally the time I want to play all the EU servers are high or full 🤔
---
If you don't mind grinding (which I hope you don't in Vanilla WoW) you can stay in Elwynn 'till lvl 12 doing all the quests and grinding the rest and then head to westfall or and switch to the Loch Modan around level 15
---
Well, I respect your opinion of course mate. Though I count on my own experience much more.
---
Yeah my friend is.a supply teacher and said little kids call each other "default" as an insult, meaning default fortnite skin
---
Lol c’mon dude, wow classic that hard
---
It's not like ascended gear added vertical progression. It's just one layer above exotic (the highest tier before).
---
So if you get to ascended its bacon m basically horizontal again.
---
And with raids and fractals throwing out ascended it's not even hard to get the best gear in the game.
---
It's not even needed (outside of fractals)
---
Nah I’m seeing how long I go till his head blows up
---
For a beginning dungeon WC is very confusing. I've done it so many times and I'm sure I'll be totally lost going back in there.
---
That's a workaholic. My grandfather laid in his death bed regretting all of the hours he spent amassing wealth rather than memories with family.
---
I can't say for sure about mustard or mayo, but I do know that Australians call ketchup sauce
---
Ok dungeon I will ask to roll everybody but I'm in random area not dungeon I will loot fast but if in group I will ask to roll ty for this advice
---
Same for my Tauren hunter an stomp with the mob in my face.
---
It's not even working that well for most of the groups.
---
Move to sulfuras it’s an up and coming server with peak time ques only reaching about 30-50 minutes! https://discord.gg/hYTGv5y the server has grown in rapid proportions these last few days.
---
Join your server's Sub / discord
---
Alternatively there is nothing that is just like this - just with less People.
---
Making your own Sub would probably actually come closest to this :d
---
It's a free house, Jim!
---
Classic is great when everyone is leveling.
---
But once the  majority leaves low level zones and they become empty questing is gonna be super hard for late comers .
---
Its also VERY time demanding at end game so not many will get to enjoy end game. (Some raids require to farm specific gear for resistance for example ).
---
No dual spec means you have to commit to a single play style. 
---
So yeah it's fun now ,but once dust settles we need to see if this is true or not.
---
Rend is great DPS
---
I feel ya. My friends started on whitemane and we switched to nagle. I had a 15 min queue at 5:00 est when I got home which was not bad at all. Can you remote desktop and queue up from your phone while at work? Sucks your friends picked a packed server but after this weekend I bet it will be way better.
---
Your unproven assumption about server pop at some unspecified point in the future is not a convincing argument in my opinion. The devs said that even medium pop servers would be higher pop than the very highest vanilla servers. Even the lowest Classic server has quite a healthy population.
---
But your game version gets updated to it whether or not you buy BfA. Even if I don't buy BfA all of the BfA content still has to be installed for me to play, it's just locked behind a paywall.
---
The circlejerk about buffing is real.
---
I'm looking forward to the revival of 360p pvp montage videos with linkin park blasted in the background.
---
Ten Storms no queue
---
impossible on EU. All PVP servers here are Full, even the last opened ones.
---
I decided to keep my vanilla warrior a thing, but everyone and their grandma also rolled warrior

I think I get where you're coming from, but from any other industry, this would NOT be acceptable. 
---
Regardless, this isn't "typical" launch issues. If servers were crashing, there was latency, bugs, etc, I think you expect that. But there are queues? Ok maybe... except these queues are 100% because Blizzard is expecting a large portion of the playerbase to quit. They don't think people want to play their game. It's complete lack of faith from their end. That is shitty. They *could* release a bulk batch of 10-15 servers and allow two free realm transfers per account from any high-full server to a low server, and disable new character creation on those servers for 6-24 hours. That would be a true customer service initiative. Instead, they are holding on to the thought that people are going to quit in the same numbers that they are queuing up to play in.
---
I was about to get rid of the -30 working hours I have accumulated.
---
So much about that...
---
Heading straight for -40 now xD
---
The circle of life.  I hope you're ready to instruct your spawn in how to pick cactus apples and how to tag boars in another 16 years once the cycle continues.
---
Nodoy drove in New York, there was too much traffic!
---
People are always quick to say "that's not difficult, just do it right!" I'm curious, can you describe something that actually *is* difficult? I mean the detailed mechanics that are difficult and why.
---
The more work something takes, the bigger the dopamine hit.
---
Love it
---
Both classes are top tier in dungeons and raids, both are really good in PvP, both have to share loot with a lot of other classes.
---
Does the addon do anything to talents gained by levling up?
---
Meanwhile all I do is cast underwater breathing and get all the buffs in return. Oddly enough people love getting buffed so they seem to buff back...
---
Looking for something like what happened with r/gameofthrones and then the much better r/freefolk. I'm sure something like this exists, just asking if other people are aware of it. But since this sub is now flooded with r/wow people I doubt they know of it.
---
Ah, fellow Bloomoo! Keep it up!
---
Wait, I can hold the key to spam the macro, or do I have to turn some option on?
---
literally does not matter. If your internet is good it wont matter.
---
Any dungeon level in modern WoW is harder than classic? Are you serious? Lol
---
Does that work for Growl, too?
---
Yeah nah, they don't like rural spots in the US, I'm in the same boat. Kind of frustrating because here are places within 30 mins from me that deliver w/ uber eats but they won't actually come to my house in particular because it's out of the central hub area.
---
tldr: Had a good time in the arena once. Steve's a hero. Hail Ween.
---
Big misconception there bud. PVEing on a hunter will remain a breeze
---
Never tampered a lot with the AH. Can someone kindly explain to me what's wrong with this pic?
---
Guild wars 2 did this
---
The game hasn't been out for a week yet and you are declaring it a success?
---
Let's see what the server populations look like 6 months from now.
---
Nah, Uber is pretty shitty to their "contractors". 
---
I put that in quotations because Uber labels their drivers contractors so they don't have to treat them as employees.
---
This is literally all my weekend plans.
---
We out here!
---
Yes and when you loot a chest out in random area, offer to share the items from the chest.
---
I would argue its the opposite. In retail you are literally showered in epics, you can barely customize your character to stand out from the crowd, and small things like a single item drop are mostly meaningless, unless the drop just so happens to be your BiS SuperMegaTitanforged item with a socket. Also, it feels less like an MMORPG and more like a mobile game where you log in to get your daily participation rewards. Also, there's very little to differentiate a rogue from a fury warrior. They don't bring anything unique and exciting to the table, they can just hit things and do damage. 
---
In Classic, every level rewards you with a talent point you can choose to put into a myriad of different talents, every item drop in a dungeon is exciting and even progressing your leatherworking skill takes effort and feels rewarding. The social aspect of the game is also much deeper, rewarding and often requiring, coordination and teamwork in even the simplest of group activities. Classes feel unique and can each do something no other class can, and those things are often very impactful.
---
I only noticed it yesterday. I guess that's a consequence of the server population cap increase.
---
Another alternative I could've accepted for the LFG would be that you could only use it after having discovered the dungeons - and only if you already had a full group. Essentially just making it a time-saver for constantly running to the dungeons you're farming.
---
And I agree, LFR is a fundamentally flawed concept that never should have existed.
---
Need to hurry, the feels train is arriving.
---
Yeah but if you waited so long, maybe you wouldn't mind waiting a few days more, the server situation is pretty awful right now. I mean what's going on now isn't a healthy classic expierence.
---
Hunter are more player-skill capped rather than stat capped. Plus when everything's a hunter weapon you're generally overgeared for the content you're dealing with ;)
---
Hey bro another question for you what settings to you run classic wow? And is it safe to plug in the charger while playing? Dont want to damage my laptop.
---
Was in westfall last night.  Militia part 2 took every bit of 30 minutes in a group of 5 trying to tag the 30 mobs we needed.
---
But hella fun.  The slow pace is enjoyable.
---
Nah. I onlu played druid yo 26 on a pserver. But i found Incould pretty easily kill 2 at a time. Just dump rage into your maul and then swap,heal, swap again. After level 20 is gets better. Remember, you aren't a tank or a roguem your a druidm you can swap constantly. 
---
Try to pull with wrath+moonfire then swap. You regen mana while transformed
---
This is why I liked old AV. It was just a slaughter fest for hours/days.  It just felt like a real battle like this.
---
I play warrior and here is what I noticed.
---
Weapon skill is everything, shit half the time I can't kill something that's anything more than 2 levels higher than me is cause of missed attacks, this will get solved with levels.
---
As for a tip, what helped me was buying a weapon upgrade of auction house for 20-30 silver at level 10 and then again at level 15 or 17. Weapon dps counts for alot when 90% of your damage is white auto attacks, it may look pricey but since a level can take more than an hour it's super worth it as you will keep it equipped for a while.
---
I’m sure there is...google it you’ll probably find something 😄
---
Classic Tank Guide: 
---
Pull - Sunder main target - thunderclap - tab - sunder - tab - sunder - tab - sunder - tab - moar sunders, moar tabbing
---
Where are you getting the add on from?
---
Greens? Those grays are getting me more armor than greens
---
You likely need to assign the auto attack. But why not open with a special like serpentstrike?
---
Also. Dobt forget to feed your pet. The greedy bastards!
---
bro, I was only AFK for 4.5 hours, don't report me, it's not fair!
---
Alright, thanks very much for the quick answer! I'll make a priest tonight :)
---
I remember 2000 queues on blackrock not exactly sure when that was though.
---
Didnt think of that lol
---
you can also just change it to "only show available" so it hides all the ones you cant get yet due to level
---
Being in the first wave to hit 60 sucks. Been there, done that. Know whats actually nice? Having gear on the AH to buy, people having money to buy things from you, and actually having people to play with one you're max level. 
---
I've done the no life, rush to 60 thing in so many MMOs and honestly it sucks the joy out of the games. You burn out from grinding and then get bored waiting for your friends to catch up.
---
I've been giving free food and water to anyone that walks past me.
---
Yep I expected it to flop but I’m enjoying the slow grind. I even thought about going back to aol dial up to get the authentic vanilla experience I remember.
---
This is a duplicate of the keeanu reeves meme and almost a duplicate of the hulk one. Can mods crack down on near-identical low effort buff memes?
---
So moving the unit frames works?  I unlock them in the right click menu but still can’t move them.
---
A bot
---
I heard with the leeway mechanic hamstring kiting will not be a thing, how"s your experience?
---
&gt; I fail to see how it is a player responsibility
---
Pick a server with a lower population.
---
I think it is not possible to right click to use bows. I specifically remember they made this change in the tbc prepatch and it caused the worst hunter in our raid to pull vaelastrasz prematurely
---
Some of us are playing with huge groups of friends, which makes it impossible to move on short notice. A lot of people in my discord were already queued before servers went live and managed to get in right away, others haven't been able to play at all.
---
Sorry you don't have any friends.
---
I just let people borrow my pet for a bit. 
---
Running through the barrens and see a guy being chased down by hyenas?  Meh, I'll send barkley on over to tank for the guy.  He'll come back eventually :p.
---
Dude, it's the first week. Calm the hell down. The servers will stabilize within the month and if that's not good enough, too bad I guess.
---
:') 
---
As a solo leveling warrior, thank you
---
If you get a good weapon that you can't use, run back and learn the skill. The ten silver to learn it will be peanuts when you hit level 20, so you can eventually afford to train it all.
---
Well you have to ask yourself what's easier... Having some rude people or being alliance and having to tell your parents you are gay.
---
One of us... one of us....
---
open skills and use a bow skill as opener , auto shot, serpent sting ect, it will be followed by auto shot until in melee range.
---
Sometimes they can, but a lot of people use those macros to shortcut who they are targeting, like a mouseover macro
---
Miss, miss, miss, miss, miss
---
I'm in this photo and I don't like it.
---
Just wait until you get that badass paladin mace! Verigan’s Fist!
---
I can’t wait to run around punching boars to raise my unarmed skill up.
---
Yeah, I started distancing myself from WoW when it started trying to encourage me to play the game every. single. day.
---
One of the main issues is people in PVP making healers bigger.
---
I would if I could get in.
---
Spreading people increase the capacity. What's resources consuming for a server isn't the total number of players, but  places with high number of people. The more people are spread, the more people you can have in the same time
---
I'm trying not to be such a scrub, so bear with me.  I'm thinking what will happen is that since you bid on these bags, they will be held, because they have bids, but no one else will bid on them, because the market is moving so quickly, meaning you'll get them all for that price?
---
You are the type of player I love to come across
---
meanwhile, I have tons of horde kill him while I'm mid tame took me an hour
---
that's what I'm here for
---
Wish my server was this cool. I’m playing on one of the pop up panic servers on US EST. I feel like I’m missing out by not playing high pop like stalaag or faerlina but the queues are so bad.
---
Spinestone was at full yesterday. Still gave me only a 20 min queue. Usually it's around low-med and no queues.
---
Well met.
---
Sadly no. It was always along shot but I’m glad I tried.
---
For real, thank you and everyone like you. Many an ass has been saved by kind strangers.
---
I really got lucky, at first i picked a high pop server because i want to play with as much people as i can, because in retail i picked EU Krasus where my friends were, a low pop that got fused to, i guess, something like 5 different servers since its creation. And it's still empty as fuck.
---
And now i have the reverse problem ! 6 hour queues to get in ! I consider myself lucky to have rerolled on EU Ashbringer in classic, i only have half an hour queue, i get to play every evening ! :D
---
I would have to wake up 8 hours earlier to play... oh wait.
---
Really comes down more to realm issue now as I had it like 3/4 times now lvl14
---
Hopefully the next one to be honest. Ion has seemed at least open to the idea of learning things from Classic and what it means to the game. He already did that interview talking about how they went too far with class pruning, which in my opinion is one of the key differences between classic and retail.
---
&gt; It just proves how disconnected Blizzard are from their players.
---
It's not just Blizzard. It's everyone. Gaming has kinda sucked and declined since late 2000s. I'd much rather be back in 2005 playing WoW and Halo 2 nonstop than whatever free to play crap/mobile crap is on the market today.
---
WoW Classic proves to the idiots who just tell us "it's just nostalgia, it's not as good as you remember" when I know they're wrong b/c here I am in 2019 still playing Halo 2 and WoW Classic (and a N64 sits on my desk to play through my 90s collection too). Games just suck nowadays.
---
WoW you can enter Classic by a phone ? That's awesome!
---
NP, actually when I hit 40 back then and was graduating to mail, I recall taking hits on stats just to transition armor types and almost start the numbers game anew, sort to speak. But as DPS, I have that luxury. Tanks and Healers kinda have to be on the ball with the stats for survivability
---
Just remember to go into the Mail path instead of the leather one like my dumb ass did in 2007 because I didn't know hunters switch to mail armor at 40.
---
I'm also wearing a lot int and spirit gear as a hunter. Those stats are actually beneficial in classic for a hunter. Spirit means more Regen and int is what a lot of hunter abilities scale off of.
---
Raid on the weekends.
---
For the Alliance!
---
I always throw heals at people who bit off more than they can chew unless they are just tagging everything.  My most traumatic events so far have been trying to heal someone, and right as it's about to cast they die... I'm sorry, I tried!
---
Now I have a res so it isn't bad anymore.
---
Clicking the mob, rotating with the keyboard, leaving attack on the keyboard... DEAR GOD MAN!!!
---
Thank you! I’ve been losing my shit trying to figure out why this keeps happening.
---
Sort by short time. Bid. Profit
---
Ass Candy letssss goooo
---
I'm hoping they learn that people are yearning for the complexity that the systems of the original brought to the plate. The talent trees, the questing systems, the sense of adventure in exploring new places, etc.
---
Instant gratification is great, but the thrill of earning something or accomplishing something hard-fought is better. Quality of life improvements are great, but over-simplifying your entire game for the minority is not improving the overall game for the masses.
---
People want a challenge, complexity, nuance, and adventure. Maybe they'll rethink the way the roll out the future expansions for Classic, but what I really hope is that they do something different entirely. I want Classic to be a world of "What if..."
---
well noticed yesterday there are already a lot of people complaining about qol features in trade chat
---
Wow, you're being downvoted, but are absolutely correct. The appeal of classic is not the difficulty, it is the inconvenience. You need to take mobs one at a time, you need to heal/mana up between pulls, you auto attack a whole lot more than you're used to. 
---
None of those are hard, they're just things you do. If you follow the rules, the mob dies and you live. Is it harder than murderating mobs in full heirlooms? Sure - but it isn't hard, and for a lot of specs, there's not really many things you can do to "break the rules" (no way or even reason to try to pull more at a time).
---
Meanwhile, the most inconvenient thing I've run into on classic is just named mob and long respawn collectibles. Waiting 8-15 mind between tags and spamming a macro is not challenging, it is literally just a time waster.
---
I say this all while actually enjoying classic, but it is certainly not because it is difficult, which it isn't.
---
I don't want retail to fail. I want retail as it currently exists with this 'play the patch' crap, to fail.
---
I want classic to cause the next retail expansion to actually feel like an mmorpg instead of one giant lobby to hop around in while waiting for queues to pop.
---
They've already tried that in Cataclysm, it went exactly as you described.
---
WoTLK's heroics by the end of that expansion could be tanked by a retri paladin with righteous fury and be completed in between 5 to 10 minutes. Cataclysm brought back the kick-in-the-teeth heroics of BC, the outrage from WoTLK-players unable to complete dungeons for pre-raid gear at 85 is probably still echoing in some long lost hall.
---
Warrior + priest/shaman could be very rewarding, but only if you enjoy the classes themselves, because both warrior and priest can be very frustrating for many. Extra bonus is instant group for any 5-man you go for.
---
If you are 30 now, chances are you are nolifing it though. How many people will keep playing like that for a long time period?
---
In the end blizzard HAD to make retail more casual friendly. The game was old after wotlk and started to die off. Dota 2 and league are FREE. Theyre just as fun. So why pay 20 a month? Blizzard needed to make the game worth subbing for those only playing a few hours a week.
---
Retail wow sucks because you all left aftee wotlk cata etc. If wow had 13m they wouldnt change a thing.
---
The changes they made weren't adding/removing major gameplay systems.  Bumping up the debuff limit a bit and using server layering so that people can play sometime this century isn't really the same as trying to find out what parts of an expansion the community wants/doesn't want.
---
Alliance...
---
What if someone just made a mechanical input jump with a fan attached..
---
I mean considering that as 3rd party use..
---
Yes, it's a joke. If there's no software side involved in avoiding afk kick then you shouldnt be banned.
---
They should be thanking you, hell THANK YOU. You are one less person in those queues
---
Go for any but make sure it either medium or low population if you don't want to wait hours in Q.
---
Just to give some perspective, I picked medium server as I didn't want to go to low population due to fear of no one to play with, however if I could choose again I would have went with a low population as my medium server is now full capacity and comes with the gift of a 2 hour login.
---
I have to say that the mages are failing the community most of the time lol. I keep giving them fortitude and the atop and look at me then run off without giving my intellect.
---
You need to share your magic guyssss!
---
Wait there isn't an AFK kick timer??? What the hell blizzard.
---
I use them to tag quest mobs
---
/target (quest mob)
---
/cast Earth Shock
---
Set up an auto clicker to spam the macro
---
I am calm my friend. I just get irritated when I see all these Blizzard Shill posts about “they warned you” “play on a low pop server” when every single server has a que!
---
I play WoW since the beginning, and still play.  Play end game content ., Raiding mythic + etc. 
---
Honestly I thought classic would fail, I was sceptical. Said to people why you wanna play it, it slow etc... I tried the beta and had that feeling. 
---
So release day comes up, I make a character, because I'm like: why not.
---
I'm hooked like 15 years ago. Going to work, thinking: a tonight I can play classic again. Not even thinking about retail.
---
lol she'd do best as a warrior? Is your woman a barbarian? xD
---
Shhh, buying stuff of ah below vendor price is how my bank alt has 9 gold!
---
Rip. Lok tar.
---
Nah, this I'm not keen on. There was a layer crash last night, which meant I went from 2K in the queue to immediately in the game xD I was chuffed at the time, of course, but I feel like it kind of ruined the rhythm for those already in the game, and it would really suck if any of those 2k people didn't get the DC grace and ended up at the end of a huge queue! 
---
They've been doing daily resets at 3AM server time - I think that's enough. While I would rather not be waiting in queue, I would hate being in what is essentially a lottery every 2-3 hours for the people in queue to get in, then the first x amount of people to realize whats going on and relog get to get back in, while others just get kicked to the end of a 12k queue.
---
He died in 1989 of a heart attack at age 64
---
Yeah, the only guys in my guild who are 20+ are the ones who have been playing most of the day every day since launch
---
Ashkandi represent!!!
---
ME TOO! I flew to another state and bought a computer (I'm just going to return it in a few days) to play with a friend I had never met irl. It feels like 2006 sitting in his apartment questing together!
---
For real.
---
It’s the required levels that matter
---
Confirmed by who? How was it confirmed? Sounds like Method hubris.
---
Did you feed your pets?
---
They might leave if you don‘t do so
---
Yep exactly. The fact that they tied it right to the retail subscription with no cost it's obvious they are hoping that once people are done with Classic they will migrate over to BfA.
---
In Blizzard's mind this is a win win. technically their subscriber numbers for retail are probably the highes they've ever been currently. Even if everyone is on classic, I imagine eventually some will at least try retail and that's what Blizzard wants.
---
I’m sure they are monitoring everything and since raids will be down after 2 weeks if they don’t keep adding stuff it might get stale. We just need to see if this becomes just a fun thing to do on the side or if it’s full on a large player base is playing it more then retail. My nostalgia is going strong right now but who knows what it will be like in a month.
---
I had a dream I rolled into a RP-PVP server, woke up frustrated to double check, found relief knowing I was in a pure pvp.
---
the end.
---
Shes a bit more into wow than she should be clearly
---
Sitting in queue for 4h now, moved 4k ppl
---
Idk... Sounds like peer pressure to me!
---
Welcome to the classic family homie. It probably won’t be for a while, but if you start exploring other classes, your gonna notice that gameplay is dramatically different with how you handle different scenarios. And I’m excited for you whenever you get to do your first dungeons. Deadmines and Gnomeregan are real treats compared to their retail counterparts.
---
The holiday weekend will be the breaking point for most of the current players.  More will bleed out over the next 30 days.  People are celebrating the success way way too early.
---
not even a monkey OMEGALUL
---
Blocked, blocked, parties, missed -&gt; dead
---
Unending heavy Breathing
---
Had no queues on Remulos so far. Day 1 starting zone was insane like every other realm though.
---
### ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Look at Tier 1, 2, &amp; 3 armor sets and pick your favorite. That’s what a lot of us did back in the day, lol.
---
So you are going to always use your pvp trinket? waste of a trinket slot
---
As a complete noob with a senpai to help me, I'm happy the RP servers exist and that I already was aware of launch queues beforehand.
---
I've said some pretty dumb shit without thinking about it while sleep deprived. He very well may be acc sharing, but without any evidence we really can't make the claim like those salty Method boys.
---
When you aggro one mob as a paladin.
---
This. Players would not have to do this if the queues were not that ridiculous.
---
While I understand people don't want to log out to avoid queues, there is a big difference between continuing your journey in azeroth, and straight up botting and hogging a space in the server. It'd be like putting an obstruction at your favourite table at the local pub/restaurant/café that you frequent so that you can guarantee it's there for the 2 hours you'll be there that day. 
---
Ultimately, it's just a super shitty thing to do, for which there is no justification, unless that justification is "I'm a dickhead, and I don't care about anybody else." if that's the justification then, hell, I can't argue with it, but it certainly doesn't make them right.
---
Eyy that staff is LIT.

I got a single 2H Sword that was green and had 2 stam and was more excited than I've been for an item drop in a long time.
---
The game just makes you care about the little things. Like I'm actually enjoying the fact that the things I make in Blacksmithing are useful to me and I can wear them. The recipes and food I make with cooking are useful too!
---
It's pretty neat.
---
It hasn’t worked that way in retail for expansions now, but I specifically remember being able to aggro mobs past people to prevent them from mining nodes when we were competing for spawns in Searing gorge. 
---
Mobs can aggro while leashing back to their original spawn so long as it’s not ridiculous distances (see Teremus during stress test simply despawning when Asmon and co tried kiting him over the Thandol Span on the way to Undercity)
---
Welcome to the club
---
I received so much help yesterday, I was using level 1 skill for so long until a guy helped me and buffed me.
---
Loving the game.
---
The player attacking the mob died or use something to lose aggro and you are the closest one to the mob ?
---
[My feelings right now.](https://youtu.be/QEzhxP-pdos)
---
Ok, then I understand your problem. Guess you'll have to wait a bit for the queues to die down.
---
i rolled green out of muscle memory
---
Eleven year old me begs to differ. I started mid BC and never reached 60 on my main, because i just got to 55 when Wotlk was released and switched to a DK.
---
It took me months and hundreds of hours to almost finish leveling, but boy did i have fun.
---
Yes keep them coming. Also if your a mage throw us that int buff it helps with weapon skills from what I read.
---
Also thanks to all the druids who group with me even though you probably can do the content solo. It helps a lot.
---
Try hamstring kiting. Live is _so_ much easier with it.
---
It is but like you said it’s a hassle. If someone is reserving something in the run, they’ll put it on ML for that boss if they’re smart.
---
Makes sense, thank you!
---
We are many
---
I’d argue this too. Current wow is simply built for a different gamer archetype. It’s changed so much over the years that it’s fundamentally different in how it motivates you as a player.
---
I noticed your blikje. Enjoy.
---
Legendary.
---
Dude, every server was high/full the DAY BEFORE release. It doesn't take a galaxy brain to realize that they would all be smashed by people that didn't want to pay for two extra weeks just to get a name.
---
Only if you're afraid of not knowing.
---
Keep reporting. I doubt the people in charge of server maintenance and size are the same people who manage in game names and what not
---
I'm specifically talking about raids. Sure Hunters are excellent solo-ers. I'll probably have one as a farmer alt.
---
I’ve had zero lag on Fairbanks
---
To make the grind even slower...make a character, get to level 10, decide you want to be something else, repeat
---
I have done something like this a few times as well, I feel bad for watching, but dam is it entertaining.
---
Why would you trust the master looter?
---
You're right, damn.
---
Oh definitely. They played up the rewards angle big time. Its a manipulation of gamer psyche, and its terribly ironic because if they went the other direction (playing up social interaction and in-game culture/society), they'd have a game that's more self sustaining and durable (like classic, but even moreso).
---
Plus, "rewards" just offset lackluster game design. When there are no "rewards" your game can't be lame and unfun.
---
The queues don't bother me that much, I started Vanilla a month late (got it for Christmas) and I don't mind waiting a week or two this time around.
---
What bothers me is the fact that most of us knew this was going to happen and Blizzard could've prevented it if they hadn't convinced themselves that Classic would be a failure.
---
Also, the fact that they encouraged us to re-sub 2 weeks early and then said GET OFF THOSE SERVERS is pretty fucking ridiculous.
---
Do you think they will bring the Inky Black potion at some point? Because I really want dark nights ;/
---
Studying, by yourself, with google, lots of people working in this field dont even have degrees.
---
Me too, I knew it was coming due to ads, but I hadn't played wow since cataclysm so I didn't care, then on launch day I got a surprise day off from work, checked my email when I got home to see an email from blizzard and figured screw it, installed the client, paid for a month and now I have a level 12 hunter and a level 8 mage. Fucking loving it!
---
It's slow to solo world mobs.  It's mostly autoattacking and heroic strike, with your specs talent-tree topper every six seconds, whirlwind too if you have the rage for it.  If you don't intend to get gear at max level and don't have a steady group (or at least healer) to play with, then maybe consider something else if you don't want to have to get hella gear to do well.
---
If you can do dungeons to at least get your tier-0 (which isn't hard to get, just takes time running dungeons) you will be fine to do any non-raid content in the game, as well as do decently in PvP if you decide to try that.
---
Though really Warriors are at their best with they have support/heals with them.  If you plan to go it alone it'll be less fun.  With a healer a warrior can go wild tagging and killing one mob after another, even as Fury you can use deathwish and bloodrage on cooldown and just pump out the damage.  Solo you'll need to take it slow and eat eat eat.
---
That redoing content from the beginning relies heavily on Nostalgia, which is powerful in the beginning for relies heavily on Nostalgia, which is powerful in the beginning for players, but the diminishing returns of enjoyment for each successive expansion after that we'll always be some percentage less than it was originally.
---
The person who burned out by Warlords of Draenor the first time around will burn out earlier this time around. And earlier, and earlier, each go around. Blizzard knows this well
---
Well the problem is: maybe 5% of the playerbase (estimated value) are the "hardcore" players. so 95% of the revenue comes from the "filthy casuals".
---
LFR is a great tool for casuals (like me). Thanks to LFR: in BfA was the first time I raided (I started with vanilla left in bc and cam back with wod). In vanilla  I never had the chance to see a raid because i didnt have the time to commit! 
---
It really is about player investment though: there is so much to do but nothing really matters because it will be irrelevant in the next raid tier. and with titanforged it almost doesnt matter if you lfr or go heroic or even mythic .
---
Make leveling great again! Make the old zones great again. There  was a post on the wow subreddit the other day where someone posted some ideas for improvements like a heritage armor overhaul. updated skyboxes. new itemisation, class quests/agendas etc. etc. 
---
It doesnt feel great to have the same armor from lvl 1 to 120. there is no sense of improvement. The way i play the goblin shaman i currently lvl through dungeons hasn't changed since ragefire chasm until the pandaria dungeons. heck i dont even know what they are called because everyone is just rushing through. its just so irrelevant. 
---
the other day we wiped three time because of a cataclysm boss mechanic (i think cataclysm black rock the mage with the two dragon adds, second boss, forgot the name). the grp disbanded to another instant gratification run not willing tho figure out the minimal amount of mechanic there was to play. 
---
TLDR: Player investment has to be a thing again. Instant gratification damages the game. Casuals are not to blame (mostly)
---
Thanks.
---
How the fuck do warriors lvk as DPS? I always level as tank and just power dungeon farm with a druid that knows wtf is r4 ht
---
Looks good man
---
increase pop limit

Gets parried, dodged twice, miss, MISS AGAIN. Well I'll see you guys in hell.
---
Ooh!
---
It was never just one thing that tipped the scales, it was the accumulation of many small things over time.
---
Nah just work timing, though my first post could be misconstrued. Didn't see sense in playing bang on launch as I was up early for work and would have only had a few minutes if I'd managed to miss the queues.
---
There's not one thing that you can say to make it right,  
---
Unless you say I'm leaving\~  
---
And if you're not, then please tell me whyyyy  
---
Please tell me why you can't  
---
SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAVE

Say it to my

FAAAAACE
---
I feel the same way.  I loved vanilla but a part of me thought classic coming back wouldn’t be as fun or memorable as the first time.  I was wrong.  I’m having so much fun.
---
Then where should the goalposts be? My guess is the popularity and population of Classic should be compared with both Legion's and Warlords of Draenor's numbers on a week-by-week basis. That would probably give a pretty good idea of where Classic falls in terms of long-term fortitude.
---
Oh forgot to mention, im rogue.
---
Yeah cause the average gamer is a tierwhore now because of the normalization of ranked/comp modes in most online games so everyone looks up what the "best" is now and every guide online puts warrior as far and away the best vanilla class.
---
On a search for bear ass isn’t wrong
---
it has the additional bonus of getting up for wow, not getting up for work
---
i actually resceduled my life around going to bed early and doing stuff for me before going to work, though that somehow got lost again and i am back in the usual stay up until you know it'S already too late and then get up in the morning grumpy and with bad attitude because it's only work waiting
---
The wierdest part is the change in him talking and not talking. I saw quite alot where he would talk and answer chat, and parts where he would answer questions about gold by simply pointing at it saying nothing. 
---
Still not evidence, but kinda suspect.
---
You're one of the good ones. :')
---
Wonder if that Chimp has tried DMT. Definitely has been working out with our ONNIT © kettlebells. Bitch is RIPPED. Huehuehue.
---
35 here. Marathoned WoW Classic last night for 6-7 hours, unheard of for me. Last time I played a game for even more than 2 hours was Witcher 3 and before that it was Diablo 3 until I realized it was hot garbage.
---
Horde, alliance, I'm the guy the gun
---
wow, you can train a few rank 2 and 3 spells now!
---
Yes, never forget that your guild name is just an extension of your character name. Plus its just fun.
---
What is more important, a 3 days of effort or playing with friends?  I say it’s better to start over at 20 than to start over at 60.  Playing with friends makes the game so much better
---
As someone who played nostalrius while everyone was dunking on how it was just nostalgia and the game was terrible, it really makes me happy to hear people come back and say they’re actually enjoying the game.
---
It'll be whatever it was back in 1.12 since that's the patch that WoW Classic. If in Vanilla (not private servers) it was multiple mobs than I'd imagine it was multiple mobs. But that's just an educated guess.
---
Wait? They remove it?
---
classic DOA /s
---
Could have been trying to spirit rez, depending on how over the top he was going with the tagging. I do it quite a bit when the run back takes longer than the rez sickness.
---
Rogues are not op in classic. Classic is on the patch where they got nerfed hard. Most classes beat rogues in 1v1 assuming equal skill.
---
Did that plainstrider have a beak?
---
If you pick warrior solo leveling is damn near impossible. You will hate yourself as you slowly grind to lvl 60.
---
Group leveling is different though. No matter if you’re playing tank or dps in a group even with your low damage you feel useful. Low level warriors have so much utility like demo shout. Hamstring... ect. That if you use it you will be very helpful to a group. 
---
Basically it really matter if you’re going to mostly play solo or in a group on whether it’ll be fun or not.
---
I had to re-roll on another server after starting a mage.  I was annoyed at first, it turned out worth it.  The best thing about this game is playing with friends / community.  I was initially going to rush leveling but now that changed. Four of my friends and I just grouped up in Westfall last night, repeating the quests I already completed 2 hours in advance.  We were cracking up and having a great time.  I have no plans to level to far ahead of them now.
---
I'm very much enjoying it as well. I'm getting hit by some big nostagia, and seeing all my totems again (shaman since the beginning) is reminding me how much Blizz has normalized my favorite class.
---
this correct, aff is better for leveling but for raiding most go SM/Ruin (30/0/21) or Demo sac/Ruin (9/21/21)
---
GW1 had a lot more horizontal progression with the skill system, the need to get all skills really had a nice objective to persue. It's just too bad that Gw2 actual leveling wasn't nearly as satisfying, World PvP wasn't really good either for those max level wanting to play the endless PvP endgame.
---
People wouldn't have been bored late game if the game didn't feel like a Wow clone with a lot less content, or if the PvP was actually engaging or if the stretch of the endgame goals wasn't too easy, or completely ridiculously hard (Getting full set of endgame gear for a dungeon vs getting a legendary weapon), there's not much in between, and the fractal system didn't add much to fix it.
---
Ok Mr. warlock we all know you you have a drain soul macro that deletes the shard. Unless manually deleting your extra shards somehow makes you a better player.
---
Thinks its just called weapon swing. At work unfortunately.
---
I get all my add ons through the Twitch App, and just searched weapon swing for it.
---
Yer concussive shot is nice, although if you get the hang of the swing timer you could avoid meele all together (and therefore save a fortune by not buying meele skills)
---
Was in SW last night and saw a nelf in chat, asking about how to get to stormwind. There were many F’s to be seen in chat lol
---
I feed them all time once I see it go from 100 I feed the pet
---
he has Bezos money now pleb.
---
Guys only want 1 thing and it's fucking disgusting
---
Not to be "that guy" but...we told you!
---
Context pls ?
---
I thought we didn't allow personal attacks on this sub
---
Lmao my gf is learning preist (and the computer in general) and i didnt tell her about follow so shed have to learn.
---
Bloodsail has only ever had a queue on launch day. It's been great.
---
Well, make new friends or make new character. Pretty much your choice at this point.
---
It's definitely more efficient to quest constantly, but dungeons are always worth it in terms of exp. Just maybe not worth the time it takes to find a group and run it VS  questing
---
Haha yeah
---
Mrglgrlgrglgrl gonna give it to ya
---
Your hunter is having a bad time
---
What
---
hhhhhh
---
Eh, but then you’re wasting time in the auction house when you could be leveling to get better rewards and items that sell for more. Also, you’re probably throwing junk away in the field when you need room for that green because you have 10 other greens already in your bags that you’re saving for the ah.
---
Probably not first. 
---
People on Herod are pushing 40. Try /Who # to check levels
---
Good to know. I only had 20 copper to my name last night after buying skills lol. Have since rebounded after questing some more so I’m going to check the AH tonight.
---
Sorry but agility is a great stat for anything that doesnt fling magic. And even some things that do.
---
Rogue can eat shit.
---
For glory friend, we must endure. *Oh shit defias boi i must run*
---
Why weren't these pictures taken with a cellphone?
---
What app/software is being used? I can't tell from the video.
---
Honestly I missed out on classic, tbcand wotlk (other than Icc).
---
Ever since I played this game I could fly around and skip everything I could so I could get back to being afk outside of stormwind. 
---
I know you don't mean do it anytime soon, but a tbc with no flying and similar style as vanilla would be awesome once content starts to get stale, I would love to relive the journey of wow where the devs had a chance to learn from their mistakes.
---
It's been all of 3 days, somehow I doubt anyone else has gotten so frustrated with this sub as to make a new one yet.
---
I know, I'm just trying to get an idea of realistic expectations considering how often I would be able to play.
---
Hey man, not all people are the same. Some girls enjoy playing with knights and dragons, some boys enjoy playing with dolls. Nothing wrong or weird about it.
---
Need a tip? Demoralizing shout, disarm(when applicable), thunderclap. I survive atleast 3/5 2v1 situations thanks to these.
---
OH SHIT TIN FOIL HAT TIME.
---
Brack made that statement because he knows how much we actually wanted classic WoW.  So in turn, making us play it even more and flood blizz with subs because he knew retail wasn't headed in a good direction.
---
4D chess.  Checkmate.
---
A lot of people were running on metered connections or shared phone lines meaning they wouldn't be always online. No point pinging someone who was offline.
---
Me too haha, worst part is when they hp is low they ran away to call their friends over, then they all start to shot lighting bolts at you, and i don’t know why the mobs can shot shit at me from 50 yards away but my spells only has a 30 yard range, cheers!
---
My new server still had queues last night bud. They didnt increase it that much. We arent risking server stability for the morons who insist on not adapting.
---
Its a first world problem. Organize yourselves and move
---
Thats what changed my spirit towards the game. I fully quit when MoP had a legendary every class could get with no effort as long as you played(paid) for 6 months
---
But we are in the wowclassic sub...
---
Funny i have the opposite problem
---
How do you have decent internet?
---
Hmm, don't have the bars locked and I also don't remember having to swap spell ranks manually before. I'll take a look through the settings when I get a chance to see if there is something in there I missed before.
---

They going to cross reference all the Mac ips? Lol
---
Might as well keep track of the people in the house so you can't get a family member to do it.
---
Have you tried Necrosis? That's what I use to keep track of dots on my lock.
---
We've had toxic people in the game since 2004. Just wait until people start looking for Mankrik's wife...
---
Awesome :D gz
---
I was on Skullflame but hopped on to Ten Storms because.. well it's called Ten Storms for crying out loud.
---
EXACTLY. Every guild that was made before classic release intended to be on Arugal as it was the only server announced. It was stupid not announcing two beforehand. I'm in the same boat as you mate.
---
Using auto clickers is definitely bannable. Just wait. Any sort of macro to not get logged out is.
---
Those last 3 bullet points gave me a chuckle
---
How do you make the party frames look like that
---
Same i havnt really played classic servers too much in the past but i still remember all these quests. im lvl 26 and havent needed to google or download a questing addon yet. I didnt know i had all this knowledge stored away.
---
Read a work email 10 min later gone, get a classic quest in 1k needles remember exactly where to go.
---
Nope haha! Vanilla logic
---
I'd rather have a few highly populated layers than a single layer with an 8h queue
---
Leveling and gearing a second character will take more time and gold than the cost of just respecing
---
I don't remember dieing this often on my initial play through...
---
Noticing it doesn’t mean it’s not there.
---
RP servers are low-ish pop now but they will always have a community and most likely get stronger with time. PVE-only servers you may have a point.
---
Welcome Home!
---
Literally turning 29 next month, this hit too hard.
---
The low pop I decided on two days ago was "High" yesterday and I didnt have a load time. Are they increasing server capacities?  
---
Also curious as to whether they're still adding more servers?
---
...
---
Yes but with OSRS people got very bored within the year.
---
OSRS would not be alive without the continued stream of new end some content and quality of life updates. 2019 OSRS is an extremely different game than 2007 Runescape. So it’s actually a pretty solid example against what I think you’re saying
---
That was my thought too haha
---
OmniCC: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/omni-cc
---
The community is going to do what the community wants. Blizzard provides the game experience, you can't force the community experience.
---
Cringe, just go on a dead server and stop crying
---
Someone was asking which vendor sells them but I had no idea. Where can you find them?
---
Didn't repost this, actually made them with screenshots that I took my my wow client \*shrugs\*
---
The tinfoil hat I saw for it was that they were intentionally throttling Aussie based players to stop the influx of us into American servers. Implausible, but I suppose vaguely feasible.
---
I feel you, I'm level 10 with 4s. Though my dumb ass bought daggers with out looking at the cost...
---
[Context](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ns15eHLDv1I) if anyone needs it.
---
I imagine he was trying to complete some quest and didn’t want anyone else taking the tiger. Although I just group up and I never have to worry!
---
But it also did away with ALL hybrid specs, which were still good as late as WotLK IIRC.
---
Maybe ill try that in the morning, i missed the queue by a bit today so i probably have a few hours even after i get home. 
---
Cheers.
---

you're welcomed! :D
---
I had to go through an entire cave of goblins to kill a boss, Fizpockets or something
---
Jesus Christ. Felt like I was soloing the Lich King
---
Good luck with your stupidity OP. I'll be logging in remotely while I leave work in the mean time. You should report me for that too.
---
That also will make you both better players because you'll have a more experienced understanding of aggro, your limits, getting a feel for crit chances, etc. so you'll intuit your way through challenges in the game. 
---
If you ever really want to have a wacky time, both of you should roll paladins. You'll both suck at dps, but have every trick in your kit, plus be tanky. It makes every fight really strategic because you can't burn down mobs but you CAN stun/heal/buff/go invincible, which makes adapting and reacting as you play very powerful.
---
Well there's a reason why we left :D
---
So in my opinion, Blizzard should now try to focus on how we "stay".  
---
Just by getting back to the game, it shows that we **want** to play the game.
---
Blizzard doesn't even need to do anything fancy for us to stay.  
---
They just have to make sure, there are no reasons to go.
---
And in my opinion, they can make that possible by actually listing to our needs instead of trying to "force" theirs on us.
---
I'm pulling 2 sometimes 3 and getting out fine... Look up how to kite it may help lol.
---
It gets a lot better in the 30-40 range with whirlwind axe
---
Imagine being unable to tell jokerds friends are just saying it to troll. He was in that ts server for ages but suddenly forgot it wasnt hidden? cmonbreh
---
DD forever
---
Logged in to see two people AFK running against the wall in the Dolenaar inn.
---
Need to be up by 6 am. Went to bed at 1... Thunderstorm woke me up at 3. Guess I'm playing until the alarm goes off.
---
God bless you for this
---
games been out for less than 48 hours.
---
I personally am done worrying about layering at all.  I don't really care.  I just want to play.  If it's a choice between layering or multi-hour long queues I'll choose layering.  If they have to turn it off server-by-server as the populations stabilize that's fine.
---
Yeah it's a completely ridiculous mindset.
---
They really aren't. They predicted the massive influx at launch. If they increase server capacity too early, people won't leave for the smaller pop realms. If they add too many realms, when the hype drops off and people quit, those realms will be abandoned.
---
This is an incredibly complex situation they're dealing with and you don't seem to grasp that. The frustrations people are facing is part them trying to force people to lower pop realms through queue times, and part not wanting to make too many servers as then they'll eventually end up with a bunch of dead ones which is horrible in classic. This change is part of that, they've gotten a lot of people to switch over so far, and they don't want to add more realms.
---
When I login, I see so many people auto running against walls inside of taverns... So obvious :/ 
---
At least let other people play correctly. If they play their fill, queue times will be reduced anyways.
---
Same and 0 since then. Sad
---
*misses final attack that would have killed the mob*
---
Dude is just sharing his take on long term future of game to have a discussion on a discussion forum site, you obviously think the idea is terrible but would be cool to get your take as to why it would be bad in a few years time, genuinely interested.
---
Never hated murlocs in my life before, till classic dropped.
---
Haha I’d be fine with retail not running that well seeing as I now wish to spend way more time on classic but with the way it runs that’s pretty unrealistic lol
---
Im doing jack shit at work, no buiseness today...
---
And im thinking how i could spend this idle time lvling my druid.
---
That's a basement cabin obviously!
---
Heh, the first time is saw the roll mechanic, i thought that the coin meant you needed to sell this to get money, which was for sure a priority, and the dice meant you don't need it and it'll be random on who gets it.
---
What about for my buddy who is only playing with us but happens to live in New Zealand?
---
If you can't take at least 2 mobs as pally you're doing it wrong, heal is your friend
---
Exactly, this weekend is going to be brutal.
---
Thank you champion of the light.
---
As a DPS Warrior, you just learn to tell yourself it will all pay off when you get closer to end game.  
---
Right now, I've just learned to convince myself that this is the Classic immersion experience and all is going accordingly.
---
I've yet to see anyone say the gameplay is fun yet. I mean people love the social aspect and doing quests together. But once that dies off I think the game 15 years later is quite hollow. I was fortunate to play classic in 2004 so I've been there done that. 
---
But I can see in a week or 2 all this buzz and excitement will die off quickly. The game does a lot right, but it also does a lot wrong in 2019. I for one enjoy it, but the combat is dull as are the quests on your own. I don't particularly want to dedicate my gaming life to this game that I already did 15 years ago. This game is one massive time sink and personally I don't think it will last en masse. It will just end up with the dedicated people. Personally I'm conflicted as to whether I want to commit to the game. Just my 2c.
---
I think also people are jumping to conclusions with the whole "you think you want it, but you don't line" people are saying fu to that comment in launch week. Let's see how that stands in two months first. Otherwise they will just throw it back in everyone's face. I for one hope it does keep going though
---
They are smart! You get a free bag and they lvl their tailoring.
---
lol wtf. I'm 30, my mom is 67, I don't have kids yet.
---
same here... I wonder if the queue is going to flip this weekend. Everyone will switch their schedule to accommodate the queue and then it'll be 12k at 2am and 0 at 2pm. Lol
---
You realize you're doing the exact same thing with this post.
---
 Yeah 10 hours might not be big compared to the total investment for a max level character. It's still going to be an issue causing people to not reroll. If they hesitate and continue playing the time will just stack up and like I wrote they get even more locked in.
---
 If I take myself as an example. I have a lock at the moment level 19, have herbalism around 120, skinning 140. Have an alt that is level 10 with around 80 in tailoring/alchemy. Sure compared to how much I will play over a long period of time it could be argued I can reroll. My feeling though is I'm not rerolling. I would rather stop playing altogether than reroll at this point. Have invested to much. Professions are very tedious to get going. Especially herbalism on a new server.
---
 My server had 7 hours queue in the evening. Will be interesting to see how it looks today.
---
&gt; It's short sided of Blizzard to increase the amount of layers. These servers obviously have a huge overpopulation problem. Come phase 2 when the layers are removed the queues are going to be massive. I guess Blizzard is relying on people quiting and opening free transfers to low pop servers come phase 2. 
---
The layering will either stay in phase 2 or phase 1 will be dragged out. I don't care what they say. They will not hold that promise.
---
I figure, go nuts this week and weekend and get it out of your system. Then take a more relaxed approach starting next week.
---
Chrome Remote Desktop :)
---
I feel you. Getting 6 hrs sleep max atm
---
It's funny because hunters weren't bis dps for anything!
---
Back to being schooled
---
Hopefully for current WoW's sake, a trip back in time to Classic will shed light on that for the dev team and they take notes of things like that.
---
YES i'm not the only one who noticed! I don't know if you realize how big this is for endgame dps. This is going to help us big time. 
---
I have 100% noticed this. Especially when getting a new slower weapon and i screw up my timing to realize...i still auto'd. Granted i'm ONLY noticing it for multishot so far. Arcane and serpent still clip. As long as aimed lined up and works like multishot, it's going to help so much endgame for our dps. Even if it only works for multishot it'll still help as every few rotations you still end up clipping a bit.
---
Hey man someone did that to me while I was doing my druid aquatic form quest! It wasn't needed but did make it a more comfortable journey, so thanks warlocks!
---
They have but there still isnt enough EU severs
---
There have been people on this sub. You're just not looking very hard.
---
Hm, i see.
---
I was never big on PvP, i enjoy PvE content more. However i do play on a PvP server because i like "the thrill" of encountering enemies and having this feeling of danger :)
---
Savior! thank you.
---
Had to move from Mograine after hitting lvl 15 to switch to Dreadmist, I hope the servers don't die as I know Blizz probably won't let us transfer...
---
Also hoping the queue is relatively ok tonight!
---
I got to level 21 and have had 6g gave 2 away though.
---
Need more rage. Need more rage. Need more rage.
---
At least priests can heal tho
---
Yes but have you considered... feline runspeed buff talent should be back?
---
Ok bro
---
superscaling i assume
---
Same. I can’t sell anything beyond vendor prices so I’m better off vendoring/disenchanting.
---
Unless they died, then the agro is all yours.
---
Let's put things in perspective:
---
* A WOW Classic players makes Blizzard less money than a WoW player 15 years ago.
---
* A WoW Classic player makes Blizzard far FAR less than a retail player now (it's not only the micro-transactions, it's the tokens, many people pay 20€ for their sub).
---
I don't see how this is supposed to work if you want Classic to thrive... subscription for WoW Classic should be ~20€ to stay in line with the original one.
---
When’s ur Ted talk
---
BrRoOoOooOmMmmM! BrRoOoOooOmMmmM!
---
Dude, come join the fun
---
Oh hi :)
---
nah man play who you want; there's probably a few hard core guilds who might care, but they wouldn't be fun to play with anyway.
---
Hi, /u/HandpickedNut
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cx12ue/what_should_i_do_with_my_copper_bars/). 
---
So ordinarily I wouldn't make an ass out of myself and admit this, but it's Vanilla and it's been a long time for a lot of us. 
---
Apparently life was slow going because while I upgraded my spells, I forgot to actually swap them from the rank 1 versions.
---
Genius huh?
---
Druid or priest
---
I think it’s dumb. My friends refused to move even before they started, so they just let their pc sit in queue for fucking hours while I’m running around playing. I guess I’ll find my own guild later..
---
Ofc, I was just saying I am used to having my information on the edges and that I can't handle stuff in the center. Other people obviously prefer other things ^^
---
They added thousands of layers to help with queue, these will ho away eventually.
---
From what I've heard, I think that the "Diablo 4 mmo elements" are more just like a waiting lobby kinda. When you go to Caldeum in Diablo 4, instead of only people in your lobby, it would be populated with a bunch of other real life players, and you'd use it as a hub to group up w/ and interact with other players. I've also heard they are trying to make it an over-the-shoulder aRPG.
---
So.. basically it would be BFA but with good class design (seems to be the idea).
---
It ultimately will not make a difference. You'll be fine as NE.
---
Hey man, what addon did you use to move your char frames? Im looking for something similar to moveanything.
---
lol, yep.  I can't wait until I get feign death, because when I see people trying to tag every single mob for themselves, I'll run out, grab some more mobs, bring em over, and just dump em' on the dude lol.
---
Be me. Fear there already attacked mobs into other mobs. As they hyper aggro them, dying to them. That makes me tear up laughing.
---
Me too. I played a hunter in vanilla so leveling warrior now is a completely different, err, experience. So. Much. Corpserunning.
---
But being wanted in groups is a really nice fuzzy feeling.
---
Right on the money, keep hamstring and rend up and just re-apply when needed. Bandages are a warriors best friend (because no one else will heal my sorry ass) 
---
Don't work harder, work smarter
---
Class has good design, it is the best scaling class with gear, but suffers from low mobility and is totally dependent on gear.
---
Can't answer subjective stuff, just point out the factors.
---
I get the feeling these guys have gone through the content enough times that this is more fun for them
---
I meant the human-looking Worgen, not the wolf-looking ones.
---
Not when the moment something attacks her she goes "AHH A CULTIST" and panic runs in a random circle lmfao
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/faction=69/darnassus#quests:200+10+12
---
That has a tab listing all darnasus quests. The main zones are teldrassil darkshore ashenvale and feralas. There should be more around in a couple othet zones and generic alliance quests should give a fair amount of rep too
---
This, So much!! When you appeal to the masses, and hand things to people. No one needs social interaction, why do i need a 5 man group when i can just blast through everything AOE style in lower dungeons. Why do I need to ask anyone where this is because I have quest helpers on. Why should i buff anyone, they have their own. Vanity makes it so it doesn't even matter what gear I'm wearing. The retail version is such a watered down MMO experience. I REALLY hope they take note of all of this.
---
I am also a hunter and won it in a roll haha
---
Wow I didn’t realize that because I switched weapons my weapon skill would be lower which results in more misses. This explains a lot
---
does it make the game easier? I don't want to spoil it for myself
---
* In a fresh server economy, greens and blues are tougher to get, and they are very important for gear dependant classes like warriors. Especially true for classes who have to build sets for two roles like Healers.
---
* Everyone can use the money from the greens for those expensive skills and eventually your mount.
---
* No need to fight over tons of mobs with people. Nothing worse than wanting to complete quests and having a low pop mob, with a non 100% droprate, being camped by several people. It it's a real timesink sometimes to be out in the world in certain zones/areas.
---
* Dungeons are the bread and butter of gearing up at 60, and people might need the time to develop the skill sets to run them effectively. Dungeon experience and role experience pays off immensely when you might find yourself in an ungeared or inexperienced group and you might need to help guide and carry them through.
---
* Dungeons are fun even without quests. Sometimes trying to help someone sync up with your level and quest status is a bit of a pain. Just yesterday, farming just 15 Tough Condor meat for everyone's quest took as long as one dungeon run. Then one of us was underleveled and was going to miss out on the next series of quests, so we decided to do Deadmines instead to get them caught up, so we could optimize the time later, and we didn't leave them hanging to try to pug those quests.
---
* People are excited to get their asses handed to them in dungeons. It's probably people's fondest memories.
---
Just some of the reasons people like Dungeons instead of straight questing.
---
If you select people in Classic based on their Raider.IO and Myhtic+ performance you're not worth raiding with anyways.
---
&gt;Soy
---
Oh aren't you just a peach
---
The problem is it’s not a parallel. Housing is protected heavily while contracts are actually made to be broken. One can come with criminal penalties while the other cannot. Breaking a contract isn’t shady its standard practice.
---
I'm trying to install the data I need for Vulkan right now xD But i get the error The requested URL returned error:404.. So many problems xD
---
Question: what’s your download speed on your home internet? I ask because heavily populated areas (lots of players on screen at once) can eat up your bandwidth. Or at least, that’s what I’ve heard.
---
I'm ecstatic to have 2 gold. I feel rich.
---
I don’t think you are used to slow and grindy because that’s what would delude you into thinking it’s a monotonous game. Obviously the early levels where you have 2 abilities are boring. You also may have picked a boring class to level like Paladin, or a class that just doesn’t suit you. The game is tailored much differently and much more specifically, you need to know a lot about each class’ leveling and endgame playstyle and ability pools before you make snap judgments. Bet you’re level 10 at most.
---
It's gatekeeping to an extreme level, never seen it done THIS badly before.  Minecraft, Fortnite, World of Warcraft Classic like shit man, let people enjoy what they want to enjoy and stop trying to make them feel bad for it.
---
Layers, plus worlds massive
---
Just right click unlock then move
---
Was the only one in the group that could use it :) i asked if it was ok!
---
Lol do you know how many MMOs try to copy this exact formula?
---
when i was a rogue back in vanilla, I pvp'd and pve'd as a rogue without respecing. 
---
granted, i did pve poorly in retrospec.
---
You'll be surprised at how much xp instances give now. I was running WC from 18-22 and it only took 4 runs. Was a pleasant surprise.
---
bot's sure, they are lame I agree. Remote control apps though, perfectly legal
---
probably locked because of "server" or some similar algorithm blocking such things to make it harder for scammers to take names that can trick people into believing that you are part of the company
---
i doubt it's unavailable because someone else made the same....though maybe i am full of shit and it would work
---
Retail has that.
---
Imagine that you go to the opening of a new grocery store. You see a big, delicious plate of chocolate. You pick it up, walk to the register and pay for it. You can't wait to go outside so you can enjoy this great product you paid for. However, you have to wait 8 fucking hours in line in order to get out and eat your chocolate. Would you call that a successful opening from your perspective? The fuck you wouldn't.
---
Stop sucking Blizzard's dick for just two seconds and you'll see that this was a fucking terrible launch.
---
&gt;Marathoned for 6-7 hours
---
This is nonsense, speaking from a lvl 30s perspective with my guild, group of old friends, several new people I've already met in game, and some cool drops on my main. 
---
I'm obviously not rerolling now lol.
---
I too work 10+ hours a day and I'm running on about 7 hours of sleep in the last two days. Feels rough man
---
I disconnected like five times whilst in queue yesterday while installing my new router. I hopped from my home network to my phone’s 4G without any problems, changing IP in the process.
---
What’s suspicious about logging in from another location that’s quite close to you? Nothing. They don’t suspend people for that. In the last 24 hours I’ve changed IP three times.
---
I been wanting to tank since I started, but fo. Some reason it took me super long to get 1 green shield and I sold my 1 hander out of frustration to learn a skill XD that said even without a shield using abilities to reduce enemy output is usually enougth to tank anyways
---
AOE mage farming can get you leveled very quickly if you know how to do it properly. I watched him a little last night and he was mowing down groups of mobs without much issue.

This but unironically.

21 with roughly 3g and a bunch of trade goods and greens I should probably vendor

Have you played EQ1 recently, like in the last 5 years? There's a lot of obsolete content.
---
Do you know what's the best pets for PvP?
---
I’m trying to help him out
---
exactly, it's not like everyone had 24hrs of game time on launch, moving then would be no inconvenience compared to waiting 3-5hrs for your friends or yourself to log in.
---
Me this morning, but it was more like an hour. So worth it though, finally hit 20 last night. Eh. This morning. 😴
---
I needed on the Lavish ring in deadmines (I believe 6 intellect and 2 agility) over a priest and mage and my justification is as follows:
---
- The 60 mana is very useful for actually casting shit.
---
- the intellect is very useful for helping my arcane shot crit damage 
---
- I actually have use for the agility on the ring unlike the casters.
---
Just right click, unlock and move
---
You're welcome! Happy Hunting. :)
---
You’re funny, i like you
---
This is why we wanted classic back. You need to work for your character to progress....be that grinding or questing. You have to work to get coin to pay for spell upgrades, your reputation is built in how you interact with others. 
---
It’s not insta max level and everything a handed to you on a plate. 
---
Maybe classic isn’t for you. 👍
---
Wait so does that mean that damage / damage per second also doesn’t matter for druid damage? Or is that consudefed stats as well (next to str / agi / stamina and so on)
---
Pick one of the realms in your region and preferred style with the smaller queues. Don't contribute to the problem by sitting in the Faerlina queue for 9 hours so you can go toil in the mines for Asmongold. 
---
The fearmongering over population drop-off is mostly nonsense. These servers are so fucking overloaded even if literally 90% quit next week on the "medium" realms , there's going to be healthy populations on all of them.
---
Yeah that's my plan man, if it dies loads we will transfer off :)
---
Smolderweb here. It’s the first realm I chose and I’ve never had to wait for queue but the pop is always med-high
---
They said there would be queues on certain full realms before launch and told people to move to lower pop ones if they didn't want queues.  Well now almost every server has a queue time and new ones fill up in hours.  Blizzard never said MASSIVE QUEUE TIMES FOR ALL SERVERS.  100% Blizzards fault if you subbed early expecting to play on any server.
---
Perks of a priest ... you get to mind control people.
---
Bruh, Undercity is where it's at 👌
---
"Croikey guv'nor, the server's fucked. Let's light the barbie, crack open a Fosters and wait for those drongos to fix it!"
---
Sounds like you got a lot of retailers with ya.
---
Recap:
---
You suggested that RETAIL was good for casual players.
---
I suggested MYTHIC+ in RETAIL is NOT good for casual players.
---
I struggle to make enough damage to kill them before they kill me. Also most of the times these abilities are on cooldown because sometimes I even struggle to kill one mob. It has to be my gear.
---
Everyone has a different play style. Some like to go balls to the wall others like to roll play, others like the story, etc.
---
Thanks for this, but there could be people higher than 50 atm?
---
He said he *didn't* want the sub filled to the brim with cringe memes, definitely don't think he's actually looking for something like either of those.

We used Thottbot in Vanilla .......

---
That just shows your an idiot
---
I don’t understand this comment. Sometimes you do need cooldowns to get through s lack of mobs. You get out of mana much faster, and some mobs are scarier than others. Let’s be honest many PvE encounters in retail aren’t that hard either. Why do dungeons take longer in classic? It takes more time because a larger pull could wipe you. If that’s not “difficulty” then failing to face a boss a certain way in retail isn’t difficulty either. I feel like your definition of difficult is very stringent. When playing Mass Effect on Insanity difficulty the mobs hit harder and have more hp. Do they necessarily have super complex mechanics compared to normal difficulty? No but you best believe the game gets harder. Is it more difficult in the Arkham games when you don’t have the hint telling you when to counter? I would say yes. Anyway, I gave no idea why you’re adamant in arguing this. What’s wrong with people liking a different version of the game? I played since 2005 and I like being able to play classic again. It’s not like you need a separate subscription so to each their own?
---
Growl can be learned at the Pet Skill trainer every 10 levels.  They also can teach a handful of passive skills like resistances, increased armor, and increased health.
---
I'm pretty sure he realizes he was wrong...it's not like thoughts and opinions are concrete. The dude even announced the release of Classic at Blizzcon, I'm sure he see's he was wrong.
---
When your line of a good player is "know how to press buttons" it really shows that WoW is anything but a hard game, both retail and classic. Unforgiving, yes. Slow, yes. Requires dedication, yes. Hard, no. There are thousands of games that are way more unforgiving, while also requiring precise and fast inputs with split-second decisions.
---
Chrome Remote Desktop 👍

"Genuine Leather" is actually nearly the worst grade of leather you can get. The only worse grade is bonded leather, which is basically chopped up leather scraps glued back together with other shit mixed in. 
---
Need some Full Grain leather pouches.
---
ty for the feedback :)
---
But rested XP, I recommend going to the cellar of a less known inn.
---
That's amazing for you guys, I'm glad. 
---
Hopefully blizz notice they've not fixed this yet over here, if you patch 20% of a hole in a bucket the water is still going to drain and the bucket be shit.
---
I remember arriving to Thunder Bluff for the first time, coming from Bloodhoof village. 
---
The sense of wonder, the majesty of the place.
---
Fuck, guys, you're making me want to renew my subscription for the first time in almost ten years...
---
I think i will!
---
Shame nearly half the people I've encountered from gravediggers are toxic racist assholes.
---
This right here, productivity should be sky rocketing for everyone stuck in queue!
---
Yep where I grew up they still don’t have cable only dial up or satellite internet (which was too expensive for my parents)
---
bow before the power of kritonos.. and the horde!
---
I was skeptical as well. And while I probably will not stay for the long run (heck I may not even level to 60) - I am truly enjoying every aspect, except for mob tagging. My one and only issue.
---

I got called back into to work on Tuesday after just sitting down and starting my que into Grobbulus.  My wife, who dislikes the fact that I spend my nights playing WoW, logged into my Druid and ran around UC for me every 10ish mins for 2 hours so I wouldn't lose my spot. I love that woman.
---
BfA baby
---
You don't need a green shield, a half way competent healer will do you fine. Just work out your rotation of how to generate threat, mark targets for your group if needed, and taunt the ones smacking your healer or something.
---
If everyone knows what to do, your gear doesn't matter until end-game
---
But i can still heal well if i go shadow, right?
---
Im a dwarf priest on the same server. I ran to westfall eagerly to partake in the battle and heal my fellow alliance brothers. When I came to thw field it was empty. I was dissapointed. 
---
Though I would be more dissapointed if I had to wait 20 hours in queue to play on the only rp-pvp server, i guess
---
You're stuck with dogshit class balance/design and BFA "talents", LFG, mount at 20, fast mount at 40, flying at 60.. BFA scaling, heirlooms, cross realm sharding bullshit, warmode charity boost, etc.
---
Cant stop people abusing recount to be elitist af. Sadly thats always been a part of our raid communities.
---
Nice tipp ty :)
---
Sure while you can get just as much value out of cloth item, WE DON'T HAVE A CHOISE, that might be the only item in a long while that we can use, you people who have choises shouldn't be taking our chances to get upgrades, in case no cloth user in party NEEDS a cloth piese, then sure you can have a chance of having it...
---
But if ANY cloth user in party even remotely needs it, they should have the privlige to it, same as leather users should have privlige to leather gear, or do you want me rolling need on your leather upgrades, because to me the vendor silvers  are as valuable as to you an upgrade?
---
No I do not agree rotating players is the play here.
---
i might really will :)
---
this is why there is so many private vanilla servers. this is such a good game.... it's not nostalgia at all.
---
this is a good game.
---
Incorrect. You cant use Shadowmeld during combat.
---
All I care is about in this video is the health of the fat guy. I don't care if they do their best to be logged in - they have a show going on.
---
Quick tip btw, if there is an inn at the town your at there is normally a fire you can use to cook instead of buying flint and wood #budgetstrats
---
The server will be fine, I played on Emerald Dream for 8 years and it still has a healthy RP community despite also attracting that kind of people
---
that is my go-to reason too why wow sucked lately
---
there is no middle ground for playing, it'S either nolife 24hours a day and compete for worldfirsts, or lean back and log in now and then to collect freebies and catchups
---
Everything in between had become pointless
---
Yup its a good Hunter ring. But I had a rogue win it, because he said the agi was an upgrade..
---
Wc is cancer
---
Legal, sure. But also scummy. Like I said, if you're leaving for hours, be courteous to others.
---
I feel this as a rogue
---
I’ve never claimed WoW is this ultra-difficult experience. Just the the 1-60 PvE element is more difficult.
---
Give them time. It's literally the third day and if people are coming from Retail they may not really know that reality. They might unwittingly think paladins and bear druids can still tank as well as they can in Retail. So if these people play DPS warriors on Retail, it might be their comfort zone to stay DPS warrior in Classic.
---
I agree with the sentiment. They should start learning to tank now so that when they get to 60 they're better prepared to be the highest-in-demand tank class in Classic. Druids and Paladins cannot tank in raids (from what I've heard and remember), so they'll be stonewalled at end game unless they play with friends who let them play the spec they want.
---
Yeah i got rekt by him aswell haha
---
Night elf hunter with a cat basically have stealth just no moving
---
This.  First Aid and HP pots have been amazing.
---
Hey man - I think #nochanges people can shut up when Classic is over and it comes to "What comes next"
---
The normal server would stay Classic as it is #nochanges
---
With seasonal realms Blizzard could go ham with changes.
---
I love the idea. 
---
Having Classic in many different flavours. More Specs viable. More PVP battlegrounds/arena's
---
Seasonal item raids or smth like that...
---
Awesome. 
---
I do think that it would need to be additional to all other things which really hurts the feasability. But since it would only be some "patches" to the normal Classic pretty much I think it would definitely be feasible.
---
Am I worried? Yes, but at this point it had to be done. Blizzard dropped the ball^* on the number of initial servers announced. Bringing up more servers doesn't help all those groups of friends who selected a server beforehand but found only some could get in. And it's likely that new servers they bring online are the ones that will be empty in 3-4 months.
---
\* Dropped it and then kicked it out of their own endzone for a safety.
---
And honestly if I'm a tanking warrior, I do not want a dps warrior in my group.
---
Play on a different server untill the rush starts dropping. When Herod is free of queues, play with guildies! Dosen't matter if you're behind, they'll help and some will be making alts too!
---
Not everything is about leveling as fast as you can
---
From what I've gathered, they increased server capacities by around 3k. So the 15k queue went to 12k. Not enough to make a difference for people who are queueing when getting home from work.
---
that news makes me really happy i think i will give it a try :)
---
If it was Chinese censorship, they'd have removed skeletons entirely.   
---
They didn't.
---
The contrast between the new water and the old graphics just dont feel right to me. Classic setting ftw
---
&gt; privlige
---
Check your privilege.
---
^^^BEEP ^^^BOOP ^^^I'm ^^^a ^^^bot. ^^^PM ^^^me ^^^to ^^^contact ^^^my ^^^author.
---
There's nothing wrong with getting into the queue ahead of time.
---
It is wrong to leave yourself logged in for hours by scripting around the AFK rules.
---
There are 5 more content phases to come.. I think we're good for a while.
---
Honestly, blizz should just start disconnecting the whole server every hour. Those how are active can get back in, and those who are AFK and camping the login screen get booted.
---
It would mean banning tens of thousands of people...
---
Good for you man, wish more people did this.
---
First of all, take a look at the [Intel graphics page of the ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Intel_graphics).
---
Make sure your graphics drivers are installed properly. Broadwell CPUs should be compatible with [Vulkan](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Vulkan) (so make sure you've installed the `vulkan-intel` package as well).
---
When your drivers are in order, add [DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk) to your wineprefix and you should be fine.
---
That would be fine except yesterday it was in skull rock and we kept having like 4 cultists dumped on us in situations where running away just aggros more cultists. Those guys got us killed alot lmao
---
Right click turn instead of aaaaaaa it's much faster
---
Idk about that. I did it in about 35 mins yesterday with a group all level 18 or 19. CC is key on each pull imo.
---
Haha wait..I’m leveling a warrior now. Can someone explain
---
Well yesterday I did see my mouse become book on trainer
---
Thanks for the answer, I really didn't know how layering works.
---
If your pet is set to Defensive, it doesnt attack until you or it are hit. Aggressive it runs all over Kalimdo trying to find shit to fight. 
---
Set to defensive and macro your auto-shot with pet attack for best results.
---
Did someone say...
---
Lol, your mileage may vary! As Horde, I just got to the Barrens. Last night from about 7-9 pm questing was just a miserable experience. Either spawns were totally farmed out, or the dynamic spawn rate got going a little bit too quickly because of the massacre and you start catching 3-4 mobs at a time!
---
Worse problems to have though.
---
How does Shaman fair in PvP? I saw that unbreakable video, but am hearing other people say they aren't that good.
---
Thats ironic because imo its harder to be good at CSGO than WoW. Obviously they're different but I just find it funny that you picked that exact game.
---
Method? Account sharing? No, this cannot be.
---
That's actually sad. Poor animal.
---
I mean, if you aren't telling people that Alt-F4 is how to summon their pet in general chat then I don't know what you're doing with your time.
---

Not as bad as OP but at ratchet to go to Org it took me to X Roads, then back to Ratchet, then finally to Org. #NoChanges confirmed.....
---
Jokerdtv has no cam and is not talking sometimes. So he could easily have other people playing on his account while he rests, right? There is no way to know he is doing this himself?
---
 It doesn’t really matter, because if a realm dies off character transfer will be an option. Just play now, worry later. (:
---
I am and I rolled for a cloth belt that had agi and will. 0 shame.
---
Honestly Ive been running with a DPS warrior as our “tank”. Helps get dungeons done faster and haven’t really noticed any issue with it so far
---
Yep that’s one really unique thing I like. I leveled wands on 2 chats today. Goes really fast.
---
But if you rely on dmg like rogue or warrior and you get a new weapon, you mich 30 times :p
---
I have asked some streamers to show me top levels on their servers. Almost half of the players on the list do not stream, but that doesn't mean my list is complete. If you have any info, please share it, preferably with a source.
---
Do you know of any? Jokerd ground out first 60 on the last private server, I think he's been working on his route for a long time. Dude's crazy.
---
It is supposed to be not blue I think.
---
It just used to be this way :/
---
Other commentors addon definitely helps.
---
10 hour work days, running on 3 hours of sleep
---
Care to elaborate?
---
I've had to re-teach myself this. 3-4 mobs in a little camp area = death for my warrior or mage. I'll get 1, maybe 2, but then I'll have a spirit walk.
---
/r/agedlikemilk
---
your going to be so sore in those chairs.
---
Exactly, it’s way harder to get into groups as a dps warrior since the tank will take any other dps over you
---
Ouch, I remember downloading the Star Wars Galaxies beta in early 2003 on dialup and it literally took me 10 days just to download the game.
---
With level 50 being like 56% of the way to 60 when do we think we’ll get our first 60? Saturday evening/ early Sunday? 
---
Also anyone have any clue what these peoples /played is?
---
You should get some sleep :P
---
This is all I have been thinking about since launch - Hallow's End is coming!
---
Right? Kind of like saying classic literature isn't worth reading because we're only nostalgic for it.
---
we are all pink on the inside.
---
Yeah seriously, I'm having a great time playing on deviate delight while everyone is making memes about waiting 7 hours to get on Herod. Like just choose another server it's not hard
---
Also a prot warrior that picked up herb and alchemy, what benefit do we get?
---
It's a lot easier with Piercing Howl since you can reapply the slow from range and it can't be blocked/dodged/parried. Basically it's only useful if the enemy has a much faster attack speed than you (another reason slower weps are better). Also PH is 50% and there's a chance you didnt pay to skill up hamstring (which starts at only 40%)
---
I've gotten it to work but it can be a little finnicky. When it works though, you're trading blow for blow a 2h axe dmg vs like a dagger dmg, once every 3s. so you take almost no damage and they're getting cranked by the Crescent Staff.
---
Not even close to 4 hour waits. Only around 500k were playing Vanilla when it first launched. This launch has well over a million.
---
Keyboard turners die in the fire
---
Neat, thanks for the new word.
---
classicwow.live/leveling
---
Classicwow.live has a great guide.
---
Keto.
---
They were hiding the numbers while I was playing.
---
They had the number of players online on OSRS on their frontpage, as did RS3's. So it would regularly read something like 
---
OSRS: 40k players online
---
RS3: 70k players online
---
The only issue was, they we're counting both OSRS and RS3's players in RS3's count. So they really only had 30k people online.
---
It was not hosted by nixxiom. He was stuck in que when the whole thing started. Fodor, a Rouge from the Gravediggers got ganked and we formed a raid to get revenge. Nixxiom got to the 2nd battle. The first battle was right out of Goldshire.
---
It's back on
---
Yeah, he straight pulled a bait and switch. I donated $5 to support him, then paid $5 for the guide, and now it’s a $37 one time fee. Tbh it’s worth it, but it’s kinda shitty that he did that and didn’t say anything. He should still honor every persons month.
---
Eh, while we don't have numbers its likely each server holds like 3-6 times as many players than vanilla servers could have. So we only have 1/3rd of the servers that the OG game launched with but the amount they hold makes up for it.
---
Which Addons are you using?
---
"What are you going to do, daze me?" -man who was dazed
---
Sure as hell ain't passing on a 21.2 dps weapon with 12 spirit I suggest you let that one marinate
---
You probably keep destroying the liver when trying to remove them.
---
Solo lowbie hunter grinding rotation: Mark + Pet attack macro; Serpent Sting; Autoshot while I watch Dr. House on Netflix; loot.
---
Rinse and repeat.
---
Now we’re getting close to my vanilla experience. It took all night to set up due to dial up. Luckily soon after we got DSL out where I lived.
---
When runescape released their old school servers, the main game was definitely in decline. But it divided the community hard and definitely wrecked a large part of the community they had, because everyone left to play the game they actually wanted to play.
---
I'd say retail has a similar fear. But I could care less honestly. I've had more fun in Classic than I've had in years.
---
&gt; and figured stuff out
---
Or not, depending on if we're talking about that level 60 melee hunter that turned up in your DM group. 
---
The internet community is definitely better organized, but I think the overall percentage of people that only want to play the #1 best class hasn't really changed that much. Wherever there was a patch you'd have a fair number of people re-rolling to whatever class was seen as OP back then as well.
---
Lmaoo 🤬💯
---
How long does it last? Haven't hit one yet.
---
well you can expect to take fucking forever to hit level cap but that is all I can really say
---
isn't this guy getting seriously out-leveled right now by randoms?
---
Yeah, no shit. I didn't say it was.
---
Mostly casual player here.  I've dumped a fuck-ton of hours (more than 20 maybe 30) so far and I'm at level 19.  This is while trying to push levels asap.  Can't imagine actual casual players who might barely be at 10.  I think we are still a few days before the casual pack reaches 20.
---
did you see chat?
---
Calling his guild the &lt;Special Olympus&gt;  fucking LoL
---
yah people laugh at us.. until they have to kill threshers for their eyes in Auberdine.
---
Or they start to pvp and want some dispel cover for their "better buffs".
---
Username checks out.
---
And they are perfectly fine they add replayable content.  None of it is required to do
---
Don’t even need a target macro just spam click the area that it spawns in and either an instant cast ability or an auto attack, it’s not hard? Group up with someone, could even get 5 people together and increase your chances. Could skip the quest and move on bc it isn’t that important, if you are a completionist come back to it in a few days when it’s less populated in the area and do it then.
---
I think that Apex Legends will act as a pretty good analogue for WoW Classic.
---
When that launched, it was revolutionizing the Battle Royale genre and the video game marketing paradigm at the same time! Millions on twitch! Crazy DAU's!
---
And while it is still a successful game that is doing just fine, it is *nowhere near* the cultural phenomenon that it was at launch. At launch, *everyone* was talking about it, *everyone* was playing it.
---
Then a bunch of people stopped doing that and moved onto the next hot thing.

How many ranks of each spell do you need? I'm worried I won't be able to manage my entire bar lol.

Wow, you're an absolute clown for doing that lmao
---
10 times out of 10 I wont ever join a group like that. Maybe it's a little petty but also they need me more :D

You can fish up a bag?

I thought I was just losing my mind on that last point. I swear it only procs when the mob is almost dead.

You've got my upvote. First thing I said on stream coming out of northshire Abby into elwynn, was "Man I missed this weather for 8 years." It was raining, it was loud, and it made me feel visibly happy.

So fun doing it 10 times in a row in barrens
---
How do you feel about leaving myself AFK while I go eat, walk dog, eat dinner etc. It’s a half hour and if I’m getting close I run to comp and move a little bit etc. Last night I did that for an hour in the evening after being logged in since noon. Avoided a 2 hour peak queue. Is this reportable or just common sense?
---
So what you're saying is that if you've got a Druid healer needing on healing cloth, the cloth users shouldn't give them shit for it? I totally agree with that.
---
Yeah, they're totally going to give you money because you don't wanna play on a realm with a smaller pop. Fuckbois
---
GZ on selling your Hunting Bow
---
Bartender is a really dope name, nice
---
I’m having a great time. Playing horde for the first time so it’s a near fresh experience for me. With all my knowledge of how to level and when to switch zones and being a Warcraft geography major, leveling is going swimmingly
---
in the form of a 25$ mount.
---
Yeah I understand that bis items for certain classes aren't always the exact armor type for said class. It should be taken into consideration that when you have a cloth wearer in your group and 4 other classes that will need on a cloth piece that drops just because it has their stats that it could make in difficult for him to even get HIS bis pieces too. But whatever. Way she goes boys.
---
There's always two zones for each level band.  You usually gotta do two to get big enough for the next band.
---
Sounds like it would make a cool expansion
---
how do they sleep? or account sharing?
---
just curious
---
Agility is great for warriors too. Nothing wrong with that.
---
Eh we saw it coming a while ago though lol.
---
2019 OSRS is a fantastic model for how Classic should be handled. The polling system, which Blizzard would never implement, is a great way to suggest additions to the game while gauging the playerbase’s attitudes towards the change. They’ve added to the game without fundamentally altering it which is key to sustaining an old school experience.
---
You sound like you could use some maturing, guy
---
These wow classic deniers are really stupid.
---
IKR, I wish I could somehow fit spirit tap into dungeons somehow when I'm healing
---
It's the little things that make it great. Wish more people understood that.
---
Honestly ANY resist hurts like hell. There is this one Murloc type in Westfall that casts ward which makes immune to spells...thats even worse.
---
They gotta get that early launch gold just as much as us I guess.
---
I haven’t played since vanilla. My younger brother got into it much later and always asked me to get on I would start a character lose interest and quit. He always complained about retail feeling like he had to get on and do chores. 
---
When I heard about classic we got excited. He could see the version of the game that I loved and we could play together. It has been a blast. I have 0 intention of ever playing retail. There are a lot of 30-40 year olds I know that play with similar stories.
---
Relatable
---
I've been so exhausted.  I sat in Darkshore and fished to 75 last night and glanced over it was 2am. Loving every second of my time spent on this game though!
---
if you are serious, you should always upgrade the main skills you use and it is normal for 2 on level mobs to be hard.
---
This is common yes, at level mobs are very dangerous and 2 are probably going to kill you if they resist anything.
---
That's what you get for not putting bindings on reserve.
---
Hide headgear then friend. Thats in the interface menu if you don't like the mask. (Same with cloaks too).
---
Layers and shards don't bother me. I like being abme to complete my quests in a reasonable amount of time. My dissatisfaction with modern WoW is the dead community (thanks group finder) and the lack of meaningful character progression.
---
wooh  
---
ah  
---
ohh
---
You get to be the super alpha monster main tank, who's secret hobby if flower collecting. Is this not enough for you?
---
Welcome back :)
---
Blizzard has confirmed that even the lower pop servers are currently way more full than the biggest Vanilla servers ever were.
---
There is retail and BFA
---
as an orc i havent seen a druid yet
---
I used to solo WC on a mid-20s Hunter for cash, I'm 100% confident I could 3man at 18-20 with a healer and a mage.
---
To stand a fight toe to toe? Yeah, pretty big ask to 3-4man dungeons. But if you're willing to kite a bit, a bunch of them are doable. (Don't try to 3man School or Strath on-level or something ridiculous like that)
---
I though jumping in at around 14.00 won't be a problem, but I've been sitting in a que for 4 hours now and there's still 5300 people in front of me.
---
Maybe they'll choose passion over greed this time around...
---
Most of my group is 15-20
---
That's a terrible analogy.
---
What would make sense more is that it's incredibly difficult to find parking in NYC, so people who fine a spot do everything they can to keep it because if they leave it they have to find another spot which could take hours 
---
If you could get another spot in 5 minutes, no one would care to leave a spot
---
Dreadmist EU for the win
---
Yeah, I acknowledge that server capacity is also a large part of the problem, but as you said, they don't want loads of dead servers in a couple months when the "casuals" realise how hard classic was and go back to retail - and to that end, I'm happy to sit in the queues. Like I said, the excessive queue timers are shit, but I'd be happy with it if there weren't so many people botting to prevent the queue from going down.
---
Blizzards response has been slow, I think, and not as transparent as it could have been (although much better than the past!) and I'm pretty pleased with it so far. I play on Mograine EU, so not even one of the most populated servers and I had queues almost at 9 hours! A moment of silence for those on the most populated streamer servers....
---
People with huge monitors need to do that cause otherwise their eyes have to travel too far to see stuff.  One of the reasons I like having a smaller monitor.
---
Enemy Cast bars only picked up the start of the cast, but couldnt read any info beyond that. Canceling was not detectable like you mentioned but casting another spell was of course.
---
As far as i remember the addons had a database of spellnames and cast time in their specced state, for example -0.5sec on frostbolt.
---
If any mob or player cast something the bar showed up. When they suddenly casted something else the spell was cancelled,so the bar either vanished or turned gray indicating it was (most likely) cancelled. Interruptin via Counterspell was detectable.
---
My addon back then created bars for anything excluding party/raid members.
---
Additional mob pulled without noticing and it casts something? I saw that as a bar.
---
Sneaky mage starting a pyro while hiding behind a tree? I saw that. Of course I couldnt see who was the target, but why else a pyro castbar would show up?
---
Man, that's just rude. I get that the spanish servers are all full, i got even a couple of french people like me. But it's proper etiquette to not have a conversation on the general chat in a language most people won't understand !
---

I think youre making this out to be a bigger deal than it is. If youre a moonkin druid you will have to convince people to let you run something suboptimal. If youre a resto or tank druid theres space for you(especially with restos combat rez), hence you mentioning they might "run out of slots" for druids(i.e. they wanted/took some with them). Druid is also the least desirable class in the game to party with overall, so given they still have 2 specs people like and will team with you can extrapolate that to mean "whatever class you choose, you can find groups if your spec is done well"
---
Being the warrior thats more in demand can also be a pain in the dick later. Because you are raiding with 40 people and if fucking 15 of you are warrior good luck progressing on loot.
---
My biggest gripe with all these "weekend warriors" is i think about 50% just had no idea what they were getting into and will give up long before level cap. 
---
This is true for a chunk of the playerbase rn but i think its most true for those who rushed a warrior based on people online saying its "the best" and not because they themselves chose to play it.
---
Razorgore currently has a 2200 queue for anyone that cares to know.

Just got to the point on my baby lock where I can start fear juggling multiple mobs (dot dot fear repeat) I forgot how much fun that was.

Aah an IGN guy, he sure is filled with wisdom of the earth godess.

Classic wont fail, but you're mentally damaged if you think it retains this weeks population throughout mid 2020.

When the moving AH price is higher than the vendor price.

Make sure you do a PvP server so you get **the full WoW experience**.

Upvote for character name.

Then you should have said that.

Elemental shaman gets real good past 40 and priest is decent once you get a wand. Once I got like 10s I ran to ironforge to buy one (req lvl 5). It’s way way better than melee.
---
&gt; LFD came out during the Trial of Champions patch
---
Didn't dungeon finder drop with 3.3?
---
With exactly how many players? The hardcore wow player community is not what blizzard is aiming for as a company.
---
Not of the mechanism is enterily mechanical. Since the ToS prohibits unauthorized software to control the game.
---
They are working on it. They've taken steps in the US and it's been getting better. Hang in there.
---
Every fortnite streamer right now.
---
Man that’s a bit of an extreme reaction...
---
A lot of people would like that but there would be an absolute outroar from their fanbase
---
I spent about 30 mins doing this outside brill on launch day. Didn’t mention the word free but people came through with the tips anyways
---
When they get to level 30 slowly teach them da wae.
---
Keybind left right strafe instead of turning.
---
Keybind 1,2,3,4,5, r, t, v, f, g, q , e on action bar for them.
---
Just go away, it will make the game a better place
---
7/10 too much water.
---
nah, I use teamviewer to queue up from work around lunch time. By the time I get home, I have 20 minutes left in the queue.
---
So you did get booted? I was watching the guy thats already lvl 50 and he plays mograine eu, and he was still playing.
---
I think you're wrong, but sadly there is no way that I know of how to figure out which of us is right :(
---
YTA people avoiding AFK are just causing more queue
---
Mind blown
---
The layers are not 5x the size. They're like 2x at best
---
&gt; cant even down level 22 mobs as a level 21.
---
Welcome to Classic.
---
haha happens all the time
---
What's the spoon for?
---
Yeah, low level dungeons are actually intimidating now without all the heirloom BS
---
this.
---
I think this kind of account sharing is acceptable.
---
I mean, who would ban such a cute kitty? :)
---
No, they don't
---
Most of them still serve a purpose.
---
No, flight paths are on a per-character basis.
---
I mained warrior in Vanilla and my only thoughts on leveling were that it was so much easier than all the grinding I had done in Star Wars Galaxies lol.
---
I didn't see any bitching about leveling warriors back then tbh. The narrative that it's the pinnacle of MMO tedium seems like a pserver / classic invention. I find so hard to believe that people who started in vanilla are the ones overstating it.
---
People keep thinking I think that when I have never said that lol. But I am also sick of people pretending like classic raids are brain dead easy as if 99% of people who play classic are all going to be full tier 3..... like fuck lol. And then pretending new raids are impossible.... when what about same amount of people who do hardest mythics probably actually did full naxx back in the day? 
---
Then people just ignore the fact there is so many new "learn this raid shit" plus 15 years of experience. Of course the mechanics are going to be harder but shitting on classic and it's raids makes no sense and there so many people who do that on this sub and I am sick of it.
---
Welcome to classic
---
Do you get free gold if you dance for the innkeeper? Also a no :p
---
I really appreciated the dailies in TBC as they made rep grinds much more bearable (aswell as a way to make some gold). But I never truly did endgame in vanilla as I only hit 60 two weeks before TBC hit :D
---
Join a high pop server they lag so much some times you don't even need to downgrade to dial up.
---
Yeah, I knew about the layering, I just didn't think it'd have such a huge effect that I'd be playing alone basically.. It's been a kind of disappointment to not have any social interactions for the first 15 levels
---
Then why would  they ban people for using clickers? Who cares if a few people did it am I right?
---
Fuck, you are dumb. Just tell everyone to move to another server.
---
&gt; with a fukn spoon?
---
Yes I got booted.  And level 50?  Wtf is wrong with people, lol.
---
His totally works. This man is a genius. Nobel prize.
---
Dungeon finder killed the community aspect of the game. Seriously, it was almost like a switch for me when it was added, my interest in the game dropped dramatically. I stuck around for a few months to do ICC and then I stopped playing completely. The game just doesn't need it, not having it encourages people to talk to each other and build bonds that keep them invested.
---
Nope. Character specific.
---
/w u need?
---
It works because the designers knew what they wanted to create.
---
Weird product placement flex but ok
---
2-3 years perhaps?
---
Fuck these people
---
Bloodsail has been everything I hoped it would be. The people are phenomenal and damn near zero queues!
---
Warriors are not for the weak. Leave us
---
Because everyone who isn’t working and can play doesn’t have job...
---
Nothing is true or false with a billion dollar company unless they specifically say so. But remember that Blizz didn't think we wanted Classic and wouldn't have payed out for the max spec infrastructure. Hence the couple at the start. A billion dollar company that is more money focused than ever.
---
nope
---
I turn on my PC with Wake Up LAN 1 hour before end my work and queue via remote access.  
---
Its because people like you that we have 10k+ queues.
---
Great so we should all do that then right?
---
Oh honey
---
How about you just remote in from your work pc instead of two separate clients?
---
Thank you!
---
A 20 stack lasted me hours, it’s so useful. I open a trade window and pop a health stone in there for any mage I see hoping for some water in return lol
---
I've seen this happen before. At least there is a release plan unlike Old School RuneScape but even with a plan, once that plan reaches the end of the line it will take a while and only the most dedicated will remain. It might take months or even several expansions of retail before classic reaches the point of death.  
---
To avoid death the game will have to add new content that works with the feeling classic E.G. content that was cut but planned for classic to begin with. Purists like me will complain but for the longevity of an MMO it is inevitable, classic is sadly not a special case.  
---
It's still ridiculous that morons like that think classic is going to die within a week. It broke records on Twitch so that should tell you something about it's popularity and success. I'm saying it might live for at least 5 years, 10 if we're lucky. Anything more than that would be insanely lucky and I really wish it does live longer than 10 years.   
---
Either way, this success has been the biggest kick to the balls to game developing companies, proving once again that they are supposed to develop for the customer and not for the company.
---
I went to loch until lvl 12 then went to Westfall.
---
People *are* putting in the time. They've also been putting in the time on private servers for years.
---
&gt; Bad players in BFA still do LFR which are raids with the same amount of mechanics as any raid in classic.
---
You can clear this with half your raid dead. Yes there are mechanics, but in LFR they are more of a suggestion.
---
I don't think that word means what you think it means.
---
A person that is new and asking questions about the game is a *newb*.
---
A *tourist* is a bunch of short attention span people who show up in droves initially, but then leave within a month.
---
The queues are worth the wait, especially once populations start to die down from release hype
---
I hope that your day gets better and you maybe find a crumpled up euro in your coat pocket
---
MOM! More hot pockets!
---
WoW has this it's just completely dead or filled with M+ spam. It would help for low lvl stuff so you don't have to stop lvling while looking for a group in ironforge
---
They just sit there and do nothing.
---
Sure, maybe it's fun to look at for five minutes, but then you want something different.
---
Dunno about NA, but all EU servers were full yesterday, except the RP one. Should be better now that they increased cap, and if people stop being afraid of queues they will also stop flocking to low pop servers so those will stay low forever.
---
THANK YOU
---
/say invite?
---
For 5 hours solid, all I did was skin. On release night I was the only one of my friends online. So I skinned pretty much all of the first night(bar the starting area quest's) I also have LW, meaning any scraps I get I convert to Light Leather. I was extreme in doing this but I wanted to wait for my friends + play at the same time
---
Same here, but that was the cause before WoW too, I really don't function well if I have to wake up before 6 am...
---
+1 Bloodsail!
---
Better question is why cant you skin Centaurs?
---
Other reply contradicts your beliefs my friend, and they seem more certain! I agree with your sentiment though.
---
Sorry, I made this in response to getting these very same shoulder pads in game and couldn't contain my rampage of excitement.
---
Warcraft 3 had goblins in literal iron man suits and you complain about motorcycles?
---
Sorry I'm an A Grade arsehole, I feel for you if this is oceanic
---
Damn that's great to hear, although I will warn you - wait til late game professions! The chorin' is so real lol.
---
"oh but in the past MMO's lauch were always like that, stop crying about it."
---
In the past we also used dial up connections and my mouse donsen't had 21 buttons on it. 
---
Technology evolves, the way things are done should evolve aswell. Its not a free service, and its unbareble that people are PAYING to wait 8 hours in a line in order to play something because Blizz wants to save some money on infraescructure on the belief that playerbase will drop very soon.
---
There is no defense to that. It's just lazyness.
---
Play on a different realm man
---
Nice to hear they rushed to get you guys back up. Took like four hours for us. No surprise, we're forgotten. :)
---
All EU PVP servers are Full in the afternoon/evening, it doesn't matter which one you use, the only difference is 2 hour queues vs 10 hour queues.
---
I started in early BC so the leveling so far has felt basically the same as that. The real difference will be the end game.
---
If you think so, this is an unpopular opinion after all. And comming from the oldschool runescape community I have to say that major updates like add the grand exchange (which also hurt the interaction between players) helped the game aquire new players who never played the game before.
---
Are you using your seals correctly? Seal of command is beyond amazing until around level 40ish.
---
This sounds like a massive waste of time considering the adds he creates.
---
Because hundreds of thousands of people tried to use his guide (the most detailed and well set up guide btw) at launch and he’s had to fully re do his server situation.
---
Renew, bubble, wand.
---
READY?
---
I never played in Classic. I started in WoD. Classic is so much more fun for me because of the community aspect. I've grouped up with people so many times, everyone talks to each other and helps each other out. It's so much more fulfilling than retail imo.
---
Doubt
---
sorry for the late answer: i found it! https://youtu.be/TFFwa9FF8s8
---
Yeah currently I have that, unfortunately what I was after was a single macro that covers every form depending on which form I was in.
---
&gt; I don't understand why people care about layering.
---
It destroys the integrity of the world and causes all kinds of annoying things to happen.
---
For example, someone says in guild chat "THERE'S A MASSIVE INVASION AT CROSSROADS!!!"
---
You run to Crossroads and see a ghost town because you're not on the same layer. You ask them to invite you but your guildmate is in a raid and the leader isn't responding because he's too involved in the battle that you're missing out on.
---
When these things happen repeatedly, it destroys your sense of a single, cohesive game world, which was one of the main things people liked about Vanilla WoW.
---
Using this now. I like it better then Questie. Really like the auto accept and auto turnin options. I've been told that Questie has that as well but it wasn't working for me. Maybe I just had an outdated version of Questie and needed to find a new version, but Codex does the job so I'll stick with it.
---

---
Considering Classic wow gold sellsers are going at a rate of 1G = 12euro then I certainly hope not hah
---
The majority of people that purchase the guide will likely not make it to 60 and quit long before then. By charging $37 he can profit instantly instead of having to wait over 7 months for the monthly fee to accumulate to that much money. He would probably make $5-10 off of a person before they quit if he kept the old method.
---
Edit: text
---
Sorry to bust your bubble but server transfer and name change is coming with or before phase 2s release. They only held off implementing this at the start so people could settle before they allow people to move about. But paid services is how blizzard makes it’s money so you bet they going to add it as soon as possible.
---
Thanks. Another question what would be a role in raids? Priests are usually the go to healers, from what I've read feral isn't has good as rogues, and balance is usually replaced by mage/warlocks. Should I just play whatever I want and become a backup of what's needed?
---
If it moves, it's getting thorns and mark.
---
yes.
---
there are free guides elsewhere.
---
Yesterday I was walking to the gryphon master in stormwind after having just bought 2 linen bags. I had found a 6 slotter while questing, so I had 1 slot open, that I was going to fill with the old blanchy quest 4 slotter. As I was walking there someone randomly opened a trade with me. He gave me a linen bag for no reason. I thanked him and he said no problem and we went about. Got 2 extra slots!
---
Yep. I’m taking it nice and slow. If a friend wants to do something or the gf wants to hang out, I’m logging and doing that first. The game is very fun, but life comes first.
---
I always seem to pull aggro from my voidwalker when doing shit, am I just out DPSing the threat?
---
You contradicted yourself. "It's not my weakness, but it's all people see when they look at me." You're letting it define you as a person based on other people's perception of you. Disability vs Disorder is just linguistics.
---
tbh i do the same when i shower, i put a deoderant on my W key so i keep running so i dont get dcéd in the 10 minutes and i have to requeue for 4 more hours
---
*Salutes in Frost Resistance Totem &amp; Grounding Totem*
---
Lmao I actually did get the recipe! I'm gonna get my 40 mount easy
---
Blammo
---
Nope.. it's a whole lotta running and exploring. Set a day aside to just see how many flight points you can get, then you'll have them all when you need them.
---
Going around killing everything in 1 hit is soooo rewarding though... and the fact you get all your abilities starting off. Last time I leveled in vanilla it tolk 25 minutes to level to 15 running from starting zone to barrens just casting A moonfirr on everything and than started instances grinding
---
He did say that.
---
I think it's called "Weapons of Choice"
---
Warrior DPS is excellent though, if they have greens, if they have blues it's absurd.
---
Macros are your friend. I'm not sure if there's a macro such as targeting the nearest enemy but there's a few targeting macros for sure (like mouseover one) and then macros to /attack your target. Combine both in one and voilà you can target and attack with the same keybind, how magical.
---
Yea, what the fuck are people doing. [There's like 3 spots left on Hydraxian Waterlords that hasn't been filled](https://i.imgur.com/cfvPgsX.png)
---
What....
---
What casting bar addon is that?  Does it also have a bar for target casting?  Would love if they ported Quartz to classic.
---
Maybe its because I'm old, have a job, wife, and kids, and played vanilla when it was vanilla....
---
but what's the f-ing hurry.  
---
I am loving the slow pace.  I love grouping with randoms just to tag mobs.  20 minutes of 5 people to kill ravagers, I'm in.  Helping someone solo a mob that has them on the ropes, you bet.
---
Classic is about the journey not the destination.
---
Retail would never tolerate 4 hours in wailing caverns and the thrill of completing it.
---
I never played alliance and I am so looking forward to the long fight through dead mines.   
---
You can't add up the amount of fun these guys have missed just to say they were first.
---
Russians got the best one: Chromie. Since Chromie reversed time and got us WoW classic, get it get it get it?
---
I also got outvoted, it was like 60-1 Horde/Alliance.
---
So now I'm a female Troll.
---
Yes, it's more challenging - now go back to retail if you can't handle it.
---
Agreed.  I am so tired of seeing people do this.  Log off.  Go to sleep.  Go to work like a normal person.  If you have massive queues go to a different server.  My generation is full of these entitled pricks who only think of themselves.
---
&gt;  only if you already had a full group
---
The entire point of the lfg tool was to help players find a group.  Admittedly, they could have implemented it better.  but it would have been pointless if it required you to already have a group.
---
Thanks for counter protesting
---
I'm pretty new to wow, i started playing in retail a few months ago, i was expecting this cool immersive rpg world full of warriors and wizards, instead i log in to chika brughghg broooooooooooooom!!! every 5 mins, thank god for classic.
---
Sounds like youre in the 50%(im assuming that number for sure) that picked warrior for good reasons.
---
Whirlwind axe is bae. Gonna be interesting grouping up to kill that cyclone boss dude
---
Because it should have been different. This was a botched launch. They should have had more servers, given the community the option between more than just fucking two as opposed to begging people to switch to the less populated ones. I am still playing the game I’m not choosing not too sitting in queue is part of the game for me. But! My friends are choosing not too as a result of this queue and that’s bad.
---
Thats the way to do it. If you can you can also queue at lunch and use Teamviewer or Chrome Remote Desktop to keep and eye on the queue
---
Yea I don't mean anytime soon. Maybe a year or two. I'd be totally fine with no flying mounts, but something would have to change for certain areas that require it. Maybe give the player a flying mount that can only be summoned in that zone.
---
Putting the "no va" in spanish which translares to no go 😏
---
If all else fails, just get [MSBT](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24962-MikScrollingBattleTextClassicquickfix.html), that's what I use and I see healing numbers, not sure what shows (or doesn't) without that mod.
---
Bonus tip : Type "/msbt" in-game to open interface to set the add-on up and change the horrendous default font.
---
Knock knock, open up the door, it's real
---
So they ban normal people for this but since its Method they get a pass?
---
Yeah I did. Which is why I’d never play classic. It’s not remotely the same. Shit I see on this sub is pathetic.
---
Enjoy the queue. And the addons we had back then were ... not the same as the crazy ones we have now. Fuck outta here.
---
Guys are chasing nostalgia because you weren’t there. It will never be the same.
---
Active players are at an all-time low though. Those are the numbers that matter more.
---
I'm a shaman, kisses are all I can give until I'm swimming in fish oil and scales.
---
As someone that’s now a level 15 warrior, bless all you people talking about buffing. I’d kill myself by now if alchemy, cooking and first aid didn’t make leveling easier.
---
This is sarcasm, right
---
I hopped into Smolderweb the other night. No queue. I had been playing on Bigglesworth, 8k queue. It didn't feel right. It felt like I was in twitch chat with a bunch of 12 year olds. I know, I know, barrens chat. But there was constant "I am going to fuck your mother", "TRUMP 20202" and "MAGA BOIS ROLL OUT". But the difference in the attitude of those two servers was enough to make me go back and wait in queue. 
---
Smolderweb felt like the waiting room no one was taking serious. Feels like it is going to get abandoned when queues go down.
---
Money! Save/earn as much money as possible even if it means giving virtual blowjobs to some random orc in Durotar!
---
P.S you think im joking but i aint.
---
My latest pet peeve is people getting aggro of your mob and then running miles away
---
So many salty people who don’t want to switch servers or adapt.
---
Do none of you know how to use your phone to remote view your desktop and log in before you get home?
---
Yes. In my situation it's a merger of a few groups of friends so everyone has different opinions. All it takes is a few stubborn people and we all stuck on Herod. Easiest solution is to stay. I'm sure it's like that for a lot of people.
---
They're pretty undesirable at high levels though. Despite what people say, a tanking druid is a miserable experience to heal in 60 5-mans without overgearing it.
---
what do you mean by dec server?
---
\*high five*
---
\*click*
---
one advantage is these are speed leveling guides. so the person has taken the time to discover which quest are best to do for the most exp/hour.
---
i'm doing all the quest and letting Questie give me the spots where to complete them.
---
Yeahhhh... Worgen are nasty. Also tons of casters.
---
Yo you understand my point entirely I am with you man. For the horde!
---
Pagle has their own census, I'm not sure how he does it but it's broken down here: https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/pagle-census-info-update-for-horde-initial-scan-08-29-19-8am/272603
---
Exactly, people say like "well my guild" but if your guild chose like stelagg or herod maybe you need a new guild
---
Don't forget thorns too :)
---
I thought the choppers were cool just unfair.
---
It’s a combination of both.
---
For sure, just running around Tirisfal again was incredible, and this from a guy who until now just remembered how freaking far away Agamand Mills felt back in the day.
---
agreed, it takes time for a community to develop a consensus on rules, and even then sometimes there's a split which goes in a different direction (bioshock infinite hrh mod for example).  
---
i also agree that the community should be largely made up of speedrunners who have speedrun the game for an extended period of time (ala the goldeneye elite).  
---
here's a well known goldeneye speedrunner's opinion on WoW speedrunning: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_bw0jDNP4g
---
Yo thas dummy cute
---
Best way to do it. Do other things at the same time and pick em off as you go.
---
FOK! zeg
---
Fuck waiting for you to get it on ya own, mrglgrlgrglgrl gon' deliver it ta ya

Yeah but you'll right off the bat a lot of fish that require like 30/50 cooking, it's not very efficient :(

Warcraft has always been a kind of thematic mess. You have the Forsaken, Night Elves, Humans, Orcs, all with vastly different themes, styles of architecture, color pallettes, etc. It seems pretty intentional on their part to have all of these different ideas clashing.
---
Im also a retail fan, i have not logged into classic untill today because of tightschedule combined with hours of queue. And i hate queueing in general so i've been doing the same stuff in retail, m+, mountruns, mogruns etc. And today when i woke up i heard about the 10k realmboost on highpop servers. So i gave it a go and got in with no queue. Made my warlock undead and jumped in. And have this in mind that i love fastpaced gameplay and i was sceptic about classic. But after 2 hours of doing quest and exploring and interact with other people i was still in the starting area (deathknoll) and i was enjoying the shit out of it. I'm a person who likes to read the quests entitely and letters/books that i loot. But it's been a great ride so far so this weekend will be only classic.
---
Are Hunters a class that are still wanted in raids/dungeons end game? 
---
Yeah, even in the intro areas whenever I have a shaman in the group I feel better , that’s why I considered running them. Seems like a good middle ground of DPS/Tank/Healing. 
---
Facts. Seems like there are many pros and some cons to a Warrior.
---
So many non-gamers think they know "gamers"
---
Good luck man hopefully you get some quality game time in soon.
---
If you play warrior he can heal you while leveling and doing dungeons, thats a huge help for a warrior.
---
just give us 1 free month, that's fine with me
---
Most of the time they might not have the mana to buff you, it literally can take a third of your mana bar to cast it once at lower levels.
---
As a pally I'm buffing everyone I meet. Maybe 10% of people buff me back. Can't wait to get salvation and take my buffs from them
---
I love the keyboard turn, pause, and misspelled "tanhks"
---
Lok'tar ogar!
---
This is not a feature in Classic WoW.
---
This was introduced in TBC.
---
You need a UI add-on to get green numbers on allies like pfUI or x-perl or any other.
---
EDIT: An actual change I'd like, but hey.
---
I never played classic and when I started playing the game already had the dungeonfinder. So I cant miss anything about it I guess. But all those comments made me look at the topic in a new way and kinda made me looking forward to playing later today.
---
Nah I brush it off pretty easily lol
---
Yeah, we paid for the privilege of helping them estimate demand.
---
Our group reserved on Herod and then moved to one of the newer servers because of their warnings. We're still stuck with 6+ hour queues every night.
---
Im pretty normal tbh.
---
I did check MSBT last night but I remember reading about it not being able track heals on other players cause there isnt anything to go off of. I’ll try it
---
Generally it'll be strength of earth, mana spring, windfury/grace of air, and some variety of fire totem.
---
Yeah, that’s true. We just won’t be playing 100% of the time together, probably less than half. That’s why I was thinking of a better Soloing class.
---
Deviate delight is a NA east server, I've played every day in the evening since launch and I've never had to wait.
---
That's all cool and all, but you can't find a low pop PvP realm in the EU (i.e. the "default" realm option for WoW chosen by most)
---
Warcraft 3 also had gyrocopters
---
Same.  The former is just fine.  The latter is despicable.
---
Ooooof, time to start streaming WoW Classic as a career.
---
Yeah. I hunterstrike. Serpent(to give the dot more time) concussion, then spam arcane) I also keep my pet on passive and manually "release" him either right before or right after the first step in the process.
---
Shut drops yards before they hit me.
---
Yeah, i feel it im not mad. Just wondering. I just did the RFC quest and need to get to TB for the turn in. I played classic but i only made it to 40 something before TBC came out back in thr day so i forgot alot.   Time to travel to TB after work.
---
Ask general chat (/1) and they'll tell you.
---
BBBBBIIIIINNGGGGOOOo
---
Which addon you using?
---
2 to 3 hours form now well be back at ridiculous que times
---
I think all this drama surrounding WoW classic really has its roots on how we view ''Nostalgia'' in general, and its rise in the past decade. One of the camps view that every yearning for past experiences is a sort of sentimentality and that these experience held no objective value over their current alternatives; that same camp consequently sees that games (and maybe other entertainment venues as well) are only getting better and better with time. The other camp really believes that many aspects of older venues of entertainment were genuinely better than their modern counterparts, and while the modern alternatives definitely got better in some areas due to technological advances, the overall quality of these modern alternatives can be objectively lower than their older counterparts due to the pure lack of soul and passion, and the overwhelming greed for money and neutering of passion in favor of satisfying the widest slice of population possible.
---
My coffee consumption at work has exploded
---
Staffs are really good for hunter Melee dps and those are second and third priority stats tho. I would have given to healer as well but still sucks to pass on gear that’s really good for you.
---
Just when I thought I was out... They pull me back in.
---
Classic is the only option anymore.
---
oh!  just looked it up.
---
are they just wanting to announce that you'd like the final hit so they get the buff?
---
I’ll prob run BRD only once to stay sane.
---
&gt;Imp is better than void walker FYI ;)
---
Why shouldn't you give a fuck about the WoW community?  Things like this just make the queue problems worse.
---
You shouldn't be training every spell upgrade.
---
Pick whatever lets you play, to be honest.
---
I played for almost 2 years during TBC on a low pop realm, never had trouble finding people for content and the sense of community was even stronger than average, because we were few, only a handful of relevant guilds so everyone knew each other.
---
Dude I fucking ***hated*** dailies.  I did them a few times in TBC and they were fun, but they were so fucking boring.  I never wanted a chore.  Then I'd complain to my buddies in vent about gold and one was always like "go do your dailies" like my manager or father.  When they just became worse and worse is a big reason for why I quit in Cata (I really loved the lore in Wrath).
---
While I do agree that others might be trying to queue, I mostly just applaud you. I’ve been thinking for months about getting some sort of di-sized weight to put on my w key. This is the kind of spontaneous problem-solving we need more of in the world!
---
Classic is going mobile!

I think it was all servers last night  was in thunderbluff and it took like 30 seconds to sell trash loot.
---
I see what you did there.
---
Since this is an heirloom, I'd say it's more geared towards people who don't want to spend ages running through zones again on their second or third character.
---
I mean, I'm already getting a bit annoyed by all the running I'm doing at the moment. Having to do it all again with an alt is something I'm not looking forward to.
---
When did you get this pic of me yesterday OP
---
Matter more? You said it did not set sales records, you were wrong. You don't just get to move the goal posts because reality does't fit your narrative.
---
Here. Let me change it for you.
---
You subscribe to a magazine for $5 a month. One day, they take away their subscription model and charge everybody a flat $37, but they also go to everybody's houses and take all their magazines back until they get their $37.
---
Is that on the nose enough for you, you autistic robot?
---
so far the ques are tick for tick on the popular servers.
---
idk why youre telling me, I have no issues with it.... reddit is full of fucking idiots i swear
---
Oh my sweet summer child ;)
---
What server are you talking about. The 4 big servers on NA are only not busy during the early early morning times.
---
Yeah I’d agree with you, for the average player it’s not ideal. You really need to have a focused group of people who know the dungeons and mechanics and are willing and able to consistently run them. If done properly I could see this being an effective method but otherwise for the average joe you’re best off running a dungeon for the quests, and maybe a time or two more for some gear.
---
Devs have said server sizes are way larger than Vanilla already, and they just upped the server capacity. Apparently low/medium now is the same as high in vanilla.
---
didnt see many major bugs
---
guess you dont play oce
---
our servers were fucked for like 6 hours
---
Dedication to the cause.

Omg nab

If I were to do this. My experince would be ruined completly.

Literally 30 with my life together

 a big project at work ending this week
---
was going to buy a new truck this week
---
was going to take care of other responsibilities
---
None of that has happened this week.
---
I’m definitely going to try to help any warriors I see going for it.
---
Yeah that’s for sure.  I’ll make my mind up by tonight - I’ll have like 250 minutes of que time to contemplate it haha
---
No they changed it. Population is based on how close the server is to queue. If it says full. There's a queue.
---
Did you ever install classic on your 19 mob? I’m curious on the FPS and performance
---
Why because I don’t blindly agree with people when they don’t know what they are talking about?
---
I started in Durotar and didn't loot a single piece of meat used for starting cooking except a few fishes (and many fishes requiring lvl 30/50 cooking)
---
I played since launch and never unsubbed until Cataclysm. Breaking point - Western Plaguelands cured. Idk why, but WPL and EPL were always my favorite zones, but cataclysm changed it all... Since then I would sub and unsub constantly, whereas i skipped whole Pandaland and most of Wod. In BFA max character I have is lvl 111. I just can't bring myself to play the game. By the time Legion hit, I seriously didn't care about my rogue who I had leveled from day 1. Now he is a ghost by the Uther's Tomb.
---
Sulfuras? Med-high pop, definitely some balance (although it’s hard to tell at this point), pvp, awesome name, awesome people :)
---
Did they? It’s only been a few days. Wait for populations to stabilize
---
Well hunters are really fun and unique, so there you go
---
warrior or paladin? looking good
---
Soon™
---
Hunter in vanilla should be interesting. Beast Mastery is crazy good.
---
Feign death. A pet with growl. Disengage. Feign death.
---
Can you install other packages? Are you trying with `pacman -S vulkan-intel`?
---
$15 is a bargain for a month of vanilla,  play solo, be nice to others, you will find groups to do dungeons and quests, and you might be like me, I solo'd to about 50 in vanilla, helped a priest do a quest, then she invited me to an instance, then she got me a guild invite,  we raided mc, bwl, aq, zg, ony, then raided in tbc. We've been to each others weddings/etc, kept in touch and are making a guild now. 
---
You may intend to do solo, but if you're not a  jerk you never know
---
not being able to click tracked quests to bring the quest up in the log...
---
Being able to actually play it the first 24 hours is better than most MMO launches in my experience
---
Wait really? Can you source this?
---
I don't think that Blzzard screwed up on this one. I think they are managing it very well actually.
---
Yes there are really big queues but a part of that reason is that a lot of people rolled on pretty much the same servers. I know a lot went for Shazzrah and 3 more other realms that went instantly Full.
---
Layerying does help and is extremely logical. I mean think about the following scenario:
---
Day 1 - Nethergarde realm ( Medium pop )
---
There have to be at least 100 players in Northshire at that time trying to play. What do you do ? Open temporary servers and then merge them when population stabilizes or layer multiple "realms" into one ?
---
Layering in this case helped with the logic of sustaining as much as possible a enormeous amount of people in the same zones basically.
---
This is my oppinion and i hope everyone reading understands my point.
---
Can not relate. All I'm experiencing are queues..
---
Can confirm
---
Ive found that I am bad at it
---
Facts. I don’t want to boost a character and immediately start playing as a savior of the alliance the faction leads all know. It’s cheap.
---
Absolutely
---
&gt; Mythic on the other hand, ok that was a biiiig challenge
---
Mythic raids and high-end Mythic keys are harder than pretty much all old content. But there is nothing to prepare you for it, It's baby mode leveling until max, easiest ass world content until some gear. Small difficulty increases with Mythic+ and then bam, massive difficulty spike.
---
Tab target selects Onyxia 3 zones over, group wipes. Ah, the classic experience.
---
They are even quoted as saying "You think you want this, but you don't."
---
The launch in 2004 was similar, although I think they had a few more servers available.
---
The first week or so will be rough and will separate the weak(casuals) from the strong(hardcore).
---
I doubt they're playing to experience the 60 life 5 days after launch. The race is a different game in itself played amongst veterans and speed runners.
---
MoP wasnt good. It had a 6 month gametime required but somehow practically free legendary that literally everyone could get. Which meant anyone who didnt or couldnt spend the 6 months didnt get invited to any groups for anything. That shit made me quit. MoP wasnt nearly as good as even cataclysm, especially in the questing zones imo
---
My man
---
Depends on your long term goals. If you don't plan to stay for long go for the lowest pop servers possible
---
When I turned my alarm on its said I would be getting 3 hours and 6 mins of sleep :(
---
You got this brother!!
---
Then live with the consequences of your own actions and don't bitch about other people.
---
If you go shadow, you can't do heal spells in Holy. Keep that in mind.
---
I would be interested in seeing this as well
---
When leveling a hunter it's usually best not to care much about gear and get anything with more stats that aren't strength. Just so happens to mean a lot of cloth ends up being good.
---
As for the bow, hunters get a bow upgrade at ~25 in wetlands at least alliance side.
---
servers have over 10k capacity.  worst case they merge servers, second worst case they group them like they do in retail. best case they offer free transfers from other high capacity servers to yours.
---
you literally have nothing to worry about.
---
I think they were just playing it safe. From what I’ve read it seemed like they wanted to have too little servers sat launch rather than too many. 
---
Too many servers would spread the player base too thin and you’d have a lot of dead servers
---
2 g in the early 20s is about average. Look up farming areas you can farm the mount gold pretty quick.
---
Queues match what a remember from TBC and WotLK. Just always have something to do ahead of when you want to play and jump in queue.
---
I agree somewhat, but honestly, we all paid for it and should be equally able to play it. So, a Blizzard problem. (I log off an deal with 9 hr queue every day)
---
I believe you can download Soundcloud as an app yes. If you do, I happened to upload the audio track yesterday ago: [https://soundcloud.com/icyvolk/wow-classic-radio-ep1-heading-back-home-to-sweet-azeroth](https://soundcloud.com/icyvolk/wow-classic-radio-ep1-heading-back-home-to-sweet-azeroth)

Not true

I’ve gotten a max queue of an hour on kurinaxx

The auto crit to sitting people does not count toward Reckoning in vanilla 1.12 or classic 1.12. This is a private server thing the same as enrage on sit.
---
Nah, at level 60 its 1 STR= 2 AP and 20 Agility = 20 Attack Power, 1% Crit Chance, and 1% Dodge.
---

---
Yep. That's why I do it.
---
I agree with OSRS observation but that is neither here nor there.
---
I'm healing myself and a UI add-on is what will solve your problem for the moment, and even other problems you haven't even considered about, such as numeric values of HP/Mana for party members, or showing target of target for every party member.
---
Most of reddit are idiots wod is better than bfa and arguably better than most of legion if you don't give a shit about lollore
---
I love that these two words have found each other. Classic WoW has already created something i've never heard of and its not even a week in.
---
Haven’t started classic yet but can you buy membership with in game currency? Similar to bonds is OSRS, I don’t mind paying membership for a bit but still paying while my characters get serious cash seems like a waster
---
That’s like waiting in line for a named quest mob
---
Thats awesome man!! Enjoy!
---
I’m guilty of doing what he says. I Remote Desktop in from work and move every like 15 minutes.
---
This is actually why I might have to discontinue playing. WoW used to be a huge form of escape for me, and it seems like that hasn’t changed a bit.
---
You're upset at the wrong people.
---
Sad panda
---
no, he's me
---
I also did this exact thing.  I was upset I could not play my main but was happy just to play.
---
i thought a gnome was a mage not a war yesterday
---
he thanked me for the mp5
---
Switched to kromcrush and was a little hesitant at first then I heard about daily 2 hour queues to enter Herod and Faerlina
---
I wanted to make my first real Classic experience at least somewhat challenging, so I’m currently solo leveling a warrior. No regrets so far, but yeah, dying if you pull more than one mob most of the time sucks ass lmao. Far more squishy than retail warrior!
---
All things considered, he probably is.
---
Lok'tar Ogar!
---
Disagree, that person doesn't make this post.
---
You should have heard my gasp when a bag dropped for me. I probably inhaled a fly.
---
It’s also very public for method to do it on stream
---
Do you have a source on that?
---
My ah addon always has to scan before i can press buy and no selection for bid prices when selling. Is yours the same or is it a better one? Really hate mine
---
What’s that?
---
he just an arrogant idiot who ruined the wow.
---
The hype
---
It's times like these I wish my oldest was maybe...2-3 years older. Free labor doing professions!
---
(Not really, just kidding. Mostly.)
---
As a Florida player, and a south Florida player at that, I fullllly intend on being able to play through the weekend.
---
Cool, not that dedicated just curious
---
Dammit, you can’t say that and not post a linky-link!
---
Wait if it was your turn does it not just put you in? Or are you saying you got in but then timed out again while you were sleeping?
---
It was supposed to be based on warhammer at first, but it ended up being very very very different, both in aesthetic, in theme or in atmosphere
---
Ive chased down mages before that gave me arcane intellect just to give them fort.
---
I appreciate it, mage bros.
---
I'm transitioning between my current job and new one which starts in a few weeks so I've had a ton of time to play. The game could not have come out at a more perfect time.
---
I'm actually just efficient with my game time. Also, are you seriously being serious right now? XD
---
Also realize that saving 5s today isn't really going to help you get your 90g mount.
---
Because it was originally used for storing murlok poop, and still has a slight wiff
---
Kind of a similar thing I noticed - Almost everybody has names with just normal letters! Very few funky characters or accents. Just folks with normally formatted names for the most part.
---
I didn't say it is hard either. It took me like 20 minutes, where 10 of those was googling for pixel reader solutions until I found this one. I just find it strange people are surprised I didn't write the pixel reader API call helper from scratch. Why would I do that if it has been solved thousands of times before? I set out to make a login alarm, not create a helper function to expose windows dlls to C#. :p
---
I don’t have a problem with queues.  I don’t know who you’re responding to.  I have a problem with people skating rules to stay logged in 24/7.
---
Not sure off the top of my head
---
You can duo most quests, but you guys are gonna make lots of friends to play with along the way. You cant duo dungeons though.
---
IS THAT A MOTHERFUCKING DARK REFERENCE?
---
My friends and I just fled Herod for Sulfaras last night. I'm a little concerned. Maybe it was bad timing (8-11pm est) but General chat in the city was full of immature meme spam and people being mean to each other. Just felt very disorganized and overwhelming tbh. For being full, Herod honestly was not like that in the 20 hours or so I was in it so it's a little discouraging to move to a seemingly worse community despite no queue.
---
I don't think he is buying mats.  The recipes cost a fortune.
---
Can you explain this to a lvl 8 paladin that has literally no idea what they're doing? What's a bubble?
---
Show us where the hunter touched you.
---
Because I don't want some random on a subreddit telling me how to play the game??? K
---
I knew what you meant...I just wanted to shitpost my anecdote. :D
---
I still keyboard turn - I can’t break that habit.
---
wait, you're saying I have to become a  prophet before I can play WoW?? Aw man :(
---
Every WoW expansion almost doubles its active subscribers in the first 2-3 months and drops back down after, so it's not just a Classic thing.
---
Classic will probably be as popular (or more) than BfA in NA and EU countries where subscriptions were down to less than a million.
---
Classic (and eventually TBC / WotLK) only take a fraction of the resources required for a completely new expansion. It's for the most part just a QA job with a few engineers thrown in. Their break-even point is probably something ridiculous like 100k active players. Even if Classic dies in a few months, the \~1 million new subscriptions for 2-3 months will make it a financial success.
---
Or just play on a realm that is not full... no queue for me yet.
---
tbh playtime compensations should be happening if they have any humanity left. literally unplayable for any1 with actual responsibilities outside of the game.
---
Cool didn't know
---
Brand new player here, what does it mean to respec?
---
I wish my server had more people like you :(
---
Just last night I clicked frost nova when I shouldn't have (was trying to run away). What ended up happening was I had my guy chasing me plus this other mob some other guy tagged. Rather than picking it back up, dude just let me get killed by both my mob and his :\ was really disheartening, really. I ended up skipping the quest till later after that.
---
Honestly...for solo questing i really dont use a ton of water.
---
If im working on some quest with mobs 3+ levels higher ill use some, but spirit tap+wand is fucking amazing.
---
Look in your wow folder, it's literally broken into folders named \_classic\_ and \_retail\_. People using the vocabulary "classic" and "retail" are literally using Blizzard's own wording.
---
Even if it was open, every other server has a huge queue to get through. If everyone from those queues went to Deviate Delight, it'd be filled just the same
---
Level 11 and I'm already skipping certain skills because I've seen how expensive my level 30 skills are.
---
I grinded for so long trying to get that on my warrior. Hop on my mage... the other half drops on my first run...
---
well classic just reased, hit lv13 and gametimes up... fml
---
I lost my first epic to a server roll back.
---
Isn't venomstrike amazing? The thing procs 1-3 times a fight and feels like it does about as much extra damage for me as spamming multi/arcane shot would in a lot of fights. I don't think I've ever been so hyped about a new weapon in any game in 10 years.
---
Well, the only firewalls blizzard can deal with are those of mages.
---
Big scam anyway. All these people reserving names on servers they can't play on.
---
Also mobile sucks..
---
Classic is my first proper experience with WoW. I would've been screwed if I didn't read the comments on this post. Are there any other quests like this I should know about?
---
Nice euphemism
---
What about buying wow tokens playing current WoW ? Would that still give membership for classic ?
---
yeah and to add on this, this works better the slower ur weapon is since bigger damage each hit u deal and less overall hits being taken
---
After a long queue I was finally able to create my night elf priest, we did it guys, we're back home.
---
I spawn on shadowglen, take the first quest to kill some boars.
---
Here we go, this is what it's all about. I cast my first spell ever, I'm going to smite the hell out of this piggie!
---
... 'Resist'
---
Finally, back home
---
Seriously, I hope you get banned. This is why we are in this situation. You are a terrible person.
---
You don;t buy all the recipes. Only the ones needed to Level. Rookie mistake
---
Yea you're not getting unending breath with that attitude
---
Id kill to get all the bc and wrath content but with proper progression and no dailies/flying.
---
WarStomp is great. Can't dodge or parry while stunned, bitch!
---
His twitch name is JokerdTV, he has like 13k viewers atm - shouldn't be too difficult to find.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/jokerdtv
---
Accurate. Fuck.
---
I remember Penny Arcade rescinding their GOTY award to WoW because of the stability issues.
---
just zperl and bartender
---
pretty much.  CST playing on PST server here.  I feel like making a guild named "Wife's Asleep" 😂
---
This was me exactly.  I sort of vaguely knew it was coming eventually and was kind of "oh, I guess I'll see that at some point" but I've been out of the WoW scene since early Cata and didn't THINK I had nostalgia for it, beyond a kind of "oh, that was really fun and a huge part of my life, once" 
---
Then I saw something about it a few days before release and decided that I wanted to be a part of it right at the start, warts and all.  I've had some of the best days out of this past year in the past week, playing with friends and remembering why this was my main escape for like, seven years of my life.
---
Hey, good luck friend!
---
No. They told me to pay for a subscription in order to play their game. They advertised playing the game and they did not deliver.
---
There is no conditional macro to check for buffs, debuffs, target range, or if a spell is ready.
---
You’re a piece of shit.  Queue up an hour or so before you get off like a normal person.
---
They really ruined Deadmines in live. Not only did they change it completely, they locked Vanessa behind heroic for cataclysm. Now everyone in Westfall will see Vanessa all over the zone then not even get to fight her.
---
haha yea i forget to do that stuff sometimes as well
---
EU Server names &gt; NA.
---
Thanks for the tip. I don't want a wand but I will be sure to pick up some extra money when I do that quest.
---
I tried to use the wst addon to get better timing but there was some kind of conflict so i had to turn it off. 
---
Just character animation for the first attack, then i look at the indicators on skill icons because the basic attacks seem to go through no matter how i cancel their animation, so i just need to pay attention at the spells.

I think putting Fiery Enchant on my Hanzo sword back in 2005 was the most hype I've ever gotten in an MMO.
---
China has their own censored client so this is completely false. In china skeletons are replaced with gravestones.
---
I had a lock give me unending breath yesterday while i was doing the murloc quest in redridge.  While you dont really have to go underwater for that it was still SUPER nice to have while in the water just so i didnt have to worry about if i went under for a bit for whatever reason.
---
This one hurts deep in my soul
---
Mythic raiding now is by far more challenging than vanilla raids. I don’t like the instant gear gratification, I only said I do not like the slow leveling in classic. If I could have retail wow end game content without the slot machine style RNG based loot system and with the vanilla end game loot system and raid levels (one difficulty) I would love it.
---
Aight. You're either the most sterile person who ever existed or yer a troll. Anybody with half a modicum of scope outside their own little box would understand what I'm getting at without being so adamantly stale about it
---
Aaaaamen sistah!! I have been playing with no ques already hit level 18
---
The results may outweigh the cost!
---
I was sooooo hesitant to roll one after reading up on it being the slowest leveler by FAR.
---
Wouldnt it be easier to just ask ingame in the general chat than opening a new thread for it? asking for a friend
---
Its in mulgore...
---
Absolutely. Bloating the game with double the number of levels that max used to be was one of my least favorite things about the additional content. 
---
I like how it was in EQ in the early days, where new expansions added low and mid-level zones to the fray. It gave you alternate routes of leveling so you could experience more of the world in different ways when you played different characters.
---
Yes. I'm a pretty die-hard prot/tank warrior of a mind set and end game, but I will level as arms and quest with a 2-hander. Just also keep your sword and board current for tanking those dungeons.
---
Questie is fine in my opinion. I mean it's either that or skim through quest logs for a direction.
---
I don't think they are underestimating it nearly to the degree everyone is clamoring about. They simply don't know what they are dealing with. How could they? They are constantly adapting though.
---
Jesus. Last two days I've started the queue on my lunch break and still had to wait for four hours when I got home from work. 8 hour queues are killer. But, I checked before work this morning and there was no queue at all so that's a positive sign.
---
#Herodproblems
---
The problem is that servers aren't big enough or abundant enough.
---
it was announced last week :)
---
Still trying to play on a high pop server is your mistake
---
Go get the help you need, kid.
---
Yeh I've done it before when I was much younger on my first laptop (my classic experience was all touch pad) and wasn't the worst thing in the world but puts you at massive disadvantage like.
---
That sounds awesome, I think I'll look into that now! Cheers mate.
---
This would be funny if those were actually servers ..
---
Maybe check out 'Classic Codex' - just been reading about it and might make the switch. 
---
If you ended up googling most of the quests anyway, I would certainly suggest it...
---
I love reading quests and figuring out what to do most the time so I can just disable it by shift clicking the minimap icon and enable when needed. I was just sick of tabbing out / minimising my Netflix session!
---
I was starved for cash before so I powered through quests and now I’m carefully auctioning all the greens I get. 
---
Also doing RFC is nice.
---
Well take this as a learning experience. Dismiss your pet before going AFK.
---
&gt; raiding with clueless people with bad specs and worse gear made it really challenging 
---
As someone who first played in TBC and never made it to raiding... I can assure you I will make it challenging for you.
---
Yup! I was doing "practice" runs on pservers prior to launch and i ping ponged between SoS and STV depending on congestion. I wanted to see if it was actually possible and it 100% was. 35-40 with like 1 gold to my name i grinded my mount by 40 1/2. Boring?? Yup, but worth it because i was leveling pretty quick with constant exp and even faster because i got my mount levels before most people most likely will.
---
This time around, it'll be way easier as even if i'm tempted to buy from AH, i wont because barely anything will be posted!
---
I swear i had to kill 20 fucking birds to get a single tough condor meat in redridge.  Uuuuuuuuuuuugh.
---
Good question. Probably just don't watch Method cause they're a bunch of quacks.
---
how about you guys wait a month or two?
---

That is no way Hotted. He's lost **A LOT** of weight in recent months/years. He's no where near that large.
---
But what to report?
---
He was at full happieness when I left and I was gone for like 20 minutes...
---
I love the jump-jump as a shorthand for "Thank you! Best of luck on your travels, kind stranger!"
---
I've seen like 10 people offer to make bags for mats. So I think the best way to get bags is just to ask.
---
There's also plenty of realms that are still low pop. People say there's no room when there's plenty, just not on the realm they all want. Highly recommend people just go to less popular realms if they really want to play. No queue time is awesome.
---
That will certainly happen at some point, the question, to me, is when. Will it happen in a week? Definitely not. Most people won't hit 60 for at least another couple of weeks unless they are power leveling.  In a month? Probably not because people will finally have access to some end game content which will require lots of grinding to get ready for. In two months? Possibly, but for people who are raiding, they will have to farm A LOT, and for people who are super casual, they are leveling new characters. In 3-4 months? Maybe? The immediate excitement will have died down and some people will peace out. But many many more will continue to be active at least as much as they were on retail, if not more.  And there are a LOT of people who have resubbed exclusively for Classic who lost interest in retail long ago, and those people can be reasonably expected to remain invested for at least the next couple of months.  Then, when things calm down, it's time for a content patch and people will come back. 
---
I really think people will remain active on Classic for longer and on higher numbers than Blizz is expecting.  They were clearly blindsided by the huge amount of interest in Classic, and my guess is that they will continue to be surprised by how much they underestimated this product.
---
Yey
---
Bagnon works with Classic WoW on twitch app now.
---
Personally I wouldn't care if they did it lowkey, but not stream it. that just encourages others to do it as well and results in longer queues for people who are actually there wanting to get in.
---
The new hotness for Ret Paladins is the spelladin build. You stack spell damage and use fast weapons for SoR damage. The BiS weapon is the crowd pummeller from Gnomer because it has an activatable 50% attack speed boost.
---
Yeah man. The upgrade to crescent staff at the same time makes me feel like a god. I hit a raptor strike crit for almost 200 damage earlier. That thing actually makes it worth standing just outside of the mobs dead zone and running in for a quick raptor strike between auto shots I think for a few levels.
---
Trade pops open. Here have a healthstone!
---
Slow sword main, fast sword off for leveling. Double true if human.
---
Yeah, as soon as the bullet fires, take a step back, you can get 3-4 autos before things get to you.
---
A group of us have been playing MMOs together since 2005. For WoW Classic one of their daughters, who was 3 when WoW first came out, joined our Discord to play.
---
Getting old. Getting. Old.
---
Is that a regular mount, what is it?
---
Health regen
---
Holy shit I hadn't seen that. I've got about 1g50 but I was also planning on lvling up tailoring :/
---
Damn, not in NA I assume?
---
I don't know why they don't open extra servers for EU and Oceanic.
---
1-100? Max lvl is 60. What sorcery is this?
---
I’ll give it a shot!
---
Jokerdtv on twitch
---
I would say its an isolated event
---
fuck that best part is im OPM's enough to ne hammered by the time i beat the queue boss
---
From everything I have seen, there are few tanks. I rerolled a tank to get ez groups
---
The tigers on Echo Isles were hard to kill because of their sprint. You could only shoot them once or twice. I died so many times to them lol.
---
im aware but the guy mentioned not wanting fireball
---
I've found that the colour value does seem to fluctuate?
---
I appreciate that you're try to help but it's a hard NO, I hate the sales lifestyle and culture. I want to fix medical equipment for 40 hours then home.
---
for real you think this is the NBNs problem?
---
I'm having serious internet problems because of the NBN, can't believe it's THAT bad though...
---
This is my first big boy job (played baseball for years, and that was slave labor, not a job). Big boy jobs are easy as all hell. Get your shit done and no one seems to care what else you do.
---
LMAO that dude is going to get some serious crap rep on that server.
---
I 100% would have done the same, even if it were the tank or healer and forced us to wait longer.
---
/calls someone a lazy complainer for correctly informing others that Warriors are gear dependent at low levels
---
/proceeds to affirm that in order to melt faces you need to go to the databases and find a good weapon (gear)
---
🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Im so glad that what i wanted to do with my life only required a 2 year associates degree (and one that was honestly pretty easy for me because the field i chose comes pretty naturally for me).  8 extra years of school sounds like hell (plus the debt).
---
You're also missing the fact that they increased server populations yesterday. So each server today is holding more than they originally expected.
---
One of the reasons I quit WOW long ago. And started a refreshing journey two days ago. Classic - What a ride!
---
I mean, there are a fuckton of people including myself that are planning on sticking around, so it's unlikely that the general opinion will shift drastically.
---
As warrior playing mostly solo in westfall, way too real. I insta invite every player I see just so I don’t get gangbanged by the defias every pull
---
Oh my god that entire episode is so amazing. I'm surprised I havent seen more memes with this format.
---
I don't care what people play, I'd sooner see more people picking up legacy servers if that's what they enjoy. I feel modern wow is so far removed from the original game that it's an alien exprience to play.
---
I feel like queues would be a lot better if a lot of people weren't doing this?
---
maybe I'm wrong....
---
im fucking crying
---
When you die at a specific spot on purpose knowing it'll send you to a closer graveyard to rez at.
---
A new generation of MacGrubers, glorious!
---
Will get on this straight away! Thanks for the advice my friend.
---
Someone needs to get help with their anger.
---
i mean account sharing is against the tos...
---
You're misrepresenting the argument but ok
---
My name is Nick too actually. Nick gang rise up!
---
I hate fuck people
---
Dailies were how I earned 5k gold for flying epic mount, but by God I wish I had earned it through other means and not straight up grinding them for weeks...
---
What I do wish was they expanded upon the zone controls in BC, and expanded them to contested zones in Azeroth, where It would be a nice incentive to win, and winning team would have won rewards such as gear, or world bosses, but nothing to be instanced, just guarded by high level elites..
---
is that addon working in classic? I dont see it in the twitch app
---
Is there an addon to see the leeway? Or is it just from experience
---
Only 1.6k for Faerlina right now. But probably more during peak. As the hype dies down, the servers will be a lot better.
---
Yup. With a name like that can't imagine why it is always so easy to get in but I love it
---
Mage has never been bad in the history of wow. It's especially good in 1.12 classic.
---
Method sucks so much.
---
They deserve being pwned by anonymous in Classic.
---
I started mid/late TBC and stopped at the start of cata. 
---
This is the most fun I've ever had playing this game.
---
People in queue probably
---
Yup. Love my little diablo.
---
This I somewhat understand when I beat them over the head with a staff numerous times, or claw them to death with bear claws. There are a surprisingly high number of creatures missing hearts too.
---
I logged out last night out of frustration after dying to bears the same lvl as me in hillsbrad one too many times. Am warrior. QQ
---
I may or may not have ordered caffeine capsules last night in preparation for this extended weekend.
---
Less pissing, but it is a diuretic, so I'll be slamming some water to keep hydrated.
---
This train will have no breaks come Friday.
---
Any Smolderwebs here?
---
That person may not make it long term in Classic, but perhaps they will learn and adapt.
---
Just use a scroll of spirit or armor. They'll remember you and join your LFGs, you clear a bag slot. Win-win.
---
Why would you run any dungeon more than once if you don't get an upgrade?
---
Possibly the actual WoW Classic forums
---
I picked the only RP server cause no queue.
---
We have the same story my friend.
---
I mean he was polite
---
Just wait it out til the retail kids get bored and leave.
---
WoW racism
---
Yeah man I got my Tauren hunter to level 8 yestarday. The Tauren zone is actually pretty empty, don't see many other people. Hopefully that will change in barrens.  
---
Que time was a breeze, asked my wife to log me in at 9:30pm, came home 10:20pm was already at the character screen so not sure how long it took but less then 1 hour. Definitely beats staying in a que for 5 hours and going to sleep without logging in
---
Just wait til you get cleave and maybe a blue dungeon weapon
---
I’m practically chain pulling duos of mobs and burning them down, can do 4 mobs in quick succession without eating.
---
This is so true!
---
You’re correct that it’s not the same but it wouldn’t be feasible to have everybody in the same layer. It’s also worth mentioning that one layer is roughly equivalent to one Vanilla server, so although it isn’t the exact same, it’s pretty damn close.
---
Windows 10 will not let you keep them turned off. It even has a little notification when you turn them off.
---
Yaaaaaay Win10.
---
Did you not see the Trainwreck this sub was before launch?  It's actually been an improvement with all the memes
---
I don't sit in 6 hour queues and you're still a moron.
---
That I want to stay logged in instead of ending my whole night just because I had to go eat dinner and put my daughter to bed.
---
Was this part of the upgrades they go going along to 1.12? My understanding was that by 1.12 they got buffed to a reasonable place.. problem was by that point no one was playing them because they had previously been so damn bad.
---
Yeah I mean, right now we are at around 25k ppl playing and 15k Queue on top. What is one layer supposed to be? 3k? 4k? So if 90% ppl stop before phase 2 then it will work out....
---
never gonna happen :/

Picturing Arnold trying to give *me* Arcane Intellect and Carl praying for my health is fucking weird.

Nice! Thanks for sharing.
---
I think most companies would rather adapt than predict.
---
Somebody posted earlier they were fishing for ages in Org but then realised the fish didn't exist in classic. Not sure which is true though
---
We should let murderers keep killing, its too much effort stopping them all.
---
Fuck off lol I can’t imagine how you act in the game. You’re probably a pleasure
---
I'm lvl 30 and don't wanna play the game again! It took me 4 whole days to get here and now they think i should restart! FOUR DAYS OF MY TIME. WTF BLIZZARD I WANNA PLAY WITH MY FRIENDS!!! I mean c'mon
---
im lvl 15 and i have 4 silver
---
It's literally setup to be *fair* it's the whole point of the queue. You wait in line like everyone else. That is fair. Your perception is that unless you're putting yourself ahead of everyone else you're putting yourself behind?
---
Yeah I'm sure there are some specific jobs like mission critical systems (Nuclear plant....I was going to add airplane here but seeing as those 737s had outsourced engineers working on them I guess it just goes to show how in demand software engineers are lol). But yeah Google doesn't require one. Definitely helps though.
---
its layering, itll be gone by phase 2
---
&gt;It kept eveything great in vanilla
---
Well, not everything. World pvp took a nosedive. I enjoyed TBC a lot even though I didn't play it very heavily until the end but not everything was better.
---
Yesterday I grinded mobs for fun because the priest buff got me so much hp lol.
---
Ashkandi, too.  Rerolled there opening night when Pagle was being a shitshow (crashed layer glitch) and havent had to deal with a queue yet.
---
Theres also loads of people around.
---
Hit the nail on the head lol... it's like I'm 34 and finally got it together after a serious wow addiction and the cycle wants to repeat itself.
---
Reading this gave me Flashbacks to yesterday...so many Resist, those darn mobs lol
---
Try the "Train Pet" skill from your skill book.
---
or earthbind totem when i want to escape as i'm dying.
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
Downloading chrome is also annoying always asking for it to be the standard browser.
---
There is a word on the street that he is playing with his bro.
---
Nice pet you got there. Would be a shame if it pulls every npc around you.
---
We're a special kind of masochist. 
---
Back in the day I was even harsher on myself. No guild, no group play, no auction help until max.
---
Today, you ask, and I'll group. Throw me some heals, and I would be ballzy enough to tank Ragnaros at level 1.
---
We live by the seat of our pants.
---
This...is my BOOM stick!
---
You made an impression on him for sure. I was around 11 or 12 when I first started playing vanilla. An older guild took me under their wing and helped me out a lot even knowing I was young. They would encourage me to keep playing because I started off as a warrior as well, gave me higher level gear so I had a goal to keep working for. Eventually I finally hit level 60 and they all came and celebrated as I was killing my last few mobs. I still remember everyone in that guild to this day.
---
cringe this dick
---
haha what I'm 21 still doing shit for the quillboar in the tauren camp
---
Honestly, I report every player I see using slurs (or goldselling) in general.
---
Unless you save my life in which case enjoy the healthstone
---
Don't recommend a newbie tools which distort the classic feeling.
---
Wands (and guns/bows/throwables for other classes) have their own slot, that only changed in Legion (or WoD?), you can wear both a main hand like a dagger or staff and a wand.
---
There’s an ability in your skills tab that you should have thats called train beast or something like that, it looks like a stick
---
Is there not some sort of normalisation though that means all weapon dmg abilities are calculated on a 3.30 weapon?
---
So even if your weapon is 2.8 or 3.8, the damage on a Heroic Strike for example will be calculated as if the weapon was 3.3
---
I might be wrong but I am sure I have seen this mentioned in vids / online
---
Would run it easily.
---
It's a trying time for friends, lovers and family. Big respect for the ones that understand the hype and give us their support
---
Same here buddy. I get at most a few hours after work and it's just playing catch-up to my 'took a week off' friends. No time for alts
---
I think it's partly for them **wanting** it to fail. I've honestly learned that when someone finally gets something they've been asking for other will dismiss it as something they never wanted or needed because they've grown content with what was previously had.
---
There's a skill on your spell book, under "Beast Mastery" that's called "Beast Training", click that.
---
Nope, the problem is that blizzard announced additional servers too late after all communities have decided where they should go. Nobody wants to abandon their guilds and friends hence this shitty workaround for it.
---
Yes.
---
ever think of the amount of no life private server players there are? kennymarsh absolutely sucks. server first 60 on a bugged aoe farming private server while having no life as a mage is not impressive. there are probably thousands of people who could hit server first 60 over these ppl if they didnt have a career. they are just mad that jokerd is ripped, good looking and better than them at wow while esfand licks cheeto powder off asmongolds keyboard
---
I'd put up with some monetizations. Cosmetics, pets.
---
If they wanted to redo bc and wotlk I'd buy those again too. I'd even pay full game price if they went the classic+ route people have talked about
---
Got it, thanks.
---
16 if you're good and have a decent healer. 17 otherwise.
---
I, ah, swam down the coast to Westfall from Menethil. Alas, I have no friends!
---

---
What about Carbonite?
---
Exactly
---
How was it last night?  I have normally gotten about a 70-90 minute queue on my server and last night I had a &lt;1 minute queue when I logged on around the same time.
---
Seems like whatever Blizz did yesterday might have fixed some of it.
---
pagle is actually pretty fine on the queue as of late. last night, prime time (5:15pm PST), i only sat in queue for like 40 minutes. the day before was about 2 hours, and the first day about 4. i don’t think pagle will have a queue at all after the weekend tbh.
---
Classic itself doesn’t allow you to see debuff durations inherently. You’ll have to download an addon that simulates that specifically. I forget the one I downloaded but i can confirm it works with ElvUI
---
Had this happen yesterday. Guild leader didn't want to move off Herod but literally nobody but him could get on. 90% of us made characters on Benediction and now I am the GM of the guild lol
---
Change retail's icon into a trash can, problem solved
---
Cat is 4 fite
---
Its smart dont hate. Run all the way to uc and tb yourself then.
---
Hey at least now they raised the pop cap! I had no queue yesterday and it said it was full
---
Which is what everyone else's situation is too, so I fail to see how this is anything other than putting your needs ahead of everyone else's, and justifying it by saying Blizzard should have done better.
---
Wrong that brought back 100% of the game and RPG elements that should be in an mmoRPG, and left me out all the bullshit no one wanted.
---
My dad was always against gaming. 
---
Trying to show them my childhood life. They are into it so far :)
---
That was me the first day when the queue popped at 2am. I was really excited but really fucking tired at the same time.
---

---
we don't want micro transactions in classic wow.
---
I just did the mining &amp; blacksmithing slog on Netherwing, I feel your pain.
---
Thats just putting a heavy object on the "W" key
---
in your spellbook go to beast training. you can find the spells there
---
That was a fantastic read, thanks for sharing and I agree you are a great story teller.
---
I tried an RP server last night
---
Player named virginity was asking about Popeyes vs chik fil a
---
I'm gonna try again
---
You can set the video to low quality and it only streams the parts on the screen that change.
---
yeah RNG is RNG, pretty sure I got my scales in 2 minutes
---
I love you.
---
this may explain it then, though IDK how she would have gotten so many levels worth of rest on a new character. unless you get rest for time spent in queue before making a character or something crazy like that
---
When every server was full at launch how would it not be Blizzard's fault? They booted up a ton more servers right after launch when they realized how few they had made. But people had already subbed two weeks prior to get names on servers.
---
There's a new purple one from PVP and new red one from legion karazhan attunemen
---
Hope ya get better dude.
---
The famous Ricardo.
---
Wow, that is so much better than the guys in Dun Morogh or trade chat trying to reclaim the 2005 version of barrens chat word for word.
---
People don't like Blizzard-Activision for many good reasons, and want any venture of theirs to fail. I hate them for running a lot of my favorite franchises to the ground, but I still want Classic to succeed if only to make them take a step back and hopefully realize what a good game looks like
---
Sure! Berserking is a troll racial that reduces your cast time which is great for healing.
---
Holy shit, I downloaded WoW last night for the first time in 5 years.  Might just skip classic and play regular WoW, shit like this you completely forget.
---
Same reason everyone who doesn't like Fortnite wants to see Fortnite fail.
---
You’re an idiot, nephew.
---
Wait I can get paid for giving out food and water? Man I've been doing this mage thing all wrong.
---
I’m doing skinning/mining. Selling all leather and mats I get from skinning to vendor then storing all my ore in bank. I’ll drop skinning at 40 for engineering since it helps warriors a lot and has useful trinkets. In the meantime while leveling in each zone I try and max out my first aid/cooking/fishing before moving on, so far it’s been helping loads . If you’re unsure what professions you want to stick with I’d start looking up benefits of each etc.
---
Said no-one ever.
---
I may or may not have done this 10+years ago when I started....
---
The way I died matters.
---
One way I pull the attention of 5 individual players.
---
The other I simply spark the ire of a single player and his fat wallet.
---
I'm struggling pulling as a Tauren Warrior, I accidentally aggrod two mobs in Mulgore today and immediately regretted it, running away as a humungous cow is iconic though
---
I was just pointing out that having guns in the game isnt really a very solid reason.
---
I literally said 'i agree on mechanical stuff being in the game' to start my comment.
---
Did exactly the same thing, then whispered "don't be a dick"
---
Nothing? Two different games. Retail has multiple expansions of leveling content and not many would would want to spend 10+ days of played time to get to max level. We have seen what happened when they rewamped leveling last year. 
---
Endgame is also totally different. Classic doesn't have much on that end, and I will not be surprised to see complaints in a month or 2 when more people get to 60 and see that there's not much to do. No bg, no challenge in re-doing dungeons when you get your blue gear, and very easy raiding content.
---
 There will also be the level 40+ lows, that's when  leveling really start to take more time and some people lose motivation.
---
I dont do it mind you...I got like 15s
---
:(
---
Hahahaha. I mean I do it just to be nice but a returned Int buff if I don't have it is always nice.
---
How are you gonna go with "required" grind.
---
You still need enough gear to enter raids. Otherwise why gear exists in the first place. Hell its not even rpg anymore.
---
What you are asking is LoL or DOTA, CS:GO where you can play whenever. But that means there is no progression other than level.
---
Now BFA is lvl 120. Do you think 5 years from now people will finish Molten Core at lvl 60? If they kept the difficulty? There are 7 expansions. So you want all of them to be relevant?
---
You either progress that means already acquired gear will become obsolete and you need to upgrade... either is LoL where it doesnt matter enter 1 match and thats it...
---
soo.... why am I in a 10 hour queue still? On one of the realms they gave us to ameliorate queues in the first place?
---
Also note : for more dmg with swords put the slower, higher damage (18-24 etc) in your main hand for much larger sinister strikes.
---

---
Paraphrased
---
Not level 12 atm, and im actively grinding dungeons.
---
I'm so mad at mandatory ot.
---
Can we talk about what age we will be when we finally make it through the queue.
---
Yea I just made a character on a low pop one while I wait for the server I wanted to originally play on to free up.
---
I don’t think this hype is dying anytime soon. I just see more people piling in.
---
Yeah, we may have an attrition rate of 60%+, but will it matter with 5+ million?
---
it only shows from 1 - 100.
---
I am mostly looking for something that is fun to level. I'd like there to be a real risk of dying, but not as difficult as warrior.
---
Which classes do you find most fun to level and why?
---
I dont disagree, i just think letting it happen preemptively could actively ruin a server if theyre not careful
---
Dude, I started in closed Beta testing where level cap was 30.  I still remember that troll rogue that my friend and I fought on the rooftops of Bootybay.  I was a junior....  in college.
---
Thank fuck it's not just my server.
---
Priest here, whenever I run back to town I always toss some out. Why not? I'll get all that mana back while I'm buying my skills and such
---
No you're fine, if he has tailoring he needs it too and if he doesnt then you need it
---
Patterns are to professions as gear is to classes imo
---
Oh sure, i didn't think we were talking about it in that context. I don't really do it to kill steal, just to be efficient and have a little challenge.   
---
Been playing like that since true classic WoW launched, i like playing classes that can juggle multiple mobs at the same time, or run in a camp and AOE the whole thing down. I nearly shit the bed with DKs when the released by the fact that they pull something like 8 dudes at the same time, pop defensives, AOE them down, and come out with full health if done right.
---
Do not get discouraged. This is very normal. Even as a Druid, I have died. Try just pulling one mob and focusing him down. Conserve your mana and cc for when needed. Also, try inviting someone in the area for especially hard quest. This adversity you are facing now will only make you a better player down the line

I've been playing on Blackwater Raiders since it launched. I'm sure if I want to goldshire I would see some RP, but outside that I really just don't see it. In groups or in guildchat I've never once seen it there.

I watched thunderfury go from low to medium to high within a 1 day period lmao
---
Priest is the best to randomly help people, PW:S into Renew is so strong, too
---
Right? Look at Mr. Fat Cat here with all their extra time to spend not on the grind, thinking you can just give out healthstones willy nilly.
---
Good lord this hits home. 😂
---
It's counter-intuitive, but if you add too many "cool new quality of life features" in a game, the game starts being way too easy.
---
There's something to be said for a game that's difficult, complex, with lots of depth, that doesn't have everything spoon-fed to you.
---
Everything in moderation. Do what makes you happy!
---
And how to shitpost properly in the barrens

So when it comes to tank swapping and ads within boss mechanics that does not really work as a reliable metric for very quick adjustments on healing.

Hi I'm totally not a new player where should I go for instant quest text and this quest addon. The text reveals slower than I read which is a pain. What does the addon do?
---
I like how you’ve provided them with pringles and candy to ensure the clickers don’t leave their desk. wise man.
---
The tears in this thread sustain me.
---
Classes complimenting each other is the biggest loss for me. I think it was around WotLK that they introduced "bring the player not the class" and everything got homogenised. I remember raiding in TBC and having to carefully fill out the raid groups so the buffs of each class complimented each other. I used to like that something like an enhancement shaman or a survival hunter would never top DPS but would provide the buffs that allowed others to maximise theirs.
---
Retail has personal loot though
---
Gotta admit I catch myself mousing over to the action button where I bind my mount quite a bit still.

The constellation Tucana, containing most of the Small Magellanic Cloud, is named after the toucan.

Yeah, someone else mentioned that in Vanilla didn't show DoT timers, but there is an addon out there that will. I'm trying to find it now.
---
Companion pets are a part of Vanilla, just not battle pets. The mini Diablo is for players who own the original Vanilla CE. Classic supports the Vanilla CE pets, so you will see mini Diablo, Zergling, or Panda Cub.

He did do 50% of the damage on VC. But ya

I suspect a significant reason queues are so long is because of people like you doing this shit.

Just let them face tank whatever they pull off you.  They will learn to target your target.

I’m leveling a horde warlock for the first time. They’re what???? Thankfully I have a good wand I guess.
---
Don't worry, I'm only level 11. My internet was a bust yesterday (600-1500 ping) and I've been fairly busy at work so I couldn't take time off.
---
The struggle is real, I’ll set my alarm an extra hour or two earlier so I can try and get up and play some but because I stayed up late the night before also playing, I slept through my alarm. WoW has us all again in its grasp
---
Unless you're in your pants or your healer is totally drunk you'll be fine. Healing Prot in dungeons is fun because you can screw around but you needn't level as Prot just so healers can mess about in dungeons.
---
(Healing a srs bsns prot tank in a low level dungeon is torture btw)

Druid healers are amazing at level 60. It was my first main, played it through Molten Core, BWL, and AQ40 up through C'Thun (whereupon I moved on to other games til TBC). I topped healing meters. 
---
I'm not sure where this idea came from that Druids weren't considered to be totally capable, first-class healers. They're quite good, in both raid settings and dungeon settings.
---
This is the reason we all wanted classic.  Sure, it’s a grind. But it’s not as focused on slamming through to the meta and optimization. It’s about people enjoying the ride regardless of level or skill. 
---
... unless you’re a hunter who puts his pet on aggressive in a dungeon. Then you should alt+F4 and save us the run from the gy.
---
Aahkandi represent!

If this were a rerelease of retail every person on my server would already be running around on flaming mechanical cheetah dragon mounts, alternatively, there is not a single damn person high enough level for a mount and its wonderful.
---
ffxiv is a single player game through and through. In my 500 hours game time in FFXIV I must have had like 1 or 2 ingame interactions while leveling. Almost all of my 500 hours leveling and doing dungeons nobody communicated, I never saw anyone doing quests nor did I need anyone for anything. Also crafting and gear in that game is pure garbage.
---
But Waterwalking is sooo good, worth the materials
---
Yep and if mail drops on my war with double the armor if w/e I'm wearing, I'll prolly roll need even if it's Stam and agi.... Cuz I need the armor hella bad, squishy pre 40.
---
Haha, it gets significantly slower as you advance. 
---
There's something like, "levels 51-60 takes just as long as 1-50"
---
Try another server. You will be happier.
---
Now im gladi didnt join on that last night, yikes
---
Thanks a bunch!
---
Heard some guy in classic the other day:
---
&gt; I have to log in to classic to do my rustbolt rep, but don't want a 2-hour queue to get back in to classic.
---
Dude, just... play the game you're playing. That sounds too much like "I have to go to work."
---
Which was my original point, only we've now dropped the "you're angry at the wrong people" facade and you're at least owning that it's just straight putting yourself ahead of other people. I'm not trying to be a dickhead, I get having responsibilities that interfere (to the point that you can't play anymore because of a queue) is insanely frustrating, but I think if we're being objective about it we can only call it selfishness. We all do it, I'm sure I'm just as guilty in my own ways, I just couldn't get my head around it being rationalized as anything else.
---
The damage to mana ratio isn't great, and nothing changes otherwise. The root doesn't last longer, the cooldown isn't shorter, there's no increased range, it's just as likely to break on damage... Literally the only reason to take it is the extra damage, so it's just a question whether the extra bit of dmg is worth it. On higher gear levels you'll have lots of mana, so it probably is worth it then (r1 also benefits less from spell power, making the difference bigger at higher gear levels). But at lower gear levels you're basically paying 90 extra mana for 60 extra damage. That's a mana to damage ratio of 0.67, most spells will have a mana to damage ratio more around 1.2-1.8 depending on cast time (more cast time = better ratio, typically).
---
Dem shoulders tho.. sexay!
---
Can you record your own Murloc sound? There are various online services that'll host your .wav files. I'm curious how accurate it is!

Spent a minute getting cooking and fishing to 150 yesterday waiting on a buddy to log on. Was a time, just hearing the water move and small bits of nature making noises.

---
I'm not trying to take away 15y/o partially working product that they are selling to people, like me, who are obsessively nostalgic, and are not ready to accept the fact that the childhood, and simple times, are not coming back. The poor quality of the product, is not a given, it's not like they trying to do something unimaginable, they've been running servers for years. I don't understand where is defensiveness coming from. 
---
About servers with no queues, they advertised "name anchoring" as a feature, so it is absolutely unacceptable to blame players for not wanting to move, their names is the essential part of the nostalgic experience- this is what they came for.
---
Are you typing rogues or rogue? Or misspelling it? I mean you spelled it right twice here, so I've got no other ideas.
---
I got Questie and can't imagine playing without it now lol. Also got some AH addons but have to figure out how the heck to use them again.
---
God bless you hate those things. I did a bit of bfa leveling with a friend during the wait for classic. I don't have the chauffeured chopper or any heirlooms for that matter. My freind would get on the chopper at every opportunity and follow me as I ran jumping all over! Immersion level zero.
---
Probably out leveling considering everyone is low level and not at the point where hanging out in Stormwind is the norm.
---
Yes you will not ruin this thread with negativity.  Good day.
---
It was still great fun though
---
They optimized for "ease of use" but failed to realize that games are fun because they present challenge not ease. At the extreme, ease of use becomes pressing a button and having the game play itself.
---
The primary guiding principles should always be immersion/worldbuilding and story. Ease of use is subordinate to those goals.
---
Sorry for blog post... TLDR at bottom
---
Don't know if i should stick with my level 14 hunter or swap to rogue or mage.
---
My only wow experience was leveling a hunter 1-100 in bfa and bfa end game hunter, mage, monk. 
---
 I really liked hunter in retail but in classic im really not a fan of pet mechanics and the minimum range to use bows. I didn't mind having to be a specific range away from a mob at first but now that im higher level if my pet dies i die because mobs are almost always faster than you so you cant kite and melee hunter is a joke so you just end up dying. Then you have to run back from grave respawn and pray that you are not close enough to a mob to aggro them. Then you have to find a quiet corner to res pet and feed it till its full health. I know classic is supposed to be hard but i just don't like this mechanic.
---
Also pet happiness is kind of neat but not so much when you are afk in town and your pet leaves you and you have to go to a specific place to get a tanking pet for leveling. Had 2 pets leave me so far.... Another gripe about ranged classes is the nameplate/enemy healthbar visibility distance. I like to see enemy health bars as im in combat and as hunter at max range i can't.
---
What i like about hunter in classic is weaving spells around my auto attack timer, this is really fun! (i have tried other classes and their spells are either tied to their auto attack or just doesn't feel as good idk why) I also like the rare situations where i can kite, i love kiting around my auto attack timer and spell cd's, i feel like hunter would be really fun in pvp but im playing wow for the pve mostly.
---
I prefer dps classes and instant cast times but the idea that mage can always use their spells no matter the range is nice. I like ranged more but rogue has instant cast times, stealth to de aggro if needed, and no mana! Plus the combo system seems fun!
---
**TLDR**
---
Hunter, mage or rogue?
---
don't like range requirement for hunter spells because if pet dies you die because you cant do good damage melee. Pet happiness seems cool but having pets leave you if you are afk in town is not fun. I prefer instant casts but mage can always use their spells no matter the range, mana management is a con for me. I prefer ranged dps but rogue has instant casts, no mana and the combo point system seems really fun!
---
I for one am jealous of the awe they have. Wish I could play vanilla for the very first time again.
---
Bro what are you talking about. The chopper and all heirlooms are super easy
---
He should ban me too then.
---
I love it that Roelle wants him to stop. Apparently Frog likes to RP
---
careful with that stuff it's reaaallly strong. it also got recalled in the past for being infected with botulism.

You seem friendly enough. For what it's worth, back in the day I really enjoyed Trolden's "Funny moment" hearthstone videos. The pacing and timing on them was pretty solid imo. They would be like 3-5 minutes. For special occasions (100th episode milestone, new expansion / year, etc) he would do longer ones and I would still watch them. Sort of an earned trust factor I guess?
---
I haven't played Hearthstone in a long time though and unfortunately I just looked at his channel and it seems like most of them are just over 10 minutes now. But he's probably earned enough clout by this point to do it. Can't speak to the quality and if it's remained as good though, but it's certainly possible.
---
Druid healer is awesome pvp.  And casual play.  You do use intellect for more dmg skills so you can have better damage than a holy pally.
---
And shaman heals are pve oriented.

(Horde faction skills are pvp gold.  Dwarves and gnomes are short and good skill. But I am ready to war stomp, enrage, and use the free trinket from undead)

I am a rogue and I see rogues

Balance and power has changed over time as well as being decked out in full greys rather than having BOA (rare item equivalent).

I had this just used spirit ress and suffered the ress sickness

Then you want an action game. Everything you hate action games give. Everything I stated are CORE elements of an rpg.
---
I'm honestly not a fan of the massive grinding though.
---
At level 59 I felt I had achieved something even if I just moved the XP bar up more than two notches in one evening.

You wake up in Razor Hill.

My mom played with me for a little. I'll probably ask her to play again if she has time, but I don't think she does
---
Hunter in my group Need rolled a Strength Agility Stamina cloak that would’ve been a huge upgrade for me as a Prot warrior... I now understand the Hunter stigma in Vanilla.

I can hear this photo

Oh no doubt it was
---
what in the actual fuck is that abomination? // someone who never played wow past classic
---
Yeah agreed. If every named mob is going to be a challenge less gangbang they should just lower the respawn time on them.
---
Difference between learning about the game and following a guide.
---
I’m staying away, as much as my body is ready. I’ll never forgive myself for doing poorly in school or work just so I can play this.
---
I too was concerned that I was feeling just nostalgia and nothing else, as someone who did not play private servers. But, I remained confident, and I can say definitively, I am insanely excited to keep playing and having so much fun. I would be devastated if they took the game away from me again :(
---
Is this a question you really want an answer to?
---
You tell them to get the fucking game and fucking play it. If you handhold them half the fun of wow is gone.
---
So that you can play for 3 straight days son!!!
---
\*\*DJ AIRHORN SOUND EFFECT\*\*
---
Actually they caved to the players that kept complaining about how long it took to do things like level a toon. So they added all the short cuts and ways to do things faster. Hence why players turned into raging efficiency psycho's.
---
I remember giving that white lion over to an alliance hunter way back I'm wotlk, I'm hoping someone does that to me in classic. Rare and difficult tames are the best. Sucks you can only have 3 though :(
---
Oh, we are queue buddies then! :D Started at about the same time.
---
Priest = Shaman &gt; Druid &gt; Paladin*
---
Is this not a thing in retail? I mean I could understand it if retail is just so easy to level that other players buffs mean jack shit. Wondering because I haven't touched retail since Cata but played a bit after BC released.
---
No elves allowed!
---
Always leave the shittiest item in the chest. This ensures the next person who goes for it gets trash, giving you a slight gold advantage over the person you suckered.
---
Sorry I meant the super rare fish that you can fish in Org on retail
---
It also isn't rocket science to understand the extremely basic concept that people want to play the characters they've been playing. Utterly basic to the point of not actually needing to be said out loud to anyone that isn't a simpleton to begin with.
---
I didnt play a lot this week so i was only level 10 yesterday but i almost lost my shit when a mob dropped a green sword with +1 stamina. Shortly after that i got another green as a quest reward. I felt like i was invincible
---
You think they wont but they will.
---
Nope, just my RL social life and other hobbies. I have bills to pay gotta keep the internet on so work is my WoW breaks.
---
You can log out without exiting your realm.
---
I dunno I just went to r/wow and seems they are mostly on the hype train for classic also.
---
i feel like it's a meme at this point. i want to see a guy taking a picture of a picture of a screen on an ipad.
---
bloodsail checking in.  Great server.
---
We switched from Pagle to Ashkandi and its been great. No queues, plenty of people playing. Good times
---
They come in second because there really isn't many other options.
---
For example the Paladin has usually quite low DPS which in turn is low threat generation required for tanking bosses. 
---
And I might have been wrong regarding the healing part too, I mean right now I am leveling a Paladin to be a primary healer it's just trickier....
---
At the end of the day it's about your spec and your ability to play your class. I wouldn't stress too much over which class you wan't to play because at endgame every class is needed.
---
I feel you.
---
Couple nights ago me and a pal were killing some quillboars in the barrens, two pulls were fine but damn if we accidentally aggro'd an extra. Third friend logs in, and now we can confidently take on more quillboars.
---
Last night our fourth friend logs in and we're steam rolling the centaurs near crossroads!
---
There's certainly a sense of security in a group because yeah as you said, more than one mob can really ruin your day lol
---
Druids are not amazing healers in PvP because burst damage in Classic is high so HoTs are ineffective compared to paladin/priest healing. Druids have great survivability but your roles in BGs are very specific: flag carrier, flag defence, etc.
---
Strange. Maybe try a different pixel?
---
cya
---
I have a feeling we will all get some free time from the queue issue.
---
I never tried EQ, i should make some time to try it out sometime
---
That must be the case. Was fighting a bear last night as a mage, had low health, but the bear literally had like 2hp left so I'm like, alright time for a good ol' autoattack. It dodges twice then swipes at me and kills me. Good times.
---
Sounds like you’re both addicted which can be manageable. Either get therapy or make a play time schedule and stick to it.
---
I've been pretty much strictly leveling alts since WoD just because the end-game content didn't do it for me, so I'll admit I've definitely enjoyed having heirlooms help me while level while playing casually.  I wouldn't be against making them harder to obtain though, or setting a minimum number of maxed out characters to access them.
---
I am querying all classes. So it isn't like rogues are out leveling and paladins are not.
---
I hope blizzard sees this.
---
At the same time you kind of need to grind a bit anyways, just doing quests back to back will generally make you a bit underleveled. I have been making a habit of killing everything I see on my way between zones and killing an extra 15-20 mobs after finishing to get extra linen, copper, meat, etc.
---
I tend to buff every person that runs past me that doesnt have Arcane Intellect.  The amount of people that will chase you down to return the favor is astounding.  I've had people message me asking me to stop because they had been trying to catch up to buff me and I hadn't noticed.
---
66 hours behind - LET'S GO!
---
I'm using healbot as a druid and it's working for me.  Just as spinal said above, you have to use macros for lower rank spells, but other than that, works fine.

Completely and unilaterally disagree with this thesis

Me as a mage: you get an AI! And YOU get an AI! Everyone gets an AI!

Start queue, set alarm, sleep, wake up to check queue, play.

Your favorite game is the reason people started calling characters on WoW 'toons' and I'll never forgive you.

I like playing Buff Tag!  My favorite was buffing a mage and she ran me down to give me a buff and gave me water. So much fun actually interacting with people questing
---
Every classic player knows the feeling once you obtained your first pair of shoulders. They were usually of grey quality, look horrendous, but damn, it was nice to equip them.
---
Thanks, this is perfect. Just something to see when I’m approaching max mana so I can get out of shapeshift to use spells.
---
What auction house addon is that?
---
Yeah I've only got the coffee beans so hopefully I'm safe on the botulism side. Its significantly stronger than a normal cup of coffee, but I'm drinking it in moderation and not drinking as much as I would with normal coffee. Thanks for the concern and info! :)
---
Same. But look on the bright side, every milstone will feel so great, once i dinged level 10 i was so happy. If you could play this game like the no life streamers 8-24 hours a day, you would be done in 6 weeks. You have something to look forward to for the next months.
---
Most people will develop a connection with their characters. I think we're all underestimating how many people will continue to play.
---
Hell yea dude!
---
1999 was so much cooler than 2004 anyways
---
U honestly think putting text on a picture takes the same effort as actual content/discussion?
---
Lol sounds like I touched a nerve. Calm down bud. Play some WoW.. oh thats right...
---
Yes, you do not need to be Prot until 60, generally speaking.
---
This was me last night. I had fun escorting my friends around for quests I already did and picking up new friends along the way
---
I haven't slept for the past 4 days. Have been surviving on coffee and tea. Thanks insomnia.... and classic
---
I just want to point out that it is not against ToS to let minor family members play on your account, so that is absolutely fine.
---
Having another, non-minor person play your account to circumvent AFK should result in a warning/suspension.
---
It’s actually insane. If they were just like kill 50 of these animals instead of get me 8 livers id be fine with it. It just honeydicks you by saying “it’s only 8 items” yet you slaughter an entire continent of pigs to finally find those 8 perfect livers or the 3 vulture meat

I noticed people griefing people by agroing mobs as they run then casting a instant heal on a random person fighting mobs. When they run out of rage the mob will run to the guy healed.

Just make friends in zone chat while leveling

Botters are losers

The majority of Hunter bis pieces are leather because mail stats are generally subpar for hunters. You’ll also be sharing with druids/dps warriors.

The only queue I had was on launch day for 10 minutes.

So I’m assuming you leave your skill tree empty and never have to look at your stamina, eat food, or use potions? Just ply it on easy on god mode then?

---
There's a huge difference between some of those queues. Being in a queue of 1000 or less is much more manageable than 10k+. Having a small queue during peak hours is a sign of a healthy server population. Having a 10k queue starting hours before peak time is a big red flag to not play there
---
I'm on Beni as Horde and it's reasonably well populated but not swarmed.
---
Literally turned 31 today, a few days after classic launch.  All I can keep thinking is playing wow but my wife planned a getaway for us between today and Sunday. My mind keeps trying to find gaps in our vacation schedule where I could play but not feasible with the queues.
---
What class should I play?
---
I’m playing classic with my BFA guild. They have little to know knowledge of classic, I have a lot.
---
Classes considered: hunter, paladin, priest, and warrior.
---
I played hunter in classic to 60, and Druid to 60. I liked hunter a lot, and am pretty knowledgeable on how to play one in classic.
---
The issue is another guildie is leveling a hunter, and she is pretty competitive which can get annoying. The other issues are, are players choosing primary healers aren’t skilled, and our main tank tried to tank deadmines last night. And that did not go well.
---
I can take over the roles of either main tank or healer. I feel like I have a strong grasp of those roles in classic.
---
What do you guys think?
---
Does it work on Android?
---
When they increased the capacity last night, I dropped from 8k in the queue to 2k, but after that it was moving at an absolute snail pace, going down about 100-200 every 30minutes (and of course going up and down in the queue for some reason).
---
retail I imagine refers to the Battle for Azeroth expansion in regular WoW.  
---
&amp;nbsp;

classic refers to classic wow

Low pop realms dont exist in NA.

Isn't it funny how we've all become the casuals we hated in 2004? 
---
I was in a predominant raiding guild and we got the world first Nefarian kill in BWL. I would play for ~16-18 hrs a day if school was out of my parents didn't crack down. I used to rage at patches that would make WoW "casual friendly." It  was a concept I couldn't understand. Now I play a game for like, 2 hours, and I'm like "holy shit that was a long session!"

Plus, you can take your time and see more/more of zones in a given level bracket!
---
Well it's a big deal because it's a time investment to reroll and sometimes people get attached to their characters. I'm genuinely not looking for perfection, it's just difficult when what you want to play and what you want to do are in conflict or incompatible.

The bullet board system (dubbed LFG on retail) that was introduced in TBC doesn't really have the same butterfly effect that those two walking red flags do.

Ive been playing a NE priest (lvl 17) and its fun so far doing Dead Mines. If you wanna min/max i keep hearing dwarf is better for priest so if u wanna play NE and optimize, Druids probably the way to go.
---
Same here. :) Hope you have lots of fun in Classic!

Retail refers to the most current patch, or in other words, the non-classic official servers.

Yes AFAIK, to play classic you need a current WoW retail subscription, as it counts for both. So you could buy tokens on retail wow, redeem them for the sub, then use that to play classic.
---
Yooo hahah I thought I was the only one 😂
---
I would recommend going mage, that way you'll have some variety in your party composition.  You could lure enemies for PvP and frost nova them for your rogue friends to attack.  You've already indicated you enjoy mage DPS, and mage in Classic is very entertaining (PvP wise at least).
---
LOL

If you got experience for being queue it would be a tight race to 60.

Like I said though,  no rush!

Never. I only heal butts.

Tip for any warriors out there. Do quests once you're one level to high for them. Lil less xp but get them done so much quicker. May mean lots of zone hopping to stay ahead though
---
No, you're awesome! :)
---
I'm interested for different reasons. I'm not interested in listening to 30+s who are pretending to be edgy teens again. Furthermore, I'm not interested in grouping with Nazis at all.
---
"*How does that make you feel?*"
---
The servers have so many people on them the chances of you making a bad name for yourself over this is very low. 
---
Nobodies going to remember you.
---
I'm just saying it is the same story always, classic and retail are made for different public's 15 years a part, I would like for people to understand that the problem isn't necessarily in the games, but with what people do with it. The game is just a response of what it audience wanted, now that everyone is happy with classic, I don't see the point of bashing retail and it's players, you guys are completely different people with different needs just understand this for the love of God. I like both and respect both versions.
---
I just know, 6 months from now, i want to play a medium to high pop server with a healthy economy and plenty of opportunity to raid/pug content.  I feel like the best way to accomplish this is to try to fit the most people on the least servers.  20k queues are obviously not okay, but i also dont believe that creating 10 new servers is necessarily a great option.
---
Rogues are gods of 1v1 and top tier pvp obviously.  BUT...for BGs I find them not as much fun, as you get to engage less than any other class imo.  
---
You have to sneak around and be very specific about when you pop from stealth....because you're gonna get lit up if you pop near a crowd of players.
---
They are gods in 1v1 world pvp....but not as much in large scale fights...
---
Never played a mage.
---
I accepted my first “over 100k job” 40 minutes before the servers opened on Monday.

I’m devastated.

Be easy on my mans, I can hardly imagine how it feels suddenly finding yourself deserted place and looking for people to play with in retail
---
Are the queues evening out? Just checked and there was no queue for one of the three full servers mid morning 8/29. Had several thousand in queue yesterday. Or maybe there was a restart?
---
I'm on Benediction and I'm in a similar situation. I don't want to go too far with my character is this realm is purged 6 months later but just about any other server I try gets too full.
---
Hey so i got the following problem, i started on release of classic as a human warrior which i lvled to 17. Theni felt like im missing the horde so i started a undead mage which is lvl 10 now. So currently im swichting between those two because i cant decide what to play. One the one side i dont want to "loose" the beauty of the alli on the other hand i want to be on the horde. And i also dont want to get rolled over by the horde when im alli in case its true that there is so much more horde...
---
tag faster?

No but you can sew
---
I'm brand new to WoW (never played vanilla or any of the up to date versions) and am struggling to pick a class...  I'm playing with a group of friends and am a little late to the party, and it looks like our group is lacking dps a bit so I was going to go mage. But for some reason druid sounds cool, but I've seen a lot of things online about druid being a trash tier class.
---
I just want to make my first playthrough fun and simple as a newcomer haha. Any suggestions or advice?

+1 to my ignore lost almost instantly.  Just going off in chat about politics and acting like a complete a hole

Don't forget literally every class has a selfheal now. where's class identity.

Ive res'd quite a few people where im out in the world and just see a random corpse.  Always nice to get a thank you out of it :)
---
Priest front loads damage as well with mind blast, shadow word pain +/- smite (mind flay later). But yeah, then lots of wand auto attack to utilize mp5 rule. Spirit tap is activated also to further help mana regen.
---
This is hitting me harder than anything on this board so far... oh man.
---
[If you want to know what a twink is. ](https://youtu.be/S_4PrI8gB-k)
---
So despite what everyone says, with druid, if you're geared and talented for a role you can play it. People are gonna be body starved for bodies. Standard is gonna be resto. People love you for the mana regen spell.
---
Fear, dot dot dot.... see if he sinks or swims.
---
If they do cross realm, you'll lose people. If they do transferring, maybe but most people won't want that anyway. Cuz if half a dead server doesn't xfer, it's super dead. Transferring might be the best way but it gets tricky if other realms are already popped. At the rate they are going I think a merger is inevitable. And if the plan was transferring, then why not release 40 servers and offer transferring to half of them after "x" months if they die? It makes no sense to have people plan everything out n then get stuck in a 20 hour que. 
---
I do think expanding the player count on the server was the right move that nobody expected. It will be a layering problem in the future, but they should have started with that to reduce que. I'm no expert but I feel like 10hr ques should never have happened. I also think the name reservations and coordination should never have happened because then most people would have 0 issues transferring.
---
I am going to focus on top 20 and I will only add lvl 40+ to the list.
---
You’re right. Shit.
---
Good for you buddy keep it up
---
&gt; Tempted to roll a Warrior 
---
i would do some research into exactly how a warrior plays in classic...it can be extremely frustrating for many people. You basically can only take on one mob at a time until end game and if you pull even two you will die almost 100% of the time. Plus it takes forever for rage to generate so you will take forever to level.
---
Large vocal playerbase always calls for convenience, ease and speed. That's just because they fail to realize they enjoy the journey and are simply focusing on the reward, then ask to make the reward faster to acquire.
---
I'm so tired at work
---
Yeah I understand why streamers and hardcore world first aspirants might rush it but imo it’s such a waste of amazing game. The journey and the world are to be savored.
---
They changed the meaning behind low medium high and they now show how many are in the server at the moment. That might help you decide on where to play depending on if you're going to be at on at odder hours.
---
Looked like he was explaining, not complaining.
---
Are they actual nazis or just being edgy because it's classic wow
---
Undead warlocks winning with that life tap - cannibalize combo. I rarely have to stop.
---
Server might help too :)
---
Osrs up on the top charts? I mean yeah it’s got a solid player base but it’s nothing compared to wow. They have 66k online right now thats like maybe 2 wow servers.
---
????????????
---
Hard to say it’s “best”.  Seems some people really dominate with an elemental spec (fire/frost).
---
You can have fun as Pom pyro as well.
---
But deep frost is very good. Fire is fun though.
---
You can res them after they release.  Just use your res spell and mouseover them.
---
And yet, you still won’t be getting that time back
---
The problem with that is that I'd have to compare it to every name I see manually. Ideally I'd have hundreds of names and it would turn their name a different color or something.
---
I can't speak for everyone but I'd rather play where my 10 friends are already playing than pick a random server. And getting them to uproot and move and maybe there will still be a queue and a few of them have friends on the server etc etc.
---
Originally all my friends and their friends were rolling on Whitemane which was at one point more populated than Faerlina and Herod. So we switched, but half the group went to one server and the other went to another and then some other friend rolled on one of the brand new ones and it's been a huge mess.
---
You don't really have to worry about going a healing spec until 60, you can heal dungeons just fine with dps talents.  At 60 you'll be able to solo quite easily even with a healing spec.
---
And you know these random people are actually nazis how?
---
No they are all Party/Raid buffs now. You can’t just buff a stranger.
---
At 4 am CST you should be able to get in any realm with no queue. I would just do a high pop server if you want to enjoy a thriving full world.
---
“I hate that I can’t buy a near max level account” is all I got from this.
---
So report the comment to blizzard and let them police it. 
---
There’s absolutely no reason to post that drama on Reddit.

There are lots of whales you can profit from though, wool bags and wands just fly out of the AH.

---
I would definitely be surprised if there are lots of brand new WoW players who are starting with Classic. But I hope there are!
---
Work-life-gym balance is hard enough without Classic WoW :/
---
Drinking and eating are less about immersion and more about pacing and resource management. Like mounts at 20 and flying at 60. Having to be conscious of health and mans means you need to be efficient with how you approach things. It also encourages more grouping and interaction. Retail is not necessarily a bad game, but it is not good at what Vanilla was good at.
---
If you think *Heirlooms* are the reason for that then I don't know what the fuck to tell you. Heirlooms weren't even upgradeable to level 85 until late into Cata.
---
&gt; although I try not to regret the decisions I make in life. I often wish I would have given the game a chance back in 2004 and tried some of the other expansions too. 
---
I see Classic as a fresh start for everyone! No regrets here, just try to look forward to all the fun you'll be having now! :)
---
And nice story too! It's interesting to hear that Everquest has also become less community-oriented over the years (with the ability to have computer-controlled helpers even!). I think by playing Classic, we are showing our support for a more community-oriented experience in MMOs--with strong emphasis on player interaction. I hope this helps to shift the MMO genre back in that direction.

That's true. Not just for mounts and pets, the whole progression and world seems pointless. They dumbed down the game so much in the latest expansions. 
---
You could literally shut down your brain and play without effort and still doing good.

Roose Bolton wants to know your location.

Get this patriot a brick and a coat!

Pay someone else to come and clean your place for a few weeks

Owajmuan!!!!
---
= Oh, we are just making up abbreviations now?
---
it's pretty annoying
---
it makes last second heals, interupts etc very hard to land. If you wait until last second for those things, theres a chance you get spell batched and miss the timing. Nothing quite like throwing a lay-on-hands on yourself while your buddy dies
---
Knew it !!
---
Out of curiosity, why use a third party app instead of just changing the sleep timer on the device?
---
I think your first one comes at the end of the tarren mill quests, it's just a bandana lol
---
If you rejoined now you would be in when you got home it not then close to it.
---
There’s 10k queues because people see a 2k queue and stop logging out to not wait an hour and a half. So they stay on longer inflating the queue even more.
---
As much as I'm loving playing Classic, it's not hard to see that some of the QOL features that have been implemented over the past 15 years did nothing but improve the game.  Guild banks immediately come to mind.
---
And more content, as long as it's parallel content as opposed to progression, I don't think would be a bad thing.  Like opening up Kharazan that drops gear at MC/ZG level and supports up to 10 players.  Things like that.
---
Should be done very carefully or just not at all though, to be safe.  They have to maintain the spirit of the game or we're just going to repeat history and ruin it again.
---
But it’s happening very often at the moment
---
Teamwork makes the dream work?
---
Ignore warlock on screen.  You are hunter and cat pet wants aggro!  Good cat.  Many meats tonight.
---
If you consider yourself to be casual (as are alot of people) , and just want to have fun DPS'ing, you are really debating Mage, Rogue , Hunter.
---
Druid is not a trash tier class.  At any rate the amount of players who "Tier" their 60's is small compared to overall player base.
---
If it was my first play through, I would probably go Mage if I wanted to go "magic ranged dps" with some cool abilities to make your life easier (conjuring / portals) and go Rogue if you want to do melee DPS with the ability to engage in shenanigans (stealthing to places you shouldn't be / world PvP ambushes)
---
Besides warrior, they are all hybrids and they are all bad at it is the point being made
---
I'm not interested in political discussion.

I'm interested in an add on.

Did you visit duskwood recently?
---
I'm sure Jokerd and Leshraque are going to open their wrists at the shame of not having your blessing.
---
I only buff things I can see.
---
I meant on the top charts for having a sweaty nerd community.
---
Literally everything is cringe these days 🙄
---
Viscious circle to be honest. If there were no ques, people wouldn’t have to do this. At the end of the day, blame blizzard
---
If you are on Grobbulus Horde Side feel free to add me, char name Profanity, would be happy to help or answer questions.
---
Try turning off discord overlay - that worked for me.
---
You are now exalted with The Dreadfort.
---
Druid cat form is based on the Rogue if you want an alternative. The class lets you play out several playstyles, so it's good if you want a bit of everything(healing, stealth/dps, tanking).
---
I wouldn't say classic is a trip to the past. 
---
It's the gameplay that gets us.
---
It's more like an rpg than retail is.
---
Retail seems like a spoonfed zoomfest.
---
Classic due to the mechanics and gameplay requires more planned gaming, paying attention to your surroundings, using more skills, taking more of the world in, using and spending time on tertiary skills and leveling them up, having to work more for your goals, actually dealing with other players and interacting.
---
I mean each to their own, that's not everyone's thing but that's what classic is for me.
---
As a generalisation i wonder if you implemented classics gameplay style into retail there might not even be that need for classic.
---
A Fel-energies debuff while in Outlands that reduces your level, and removes all stats and effects from gear. Outlands gear is immune, and your "levels" are about overcoming the debuff.
---
Expansion gear could be balanced equivalent to (or even under?) Azeroth gear so that Naxx is always "Naxx difficulty" rather than becoming irrelevant.
---
In Outlands with Naxx gear? Need Outlands gear. Want to do Naxx? Your Outlands questing gear doesn't cut it, because it's basically level 40 gear.
---
Content should be slotted into the level brackets that make sense. It doesn't *have* to be tacked on linearly at max level.  Pick and choose expansion content appropriately.
---
Okay dad I'll give it a shot!
---
When i picked up that quest, i remembered it taking forever, so i said i would casually kill them over time. But i found a pack of five as soon as I stepped out of Crossroads, and got all four at once. Never felt so lucky.
---
Stalagg?
---
Not going to lie, this might be the first time I've actually started to feel like I might be getting old.  I'm in my mid/late thirties, and these getting to bed at 2-230, waking up at 8-830 5 days in a row now, and then gaming all day, isn't as easy as it used to be.  Monday morning I was fine, Tuesday I was ok, Wed was tough, and today I feel like a bag of hammered shit.
---
If you see it like that then sure, but it’s still bit of an asshole move
---
!
---
What is 17/0/34? I have like 3 or 4 points in frostbolt thats it. Do i need to change that?
---
They think they know what they're doing, but they dont.
---
I did watch the clips, like I said, the studio view is during downtime when the casters are taking a break. The guy walking around pressing spacebar probably didn't know he was on stream and doing it live for everyone to see.
---
Good old business mode of get them hooked then charge them for it. I like it.
---
lul
---
But who uses them? I don’t. I have launched apps on the taskbar that I use a context menu to launch games.
---
Yes. If you have heirloom gear (special leveling gear that scales with you as you level) you are virtually unkillable.
---
This post was made by the Kromcrush/Kirtonos/Sulfuras/Benediction gang.
---
It’s a meme anyway
---
Crazy how terms appear suddenly and seem to be instantly ubiquitous... it seems to me to be a way of making so called “private “ (which are actually pirated) servers legitimized... oh, retail *and* private servers, and now classic too.  Two of these are legal - one isn’t.
---
Ahh did they already confirm to make transfers aviable for dead servers? Cuz in original vanilla you could not transfer servers and I was worried about this.
---
Yeah, I'm talking about the time it takes to enter world, which appears to be twice longer now with almost twice less the people
---
No competition AOE farming is the dream.
---
Nice cabin. Great view. Go outside dude. Take hikes.
---
Well, I'm in Faerlina, so there's definitely a lot of people lol
---
????
---
Honestly, this has been my first time playing classic and I've been enjoying myself a lot. I've played retail a little bit over the years, but the return of the community has been great.
---
IMO you’re better off leveling as a dps spec with a set of healing gear in your bags. You can heal as an off spec for most of the game. You would really only need to respec once, when you’re approaching 60.
---
Yes but you are literally never excited in retail. In classic you are. 
---
Also this is a white item not a gray.
---
Was the bag man because "sack dude" was already taken
---
Auctionator has been serving me well so far.
---
Throw aspect of the pack in there and you got yourself a public transportation service
---
This is me except it’s because I have one name that I truly desire to have on my main.
---
Try them all! You don't have to exclusively play one class. It could take you months to figure out what you like more. Just enjoy the ride and give everything a try!
---
I was one of those nay-sayers last week. Don't get me wrong, I fully expect the crowd to die eventually. But now that I'm back in Azeroth playing, I just can't get over how much *fun* I'm having. Even with a single quest now taking 4 times longer than they do today, there's something about the struggle of questing that is just so much more enjoyable than being given levels like they do in retail now.
---
Nope Rogues are great. Have fun out there.
---
We need another server capacity raise by at least 5-10k people. Just put more layers in if you have to Blizz, then remove the layers one by one when population size goes down.
---
This fucking sucks. Queued for 4 hours and then got disconnected and now I'm back of the queue.
---
Waste of fucking time.
---
/rant
---
I feel extremely personally attacked.
---
Ah the typical "nobody asked you"
---
Not sure how we’re meant to answer this for you... just play what you wanna play. At level 5 it really doesn’t matter, you can get back up to 5 in an hour.
---
Questie or ClassicCodex will
---
You and I measure difficulty in a much different way. 
---
&gt;And no, hair splitting that Mythic+ content (which what, 1% of the playerbase even does?)
---
Much more than 1% of the playerbase does M+ lol. If this is your honest view then we just live in different realities. All of the sites that look to track various achievements among the playerbase show surprisingly high rates of achievements like aotc. 
---
If you have data to point to I'd be happy to have a look of course. But if you think that it's 'hair splitting' to point to mythic + as content that more than 1% of players do, you better have some data pointing that out lol. 
---
&gt;Harder than WoW retail? The comparison is laughable.
---
Again, it depends on how you define 'difficult,' which you didn't do here. 
---
For example, what is more difficult? Solving 1000 multiplication questions with numbers between 11 and 99 (11x37, 63x82, etc.) OR deriving the formula for the volume of a donut? 
---
The former one requires more time, the latter one requires more skill. Which is more difficult? That all depends on your definition of difficulty. 
---
&gt;To argue otherwise is to essentially say a $5,000 trailerhome is nicer than a $500,000 house because the trailerhome "has a really nice showerhead". Yes, you may be factually right for the niche you're talking about, but I don't think anyone familiar with idiomatic english is going to be convinced about the generality by such narrow parsing of specifics.
---
This is a really weird and irrelevant analogy. Let's not go down this path of comparing this to something else, let's just define difficulty in absolute terms and talk about WoW. 
---
When I say that classic is not difficult, I mean it in the sense of the content can either be brute-forced and you do it, or it can't be brute forced and you don't. Last night I did a quest to go into the crypt in tirisfal and kill a mob 3 levels higher than me with a room full of mobs at my level or one higher. It's not difficult to do that quest. Get a group of 5 people and everything falls down. I never felt like my skill was being tested or my group just needed to play better, it was just a matter of making that decision to get the number of players that I needed. But for some people, the requirement of needing to group meets their definition of difficult, and that's fine. 
---
When I say that retail is more difficult, I mean it in the sense that skill plays a much larger role. Even with the same gear and the same time and same prep and everything, the best raiders in the world are going to pick up mechanics and flat out play better than my raid team and they will kill the boss significantly faster than my group ever would. In fact, my group will fail to kill bosses that they killed within two weeks. Mythic Azshara won't die at the hands of my raid group, not because we don't have access to enough people and not because we don't have access to good enough gear to kill her, but because we aren't skilled enough. The difficulty in killing raid bosses in classic is very much a social one. It's difficult to get 40 people on at the same time, it's difficult to deal with loot politics, it's difficult to set everything up for the raid. But once you've checked all of those boxes, the bosses are going to fall over. 40 warm bodies will kill the raid bosses. On retail, the difficulty of getting the group together isn't nearly as high. You can run on normal/heroic with ten-30 people, or mythic with 20 people. BUT, the skill level required, even on normal difficulty, is significantly higher. 
---
If you measure difficulty in terms of number of people required to accomplish a task and the speed at which you can complete the task, then yes, classic is more difficult. If you measure difficulty in terms of skill required, retail is more difficult.
---
At level 60 you will want [Engineering](https://wowclassic.pro/professions/engineering/) and [Herbalism](https://wowclassic.pro/professions/herbalism/). I would not worry about leveling Engineering while leveling to be honest. Takes too many mats / time. Better to focus on leveling and catch up at 60.
---
Also Herbalism is a much better money maker at 60 than mining.
---
That much is fair. Im horde myself so i cant comment on how the alliance population on mankrik is, but i definitely understand why someone whos alliance may want to avoid it based on name alone.
---
It's not a cash shop mount, it's a mount you get for owning a certain amount of different heirlooms. I think it's 35? I can't exactly remember how many.
---
Super adorable.

Where can I find one of those?

big sad I haven't been able to sit down and no life the shit out of this game for like an 8 hour sitting... sad how time changes.
---
I created an undead female character to be my banker. Took all the clothes off and went to undercity level 1. While there a lvl 11 undead male character approached. I said use me and started dancing. He wanted me. I said i wanted 10s to suck him for 10 seconds. He asked me to start. I said pay first. He then payed, and i sucked him.. i said that he had to beat me (we dueled). I have screenshots dont make me upload it.
---
i did a rough at /who in whatever zone i was in and it was mages and 1/4 warriors wherever i was.
---
You guys are always bitching about queue times... Welcome to the Vanilla experience.
---
Thank you SO MUCH
---
I don't believe you can do it by type just name.
---
There is an auction house in Stormwind. Same building, but follow the wall up the eastern side to the north and youll find a doorway in. In the middle of the trade district.
---
I had no hunter in the group and got it on a rogue, when pulling mobs it procs often and effectively does 1/4 of the mobs hp before it even arrives.
---
I've been holding off on looking up exactly how much a mount is. My god.
---
made your hair turn black?
---
Getting this blue is like getting Holo Machamp in a big deck ;)
---
This but unironically
---
You almost had me in the first half, and I was pretty interested in having a discussion about the onus being on blizzard, etc. 
---
Then you got "a little sugar in your tank" and hit us up with the typical "blah blah reddit this reddit that"
---
also, it DIRECTLY affects me. calling me a snitch doesn't bother me, these people are actively ruining the experience for a lot of people. I don't particularly mind waiting 9 hours, I run it in the background and play other games while I wait, but others don't have the luxury of a pc that can handle that or multiple monitors etc. "doing what they got to do" is an absolutely nonsensical argument. they dont have to do it. it's complete entitlement, and is arrogant and selfish. 
---
I will continue to report them, and after seeing some of the salty comments on this post, I'm going to enjoy it just a little bit more now.
---
Yeah that makes sense. I just found a few clever ways to get around the queue so I didn't have to swap.
---
Oh shit you're playing at work?! Ok I can figure this out.
---
Probably. Add in all the other people don't the same thing and it's the same feedback loop.
---
First aid is a must in vanilla. Doesn't matter if you are a healer. You need first aid and should be leveling that as you go.
---
So...like that addon that this sub was raging about last week?
---
I still don't get why people hated that so much.  It simplifies one of the things that really sucked in Vanilla, without any of the real downsides of the retail LFG.
---
Fuck you!  Scuttlepants is an awesome name for a spider!
---
Oh man I'm so jealous, I did rfc last night and didn't roll need on anything because I didn't want to be called a huntard. I can't wait for WC though that's my all time favorite dungeon
---
Moses sim 2004. Wandering the desert for 40 levels.
---
Alright grinchy mc grinch
---
A weapon is different because it has damage values associated to it and is not just a stat stick if it's your class's main source of damage. Whereas the only difference between cloth and leather is the amount of armor it provides, all other things being equal.
---
That being said some weapons are actually stat sticks that don't get used for their damage numbers, namely staffs. Come to think of it.. I get why the hunter gear meme exists now.
---
For me it's not the lvl 1 reward, but the appearance .   this motor thing just sucks balls.   I don't mind  the occasional tech based device in this world, as has been said a thousand times, they were in the game since Warcraft 1.  But it should be occasional.  Not something you run into at every starting zone. 
---
they should have made this heirloom lvl 1 'mount'  just a young pony / ram / wolf puppy  or whatever beast your race is familiar with  and I doubt many people would object.
---
The only thing limiting shadow priests from healing is Shadowform. Simply deactivate it and boom you're a healer.
---
Deadmines came first, Dire maul was released later therefore Deadmines is DM
---
Muy life
---
X to doubt. Same queue time as yesterday.
---
Seriously, make a mage friend. I have to drink after every single pull, I would be so broke if I had to pay for my refreshments.
---
Must be wrong, it hits with a wrath animation for 40 ish dmg
---
I like to think of Rping in wow as acting out a game in Whose Line is it Anyway? It's all improv and entertainment.
---
People suck dont they?
---
share the alliance guide please
---
If you don’t spend half of your /played time buffing passers-by do you even classic bro?
---
3k is not bad, 1 hour I think
---
Back in the day, me and a buddy had two Compact Shotguns (low level green gun, don't remember the stats) drop from wolves in Westfall within a couple minutes of each other.  
---
Aside from the joke of "I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your f\*\*\*ing knees off", we now had two hobos running around Azeroth's version of the Depression-era Dustbowl, with sawed-offs.
---
Should then grey from the stress really..🤔
---
Nice.
---
all of the parties make sense except for the lemon one. I remember that old simpsons episode where the two towns were fighting over the lemon tree. I don't remember that phrase being used though
---
the "consensus" is Method's opinion - they claim so, and they claim that it is "confirmed", without saying who has confirmed it, or on what basis.
---
I was just wondering if there is a community of players who were rehashing or reevaluating old topics. I'd imagine some aspects of the game have changed a bit with dynamic respawns and incorrect private server data etc. 
---
I feel you, I'm just playing as well. Not even running addons. I'm going old school!
---
what a pretentious and useless comment.
---
Escape Artist is bis for PvP (between gnome and human) which if you're focusing on, is pretty huge.
---
Closest you might kind are kill on sight add-ons like [spy](https://willitclassic.com/view/zv1zMyp4gZXNk3wIL1DY) or [vanosKoS](https://willitclassic.com/view/6JWOzA6qDZfTckkzTkqT)
---
They won't mute players but it'll alert you if they are nearby
---
If you're new, it's not a bad idea to level a few toons to 10-20 to get a feel for your preferred playstyle.
---
Cast Activision into the fire!  Destroy it!
---
I'm sorry if I don't buff you as a mage, but I don't have any mana!  ;o;
---
I too can make predictions without any factual support.
---
Feral tank with ns heal. Can tank and heal everything, also great for open world pvp.
---
Why you showering, you casual?
---
There is bind on equip and bind on pick up. You cannot trade bind on pick up items but bind on equip doesn’t bind until you equip the item.
---
OMG what is this :O :[
---
Weird.
---
Yeah Vanilla had the meeting stones as a queue system but, again, literally nobody used it.
---
And when I said nobody used the LFG system in TBC, I mean nobody used it.
---
I'd always post my group there just in case as it only took seconds, but I never once saw anyone else in it and never had anyone message me because of it.
---
And I was on Blackrock (we were full, gtfo) so it's not like I was on some dead server.

---
Thank you, I jumped in front of 8 mages last night and buffed them, only for them to either walk away or /laugh and walk away.
---
It's definitely not in at launch, which blows for priests because we're screwed out of the best wand.
---
yeah those race difference were always negligible.Only the super hardcore guilds cared about them .5 % intellect is better then 5 % spirit but both are useful for a mage.Perception could help you in PvP vs druids/rogues but 10 % increase reputation is great if you decide to grind certain factions for reputation and nice rewards .Human is more then fine choice
---
So he can burn all our hard earned materials!
---
Yeah dude! Loving it there.
---
Sounds like you should be fired.
---
Yeah, naming after a boss is a bad idea I’ll say. Still, Dire Maul is in the community consciousness. 
---
I vote for DS as DeadmineS, just to add to the chaos! :D
---
Mostly it sucks when Hunters take melee weapons from Rogues or other meleee-heavy classes that will use those weapons every single day.
---
Same with Rogues taking guns/bows from Hunters.
---
Yeah, with all the gear upgrades I got I'm effectively 3 shoting everything my level.
---
You don’t understand how it works.
---
That's cute.
---
I was sitting in Goldshire handing out free water and arcane buffs last night to help people.  :)  
---
Here you go little one! Have a buff.
---
This is why I play rogue and just go invisible when anything comes up
---
You can farm elite mobs at your level or higher with the right shadow spec, kiting with psychic scream mind flay and letting SWP tick. Silence is great for pulls and WPVP, and Shadow Reach is similarly a fantastic talent. I think Shadow is pretty head and shoulders above the other trees for leveling both pre and post 40, unless you're going to be doing a lot of dungeon or group levelling.
---
&gt;... now I'm a grown up that knows several actual twinks.
---
Big yikes
---
When i accidently add a second mob i just hit it with hamstring and kite the first mob in circles around untill its dead and then decide if i can take up the second immediately or if its time to run.
---
Brings out the best in you until 50 people have to kill 1 mob... then it’s every man for himself lol
---
Not ashamed to say that I've been doing this. Start the queue for my server a few hours before I get home from work and boom, I'm right in and ready to play when i get home.
---
I'm sure it's "possible," but good Lord, I don't recommend it. 
---
A processor and chipset that was very, very slow in 2010, paired with a GPU that is very, very slow today...
---
My recommendation, honestly, is to get a budget PC/laptop from this generation that costs $400 or more. You'll not only be saving yourself a lot of headache, you'll have a much better experience.
---
Teleporting to Moon glade (OG class hall) to do my druid quests just makes me feel so tied to the world. Like, there's this special place for druids where we all get along.
---
Also, I'm in the process of completing my aquatic form quest and was thinking of how much I wanna go collect some stranglekelp lol. So fast.
---
IT guy here as well, no worries.  Yeah, WoW uses actual input to prove you're still there.  So, actually playing, or tricks like this bird to fake it, or something like setting up an oscillating fan to bump to the space bar every time it rotates.
---
oh why is it a such must?I saw people here saying they are skipping it until perhaps way later
---
Not sure if you’re talking about Warcraft or earth.
---
Every capital has always had one.

---
You have fighting abilities for sure, and some people will talk your ear off about the viability of damage (retribution specialization) paladins. However the paladins healing / support abilities with fat heals, bubbles, and buffs make them great in a group. Solo
---
leveling isn’t horrible as paladin, just slow since you can grind mobs down as well as a hunter or mage.
---
I rolled on one on purpose, im excited.
---
Should be more than 15s 35c, as that is the vendor sell price.
---
That said, I got mine for 15s 75c, meaning when I resell it I basically just spent 40 copper on it.
---
The only classic drama I’ve had so far has been hunters looting mage gear and just being awful. Truly the authentic vanilla experience.
---
Doing adulting,  I get on at 6am so no queue for me even on high pop. :) but the trade off is only 2 hours of game time a day
---
The hero we need though not the one we deserve.
---
BOOM HEADSHOTs? That’s more of a gun thing though.
---
Bro I forgot how ridiculous some low level items are. I got it last night and my Dps straight up tripled. Probably won’t get an upgrade for ten levels...
---
Done! Sorry I forgot that!
---
Those westfall murlocs deserve respect.
---
Hmm vanilla cost me 2 years in university. So there was no balance there. Now I have a work, and somehow forced to balance it ;(
---
I dont want to, but I have to
---
I know the feeling I'm dragging ass today at work
---
When I’m passing a fight, I like to throw knives or go unarmed to raise the skill level.
---
Classic was challenging, lots grinding and rewarding. It made you feel more immersed in the world as you could not fly, required you to talk to more NPC's and made you proud when you got your mount or beat your first dungeon. The world seemed vastly large because of it. The down side was it was slow so it was hard to be casual player.
---
The big difference compared to modern wow is that professions matter, build path mattered and grouping was required for questing. Power creep was not a thing so you could not pull large mobs, you actually used your food, first aid and mana reg items between pulls as well. Leveling through zones was only way as you could know auto que for dungeons. There were faults back then but we kind of accepted it as blizzard actually was producing a game unlike anything else during that period and had lots of hype after WC3. 
---
I have very good memories back then with guilds mates, friends i made and explore new zones. Stranglethorn vale was coolest thing to me when i was 13 and with current play through i don't even see it anymore.
---
The hype is very positive as it should be classic and it is nice to see love again for wow.
---
So you’re playing a WoW game at launch and not expecting a queue ?
---
I am really trying to avoid getting back into this game (at least for awhile) but for some reason, this post really got me. I MUST RESIST.
---
Just got a blue BoE 2h axe in the Barrens today. 
---
Now im finally killing things and finishing with more than 10% health. 
---
Also. Those 30m buffs that the guy at Camp Taurajo give out are *amazing* for my general survivability
---
It's ok, I prefer to use the default keybinds for the main action bar. And I don't keybind buffs etc because it's not really needed
---
Can't really say this is true or false either way after just a couple of days.
---
I see you are a mage of culture as well.
---
It was for the rogue horde quest you unlock at level 10. His name was Ceko or something.
---
It's multiple things really but I'll give an example. I prefer to play melee but it's terrible in large scale PvP which is a big part of the fun of MMOs for me. Although I 100% agree that class homogenisation is bad, situations like this are frustrating.
---
Credit where credit is due, Trolls do look the coolest and have the best voice acting. That said, they have the worst racials of all 8 factions. Throwing specialization? Pathetic amounts of health regen in combat?  
---
Compare to orcs who get increased attack and 25% stun resist plus axe specialization.  
---
Compare to Tauren that get 5% health bonus (much better than 10% combat regen) and mf'ing warstomp. Hell even the herbalism bonus is better than most of the troll racials.  
---
Compare to undead with wotf and cannibalism. Unfortunately they can't be shaman, but you get my point.  
---
Trolls - They suck, but at least you look good doing it mon.
---
'But sir, don't you know you've always been here?"
---
My parents still can't get cable. They can do either dial-up, satellite, or this weird slightly-better-than-dial-up wireless tower thing that is affected by the weather.
---
They chose the wireless tower thing because satellite is too expensive.
---
Really just a matter of opinion.
---
I truly don't care for 1-59 that much at all compared to my time spent at 60.
---
Literally holy shit haha. The sad part with this guy is that his ass if forming such a good seal around that bucket that when he eventually ends up with ED from all the crappy food he’s eaten it’s going to fire right out his crack! 😂
---
Me after the mob resisted Mind Blast and two attempts to put SW:P on it: *"wait. That's illegal."*
---
This may happen too. I'd take a separate sub to Classic over micro transactions any day.
---
Personally I played back in Vanilla however I was Alliance. I did not switch to Horde until after the cataclysm. For me my questions and curiosity come from being new to the faction in a world that was not destroyed by Deathwing.  I try to keep this in mind as I help others.  My familiarity comes from another perspective and yet I am having a blast.
---
I member when they first added weather it was so cool. 15 year old me thought it was the peak of immersion
---
I wouldn't initiate a fight with rank 1, because the mob won't move toward you until your first spell lands, so you might as well spend the extra second to do some proper damage. But if something isn't going according to plan, rank 1 can be very useful. If a mob is running for the healer in a dungeon, you can slow it down, or if an enemy player is running away, you can quickly slow them.
---
lol yea i was trying to skin animals and everytime i start skinning he would hit the spacebar and cause me to jump.
---
Or try to find an old written guide :) (or a newly written one, seemed way easier lol)
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/priest-leveling-classic-wow
---
Is not perfect, but good enough, read another in the same style for a class i knew better and it was like 80-90% on point.
---
https://classicwow.live/guides/44/1-60-priest-leveling-guide-by-kargoz
---
Kargoz seems like he has a good rep and the wand progression is really helpful.
---
I don't know, but in retail I would rush to max in order to play the GAME. But in vanilla, I just chill out and relax.
---
They can't do that.
---
There are two competing preferences here:
---
1. If you have too deep of a progression system, then new players are really, really far from the "end game".
---
2. If you add catch-up mechanics (basically what raising the level cap is), then the old content gets short-circuited out and is no longer relevant, so people don't run it.
---
You're arguing for #1, but honestly, I think Naxx was about as far as they could realistically take their progression without a catch-up mechanic of some sort.
---
It's not been a failure. It gave people 15 years of entertainment. 
---
People want to experience the nostalgia and the days of old where it was harder to achieve anything
---
In dungeons instead of capping everyone off at the end of a pull, everyone should be bandaging. Mana is precious in vanilla, we don't have giant pools and it doesn't Regen fast. Instead of topping you and four other people off, everyone just bandages and moves to the next fight. Otherwise you end up having to drink twice. Once after the fight because you are out of Mana and have to top everyone off and then again after you have topped everyone's health off (including your own).
---
lmao.  
---
"Your not doing it right"
---
😂

---
Wow!  Thanks!
---
It’s doing more damage for me ATM I’m thinking it’s about the same until the 2h talents. Essentially whichever weapons are best I’m using until then
---
Thanks for your answer. That's a good way to look at it, I guess I'll try it out.
---
I used to do that back in the days of lichking... Good memories. Might go and get it too
---
&gt;No loud mounts 
---
Mechanostriders: am i a joke to you?
---
I’ve been doing that since Tuesday and you’re just parroting what you’ve read on reddit. It’s kind of pathetic to take credit for the idea of someone else
---
also the highest gear dependency so that can be good or bad depending on your luck with loot
---
I can tell you the features I miss. I miss a few more flight paths to at least somewhat reduce the walking, I miss the guild panel, and I miss transmog, which I really do love.  That's it. Those are the only things I can think of. 
---
In contrast, I miss a hundred things from vanilla/classic in retail WoW. I desperately miss the skill trees. I miss the skill points every level that you have to train. I miss the different spell ranks. I miss training different weapons and that when you first get a new weapon you've never used you have to level that skill. I miss making groups with real people and not a button. I miss the world feeling huge and epic. I miss feeling like getting a green piece of armor or a blue weapon from a super long quest chain is a massive upgrade and totally worth the work to get it.  I miss making a list of all the gear in all the different quests I need to do so I can get ready for heroic dungeons.  I miss that it was really hard to get enough gold to train everything and level professions. I miss that people helped each other and grouped with those around them without using an addon. I miss the challenge of everything. And most of all, I miss that I can't get any work done all day because I am thinking about logging in when I get home.
---
I just got to 60 when TBC came out and for me it’s the most fun I’ve ever had playing this game. People don’t like flying mounts but the rest of it was just amazing.
---
Leave Japan? Possibly seriously, do you run a vpn and it gave you that client due to oyur end point?
---
i heard something about TSM (tradeskill master or something along those lines) working but i’m not too sure if it made it in the game
---
Husband bought it yesterday. Sent this to him 5 seconds ago.
---
ouch, yea mine luckily is only 7am
---
Ok thank you. So I’m level 10 and haven’t gotten skill points yet? Do I have to find my trainer for that? Like skill tree?
---
Same thing, my parents still can't get cable. They can do either dial-up, satellite, or this weird slightly-better-than-dial-up wireless tower thing that is affected by the weather.
---
Woo appalachia
---
&gt;Took all the clothes off and went to undercity level 1. While there a lvl 11 undead male character approached.
---
the rule is half your level plus 7
---
Nop, all my ideas are good for the game.  Bad stuff out good stuff in.
---
That painted a disturbing picture in my mind
---
Each layer is actually the whole world, sharding is done by zone
---
It also incentives just not doing the content.  The gear becomes irrelevant so fast, same with necklace levels.  Like why play when I can wait a few weeks and get this stuff instantly.
---
Ya, that sounds about right. Ran into my first healing mob and it was like dueling a druid.
---
And if those are noise cancelling headphones it doesn't even matter you forgot the gag.
---
What’s wrong with gaming as an adult? I don’t get it. Never played wow but console.
---
I couldn't disagree more.
---
I think I would be up for healing. I was mainly concerned with being useless in my group of friends as druid lol. I think there's some vets in the group
---
Its stitches, he's an abomination. Friendly to horde I think. Pudge is based off of Stitches from wc3 I believe
---
It's been  days since I last slept a full night. Best i'm getting is four hours of sleep. Sometimes none at all. School is going to be a bitch.
---
Oh this is such a good point. As much as I have enjoyed playing expansions, the model they've adopted really doesn't work. I only really played the tbc and wrath expansions, and I remember really loving the new raids, zones, pvp, etc. 
---
But in an rpg world that's as incredibly immersive as Azeroth, the model that they previously used with WC and Diablo of "add another zone with more cool stuff" exemplifies a lack of vision in staying commited to the RP nature, focusing mainly on the Game nature. When they add Act V as the Diablo II expansion, no problem. Another awesome chain of monsters to kill and big bosses! Yeah! I really do love Diablo II. But because playing doesn't really require you to care about how the whole world is pieced together. It's fun action and some exciting/addicting loot system that keeps you playing. 
---
What keeps you playing wow is a much deeper appreciation for the world as a whole, and blizzard sabotages the way the world fits together with the "diablo" expansion model.
---
Yeah they could've made it something a bit more cool like a chariot type thing where it's basically a small horse/kodo drawn cart, or even more campy and gone for something like a rickshaw with the ~~slave~~chauffeur spouting sarcastic 1 liners.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=7800/a-donation-of-runecloth#comments

This should be in the patch so yes.
---
Is this just Code Red rebranded or is the contents different?
---
I just started to remote into my pc from my phone to start the queue early before work finishes.
---
As a player leveling enchanting I try to find paladins with that weapon to lvl enchanting on, such appreciate, much wow.
---
☝🏻 that’s what you do while you’re in queue :)
---
Is this an option?? B net chat is so hard to read sometimes
---
Are Grizzly going for week 1 Rag?
---
i agree that going to work is sad
---
Ah yes, the days of fighting casters without spell reflect and pummel o.o
---
I only remember them in IF and UC originally, so I dont think you're crazy :)
---
because they have the best looking tier set out of everyone
---
I just turned 30 on Friday. I got a better job, been learning front end app development, exercising, cardio and lifting, been showing some muscle mass, learning to cook, 72 lbs lost, and stopped smoking in the last couple years.
---
I aint done shit in the last 3 days but eat pizza and play wow.
---
I saw a guy with the Zergling pet yesterday. You can only get that if your account had the Collector's Edition of Vanilla. I was absolutely blown away.
---
I think as long as Classic or "Classic+" as people want to call it maintains horizontal progression then it'll be fine. Give people more things to do but not "better" things to do I guess is what I'm saying. GW2 does it to an extend, as does ESO - both games I love for this reason. I don't get a lot of time to play and I love that my gear and achievements remain relative no matter how many months I take a break for. I'm playing Classic because I know I basically only have to do the level grind once and then I can play whenever I feel like it.
---
Yeah i'm currently looking for another job so i can play WoW with my friends since i currently only do graveyard shift.
---
It does. The fact that Shaman is Horde only and Paladin is Alliance only changes the dynamic of how you PvP and how you raid. The different racials also change how you approach raiding and PvP. Leveling areas and quests are different. Each faction kinda has their own culture that may vary from server to server as well.
---
No alt tabbing, no waste of bandwidth, can interact directly with streamer.. literally better than twitch in everyway except resolution.
---
Playing Warrior for the first time...so true!
---
Happy Cake Day, stranger
---
now the kid will turn the head to left and... \*opens third eye and sixth sense\*
---
A lot of people prefer it because of the nostalgia. It's the game that we played as kids 15 years ago, again available in the same state, to enjoy again with other people, sharing the experience and the hype. That's a really strong factor.
---
Another factor is, this is the game that became so popular, became a cult basically, it brought so much people to play together, talk about it, live it. And for a reason. It's really a historical gaming phenomenon and one of the best games ever made. People really want to experience that again. And really, it's a darn good game. It's that simple.
---
Mechanically, what draws people/what is different from current WoW:
---
- much less streamlined leveling experience. You're dumped into the world with almost no clues to quests, you have to read the quest texts to complete them, there is no markers on the map
---
- the leveling is much harder, longer, more tedious and engaging that current. It takes time to kill one monster. It is hard to kill two. It's really dangerous to try three, anything can *actually* kill you
---
- more community interaction. Harder leveling forces you to communicate with other players, group up, do elite quests together. Also you need to really talk to people to arrange dungeon party, you have to actually go there, explore where it is, and physically enter the entrance. You don't have "go to the dungeon" button
---
- no flying = more community interaction and world PvP
---
- overall slower combat and everything. All takes time. You slowly crawl through dungeons instead of smashing through quickly. You have to make breaks (and talk to people in between)
---
- more RPG than action arcade. There are a lot of "weird" mechanics that are there for the RP - hunter ammo, pet management, reagents, talent trees, single spec with expensive respec, etc etc. It's more engaging RPG world 
---
Etc etc
---
Which server? I’m on Bigglesworth and that place has been packed pretty much since launch and it started pretty late.
---
I think disappearing thing is from sharding not layers, which doesn't exist in classic.
---
So is farcry an RPG?  It contains all of those elements.
---
IM ONLY 4 LEVELS AWAY FROM ALL THOSE SKILLS? YEEHAW
---
You can’t type right now?  Also those are switches and routers, not servers.  Fucking kids these days.
---
Bonus points if poly is resisted.
---
holy shit inv to group plz
---
It seem like EU servers are much worse than the NA servers right now. Accurate assessment?
---
This thread makes me feel better about myself
---
Yes officer, this post right here.
---
honestly I've only seen people with real life frustrations get addicted to mmorpgs. so you might as well stop worrying about it. at least that's what I did.
---
Lmaoo! She wanted to play the human female. I tried to get her for undead but...that was a no lol. So we both are now human rogues.
---
I'll still pass you up in cheetah mode while you're waiting on cd.
---
💅💅💅
---
This isn't an official race. They'd be lucky to have a blizz tweet saying congrats. Some random basement dweller is probably going to beat them to 60 anyway using similar tactics to stay online. It's no fuckin big deal.
---
Reason for Gold:
---
You know, in this age, people barely help anyone IRL. The most typical excuse is "busy", which is a lot of times bull because sometimes all it takes is 30 minutes to help a friend, not 7 days of work. 
---
More over, even fewer people help people a lot younger than they are, or people a lot older than they are. It's just....gosh...self-obsession.
---
Having the patience, at your age, to help someone who's ten. Man, that is gold - a heart of gold. 
---
Cheers,

HR
---
is your girl hot  show her tittys otherwise can we fuck off withes shit pots of my x bla la lbal la fug reddit is so shit
---
Isn't this what layering is for?
---
I wish my friend would have considered.  We are both 20+ now, and that's not happening.  Though he is stubborn and wouldn't even change before we made characters.
---
Is that a dig for using shorthand?
---
One level above a grammar nazi...
---
That's a great idea. Need to do that on my lunch break.
---
Blocked user.
---
You work to farm money so you can play wow to farm gold.
---
Because I need upvotes.
---
Retail bad, Classic good. Someone gild my comment for making a brave statement!!
---
yea yea yea where does it drop
---
Same. 9 or 10 till midnight and off. My old person back says to not sit that long.
---
Yeah any form of medical training is pretty much hell. But at the end of the day I get to call myself Doctor and cry into my student loan debt.
---
Unfortunately it still takes an hour, but so far I’ve only found it to be a mild inconvenience so far because I do all my auctioning at the end of the night and by then all my items have arrived!
---
Actually Shrek is Dreamworks, not Disney or Pixar.
---
1. You deleted your post because you realized how pathetic you sounded.
---
2. My only emotion was pity. I pity you for thinking that you could convince other people to server transfer through a reddit post which appeared to be written by an adolescent brat.
---
3. I hope the queue has gotten better for you. 
---
Don't worry buddy, everything will be fine. It's just a game.
---
Dam that's really stupid
---
Thanks for being only one to answer my question ! Yeah i would probably be a tank and other benefits you said look nice in enchanting.I do have an alt with leatherworking i can disenchant those items?
---
Not being able to vendor greens will suck but i guess i will have to look to earn money other way ,can enchanting bring some gold later on? Or is it only for rare recepies like Crusader?Love profesions and min maxing so i guess i am picking all side professions like cooking/fishing and first aid!
---
Confirmed that nobody here has actually played retail content and they just level over and over
---
I always hated that. I liked the joy of getting a new piece of good gear but you always had the best gear with the BoAs.
---
Never thought this meme would be relevant again.
---
god damn what other game can have this many people come back and pay 15 dollars to play even though it was made 15 years ago.
---
RP realms are nuts bruh.
---
You also have to feed pets to keep them happy and boars are easy to feed because they'll eat just about anything.
---
An hour I believe.
---
The 1-10 grind for hunter is easily the worst part. After you get pet, it gets exponentially easier, especially if you pick a good species. Highly recommend owls (easiest for night elves, Horde can't really get them easily til 50ish), cats, or wolves.
---
Yea, I think instead if they did like a quasi leveling experience with long quest chains required for new content like dungeon and raids attunement. But with no actual levels gained. 
---
Maybe it rewards you with a talent point after every major chain, and the talent trees get slightly tweaked to accommodate an additional few talent points. Those additional talent points can be seen as progression that is different from the traditional ilvl or lvl increace.
---
Hey man thanks i appreciate it!
---
yeah cuz fuck eu lol
---
It's a video game that got me through the hardest parts of my life when I was 10. Reliving it has been emotional so far. Nostalgia is a bitch I suppose. Everyone is entitled to their levels of joy though, even if you consider it excessive.
---
and he's a beloved tank in Heroes of the Storm now
---
I just wanna get a whiff some some hot night elf dungs
---
Plus just like actually having to go somewhere for a raid. Getting together with the guild or pub or whatever and heading to the raid. Yes... it took time but it also made it feel "real". 
---
Like instead of queuing to kill Onyxia me and 39 of my allies were actually going to her lair to slay her.
---
Oh my god thank you SIR.
---
Azuresong members unite! We are free of queues and apparently people.
---
I think the motto of our realm should be "You're only here because Herod is full" because I saw alot of people say that when leveling in Mulgore.
---
https://youtu.be/CxK_nA2iVXw
---
If I add a friend and set a note for them, can they see it? I’ve been meeting a lot of nice new people and it helps to keep track of how I met them
---
What? We love our lil footballs.
---
It was better back in the day with all of the Mr. T &amp; Chuck Norris facts.
---
Well hello fellow adventurer:)
---
From time to time you will inevitably meet players who know it "bettet" ^_^. This is just the natute of an online game. I assure you most people are not like that and actuasly are friendly. So just keep it up and have fun:)
---
No, it's probably server pop anxiety syndrome. I've got 3 level 10s personally .
---
https://classicwow.live/guides/893/hunter-macros-tips
---
Found this looking today. Seems to be a solid starting point
---
Vanilla balance was a joke. Trust me I played one and the dps is pathetic. Feral is good for leveling and you can tank dungeons or heal. Resto is fun and a decent healer but with a sub par tank you might have trouble where a priest or pally would not. Feral stats Agility&gt;Str&gt;Int&gt;spirit
---
Haha she is 9, im thinking to buy her computer but lets see if my wife let me do it xD
---
It was 4 discs, still took forever because disc drives were awful.
---
Why would you quit gaming entirely..
---
You might have better luck with discord.
---
I read the tool tip yesterday, it says it helps regen health too. Learn something every day.
---
&gt; Blizzard can't possibly need whales to stay profitable.
---
It's not about staying profitable. But rather being *more* profitable.
---
I suspected as much. Oh well, small price to pay for having bag space again :)
---
Oh, tell him to piss off then
---
La...dee...da
---
I got half my run speed so far :D overslept tho :(
---
Try and get yourself banned, no jokes get yourself banned right now or you'll regret getting addicted (again)
---
I agree in that respect. I think it's definitely relevant if you want to be super competitive in PvP, or MinMaxing those DPS meters, but otherwise I think clicking away like your finger has the shakes can keep up with all the content WoW can throw at us!
---
Heirlooms just power creeped the whole game. It made leveling vastly easier but under cut the game zones complete. I enjoyed up to Warlord of D.
---
I did 11 hours yesterday, broke my previous wow marathon record by 2 hours. It's a lot easier when you're an adult.
---
Nice!
---
He needs it for the weapon skill!
---
I do exactly that, rend, hamstring, run away and bandage. After you learn that it gets so much easier.
---
Oh another one of these...must have been 2 hours.
---
im on Thunderfury and have never been queued up, even during peak times
---
It's peak time in eu while NA is still mostly at work
---
[Run away!](https://youtu.be/m8UGWjoffpE?t=3)
---
I couldn't get my partner to play at all, but she did make the comment that there was no way she'd go Horde if she did play. 
---
That's why I'm playing solo lol
---
Yeah this is pretty strictly against terms of service and people doing this are going to eat a ban pretty soon. Would not recommend anyone try this. Scripting is pretty easily detectable.
---
Sword spec when Blizz?
---
See. I took out eons because that is how long it takes to type the rest of the word. 🤷‍♂️
---
I just disagree.
---
The games mechanics cause you to rely on other players and the vast majority of my experiences in TBC, and with Classic twice on Nostalrius and Kronos were overwhelmingly positive.
---
Did shitbirds do shitbird things? Sure but not with the frequency that is in modern WoW.
---
I would say this extends to modern gaming as a whole starting around CoD:MW 2’s launch where the shift in gaming began to cater to the Xbox360 crowd where anonymous, randomized group matching became a thing.
---
I never saw nor raged out at TF or CoD 1 &amp; 2 matches on the servers I played on because I typically played on the same servers with similar people.
---
Once anonymous matchmaking became a thing that small community thing changed.
---
Same thing happened with WoW once LFD and cross server stuff happened.
---
I went from a medium-ish server where I knew most Guilds at end game and I knew it was acquainted with a ton of endgame players on my old server. I played in pleb Kara-guilds to the top progression guild on the server. One my favorite things to do was level an alt and join a casual leveling guild and have new or novice players explain mechanics to me. Meanwhile my main was geared to the teeth with Shadowmourne and top parsing in ICC. Almost all of those experiences were overwhelmingly positive.
---
yeah i thought he was winning
---
On Thalnos we praise the Great Old One, The Great Dreamer,  **Cthulhu.**
---
So did bgs but yea
---
That's a great idea. They add further raids in the same style, staying true to the design of classic. No catch-up, etcs.
---
And now your watch begins
---
This comments hurts. Sorry man, I'm in the same boat and it sucks. I was hoping to at least keep up in the first couple days so we could all do RFC together, but they blasted through that while I was at work and are probably 20+ by now.
---
I rolled a rogue this time around. Can't wait to start Ghanking. Revenge for Vanilla when I would get camped for hours.
---
Hey, if I do the optional quests (the stuff in red) does it throw off the rest of the guide? Some if those quests offer chunks of xo over 1000, seems like a lot of xo with your guide being pretty strict pre30
---
Or you can ignore this post and keep scrolling up? This is will be reported for sure. You internet thugs are something else. You look so immature/toxic posting that. 
---
Delete your account on reddit and never come back.
---
For me the game died when they introduced flying mounts. It killed the world aspect of world of warcraft. But even then the game was tolerable up through wrath. I quit early in cata, but looking at retail now makes me think I made the right choice. Retail is for dumb kids who don't know any better, because it sure as hell isn't for hardcore vanilla players.
---
Damn I didn't realize he's friendly to horde. I was hoping to get his femur for some shenanigans later.
---
I did. Shadowmoon.
---
Not to mention the server downtime. Pretty sure it was down for almost 3 days straight at one point.
---
We’re like 40 there 😫
---
I can believe that, anything to break up the boring visuals and run simulator.
---
just use cone of cold??
---
Yeah I have a 2.5ghz Core i7, 16GB RAM, SSD with the R9 m370 card and it sucks so much ass. Honestly it's around 20fps also. How did my laptop from literally 12 years ago function better than this....I assumed wow would run on a phone these days...
---
So only spells that use manna will need to be replaced on the action bar?  All other spells do it automatically?
---
After classic runs its course Blizzard should just license the creation resources and let people run their own communities without most of the bugs.
---
Also a great point!
---
They're talking about doing a level squish, which would honestly help the flow of leveling significantly. You shouldn't be able to level 20 levels and not earn a _single_ new spell.
---
All my friends are on this server and so is my character.
---
It's been replaced by Keanu Reeves. This is Classic not Vanilla. ;)
---
Some people just have major issues with it regardless. It's the same with how some people can fall asleep in public transit, and others just cannot. I'm the type who can't fall asleep in public transit and have major issues falling asleep after being woken up. However, I'm also the type that sleeps very deep, so I'm rarely bothered by it.
---
Best example is in the past when my mother would come in every 2-3 hours to feed some kittens which we decided to keep in my room, and I wouldn't even wake up unless I already had gotten 6+ hours of sleep.
---
Can confirm. Currently getting 4 hrs of sleep a night when I was trying to get a better sleep schedule. Oh well I'm practicing for when my first child is born in april haha.
---
Edit: autocorrected word
---
\&gt;going on the internet and not expecting memes
---
Oh you will eventually.
---
Because 5 characters are stronger than 1? Loot is essentially multipled by 5 as well.
---
You're still just shitting on the way he wants to play the game.  Give it a rest dude.  Get over yourself.  
---
If someone wants to get to 60 quickly then they are entitled to do that.  People are allowed to play how they want.  Stop trying to force your way of playing down other peoples throats.
---
Undead named Gobbaghoul lmaoo
---
Turned 30 last month. Started working for my business full time.
---
As I said yesterday I never thought I'd be back at 30 with wife agro.
---
I was doing this because I thought tagging their enemies wouldn't guarantee them credit/loot?
---
I've never played WoW so not sure how it works here compared to other games.
---
Just to add to your comment, pulling one extra mob on accident sucks and it doesn't make it more fun dying or almost dying and having nothing to do except auto attack (on my hunter) and one melee spell that has a CD. Can't do anything, no control, at már that doesn't happen in retail when I  have no abilities
---
Of course this is at low level, so maybe at higher levels it will be easier but compensation at low levels will be nice
---
Man I’m also a blacksmith and I just “upgraded” from a green dagger to the green 2h axe you can make for lvl 8. Now you have me second guessing that move. Fortunately I kept the dagger for now because I plan to tank RFC soon.
---
As I said in a comment to another, profits can't increase forever though.  That's the kind of thinking a child has about the world.
---
I have been looking into Project 99. Would recommend that to someone that enjoys this version of wow over the current?
---
&gt;“What have I done...” 
---
Barely started?
---
Stick with it! My main in vanilla was a druid. It's a slow start but hands down one of / if not the most rewarding class. So much versatility and self sufficient at all times.
---
I mean I had a Hunter steal the Emberstone Staff from DM. I mean he equipped it, but still.
---
Oh Mark of the Wild, how I've missed you. 
---
And shame on you Blizzard for removing it, reintroducing the majority of other players buffs...but not mark.
---
theres always exceptions. my memory is hazy on most of the talent trees and their exact things. i just know for pretty much all classes the first tier or two either have a super-doink 5/5 or a bunch of shit you will end up using/it will end up being useful about 1/1000th of your playtime.
---
Exactly.  Retail has crept away from RPG and now resembles an action game with RPG elements.
---
That's the whole point of this thread.
---
I use a ghost form alt, you can't report me bitch.
---
I had an awesome time running SFK and BFD last night. Got the robes and belt from SFK, then won the roll on staff in BFD plus wand from quest! I feel stacked AF running around in like 5 blues haha :D
---
I don't understand how that's not breaking the terms.
---
It's literally having someone else, who has nothing to do with your subscription and character, intervene directly to ensure you don't get logged off.
---
But Blizzard won't do anything because people seem to like these no life motherfuckers for some reason.
---
U literally didn't read what I wrote. I'm not saying the people are different because of the game, people are different because of the 15 years that separates 2004 from 2019. The game is so "solo/ not interactive" because our society is way less interactive, and more "psicologicaly alone" than it were on 2004. Unfortunately that's the truth about our world dude, people on classic are just acting like they used to in 2004 but you can't hide the fact that, 2019 people will change because of that, it is basically a "social emulation". 
---
And, the post was up for response I'm just saying that the dudes story and points isn't really different than anyone's else lol.
---
I dont know about wired connections but 5gold definately better than 4gold
---
Another thing I've noticed is people LFG in trade chat. Do people not know about the LFG channel??
---
So true man “HURR MY GF PLAYS WOW WITH ME HURR” 
---
“The que is 6666 REEEEE”
---
I made a video, help me to report them. as you can see, its a lot of work for a single player...
---
I have seen like 6 different memes today that directly mirror mine and my friends gameplay last night. I love this shit
---
I give mark of the wild, but then I go that extra mile and toss thorns on em
---
Needs more Cruel Barb...
---
You claim there are problems, but I don't see you list any. If you don't like the game, fine, but if you're gonna say it has glaring issues, at least be willing to point them out.
---
Because the Horde are already killing him themselves?
---
Nope, just special effects on level up
---
From https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cwxqov/my_experience_so_far/
---
I have nothing to offer but my love.
---
My very generalized thoughts on the classes:
---
Shaman: Using totems to enhance your character and party in a variety of ways. Can be ranged or melee dps, but healing is their most effective.
---
Paladin: Auto attack things to death while going OOM unless you're healing, then they're good.
---
Druid: Shapeshifting dynamos that are the true hybrid class of Classic. They are the best at adapting on the fly.
---
Priest: Efficient and bipolar. Can melt faces or mend wounds.
---
Warrior: In your face melee that always needs a friend and better gear. Best at getting punched in the face class.
---
Rouge: Sneaky melee with a bag of tricks so they don't get punched in the face.
---
Mage: Glass cannon with a lot of tools to control the fight.
---
Warlock: A demon for every occasion and spells/curses to back them up.
---
Hunter: You already know.
---
But its not mindless questing. I plan my routes as I go, I look at which quests should be done in what order. I plan out which zones to go to and when to go back to town/city.
---
I think if anything, my approach keeps the questing engaging and the pace feels right for me. I'm not advocating that everyone play my way, but the endless posts of "stop and smell the roses" are hilariously inaccurate to how plenty of people prefer to play.
---
You say an "overwhelming majority" as if thats an absolute fact. I would venture to guess that player preferences are far more all over the spectrum. From guys who read every quest, to people who follow a 1-60 speedleveling guide.
---
My point is that people will play the game the way they are naturally inclined. Seems pointless to tell people to do it one way or the other.
---
If only this would happen on Noggenfogger
---
I feel you, I wanted finish one last quest before bed last night and it took me over an hour.  Totally regret it today.
---
A guy saying it's confirmed doesn't mean it's confirmed. That clip doesn't prove anything.
---
Didn't Joker say he doesn't even have a brother...?
---
Jabron, my guy. I logged into this terrible site just for you. 
---
LAYERS DONT INCREASE SERVER CAPACITY
---
they are simply to reduce the amount of people in the starting zones. The max cap of players on each realm will be the exact same even as layers are removed
---
They are basing off video game trends, where there is always a high percentage of players at the start.
---
It will drop for a multitude of reasons after the hype dies down and then again as some players hit end level and do the token "oh that's it" phrase but following that you will see it closer to the base numbers.
---
I would actually say tha having bfa is ok in this aspect as you can do dungeon runs, if you don't want to make alts, whilst the community catches up to the speed runners.
---
Just for reference, the samething happened with eso at the start, so don't worry about it to much.
---
Questie is a must-have and doesn't ruin the experience imo.
---
I was very lucky, someone sold me mine for 15s
---
shitposts like this are in a league of their own. "oh this content I'm seeing isn't up to my specific standards" is pretty much the lowest form of contribution one could make to a community.
---
That's our secret to success, it's all about the networking
---
was your name HeadShot EU by any chance ?
---
MC attune only requires you activate the stone at the raid's interior entrance. Most groups would take a priest or 2 and bubble thru the lava after dropping down next to the fire elemental boss. It's a pretty efficient path that only requires that one boss to be defeated
---
Basically my classic plans are (and have been) as follow:
---
Get home. do chore shit (laundry, make dinner early-sh, dishes, bills, maybe workout, etc). This has actually been sort of nice with a queue, giving me a reason to not just hop on and play immediately.
---
Then, its beer, podcast, and WoW time. I used to do dailies or level alts when wanting to chill out after work, but now I got the eternal grind that is Classic WoW leveling lol.
---
After 2 hours or so, its to bed with some tea or something and reading some history book like the nerd I am or watching some WW1 or WW2 documentary kino to put me to sleep.
---
I played last night tethered on my phone bc my internet went out. When BC came out my brother and I were on a road trip and I played on the road lol.
---
Thanks again!
---
Good thing this game was something I learned was actually boring and unsatisfying
---
Absolutely not. The game play loop still resembles that of the original WoW.  There are differences, such as loot being more of a pinwheel than pure drop chance, but the game still has the same foundation it did back then.
---
just make macros like this:
---
#showtooltip
---
/cancelform
---
/cast Healing Touch
---
Welcome to reddit
---
I've seen it available on course but haven't tried it
---
Or better yet, just keep the same servers and make a classic and a classic BC version.  Seems doable.
---
Serious question... Are paladins still worse than druids? Also, is rek bombing a thing again?
---
So are talents like buffs and spells or just like +10 holy damage? And my trainer gives me spells and stuff. Thank you
---
Yeah thats why playing each of them will help you understand what you actually like more.  It's one thing to know what things do intellectually and differing what you as an individual might like but often times the nuances go unnoticed and unconsidered but that's just my take.  You do you
---
That's hilarious
---
This is what RP servers are for
---
Cataclysm takes a lot of flak for redoing the world but I feel like people forget that it had already been destroyed.
---
Dungeon tuning was completely broken across the board and players were babied through the entire leveling process. Nobody even did questing anymore, they just facerolled 5-mans in heirloom gear. New players would watch the rest of their group steamroll the place while they stumbled through confused, unable to hit anything. XP was so accelerated that you couldn't really follow questlines properly. All of these problems were introduced in Wrath.
---
I appreciate early Cataclysm for bringing us great group content at launch and being willing to try new things, it's just a shame they ultimately doubled down on babying players instead of shoring up the problems they had allowed to fester.
---
Shush
---
40 here. Monday morning my boss talked to me about what a great job I’ve been doing and how he wants to hand pick me for a special team that he’s creating for a new project. In my head all I was thinking was about Classic launching that night.
---
A sub that plays both is a sub lost from a statistic stand point.  Best to obfuscate.
---
That's classicthreatmeter, not details. Me and my gf installed it, but it requires everyone to use it, so it's kinda useless (nobody in our dungeons had it).
---
But nobody seems to care about threat anyway. "Y u min maxing a level 20 dungeon lol"
---
As healer it's been fine so whatevs. I just wish people would stop looking at my mana and saying "healer has plenty of Mana JUST GOOOOO", cuz the moment I actually need to start casting without regening Mana I go oom in like a few casts.
---
ah then sorry for the miscomprehensions. but i still stand my point.
---
I think it should, might have to try an older version. Then the skill on level up should update when you visit the class trainer. The most recent version is based on skills that you learned automatically iirc.
---
Well I hate arena personally. RBGs always felt what the REAL PvP should’ve been but never was. But considering I’m a minority in that opinion then yes arenas would be a good thing. As much as the nochanges group is against literally anything Retail did have some good stuff. Wargames would be a good addition imo
---
the rogue experience is vastly different from retail. you have to actually use your skills to survive or you'll end up on the floor a lot. I've been a rogue main since the original classi/vanilla/whatever and you just learn these things as you go.
---
I like transmogs because then I get to see how creative people can be and look good (or horrifying) at the same time
---
What?
---
This is a solution to the problem for those who are doing it.
---
They are only engaging in this activity because of the long que times.  So blizzard created a problem which is being made worse by the only solution to the problem players have.
---
29 but yep.
---
I think a case could be made for Questie. Most of my friends use it and I think it takes away from Vanilla questing. But I don't care enough to not let people use it.
---
Are you being serious or trolling because a slower weapon is better in almost any situation on a warrior
---
So you want to be miserable? I'm confused.. I hope you're not to offend :P
---
Just had an RFC run as a Warrior tank with a Shaman DPS. The threat the generate starves me of rage. :P
---
Yeah but they are doing this while they are sleeping too. I beleive they all have hotel rooms very close. Can't say I blame them but I'm just throwing that in there.
---
Nope I'm from Shazzrah and ho one killed me
---
Just turned 30 in July, had my first baby in June, have an ongoing renovation of a building I'm turning into my first official business instead of working out of home. All I can think of is how to secretly play wow without my wife making me take care of my 100 other responsibilities while ignoring them myself.
---
You might try putting the /point at the end of the macro
---
Otherwise the buffing or yelling animation will probably cancel it
---
When in Stormwind...
---
Man I just don’t care
---
Thisnright here. People acting like you HAVE to go axe. I think the mace is the coolest
---
I've played for 13 years, am a major dedicated altaholic. Have only played alliance once, as in a single time, and that was a human rogue on Nostalrius. I got Core Hound Tooth and Perdition in the same MC run, literally the day before they shut down those servers.
---
I took it as a major sign, never again xD
---
Considering that you need to train your pet's skills, that you have to feed them and keep them happy or they'd just run away forever, 3 is a fairly good number. would not imagine how it'd feel to have to keep care of more of them
---
It’s only been three whole days.  
---
Wait until the honor system, wait until people are raiding and actively gearing, wait until they’re ready for raid bosses and rare Hunter pets, and farming end game mats. You’ll see vanilla was just as toxic as retail because it’s designed to exploit the same feeling of greed and obsessive progression as retail.
---
This is me. The other day a mage gave me food/water and I felt bad I couldn't give anything in return other than my thanks. I ran into them again later and crafted them a robe that was an upgrade. I love this community!
---
When in Ratchet...
---
Well it's better than selling 6 slot bags for 10s
---
Baby due in three months.
---
Rennovating our apartment.
---
My SO doesnt know the main reason I just bought a new laptop is to be able to run WoW.
---
To get the full nostalgia back I’d have to start smoking weed 24/7 again, which I’m not going to, although ironically it’s now completely legal.
---
Just started radiation therapy school, I wasnt supposed to get accepted until next year. I'm fucked
---
Hope your life gets better! 
---
P.s. Jokerd is whack. So many. Better streams to watch.
---
You are the one who was whining about people "running into a wall" to avoid getting afk kicked. When auto-running does not avoid the afk tag. Not someone who is actively pressing buttons within the allotted time window.
---
So damn funny and true
---
True!
---
It is elvui, a compleate revamp o finterface.
---
Kk let’s have a discussion about multi boxing and automated auction houses before we talk about kicking my level 30 so you can not pick a new server, like you should of already with you level 6 still stuck in Duotar with your precious 2 hours to play a night. 
---
Reroll like you should of already done.
---
Rellian Greenspyre : Okay I need you to get me mossy tumors from the Timberlings by Lake ....
---
NoAstonomer : Yeah yeah. Timberlings. Lake. I know it. BRB.
---
Five hours later.
---
NoAstronomer : I wonder if he was talking about a different lake &lt;checks quest log&gt;. Sonofabitch.
---
It’s also a mid level 20s quest. There are far better wands that you can get from questing before that
---
Just completed this quest! It's such a good blue item as well, I missed getting excited so much for blues and even good greens to drop.
---
Only 2 EU servers were without a queue an hour ago, a RP and a PVP server. If things don't get better fast even that PVP server will have queues, it's fucking insane.
---
The shortest queue I found was 30minutes which is manageable but it's going to be hell during the weekend.
---
AFKers have made it so bad that a 10k+ queue is at least a 7 hour wait if not more (the estimate is always between 600-700 minutes but waiting it through isn't really 10 hours although waiting for 8 or 10 makes almost no difference)
---
I've been in a 3.5k queue for over 3 hours now and it still says over 120 minutes with over 600 left. I rerolled 3 times already and i cba anymore, I'll just enjoy it when queues go away.
---
I guess you're feeling generous today.
---
How long was the queue
---
"One of us, one of us, one of us..."
---
Thanks mate
---
The entire thing is formulaic. It's a great joke but no one should believe it.
---
Do you use Google remote desktop? I didn't experience this queue problem before using that.
---
I envy you, I wish everything were new :(
---
But im having the time of my life :D
---
That's a keeper
---
only if you plan on raiding  or doing pvp/ranking. otherwise ur warrior will stink at 60. if so, get good at tanking as thatll help u gather ur preraid bis for fury or tanking with ease. ur in very high demand at 60 for those dungeons to the point where u can reserve the gear that you need.
---
This would be easy if my wife plays game.
---
Is it hard on your computer to be leaving it on for 5+ hours a day for queue? I'm starting to get worried waiting in these queues is gonna destroy my pc lol
---
Congrats!
---
For me it was Odo's Ley Staff!
---
yea tho not all full servers got the same queue
---
u can check and see
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Hmm ok I'll have to check after work. The 1st time 1g cost can hopefully be covered within the next day or two, and I'll gladly pay that to calm my OCD about it!
---
70 mins. Just got in 2 min ago
---
For many people, that's a waste of 15+ hours played time or more.
---
Half the playerbase still means pretty substantial queues.
---
I waited until 14/15 and then went to Westfall. Picked up the 3 DM quests in Stormwind and there's one or two more in Westfall. One of those is a chain. Did that and another mob grinding chain to hit 16 and started doing DM then. Mostly did DM until 20, quested to 21, and will probably try to do a bit more DM before moving on.
---
Usually they offer free transfers from the high pop servers to the lower ones. I believe this will happen once layering is removed because if people are complaining about queues now, just wait until there can only be like 5k max on a server. There will be 100k queues on some servers and people will be begging to transfer. That should balance out the servers a lot more.
---
Might be what happens now N’Zoth is awake
---
Oh my god this is so accurate. Wow is the last thing I should be doing and have played 12 hours in 2 days. Help me.
---
Whatever you think looks cool. It really doesn't matter. You can always reroll. Play a class until level 20 and see if you like it so far, if not, try another class. That's how most new players approached it back in the day. Just in general: stop overthinking and just have fun
---
Tbh I understand the logic of the other posters telling you to wait, but right now things are very cheap. 
---
I fully geared out my lvl 12 mage for under 20s and made some HUGE improvements. I’m talking going from a 13 armor chest piece to a 26 armor chest piece with +2 spirit and +2 intelligence for 4s.
---
If you can find crazy deals like that, I think you should by all means get it. It will likely be better than the stuff you get from questing the next couple of levels as well. 
---
Plus leveling is slow in classic, so you won’t outlevel it quickly.
---
That moment as a Druid when you get your Bearform and go out tearin shit up....... :)
---
Not at the moment no
---
Full heirlooms, xp pots, linear questing and zones, mounts, minimap markers and such.
---
Ok maybe I exaggerated a bit, and my comparison should have been 0-110 since that is accelerated and 110-120 is still current. But the gist of my comment still stands. And BfA is still bad.
---
That'll go away quickly. Once you get your blueberry tanking for you and life drain you'll be unkillable. And then add health and soul stone on top and Lock is one of the best at staying alive while leveling.
---
Thanks. I am having the wife log me in when she gets home. True love right there.
---
Sounds like a great time to me.
---
how did it tf? theres no titanforging in classic
---
I've  been in the queue since 15:40. It's 20:21 now and I'm at 6156 WTF!
---
Not less, equally important. By doing this, you're saying you're more important than literally everybody in the queue.
---
Second that. Or both at same time: mad meming in Q.

bro? They correlate the description of the post discusses the situation as if the testimonial is true stated by method and runs off that with the broader question of "is sharing with your family against tos or not?" all of a post should fall under a title in some way or another. My Post does, and im unsure why you're trying so fucking hard to see it another way when I've stated 3 times already that its not the way you're seeing things.
---
I saw a guy running away from three murlocs about to die. I went in and killed them even though I got nothing out of it.
---
i saw someone doing it for 25c on my server last night. One of my guildies unashamedly paid him and then shared them with us.
---
Surprises are wonderful, aren’t they?
---
Mostly because paladins and druids both had interesting jack-of-all-trades styles, but were forced to specialize. It put them in a position where feral/boomkin/retribution/protection were not viable, but they still ended up as second-class healers most of the time.
---
just stopping by to say this comment is criminally underrated
---
Sorry I didn't include "most" I assumed it was implied was talking about players as a whole and not specifically you. My words are true though, so I am allowed to extrapolate on the entirety of the playerbase as a whole. Most players have not sunk enough time into their specific characters in these 2 days to make it unreasonable to choose a different server by now.  
---
You aren't specifically the reason queues remain so large. The playerbase at large is partially at fault. I'm not sure why you took any of this so personally.
---
Man that gave me ideas. Like if the next expansion forces you to travel to the other side of the globe to a new pair of continents. The people there know nothing of Kalimdor or Eastern Kingdoms because they have their own problems in their very harsh and unforgiving environments. To them you are no hero, just some nobody grunt that popped up one day. The enemies there are far different from those in present day Azeroth, requiring proficient weapons skills and stats long forgotten by our heroes. The Mages of Dalaran have no presence there, so advancements found in Azeroth like “Dungeon/Raid Finder” simply don’t exist, and the Mages do not have the reach to teleport you with their magic to the various dungeons of these newly discovered continents. Factions exist between Quel’dorei that escaped from the Eastern Kingdoms during the Third War, and Night Elves that had managed to create a successful World Tree. The Night Elves of the new continent has been planning to reach out to their Alliance allied brethren, but The Alliance finds them first. The Quel’dorei hate the Night Elves, their own ancestors, for their allegiances with the very same faction that killed so many of their own. (With already existing races being used, no more new race option bloat) Throughout your adventure you find a major Gnome capital, and a Goblin one as well, both with a network of zeppelins and trams connecting them to various locations across the map. The Horde and Alliance interests are simply expanding, and your objective is to recruit by helping the people of these continents, which in turn gets you wrapped up in their dangerous affairs.
---
Just some off the top of my head ideas, with some excuses to revert as much of retail as possible to something more similar to a classic experience.
---
No but there shouldn't be so much whining about it. The rule is meant to stop botting, these people aren't botting. Stop being upset that they have a dude running around pressing spacebar every 20 min.

Wow was different back then, mmos were different back then. Just because people want it back doesn’t mean it’s going to be an actual long term success. Don’t get me wrong I’m having a blast playing it, but in 6 months the majority of people won’t be logging in daily and playing a game for hours with very little return. Once the nostalgia and community feel of the game wears off the majority of the newcomers and bfa players will get sick of it.

congrats on gaming at the next level. 😊  I was jealous because I tried to get my wife to play but she doesn't like Warcraft.  HOWEVER, she loves FFXIV so we play that together.  at least our significant others are playing an mmo with us. /salute
---
Yes kind of, but after waiting in line for two day 9+ hours (meaning i don't get to play at all any day after work with these queues) i'm seriously contemplating logging in before i go to work and then macro so i don't get logged off just so that i can actually plat the damn game when i get home. Right now my subscription is running and i'm getting 0 time played. If they had offered free transfers then it wouldn't be a problem since i could level on another server and then transfer when things normalize themselves a bit in a few weeks.
---
If you need a reddit reminder to take a break from a video game,you are too late to save.

That quote is the same as asking what kind of game people want.

This is about what kind of a wow people want, which is akin to asking what kind of a car people want.

Tip: install chrome remote desktop, you can join queue and watch it on your phone. If you're really desperate you can probably even play that way.
---
I used to tri-spec my warlock fairly often in classic and TBC. Trying different builds to either maximize my fire damage or shadow for pvp. I could sacrifice my imp, use soul fire and if it crit one shot a tank druid. Nothing better than having options and playing around with builds was just pure fun.
---
I actually met my husband in vanilla WoW.   He is the one that goes to sleep early.  We've come a long way from his High Warlord grind haha!

For sure. More of a party/griefing buff ;)

I got 4 hours of sleep last after my crew rerolled on another server to avoid the que and I overslept through all my alarms this morning only barely making to work. I downed a small can of pringles and a monster for the jolt and haven't struggled keeping my eyes open yet thankfully.
---
...and I'm 100% gonna do it again tonight.
---
Rushed, heart pounding mornings are back on the menu boys.
---
I’ve heard people complaining about the running, and it made me think that’s a bit of what’s good about Classic in a nutshell. Yes running around is a hassle at first, but that’s part of what make you appreciate when you get better movement options like more flight paths, mounts, and teleports.
---
I have to dedust my trusty laptop tonight :D
---
&gt;Honestly I would reroll on a newer realm
---
We have 35 EU servers almost all of them are full a few are high.
---
Stitches is a event upon finishing a pretty decent quest line in duskwood.  Not really a horde zone.
---
Funny i find this post right after reading this... https://www.docwirenews.com/docwire-pick/home-page-picks/socialmedia-stressandaddiction/
---
I like this post. I have a friend that has played retail for years and likes to tell us what we can’t do. He keeps saying our group of level 13-14 people can’t do the first low level dungeon and we should wait until all 5 of us are 15.
---
Just really glad I don't have kids. Kinda wishing we hadn't bought a house though...that downtown condo life looks really appealing at a time like this.
---
Again... just goto another server. That’s the whole reason why they keep adding servers, to try and even it all out. I had several servers picked to start on and none of them ended up working out, so I went to another server. It’s your choice to stay in a 500+ minute queue or go play on one that has a 30 min or less.
---
And you're sitting on /new and defending them. PAYING customers are VERY much allowed to bitch and whine as much as they want about a product that is literally unusable, in this sense, unplayable. Every EU server is high/full and there's a long fucking queue on each and every one of them, but whining isn't allowed eh? 
---
You are a fucking idiot.
---
He's right, you know
---
Despite being from South Korea, my wife has never been a gamer (it's hard to have time to game when you're working 12 hour days). When she last spent any significant amount of time gaming, it was playing Sonic the Hedgehog on the Genesis. I got her to start playing this with me. When she logged on yesterday and saw the rain, she was amazed how much detail was spent to make the world feel real.
---
I have to go on my fucking honeymoon in a week. Considering cancelling the honeymoon
---
I missed out on the initial fun before all the extra expansions and such.. Being able to start fresh with everyone has been a beautiful curse on my social life 🤘

This guy has levitate but shows the route. Basically just swim along the coast and when you get to that spot where it says dun morogh, drown yourself, then battle rez in the graveyard and you're in the dwarf zone.

Same for me, but once it got down to 1000 then it was time to buckle down and sit through the numbers dropping.
---
That animal is stressed the f out, and yes it's very sad to watch.
---
The main thing for priest when questing solo is getting wand specialization and keeping your wands up to date. The Lesser Magic Wand is an 11 dps wand a lvl 5. That’s massive. A Greater Magic Wand is 17 dps at level 13, also massive. Then another big upgrade from a quest in BFD (almost 30dps before wand spec iirc).
---
This helps with your longevity when soloing. Great dps (actually beats our many spells at lower levels, and higher levels pending pushback), and lets you regen mana between mobs to reduce down time. It also lets you do reasonable dps in groups without risking you blowing mana and letting others die.
---
Haha, thanks for the tip!
---
Just began my senior year of high school, scored remarkably well on my ACT in July and was working 50 hours a week this summer after I had a great junior year. Was applying to colleges the week before Classic came out and got admitted to the 3 I applied to last week.
---
This school year starts, Classic WoW is released. I literally am staying up until 2am to get through the queues and play. Just hit level 10 last night and I’m playing with a couple of friends who are in college. I swear this game is going to be the end of our academic careers. We’re all very intelligent people, sadly this game gages the interest of intelligent people remarkably well. 😂
---
Not really at all.  Just get in and start leveling and enjoy the game.
---
Ok here are the rules:
---
1) Buy her the mount asap, or she will mount someone for it.
---
2) Do not talk about the mount.
---
3) Kiss all your RL friends goodbye.
---
Fucking hell this sub cries about everything... I hit spacebar while making dinner...fuck sitting in a 4 hours queue to get back in. 
---
Why does everybody think vanilla was this utopia of warm fuzzys and getalongganging.. lol queuing for mobs? giving a shit about others in queue? Give me a break
---
Got my first yesterday too, cape from WC! Blues, greens, whites, and grey all on at once
---
Priest here checkin in Fairbanks 👌🏽
---
You can delete the items in the chest as well, that way you can keep your items :)
---
I can't wait until I can walk around horde starting areas giving out doomguards to all the children
---
I'm looking forward to trying this out!  Last MMO I played serious was runescape before EOC came out so I'm ready to get back into it haha
---
Kite him to sentinel hill.
---
This is my normal amount of sleep it is really possible
---
Warrior here.  Using "Charge" to assist someone with a mob.
---
This sub always has to bitch and whine about something. Just play the waiting game in queue while other people are actually playing the game.
---
Amazing point
---
I would say your on the right path to success. The 's' key is near worthless so you can still switch that to some more keybinds.
---
If you havent (which I assume you have) you can add additional action bars across your entire bottom and even vertically on the side. My go to keys are s, f, g, z, x, and t. That's the potential of 18 different keybindings when you use shift and ctrl along with those. I honestly cant see a warrior needing much more than that with 1-6 and shift 1-6 included.
---
It's especially good for warriors for aoe tanking.
---
I played Tuesday evening and pretty much all day yesterday and got to 15. Back to work today. Dinner tonight and 2-3 hours again tonight.
---
I'm not going to argue with someone who is clearly fuming and doesnt understand the difference between evidence and speculation.
---
Turned 40 this year.  Although I only play casually, it is pretty hardcore all the things I've done over the years to fit MMOs into my family/work/personal/friend schedule.
---
No such thing as too old to play.
---
Let me know when you find out buddy. My wife is not happy about WoW coming back. Definitely not happy I make her log me on when she gets home to start the que.
---
Some blessed soul made me 3 bags with his own linen in Goldshire, LVL 9 and didn't come across a single bag or pouch from looting somehow
---
Kirtonos is chill and has lots of horde
---
No but bad players arent doing m+10 keys or mythic raiding which was the original point.
---
Everything outside of those 2 activities and high end pvp is so fucking safe its ridiculous.
---
The only half exception to this is heroic raids but even those only have the grand requirement of actually doing the tactics.
---
Sexy lingerie would likely make him happy, I mean it usually makes any guy happy...
---
Yup, that's why I'm a lonely gnome mage in Darkshore/Ashenvale while my guild and everyone else is having fun leveling past me in Dead Mines and Southshore. At level 60 though, I'll be glad I don't have to work for rep anymore and I can just make money.
---
What does vanilla mean?
---
and any other terms/slang I should know about?
---
Like I said, I'm fairly new and only played a bit of BFA (level 33 is my highest character).
---
I'll go ahead and call you 'Ludo' henceforth.
---
Trainer gives new spells and abilities, sometimes they will give you class-specific quests for you to complete as well. Your talent free can be seen by pressing N, and you can allocate one point to whichever specialization you choose once every level, once you hit level 10
---
I didn't either but gave into the hype and played last night. It's ridiculously fun. Current wow is great, I'm not giving it up, but it definitely lost something along the way. At any rate, classic is definitely a refreshing change of pace.
---
Joana is slow. These kids playing right now are going to smash his record anyway.
---
If they can run at least 1 server it won’t be canceled, since it would cost less to run than profits
---
Sounds like some noob bitches that still want to play easy mode.
---
I mean im on the #nochanges train just because I think if we had any group of people deciding what goes in and what goes out eventually itll turn back into bfa. But I hear ya. I'd say the third party addons could take care of it that way people could opt in/opt out.
---
Lol I thought you meant he was level 45 at launch, I was like, how? Lol
---
Don't do it nearly as much anymore since the fecker costs like 1/4 of my mana bar to cast -.-
---
Not erectile dysfunction lol.
---
What kind of skeleton fingers do you have, I can't reach any button beyond 6. I doubt most people can. Unless you use your mouse-hand for 6-0 which would be terrible
---
Yeah and people actually stay in the group until everybody has finished their quest before they disband.
---
I'm out of the loop.  Why is everyone so hyped for Classic WoW?  Isn't it just WoW but without most of the content and quality of life changes that were made over the years?  Or am I missing something?
---
I love how you went from "he has no cam and only sometimes talks" to fullblown he's cheating and sharing account with his brother. Not bashing leshraque who LITERALLY went to bed then woke up 6 levels higher, but flaming the dude who since he doesn't have a cam and is taking sleep breaks. 
---
Same as the other dudes posting the clip of him(out of context) obviously joking with his mates in discord about his brother playing while he's sleeping even after he said multiple times he has no brother or anything.
---
He's doing well, for sure. He's done FAR better/faster runs on private servers(/played time-wise) with sleep and for the last month he's been trying to train his body to prepare for this run. Why not just give him some credit instead of trying to downplay him while silently cheering for some other "legit" person.
---
Not only was the queue about as long as yesterday when I got home from work this evening (EU), but it's also moving legit two times slower than yesterday. They claimed they made an "substantial" increase in the server capacity, and logically that would also mean more people continuously logging out as there are more people online at the same time. But nope. Queue is slow *shit*. 
---
Obviously it's not blizzards fault that people aren't logging out, but I doubt their claim about the substantial capacity increase.
---
some guys need em extra thicccc
---
28 is ridiculously high level
---
I'm thinking doing Darkshore til 14-15, hitting Westfall for some quests and Deadmines, and then traveling back to Kalimdor for Ashenvale and Black Fathom Deeps.
---
I guess I'm asking mostly to see what others are doing, but also because I always felt in vanilla that Darkshore &amp; Ashenvale were nearly deserted relative to other similar level zones. Shame because Ashenvale is so beautiful.
---
Compared to retail? Yeah it's night and day. Retail is just mashing the 1-2 button for 3 seconds and then the mob is dead. You don't care about health or Mana and you never use a rotation because they die to fast.
---
5G posted speeds of around 1,000 mpbs in LA &amp; NY. Might want to look at those results first.
---
Ouch, I like totally need a hookup like that (I have zero payment options, no CC and living in China so I can't use any of the online payment services available to me). At least I can vouch for just how damn happy this charitable fellow has made someone.
---
ill never understand people putting a bright LED-filled case right next to their fucking displays
---
i get it, you like dem argeebees, but fucking hell, its terrible to put such a distracting light next to something you're supposed to be looking at for hours on end
---
Addons
---
Gotta get that 5/5 Improved Arcane Missiles, son.
---
Lmfao I fuckin hate that guy!! He has the craziest path too. I’ll see him coming and be like “ok ok let me get out of his way.” I’ll see him run by and think I’m good and start fighting the next mob just for him to run up behind me...
---
ah yes, the "which DM is the real DM" debate
---
&gt; Full heirlooms, xp pots, linear questing and zones, mounts, minimap markers and such.
---
Doesn't matter. You posted this thread around 21 hours after launch. The world record for a speedrun on a monk isn't even that fast.
---
Great now I can really stress test my new laptop 😂 🔥
---
Yeah, I've seen a couple of people complaining they keep dying when they pull 3 or more mobs like they do in retail. Honestly, that's why I'm playing classic, you gotta be aware and engaged!
---
That's our plan actually! We are Just waiting for him to get hos new iMac. I don't have a computer to play on yet, so I will use his old one once it gets here.
---
First thing I said when I read what Demon Skin does was "can I give it to other players?"  
---
But no :(
---
What UI addon is that?
---
Best to flee this subreddit then :(
---
Never heard the first hit is free?
---
That isn't always an option.
---
I don't bitch about jaywalking until the jaywalkers are rude assholes who create traffic for cars on the road. That's what you're doing.
---
Can you send me the link to where you downloaded the classic version from? I've downloaded it twice from there website, it says it's for classic but it doesn't populate ingame. No option in the Menu when I press esc, nothing.
---
i think there is in the options. enable floating text and then theres a bunch of subsets of floating text u can check off.
---
For the hundredth time. If you were on an original vanilla server you called it VC because the quest was to kill Van Cleef. Source : US - lightnings blade
---
Back then WoW was revolutionary just because you could *actually solo a mob*. WoW has always been a casual MMO.
---
evidence coincides with speculation you fucking dumb rat.
---
Read this article, it tells you what some of the most useful adding are and how to install them, cheers!

---
Don't need to.
---
Dude, wait until you can make Soft Soled Linen Boots in a few levels. Your first green crafted boot and they are awesome.
---
If you're interested in being a tank, warrior is pretty much your only option.
---
The comment I was looking for.
---
5/5 characters wearing shoulders. level 15 my ass
---
Not Gehenas that's for sure, been in que 17h total during these past 3 days. Playtime? not even a second...
---
Eh I like them, retail is about endgame with constant stream of content, they've abandonded the early stuff long ago, only fixing it up here and there to keep it functional (Might change with level squish), this thing makes it easier to get to the endgame, it's not perfect but it works. Plus it's not like you can't just not use them, when I was doing my lore alt, I just didn't use it to immerse myself, worked great.
---
I've been digging on Westfall. Good community, queue times have not been terrible.
---
Don't bet on raiding, unless you can come as a.last minute(better low dps than no dps) replacement. As such don't bet on getting a lot of loot either(better a player wearing it, than it gettin DEed).
---
I'm sorry, but if you can't (not won't) put in the time, you're shit out of luck.
---
until you need a quest mob and everyone is uncivilized. RIP
---
Haha, doesn't help when he Just wants to play classic
---
Warlocks have the easier leveling experience when you learn to utilize your pet and resources well. Make sure you get a wand ASAP. Enchanters are generally selling the level 5 wand they can make for relatively cheap.  Like paladins, warlocks also save a ton of money in getting their level 40 mount for free (all I paid back in OG vanilla for my mount was 5 silver for a flight path to Booty Bay so I could take the boat to Ratchet) and the extreme discount on their level 60 mount in exchange for having to do a tough quest. You also save a ton of money by not having the massive repair bills of mail (and later plate) armor.
---
Warlocks also have really sweet and flavorful class quests, like getting to fight El Pollo Grande, the Black Chicken of Death.

https://www.wowhead.com/news=294748/classic-wow-server-queue-times-us-oc
---
Only 4 servers have queues today and only Herod &amp; Faerlina are above 5000, FWIW.
---
I just hope WoW classic is successful, and like oldschool runescape overtakes modern WoW in player count. Then 343 Industries will have all the proof it needs that it should go back to classic Halo
---
Just got a refurb off Newegg for $150 for classic. 500g, 8g ram and an i5 3.3ghz processor. The graphics are whatever stock intel 3300, but it’s more than enough for classic.
---
/spit
---
I have seen tons pf people running into a wall inside inns just to not get que.
---
They keep someone else from playing just so they dont have to stand in line when they get home.
---
I’m saying do away with third party options and opt in or out. It’s like opting in or out of playing classic vs bfa. But if you’re on the no changes train. I don’t see that API should allow the existence of these addons in the first place. That changes the game.
---
What kind of bourbon does your 10yr old brother like?
---
Your post is so incredible sad. You are a grown man and yet you are treated like a teenager. You don´t wanna hear the advice I wanna give you
---
I never made it to 60 in Vanilla (I was an 8th grader in the age before Youtube), but I played a LOT of low level Deadmines, and nobody ever called it VC. Nobody below lvl 50 in original launch had any reason to know wtf Dire Maul was, and had no incentive to differentiate the two.
---
I'm leveling a druid and a mage and I'm not sure what I should stay with. I'm not even sure why I like them so much, but I'm quite sure I want to play one of these above all other classes.
---
With both of them I have some fears about the late game. For mage I fear overpopulation a bit, but mostly the fact that there isn't one spec that's good at everything (I might be wrong about that because I haven't played mage in vanilla but that's what I've heard) so I'll be paying a lot of fees; say I do some AoE grinding to make gold, then later that night some AQ, and then some PvP to finish, that will be 100g of spec changes and another 50 for the next day.
---
Perhaps I'm overestimating how bad this is (You don't necessarily need to always be in the perfect spec for everything perhaps, if you're not a top-tier raider or PvPer, I don't know when it's just sub-optimal and when it's really nonviable to the point where people will kick you from raids).
---
Druid with HotW spec seems nicely consistent - consistently shit. I like being able to do everything, and when I play with a tight-knit groups and/or real life friends, I even like just being there to support others. But especially after leveling (I think I should be able to play feral just fine at 20-60 for the most part) I don't think I'll enjoy PvP on my druid nor do I think I'd like to be a resto druid as basically everything that I do.
---
Of course these classes differ enormously (balance being possibly the worst druid spec you could almost say they're each other's complement) and I would actually love to just play both but I feel like I should focus on one so I can keep up with my friends rather than always being either too low level/gear to join or being the worst guy in the group who's getting carried.
---
Players only know what experience they want, not how to get there.
---
Have an 8 month old baby, full-time job, lovely wife, busy life. This hit hard. Took a holiday to play Classic, but just can't keep up juggling all the responsibilities. I guess I'm a casual now :)
---
This might be a bit crude, but I bet ya he'd love some head while he plays js lol
---
And if you feel any signs of carpal tunnel syndrome (tingling in your fingers, a dull pain in your wrist and up your arm, etc) do something about it immediately. I developed it last spring during my exam period. Just from typing a *lot*. It's a nightmare to get rid of now, and it really is pretty awful
---
Who tf calls people by their names? Usually people just call it by class
---
"yo mage, make a table"
---
Is setting a custom fan to glance your spacebar witha bundle of zipties as it spins considered botting?
---
I'm saying you should just convince her to play with you. Why wouldn't she let you play?
---
Specs aren't really important until late game, so if you *can* heal, you can be a healer even in a dps spec.
---
Fucking same.. got salaried at the turn of August. Super pumped to get such a big jump, but damn am I missing classic WoW right about now
---
My girlfriend just doesn't understand by any means. Been telling her for months it was coming  out so there might be like a week or 3 or 4 days where I need out and binge "yeah yeah that's cool".
---
Now it's out I just dont get to play. Long day at work, come home and god forbid wanna play past 10am "go to sleep, work in the morning, this games taking over your life" "fine lose your relationship over this stupid game". 
---
Yep, just like being 6 again, it sucks... oh yeah, work sucks to, I wanna quit... vent over boys
---
Looks like jokerd just went to sleep, at about 52.7. Making things really interesting.
---
Dang dude, relax.  I'm not mad about it at all and you just exploded.  Stand up for a bit, do some stretching and grab a drink.  It's nothing to get this worked up about.
---
8k queue is the price i pay for going to the gym, fml
---
Sounds like leather working is what shamans want for armour, but rest assured it's never too late to change. especially at level 60, its pretty damn easy to go back and re-level a new profession.
---
If you keep gouging it it will not leash, you can kite it to other zones at that point.  OP is saying after the initial gouge it follows him further than expected without a subsequent gouge.
---
No worries :)
---
I'm playing a warlock, and I was feeling so left out not being able to give good buffs to passersby. So, I ended up finding a macro that will auto-trade a healthstone to my target. So whenever someone buffs me, they get a healthstone! :)
---
Sure, it takes some farming for the soulshards, but I like to think it could save their life if they end up in a sticky situation!
---
P99 is a strange beast with the raid rules .  Game is dope til 60 but becomes hard to raid after that.  Was a 90 percent attendance raider on A 24 hour schedule for 3 years on p99 during classic and kunark and it was a struggle.  The TLPs have a lot of modern conveniences like instanced raiding and the origin skill and a tradeskill ui which takes a lot of tedium out.  Having done both I much prefer the endgame on the TLPs.
---
Give it two months
---
Yeah fuck Gary for taking care of you so your dad could be a man child.
---
Is there a good equipment list per level to go by?
---
Play a warrior and go alch or befriend one
---
It's what you'll spam alongside hearthstone whenever you get ganked in the wilds.
---
You got that free mage water my dude. Screw the wand.
---
You aren't wearing the right lingerie then :D
---
The default attack is melee. You have to press auto shot.
---
I use a macro:
---
/Pet attack
---
/Dash
---
/Charge
---
/Dive
---
/Cast Auto shot
---
Im on my phone so cant remember if it is completly right, but you get the giest.
---
Gl mate.
---
Dam, now I feel stupid.
---
Please god let me get into a debilitating accident so I don't have to work and I can play Classic.
---
Who is they? I don't follow streamer drama and I wasn't aware of any of this. You say it like there was some official announcement, but I don't think there was.
---
I never even saw those back in the day. Nice.
---
gatekeeping mmorpgs with addon choice lol
---
also everyone looked at thotbot or allakhazam back in the day
---
I know their stance, but it's a jaded and shit stance considering anyone not having a monetary interest would call it automation. There's a reason multi boxing is banned on pservers where there is no monetary gain for their GMs. 
---
If all you can source is their very conflicted interest in multi boxing then you can't argue the actual definition of automation, which like I said this falls into. It's clearly automation but Blizzard doesn't care because it makes them more money and inflates their sub numbers
---
I am. Aren't you more important to yourself as well?
---
Rightclick auto attack is melee, you need the ranged auto on the bar
---
Well I am in the same boat. I never got her to sign on per say. Just have to play like a casual which is fine. 
---
** I do a lot more around the house and more with the kid to butter her up before logging in at night. And don’t make it an every night thing*
---
Because those were there since Warcraft II and part of the established lore and world building, as well as explained and usually confined to certain areas where they make sense. Similarly, it wouldn't make sense for Night Elves to be using magic for example. They shoe-horned it somewhat into the lore in one of the expensions but thats the point: it was explained and even there its obvious they tried to justify a gameplay change in lore to keep consistency even if they did it hastily.
---
If you don't understand context or coherence in how it was built, I can't do much for you.
---
Nice! I love it! How the heck do you get a wand at level 5? You can't even learn professions till 10 I though? I can look that up really.
---
You'll do fine! Just remind the group that you're learning, and to give you a few sunders before DPSing. That will help you keep threat.
---
You have to use the actual autoshoot ability or use a ranger ability to enable autoshoot.
---
Bless your heart
---
Okkk duuuuude...
---
Whatever makes you feel better, but no, blizzard won't ban anyone, not even your most hated streamer.
---
says the person bitching about jaywalking with a fucking disseration. fuck right off with that projection. replies disabled.
---
Baine and Saurfang are trash so I wouldve promptly ganked them
---
And I thought Nathanos was Sylvanas fanboy #1? Or did that change?
---
I wanna know too
---
19879 person infront of you in queue in Gehenna.  
---
4+h queues (today at 18:30)
---
Same here mained feral dps, pretty sure it wasn't all that impressive just a couple different colors.
---
I heard somewhere it was just a beta thing
---
Hahaha just got my college GPA where I wanted and everything. Oh well! For the alliance
---
Wow.... I was making a joke.
---
But you must be Gary, I assume.....
---
Found Rolo.
---
I run out of mana during fights all the time 😅
---
Bezos is totally the trade prince.
---
I meant *Shaman, the horde counter equivalent of the alliance's paladin. Woops!
---
You can't just give up on the world............ Of warcraft!
---
if you care about this and think it is a problem you are miserable
---
yeah i spent yesterday playing and woke up with a back sore from my posture.
---
Have yet to have that problem, just don’t stand close enough to melee or use melee ability.
---
Me and my buddies just played 9 hours straight. Extremely relatable is a good way of putting it
---
Never had less than 2 hrs there, but usually it's 6+ hrs.  Is it horde dominated?  The people with instant queues could be Alliance?
---
That's not Chuck Norris...
---
For the horde!!
---
Could always try mining + blacksmithing and make your own upgrades.
---
Now kiss
---
Fuck i came here to battle, not feel
---
Sorry for your loss friend.

Druids can tank dungeons lvling up just fine (and heal and dps) and they have a way easier time than warriors playing solo. If you don't want to play a tank, then healer is the second most requested, again druids can heal, so can paladin/shaman and priests. If you don't want to heal or tank, then warlocks is the most useful pure DPS class for a group (god bless warlocks and their summons)
---
Why would they give you a free transfer? There are realms without queue you can join. They literally told everyone multiple times to spread tfo
---
As someone who works in the industry I have sympathy for them and agree with their approach to maintain the community. I don't like queues either but I understand this is how it has to be.
---
Preferably the other faction, but the same one is fine.
---
Fatigueman the new hero to save us from fun
---
If you choose to continue, I would focus on not specifically tanking, but focus on being efficient in killing mobs with little downtime. 
---
Tanking will come, you are low level. Warriors are hardest to level and their is a reason for that, but if you want to keep playing it they also have one of the best if not the best end game in both PvE/PvP
---
This is one of the BEST and ONLY arguments I've heard in almost 15 years for it to not be DM
---
I'm also sad I can't make a horde pally =(
---
Bartender can look like that?
---
Okay thanks for everything!
---
This, so much this.
---
Maybe, maybe. We haven't seen enough of their actions since classic started.
---
Blood fury is substantial in addition to the axe specialization, but if playing Tauren makes you more excited to play the game, they have abilities and passives that still make it a great choice!
---
I have perl, I always used xperl on pservers. I can't get it to show numeric, maybe I should try zperl
---
From Orgrimmar to Razor Hill

And back again, and yet he still

Gives you sacks, which you'll fill

With things to make you proud

Have no linen, still he might   Impostors sneak in, in the night

But you know who's really right

"Choose Bag Man", shout it loud

He's kind and fair, a charity  
---
For one and all, it's clear to see

He's there, for you, he's here for me

"It's Bag Man", cheers the crowd!

They call it World of WarCRACK for a reason

---
Shhhhhhhhhhhh
---
Some people's attitudes to WoW is pretty weird. My ex would absolutely not allow be to play. When I asked her why her only answer was that it's pathetic. When I explained that it was just something I relaxed with in the evenings when I had no other plans, she said I should watch TV instead. So, sitting there by myself staring at a TV screen is OK, but staring at a PC screen while communicating and playing with my good friends was completely unacceptable.
---
In the end I just played without telling her.
---
I love classic
---
My advice: Don't look too much into the future, or you'll be paralyzed by "what ifs".
---
If playing Classic for a month sounds fun for you, and if that fun is worth the sub fee for you - why not do it? You will get what you paid for.
---
I'm not spending a fish oil on unending breath for some rando who's gonna die to the next razortusk that looks dirty st him. No way.
---
Yes, you are correct, I see that, but I think the point still stands, what will the queue's be like at phase two, single layer or not, that is the make or break question.
---
Those scorpids down in southern Barrens. The ones around the nests that you have to dig through. Those things are super tanky and then they start shooting out a bunch of other mobs to melt you.
---
Classic isn't like that. Since you don't sit in a city and spam LFD you'll see people out in the world through the entirety of classic. People will be leveling alts or farming profession mats.
---
While I disagree with you on this, I still stand in solidarity with my fellow mate willing to throw away all other hopes and dreams to conquer Azeroth.
---
The queue actually moved 1k in 30min. Yay.
---
Don‘t make me switch to horde! I don‘t like those orcish stuff but undead zones are soooo beautiful!
---
Wait this isnt a FFA game?
---
There was Zperl, which I've used on vanilla p servers, but i haven't found it for classic yet.... hopefully soon.
---
I decided to at least level up in BfA while I waited for classic cause why not. Obviously didn't have a flying mount yet and it was definitely still meh. Dungeon finder, I think for me was that pivotal thing that killed the game. But also the culmination and focus on transmog/pets/mounts/whatever other collectibles coupled with the loss of actual RPG elements like weapon skills and low level progression that actually matters.
---
Nah Wait is a little bitch
---
I was planning on going with this thing I found [online](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/55000135030215--0523031100501).
---
Oh i'm not shitting on blizzard, those games just don't appeal to me. I prefer the paradox style grand strategies to the RTS style stuff, and I don't play shooters. Lots of companies make great products that just don't capture my imagination, that's all!
---
Restart battle.net, got the same and got an error code while tryibg to log into my realm.
---
It made retail feel like a private server
---
I submit
---
You can if you choose a normal server. :)
---
I’m just hoping power stays up and I get an extra day off work to grind (Tampa here)
---
The reason mountain voltage is the only soda I drink to day....
---
If you click ALT + F4 it will force quit your WoW.  This force quit makes the game think you disconnected, so you will have your grace period.  If you log out normally the game will not give you a grace period because it thinks your intention was to log out for good.
---
Imagine still having a queue lol. Myzrael was fine all day yesterday.
---
That’s fucking lame.
---
Meeney rings a bell, Terrorz definitely does. I'll look into the discord. Thanks!
---
New servers + nbn + big rain over Sydney would definitely contribute. The technology is lacking and the infrastructure is subpar. The nbn techs do half the job a lot of the time and leave ends poorly terminated in nodes and pits and stuff. We’re so far behind in fibre technology lmao
---
I can see how Worgen DKs are bad from what little I remember about the,, but please explain it to me. You have a fantastic way of compiling this and it's been a few years. I haven't really played WoW since WotLK (and, of course, I'm now playing again in classic).
---
"Will you try this thing I'm really excited and passionate about with me for at least a month, It would make me very happy if you just gave it a try?"
---
Why is communication seemingly lost on so many couples?
---
I hope you're right. The one good thing about streamers is them mobilizing people for world pvp.
---
So many animals in Silverpine don’t have the body parts requested. 
---
I probably spent 45min-1hr on each of the ‘recipe’ quest... and that was without drinking between pills often or much competition.
---
Naw that was later. There are some add ons that show you on the map tho so you can know where to look
---
Undead or Troll Mage?
---
Mostly raids will take at least a couple druids (resto spec).  Their innvervate, battle rez, and HoTs are valuable.
---
Me lol
---
You know, calling something "crap" is not exactly constructive. I can't take any information out of this.
---
Yes you're missing something. When WoW came out it was a phenomenon. It became the most popular MMORPG ever made and people flocked to it because it was beautiful and fun and vibrant. In order to keep those people interested and attract new people, the developers regularly made small tweaks and improvements and every 2 years or so released a new expansions that completely changed the game. The things that made the game what it was were slowly eliminated and replaced with shiny new gadgets that sucked the life out of the game.
---
Now, 15 years after it was first released, the original version of the game has been released in a format that is nearly identical to the game as it first existed.  It has not been available in this format in 13 years.  And it is a genuinely fantastic game nostalgia aside. It's completely different from what it eventually became, so much so that it is really a different stand alone game.
---
It was fine when the daily quests felt optional.  Maybe you get a new mount or whatever.  Now a days the game is centered around making sure you do your daily/weekly checklist and that's not fun.  
---
It was cool when you just got rewards.  Now it's "earn 1000 points of random currency".
---
Yeah watching Cata start to gut all the systems from Wotlk..."pruning" they called it.  It was a sad sight. I dropped sub very quickly after Firelands and didn't return until the end of Legion (friend roped me into it).
---
God damn it feels good to be home.
---
Druids got stealth and better mobility though - really killer for both opening and escaping wpvp
---
Do you think Blizzard will allow a free server transfer ? With all the stuggle we had to play to the most populated servers, a friend decided to go on another server.
---
I've done both. You're being ridiculous, and I'm not saying for just me. I'm saying for all of the people who have payed for a service that they are intermittently receiving. Literally NO other type of software company would refuse to refund you for not receiving a service that you've paid for due to a problem on their end.
---
I was there on alliance side and as someone who never played vanilla before it was extremely new and cool experience, [here are some screenshots.](https://imgur.com/gallery/WAX0xKU) You can say what you will about streamers, but its partially thanks to people like them (Nixxiom in this case) that awesome things like this can happen.
---
No there is not. It works only for yourself, not for other targets (i.e allies). It is only doable via addons.
---
Guaranteed op is a retail baby based off his need for instant gratification.
---
so you're just assuming that everyone on this subreddit only cares about something when it's brought up in a meme or something? what a trash reaction to people showing empathy to an animal. fuck you.
---
Just like... BC?
---
I rolled through Durotar as a level 11 druid to get the Orgrimmar flight path and stopped in Razor Hill to buff the lowbies. I was a celebrity. General chat started advertising that there was a druid in Razor Hill giving out MotW. I felt so loved.
---
I'm in a similar boat.  My friend that I met and played with in vanilla passed away a couple of months ago so I made a tauren shaman (his main) with his name in his honor.
---
Your WoW folder -&gt; _classic_ -&gt; WTF
---
They don’t want to do it because people asked for no changes so that’s what we’re getting. They have the ability now to make more servers or not based on how they feel the population will be in the coming months. Once you get free transfers it’s a shit show as to populations over the coming month. The queue times have been cut down drastically since yesterday and it will continue to go down until they don’t exist in a couple weeks. That’s a guarentee once people hit 20 and realize the grind isn’t for them.
---
I'm so sad I know this reference...
---
Thanks for letting me know
---
Sounds to me like you aren't even playing Classic if you think this is a valid option.
---
I'm not on bigglesworth. My server isn't getting queues like that and since they changed server caps I noticed they now show Full for most servers so they are more accurately reflected now.
---
Not a solo player either, our entire group moved to a less populated server. What I’m trying to say is, there’s options if you would like to play during one of the biggest mmo releases.
---
I love it
---
I remember my first beer.
---
So, there were never any good paladin tanks in OG vanilla (sorry to hurt everyone's ego that's reading this and thought they were good, but it's the truth).
---
The reason for this is simple: paladins are mana-based.  They NEED to have mp5 on their gear at higher levels in order to keep using their abilities. They also NEED their tank stats, and to be able to reach the Defense cap. The only option they have for this at end game is a blue set from end-game dungeons.
---
They also have no way to pull from range. They can't use any ranged weapons, and Prot pallies never got a ranged attack until the Burning Crusade pre-patch bringing Avenger's Shield. They also don't get a Taunt. They might the ability to produce extra threat, but they do not get a real Taunt. Those things are super important as a tank.
---
That said, if you're just running 5-mans, then they do get Consecration which is pretty nice for keeping mobs on you assuming your players will respect the limitations of protection pally and focus the same target you're attacking, since you can't save Taunt a mob from them to save their life.

---
I use 1-4. and then Shift + 1-3.  I have a few other key bindings for Shift + Q, R, F, Tab and \~
---
I will more than likely expand this and add Shift + T, G, and V.  It totally depends on whether or not the characters on the keyboard are already bound to another action.  I will have to review the default key bindings to add more stuff
---
I am playing alliance since 2005 and I didn't know that, fml
---
Thanks for all the feedback everyone! I really appreciate you helping out a newcomer. It looks like I will try to see how the warrior does as I level up and I may try a druid on an alternate playthrough to test it out!
---
And, besides, now you know how rifle should sound, huh?
---
Brilliant
---
Druids good bois
---
The bag that was promised.
---
Might be a few days late on this one
---
Dude that's amazing.
---
Gratz.
---
That's probably your best bet as I'm sure much of the healing raid gear will be decent PvP gear and you can pick up random pieces here and there.
---
I'm on the phone to my internet provider every day atm since last week, until the NBN fix my drop out issues. I've not been able to play wow classic unless i tether internet from my phone, I drop out every 20 minutes or so. This honestly feels criminal to me, I'm paying for internet, I'm not getting it.
---
Who's on First?
---
Well it also helps that WC's 5 quests are like half a level themselves as well.
---
Oh right, cause of that bug that kept killing people. Funny how things work out like that.
---
Someone else was doing the same thing on Rattlegore, I am forever grateful for people like you.
---
No, this is actually the "Fuck this company, im paying this shit for 13 years, they had all data available too predict the number of people and yet they fucked up by releasing a shitty number of servers and taking too long to see that"
---
Fuck me dude, fuck me.
---
Yes. Any serious tank in OG Vanilla was a Warrior. Druids and paladins lacked the gear and toolkit for doing the job.
---
Thanks!!!!
---
I’m really sorry for your loss. I hope Classic brings back good memories of your friend for you.
---
He claims he played Vanilla, as I did, and the more he talks about it the more I realize he's quoting videos about Vanilla and never actually played it.
---
First time through I spent hours just killing kodo in Desolace because I liked their combat animations and the way they died, and I got to skin them. :)
---
&gt;easiest 
---
&gt;launch a brand new MMO
---
I've never built any game. But everything I've ever known is that MMOs take more money to make than other genres. If blizzard is comfortably pulling in millions of subscribers with WoW, they aren't going to splinter that on a gamble. If they can take current wow and classic wow and combine it somehow into a quality MMO, that would be significantly less work than starting a new MMO project.
---
Not to be a negative Nancy, but it hasn't even been a week yet. Oh sure everything is Donuts and Blowjobs right now (same in 2005 launch), but remember there are certain realities that have yet to rear it's ugly head.
---
 EG: Guild politics (is a biggie), End game redundancy, and Multi raid wipes on a work/ school night (Hello 3am).
---
It's still first day at school-tell me what it's like 6 months from now. Actually I already know. It will turn "toxic." As soon as the 12-15 years old males show up-goodbye General Chat-Hello mass muting.
---
 Savour these few opening weeks while you can.
---
My only grind is to 40. I really just need a mount to make the walking easier, especially while leveling herbalism. Otherwise - no rush to move fast at all. It’s so freeing.
---
He can slap mine too
---
especially* Now I will be shamed down forever.
---
It’s close but not the same, they were sold simultaneously
---
Lol, scratch that, sounds like balance in classic will be awful :(
---
I’d be surprised if they don’t eventually release BC since that was a solid expansion that most players loved. 
---
If they decide not to, I’d be fine with it if they added some elements of BC since it made a lot of hybrid classes in classic viable. 
---
Would also love it if they released Kara as a level 60 raid.
---
I forget can you make arrows in engineering as well? Or only bullets
---
I think people are just laughing at themselves as they try to play casually as an adult while remembering how utterly addicted they were, without trying to go back there.
---
People calling for bans are ridiculous. Blizzard fucked up by allowing people to setup their entire guild before launch day, making the idea of moving everyone to a lower pop server out of the question.
---
We are a group of 8 that bailed on Fairbanks a couple days ago. Rolled on Bene shortly after it opened because we just want to play. We are sticking here now. Played through Tirisfal and Mulgore the last few days. Very populated and good experience so far.
---
It got up to high the last few evenings and I bet if they didn't increase server capacity it might have queued last night.
---
No you can have a lot of fun with different things. Some start cooking or fishing, others raid enemy capital cities, others want to get all the recipes for their professions. There just is not a common goal for everybody anymore. You have to set your own goals.
---
im playing on a 2015 macbook air, except on 1024 resolution, otherwise my fogers get burnt from the heat, literally.
---
truly classic experience
---
Still using my greater at lvl 22.  Going to run deadmines tonight, but im sure there will be a warlock or mage that needs on it if it does drop lol
---
If that fails, im getting closer to the duskwood wand.
---
For real, scale your UI better
---
Undead pvp, Troll pve
---
People that like the new lore probably like McDonalds and bad anime
---
This is amazing. Did you guys rent the cabin?
---
I'm glad most people (like yourself) don't know about the power of shadowguard, otherwise troll shadow priest would be the most played combo.
---
Its just where I started, we all agreed to go there, but i was the only one who logged in an hour before launch. We all assumed the queues would get better the next day. But instead teusday was so bad they couldn't go anywhere. On wednsday they finally decided a server. And they dont blame me for not restarting. They already knew I was gonna out level em. Now I just can't go back and help them for a little while. 
---
The transfers will be unlocked soon enough.
---
Good job on the spreadsheet.
---
I'm about to leave work in a hour at 1,300 left in que. I'll see if I can beat you
---
No. Short and simple. No. Those of us who played 15 years ago, are in our 30s. Careers, kids, marriages, responsibilities. They do not get to take that from us. I use a click and a screen change alert, it texts me when it goes from Q to character select. And when I'm in if I need to handle my life, clicker goes on. I get it, you're saying everyone is important. But for many of us, our families are more important than you. Sorry. I won't wait 3 hours a night, when I should be enjoying my family, to make sure I'm in the queue and if I get in- sorry family game night is over. It's infuriating that they would demand this of us 15 years later. 
---
So no, you're beat and it's their fault not mine. I will play my hour or two a night, when I CAN play. Not when they tell me I can. Don't like it, make it free and then demands like yours can be made.
---
Oh my fuck, give it to me. I NEEDS IT
---
I’m pretty much completely new to WoW. I played to like lvl 20 back in 2009 but never got into it. So far I’ve got a lvl 9 human rogue and a lvl 6 night elf priest on two different realms because of queue times :(. It’s been great fun though even if I’m lost half the time.
---
Sorry in advance I’m pretty clueless and every YouTube video just goes way over my head.
---
Are rouge and priest a good class for someone new?
---
What roles and abilities should I be working towards?
---
What professions would you recommend?
---
Where are the best places to level? I can’t figure out 
---
where I’m supposed to be half the time and there seems to be very little direction.
---
Are there any good addons you’d recommend for a newbie?
---
I love both RS and Wow, but DUH, I mean come on! They got their big old school release, now it's wows turn.
---
Looks at warlocks with disapproval.
---
Ugh I want to meet Brains now
---
Mining and skinning is a good combo, now if you had mining and herb I might let you know it's not a good idea, but you would have figured that out pretty quick when you try to track both.
---
Gathermate was the addon causing me this issue try this first.
---
Have fun old fart living the past.
---
That's only in retail
---
Get questie. It does its job.
---
Not for AFKing though.
---
WoWHead has good guides for every class and quest.
---
For underpopulated and faction imbalanced servers...not even remotely the same things that are happening now... terrible argument.
---
All Nick's are equal in the light of Elune
---
Clearly an account sharing situation.  BAN HIM!  /s  
---
Cuuuuuuuute!
---
There is no irony you're just mad.
---
It's helping me, for sure. I just like the ease of leveling cooking, here. Even if I take forever to do it.
---
Wreck havoc as elemental in pvp and pug dungeons as a healer in the same spec! Shamans are awesome!  
---
Sure, some guilds won't invite you for raids unless you're specced as resto, but honestly who cares.. I sincerely believe that there will be lots of guilds that won't be min-maxing like that and take you along anyway, if that's what you want.  
---
If you're having fun playing your Shaman, I wouldn't worry too much &lt;3
---
Da real mvp
---
Because every group was great back in vanilla. Tanks never over pulled, no one every broke sheep or sap...
---
when a bear parries your hit, but you need lvl6 and 1 silver to parry anything
---
Shield with 3 orbs, each with a 33% bonus from spellpower (so 100% overall) with no cooldown and with a chance to proc blackout. Once you get some gear, people straight up kill themselves on your shield. Each orb will do 500+ damage. I still have nightmares fighting a troll sp as a human rogue. You do more damage to yourself, than to him.
---
Unfortunately working construction being exhausted is a real bummer so I've been keeping my 6 hours of sleep this week. But I took Friday off and with labor day Monday I'm going to no life to the extreme this 4 day weekend I got
---
It's going to be the golden era of frustration. Sounds great on paper. Just you wait my sweet summer child.
---
Wrong, it's hard not difficult.
---
With classic weakauras, could you not make one to check if you are buffed by battle shout? If you don’t have it, you can have it set to make a giant obnoxious image in the middle of your screen to remind you?
---
People who call it VC are the same people that jump on the wheel to fight Captain Greenskin. Stop trying so hard
---
Because nothing say mentally well adjusted like calling other people "normies"
---
You're right, want a PC with a new 2080ti? I'm going to go get a new one right now!
---
a horde player did summon it but i killed him right after he did, i meant i didnt have a friend play on horde to do the quest
---
Played vanilla-bfa. Its always been DM for me man. There was always those 10 people that swear its VC tho.
---
My son knew this as the "bad guy game" for ever.  When he was 2 or so he'd sit on my lap as I was leveling in stranglethorne vale making the trolls take naps for hitting me.
---
It was just a year or so ago that he realized it was warcraft after I came back for a bit of legion when I quit shortly after cataclysm.
---
The struggle is real. I've died a few times from this so far.
---
I was actually thinking of the NPC. I had a bear dodge 3 attacks in a row earlier which inspired this.
---
Get out of here

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cx5mto/tell_us_how_you_really_feel_strong_language/). 
---
In 2019?! People not leaving room for nuance?! Lol. Yeah I hear what you're saying about ownership, I just am so happy that blizzard realized there are people who think that bfa was a mistake, and I'm sure that bfa truly was them trying their hardest. They heard the outcry and instead of trying to figure out where it went wrong they just gave us what we said we wanted. It is a beautiful act of humility, and that's why I dont expect them to add any other quality of life features. So long story short, I'd you're having trouble as a newbie or veteran alike I advocate for addons like questie haha.
---
Deluded too.
---
&gt; Are rouge and priest a good class for someone new?
---
Some classes are harder than others but everyone should be able to pretty much play everything. I would say rogue probably works very well for a new player; priest should work well in groups, I'm not sure what your experience will be solo. (You will definitely be able to do it but it might just a bit slow).
---
&gt; What professions would you recommend?
---
To minmax you probably want skinning while leveling for the gold. In general it kinda depends on what you're rolling and what you want. There's some really good stuff for a priest in tailoring; engineering is incredibly useful in PvP; enchanting and alchemy can make decent money, etc. But in any case it's probably a good idea to pick up first aid for self-heal.
---
&gt; Are there any good addons you’d recommend for a newbie?
---
Definitely try the game without it (you may appreciate the immersion), but Questie is an incredibly useful addon that can tell you where your quest objectives are.
---
Is diablo mobile a real thing? Never heard of it!
---
I noticed a difference on my full server (Mankrik). My queue time was hours long Tuesday night but only 20 mins long Wednesday night.
---
I hope Blizzard pays attention to these forums because all this feed back reads like a case study in game design and what happens when you streamline things too much. Classic WoW is clunkier, less balanced, and has less content than retail yet *despite* all that most people prefer the Classic. The reasons that I keep hearing is that there's actual challenge, players feel like enjoy getting green loot in Classic more than they do purple loot in Retail because in Classic it actually makes them feel like they've accomplished something, and there's an actual sense of community.
---
You should go for [Engineering](https://wowclassic.pro/professions/engineering/) and [Herbalism](https://wowclassic.pro/professions/herbalism/) at max level. Don't worry about leveling Engineering while leveling to be honest. Takes too many mats / time. Better to focus on leveling and catch up at 60.
---
yep that's an option thought of that too but I can't have my computer working while at work :/ unfortunately
---
I'm just glad they decided to keep the subscription a normal price, and not give a reduced option for just classic. I have no desire to play modern wow, but 40 man naxx is still the most fun I've ever had in a game. Would be fun to relive that, but at the same time I've already paid for it and experienced it once, makes it easier to pass on.
---
Updoots for you my jolly good sir redditor!
---
Lol good one dad!
---
I know you are.
---
You're correct. I know it's a 3rd party program, and is a bannable offense.
---
I just want to know if anyone else using Autohotkey (because i know others do too) have been hit with a ban. Autohotkey is difficult to detect, because it doesn't modify game files and it's not a bot program. 
---
I'm sure it's a long shot from "being safe to use" but I wanna know if anyone using it has been hit with the ban hammer yet.
---
To be fair, maybe the reason they are so arrogant about player feedback is they realized how shortsighted it may be
---
Vanilla bad classic good
---
yeah swarms of people ruining lines for quest mobs and people waiting for me to pull mob so they can sneak in complete quest without helping and leaving me to die
---

Back in Vanilla as a bored 60, I used to walk PUGs across Scarlet Monastery for a couple hours daily. It was a blast helping people out but the fact they thought I was basically Superman was pretty cool. Good times.
---
You’re simply wrong buddy.
---
Neither! I've been jumping in the water for 84 years!
---
Not a keyboard turner but I am a masochist, you might be on to something!
---
Bet he won’t slap my ass tho

jokes on you, there's someone for everyone
---
... but *I want them* :(
---
I got 2 in a Row from Boars in Troll starting zone and I said "This is my main".
---
1 Bag Level 2 peasants walkin around me. They're NOTHING and theyre never gunna be nothin
---
So basically, I shouldn't use gouge to evade mobs?
---
There was a recent study that disproved this to some extent. Basically if you make at least 60-75k/year more money doesn't make you happier but up to that point it does.

My brother and I saved the empty bottles until we were forced to toss them... neither of us drink soda anymore but damn those bottles are so nostalgic I can literally taste it.
---
Yeah I still don't like it, but it's completely reasonable.
---
Biggest issue atm are queue times. I suggest whatever realm has the least amount of people... Especially if you're just casually playing, having an IRL friend to level with will help too...
---
Good luck, your first boss awaits (Queue Time)
---
There was lol. Tipsout, sodapoppin, esfand. Literally every streamer came together and announced on Twitter what server they'd go to, and it was all over this subreddit when the announcement came out.
---
Healthstone Auto-Trade Macro:
---
    /run if not TradeFrame:IsShown()then for b=0,4 do for s=1,GetContainerNumSlots(b)do local l=GetContainerItemLink(b,s)if l and l:find("Healthstone")then PickupContainerItem(b,s)DropItemOnUnit("target")return end end end end
---
    /run AcceptTrade()
---
That's what I found on the Blizzard forums here: [https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/5730073928](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/5730073928)
---
You have to press it, then wait a second for the trade window to open and for the healthstone to get put in the trade window, then press it again and it will accept the trade for you as well. Seems to work really well! Just can't spam it.
---
I also have a macro I press before that, to quickly notify someone that I want to make a trade:
---
    /wait
---
    /run SendChatMessage("Hey, "..UnitName"target".."! I have something for you!")
---
That'll say the following when pressed:
---
&gt;\[/wait emote\]  
---
&gt;Hey, \[Name\]! I have something for you!
---
Of course, you can change that to something else if you want. :)
---
I do love to buff. 
---
However if someone just says “buff me” without a please then it’s rank 1 for you my friend.
---
It will use highest available as far as I remember, if you want to use different ranks you specify with (rank 1) etc
---
Example, I pulled from another forum. 
---
/cast Heroic Strike will cast the highest rank Heroic Strike, whereas /cast Heroic Strike (Rank 3) will cast Rank 3.
---
Best guess I can give is that you either call it VC or DM depending on the server you played on in Vanilla. My server was Uldum-US and we called it VC on alliance. I even confirmed that with a few buddies that played back then, none of us had heard it called DM until now.
---
Just play the damn game. Why do you need to be told how? You’ll become a better player if you don’t waste money on a guide. Also wowhead is free
---
Agree 100%!
---
Even had the elite mob &amp; friend chase my warrior down to 1 hp! :-D
---
I’m a human mage so I wouldn’t know locations to get what you need and stuff. But I would recommend Enchanting and Tailoring. While questing you’re going to be gathering a huge amount of cloth so you might as well put it to good use! I was able to upgrade so many things for my mage and with all the cloth going around it’s quite easy to rank up. Enchanting is great too because now you can buff that gear you’re making as well as make wands which are tough to come across. Also, if you’re more of a gold-maker you can make and sell and get tips for enchanting like crazy. Now if you combine all of that with teaming up with a guildie to make greens for you to disenchant and make gear for people you’ll rank up quite fast. Hope you enjoy your classic experience !
---
Yeah I just used it for the first time last night starting an Orc Warrior. You need guidelime downloaded and then the actual "guide" version as well. I got the Horde one on curseforge.com.
---
When you load into your character just pick the part of the guide you want to start on. I think my first one was 1-12 or something. 
---
Overall I was really impressed. One little thing though, your next destination is the arrow on the mini map not the "1". It shows on your minimap future steps but the one you are supposed to do next is the arrow.
---
2019 people still dont know how to take screenshots... smdh
---
Word. ty.
---
If you don’t want to play rogue, Nelf is handy too!
---
I'm just confused by how so many people can argue against their own interests for no gain.
---
Haven't been in this situation in over 10+ years so its hard to recall, but North of the Barrens sounds about right.
---
And this isn't retail so you actually might see the same player twice.
---
 ... but *I want them* :(
---
Layering has slowly been decreasing as the players move on from the starting zones so that might be why. Queues are to be expected and they are doing their best to reduce the times which they have done. 
---
It sucks that I couldn't roll on a server with some of my Pserver friends due to the queue but I am enjoying my time playing.
---
What professions should I take with a human paladin? I started out as mining/blacksmith and just banking the ores. I see many are planning to go engineering, but I don't fully understand the benefits of it to a healer
---
It’s already too late!!
---
Personally, I only do dungeons for quests and the occasional gear upgrade.
---
I’m not 100% sure if I’m comprehending the question but...drag your spell to the action bar?
---
I would personally say that you are free to choose any of the professions as a mage. Tailoring works well with PvE activities because the set bonus from the crafted ZG items only works if you have tailoring. 
---
Engineering works wonders for PvP and PvE, but it's usually a money sink, so it depends on what you are looking for in a profession.
---
Almost like that tho
---
Except there's a HUGE line of dads waiting to do this so now you gotta wait until yours can get to your home, every now and then you get a text sayin "Your dad is in position 13523 in tue queue. Estimated time of arrival is 600 or 5 minutes"
---
But when he get's home all that fun stuff happens
---
&gt; I won't say that the addition of more enrage mechanics and instant kills didn't impact player interaction. However there are a lot of things that have made it worse. The fact that most classes are good at "everything" is a major factor and the only major distinction is who is the "best" at Tanking, healing, or DPS. In classic you need different classes to do different things so even if they aren't the best DPS you still bring them because they are needed.
---
Absolutely not disagreeing with that. Classic was just a better MMORPG. 
---
But disagreeing with every other part. We were shit back then. All of us. And the mechanics were a joke. 
---
And yes, we saw Naxx, cleared AQ40 and so on. And we were no geniuses or godlike players. 
---
&gt;  but 5 man scholo pre-nerf with no raid gear was harder than most M+ today. But for funzies you can try doing the T0.5 full set pre-raid gear and see how hard that is.
---
Not my experience. It was easier with 5 people than with 10. Seriously, we wiped more often with 10 people than with 5. Do we even get T0.5 in Classic?
---
Wait your an undead mage? Dude aoe grind, gg
---
WoW token.
---
Medium servers had queues. Did that get changed with the server size increase?
---
Can’t you make it so people can breath underwater? Also people like healthstones :)
---
Look in the mirror you nancy boy.
---
I have herb and mining. Switching for engineering near endgame and give an alt those professions
---
(Stonetoss is a fascist and his work shouldn’t be put on display)
---
I made one as well. I was a Rogue main throughout vanilla-wotlk. I'm enjoying playing a shaman. The burst is a lot of fun. In PVP you'll melt people occasionally as ele or enh. As PVE you'll definitely be resto.
---
You'll want to learn about downranking spells when it comes time to raid. It's the only thing that'll keep you from going oom quick.
---
Deadmines is your friend.
---
Dude...I have been using the crap out of this. Thank you so much!
---
Stonetalon or hillebrad.
---
IDK about others, but warriors are my top target for buffs; I will go out of my way or chase down a warrior just to drop Fort on them because I know leveling a warrior can be rough sometimes.
---
gona have to say its a pretty good tie between those two, except Classic is like an old friend you havent seen in a long time so naturally you are going to spend  more time with him at least for the first while!
---
What keyboard is that? Im looking for wireless myself
---
yeah the "CLASSIC" experience :)
---
Can you give steps on how to make it work?
---
5 year mage vet yet suggests to use pet freeze. Which expansion are you a vet in bc it surely isn’t vanilla.
---
&gt; Once the leveling experience becomes the norm it might not be quite as thrilling.
---
Leveling is the norm, and when it isn't the norm I'd bet all the same there will be people willing to help out lowbies more than ever.  Gear will be easy to come by, there will be power levelling and higher level players around to quickly help that might be running through.   People aren't on flying mounts anymore, you have to remember, so they are still connected to the world.  I remember WoW at least, until flying, being very inclusive everywhere for everybody.   The one negative is that there will be more griefing on PvP servers but that's half the battle because until retail, you'll actually see those players again if they are playing the game, it may light a fire for you to get to their level and get revenge.  There' s a lot more there than you're giving credit.

How are your controls setup? I just get the generic gamepad which doesn't work for wasd.
---
Haha, I get so little sleep, 2 kids under 3, so not sure that's a great idea.
---
nice try hello kitty online adventure ceo
---
Might be relatable....maybe...for like...my friend and stuff.
---
Thanks for saying this, I needed to hear it. I gotta know where my priorities lay...
---
i agree with that, limited RP space as it is, i believe most of us on there is from AD (well the ones i have come across)
---
Darkshore?
---
I honestly dont think BGs are worth their effect on wpvp. And it turns honor ranks into a lame grind
---
If you will play a healer, its use is less beneficial, but still better for blackout procs, than devouring plague imo. A long cd dot with low scaling that needs to be combined with inner focus because of its ridiculous mana cost.
---
Yeah when i waited 2 hrs in Q to log in and see at least 40 people AFK in the crossroads i was pissed. like ffs here i am sitting there like a pleb waiting and people are afk just chillen for an hours.
---
Shhhh it's ok
---
Your love is all that's needed /hug
---
Bag Man! UhhAhhhhhhAHHHHHHHHHHH!
---
I have house guests that are coming into town Friday evening and leaving Monday evening. No game time for me. 😭
---
This is kind of a big issue tbh. All my friends are split between two servers because of q times. Once the dust settles blizz better open up transfers, I don’t care if it’s paid even.
---
Look at you with your 4 gold.
---
If you can’t handle the queue go to a lower pop realm. The realm community isn’t that strong, its only 3 days into launch. The launch has been pretty smooth. People act like it’s blizzards fault people want to only play on 1 server
---
It's just becoming so hard to out jerk the main subs tho
---
Subscription
---
Blizzard is dropping the ball all over this release.  We all see that.
---
You’d think shareholders would take the idiots trying to ruin this into the boardroom and fire them, but that’d be asking too much.
---
This is not true. I’ve logged out intentionally multiple times and logged back in to no queue.
---
100% this.
---
Now its in my head
---
get it out
---
GET IT OUT!!!!
---
Same on Herod, although theoretically the queue should move faster since there are more people online so more people potentially logging off.  It could also theoretically move slower if more and more people are resorting to keyboard macros or other shenanigans to keep themselves from AFKing out.
---
Hits home. But here is some advice to anyone who genuinely struggles with priorities: get out of the house. Seriously, helps me so much, if I can just muster the will to stay away, go to coffee shop to study for instance or do e-mails, I do way better. Also, you feel less guilty when you play and because you put it off, feels more special when do sit down. Be wise, be balanced and remember to buff each other.
---
One of our rl friends who used to play a rogue in our premade wsg groups, used a laptop touch pad to play.  Everyone in the guild/group asked why he turned so slowly, I told them all, he only had one arm, and they were like ohhh.
---
The timer isn't real. It's just a placebo. Ignore it completely.
---
Settings -&gt; Interface Options and enable more bars, then Setting -&gt; Keyboard Bindings to bind them?
---
I took a boat to another continent and killed a whole bunch of transient workers hoping to get tons of cloth to sew into bags.  The respawn timers were ridiculous so I just left.
---
The queues were never as bad, but new servers popped up constantly until the list was massive. Servers would crash regularly and sometimes be down for hours to days.
---
Its is funny how it only costs about 80 copper for a trip from Stormwind to Ironforge, but costs nearly double to go from the first flight point in Loch Modan to Ironforge.
---
You and me both man, &lt;5 hours of sleep 2 nights in a row definitely had me feeling and looking like my undead warlock.
---
Bahaha. Made my day! 
---
I really forgot those lineage control scheme....
---
Yes.  Caused massive errors. Wouldn’t work.
---
thats my favorite mount
---
gotem
---
Exactly! I have never seen anyone say "LFG DM" and mean Dire Maul. If they were looking for Dire Maul, it would be LFG DM East/West, etc.
---
&gt; He has the fastest unassisted private server times in existence
---
lie
---
As a horde player... I will miss paladin buffs :(
---
Don't group up?  Also, there's nothing wrong with killing a bunch of humanoids that drop cloth in an area abundant with resources.
---
Well shit now I don't know what to do. Started a lock on a server that is way overpopulated and then started a 2arrior on a better pop server. 
---
I love the lock but decided to Branch out to the warrior. I have only off tanked previously and not much. So tanking was appealing but I don't have the time to be an MT. 
---
Maybe I need to rethink the warrior.
---
Stance swapping only REALLY comes into play once you've got Tactical Mastery, otherwise you're just burning rage. 
---
The usual rotation(pre level 30ish) I stick with to start is charge &gt; bloodthirst &gt; thunderclap(+ demo shout if you have excess rage) &gt; defensive stance &gt; sunder &gt; sunder.
---
Once you get the first two sunders(and inevitably a Revenge or two) on the main target, you can pretty safely start applying sunders to any other targets. Pop shield block if you're running low on health, otherwise keep sundering and shield bashing whatever casts come out.
---
You mean Welcome home :)
---
I wish my girlfriend would get into wow with me, she used to play swtor so she's sort of used to mmos. She said she didn't think she would like the open world concept :/ my best friend and wow buddy of 15 years passed away last year, I think I'm low key trying to fill the void he left in me by getting my gf to play wow. I could never tell her that though, that wouldn't be fair. I'd love more than anything for her to get into it, I think it would be a great bonding experience for the both of us, but I don't see it happening unfortunately.
---
They want people to spread out to other servers so they can remove layers in phase 2 and not go back to 20k queues
---
The most selfish spellcaster lol
---
Especially at level 5...
---
Ty.  5 sec rule already in play.  I’ll give healcomm a shot.
---
Layers don't add capacity. All they do is make it so zones with high player density are still playable, i.e. the starting zone on launch day.
---
They're gnomes. Knee-height will suffice.
---
yo wtf
---
Man you guys are some salty cry babies for sure.
---
I... don’t get it
---
I just keep seeing people say they miss their heirlooms and mounts etc. Lots of complaining in /1 about where quests are - yet the quest text so easily tells you!
---
We’ll be ready to welcome you home...
---
I'm not telling you anything other than that account sharing is literally against Blizzard's ToS. 
---
Your opinion of the matter is of no consequence to me.
---
I don't care what you do.
---
But Blizzard may.
---
Sorry but your argument doesn't really make sense. What do you think most people were doing in patch 3.2? They were playing endgame, not leveling alts. With Ulduar and the Argent Tournament there was plenty to keep people occupied.
---
Heirlooms on their own did not kill the game. But other features which were added late in wrath and cata escalated the problem. Wrath also introduced the dungeon finder, which combined with heirlooms, shifted the meta for leveling characters away from the open world. You could sit in a city all day and queue dungeons. And looking at the very chart you shared, I think we can see what kind of impact LFG and LFR have had on the game.
---
Of course, LFG and heirlooms are only part of the problem. Plenty of other changes have killed player interaction and the open world. It's been a steady decline since cata.
---
I really like the tool set we have. Ghost wolf is amazing, astral recall will be a god send for many, and it just feels so good every time you stop by the class trainer
---
And they don't know where the quest journal is...
---
#Time is money, friend.
---
Elaborate? You literally just download a program that simulates a keypress every few minutes. It's not hard, people have been doing this shit for decades.
---
This fucks rain
---
I bought a shitload of light leather that was under vendor price, then vendored it.
---
Exactly this. I have zero desire to play BFA and never have.
---
Where do I get Samuel Flipps remains
---
Also, Malygos is the only thing in The Eye, so the name is pretty appropriate.
---
&gt; Did anyone ever ask for wow to be made easier?  
---
Yes, in many ways.  Some of them are legit QoL improvements.  Running around with three vendor drops that stack to 5 and each represent a different status of a spider's leg (and don't stack with each other) is not the pinnacle of game design, *but it is actually vanilla*.  
---
Downtime was carefully constructed in classic- you can read interviews where they talk about how they tried to make it so that a dps warrior and a protection warrior end up with similar xp per hour, even though the protection warrior is dealing less damage, he is taking less damage as well.  How well did that work out?  Well, not perfectly, *but at least that was a goal*.  Does the virtual elimination of this mechanic in modern WoW help the game?  I really don't think so, but if you tried to roll that back it would be a big deal, and met with huge amounts of disapproval.  
---
Part of the "did anyone ever ask for wow to be made easier", however, was implicit- by the time BC came out, the game was leveling from 60 to 70 and doing level 70 crap, it wasn't running around plaguelands, and the time you spent doing that felt way less good than when the max level was 60.  So they reduced the time spent doing that, with some serious repercussions.
---
I read something right after hitting reply that says there are random rolling restarts to try and clear afkers or scriptors that won't log off?  That could be it
---
Dwarves taxes
---
I was on an original Vanilla server. And we called it DM.
---
So, in retail, starting on the anniversary of wow in nevemeber, blizzard is offering time walking raids. Where they squish you down to 60, you'll need 40 people for vanilla raids and your resist gear..etc same for TBC, all the way through. So, by expanding time walking into retail for raids, I don't see them adding the expansions back in.
---
I sometimes do ballsy shit like this as well, but I usually put in a lot of extra time and Im a government employee, so as long as I hit 40hrs I'm good. I also telework some days.
---
as a warlock i just run up and give everyone a healthstone.
---
Internet these days man, I didn’t want to be called a fraud
---
Would do but is hard to have fun when communities you have joined and friends are not on the others not to mention i want to play my PvE's that i have made! but oh well its going to be an RP night for me :3
---
Yeah both tried and failed on me , good to see I’m not the only one though.
---
There's also the built-in locator spells, which will show nearby ones on your minimap.
---
&gt;\[happiness:icon\]
---
Woooo!  Exactly what I was looking for!  Thanks so much :)
---
remember trying to get my bro in wow by showing him the tauren leveling zone few years back. he walked away as soon as one of these fuckers came riding past
---
The easiest fix would be to add action bars and keybind the bar to include the modifier (Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2). Might have to use a bar addon for this. ElvUI should have this feature but that's A LOT more than a bar addon.
---
This should be a good bandaid until you get more permanent preferences that warrant macro'ing 2 spells in 1 macro.
---
The other day I had to head from IF to SW to go to Elwyn Forest to do my Voidwalker quest (am gnome). Figured, oh I can just dip into Duskwood and take the flight path back to SW to hand it in. First I got killed by a skull level wolf. I rez'd, made my way to the path, got to the Duskwood flight path only to realize I didn't have enough silver to pay for it. /facepalm
---
I played in Vanilla, lol. It was DM on my server.

O.o.  That fixes?  Will reload and see. Ty for heads up.
---
Then i hope we meet in the battlefield one day Alliance warrior, I promise you an honorable death.
---
Please respect an instance’s right to make decisions about its own body
---
Things feel a bit easier compared to my pserver experiences (aggro radius and misses feel more forgiving, maybe just in my head). This could also be heavily affected by high pop helping keep dense areas cleared out and dynamic respawn on pservers royally screwing some areas. 
---
I'm loving it, having the time of my life, and the best part is I can fully invest in my character with no reservation. I'm leveling all secondary professions this time, something I've never really done
---
I had faulty RAM and was crashing all the live long day. Windows Memory Test found nothing. Memtest86, however, helped me determine which stick to remove. Now we're golden!

I was thinking he/she planned to toss it back on the AH after it was replaced. of course the vendor wants it.
---
Then get the tinkerers working on less noisy engines!

Hey man, so I found this addon NugEnergy Classic, I've installed it but I'm waiting in queue to see if it works.
---
[Here's the wowinterface.com link to it](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24934-NugEnergyClassic.html)
---
I feel it is more like having a loving caring father when you are young, but over the years he gets injured, losses some limbs, becomes a drug addict and alcoholic, and is no longer the same as he used to be. You keep staying with him in memory of what he used to be, and he keeps quilting you to stay around to feed his addictions. Then one day your the person your dad used to be shows up.
---
It's okay. Alliance are usually wrong in most regards.
---
Well blizzard is a publicly traded company so think about it.
---
I did the same thing the first few days on incedious. I got annoyed with some guild trying to manipulate and flease people. 
---
Maxed out crafting and kept going. 
---
I always did the same thing, free bag crafting at brill, 6 cloth or 3 bolts, on the cart next to general store. 
---
Idk how many bags repost made, but I can tell you that last time I was in brill people we still using the cart for the meet place for free bags.
---
Lol.  What a bullshit friend you are.  Well at least the rest of them have eachother and can have fun leveling.  Enjoy your lonely island.
---
Can't wait to get to the Deadmines! Those days when you'd spend an hour spamming LFG.. I wonder if it is still as satysfying
---
Works fine on its own.
---
People trash this opinion all the time, but I stand by it: Wrath is the worst expansion WoW ever had. Everything that people hate about retail...nearly *everything*...started in Wrath.
---
That includes this mount.
---
Meanwhile locks are in the background glaring at everyone

Had a good time fiddling around an emoting and making a campfire waiting for our last person for RFC yesterday, then when everyone logged off I went and fished for an hour. Best part about classic is that racing to keep up is moot since you'll never be out of reach of your friends in terms of being able to help them.
---
Same. I’ve been swimming or going through town and then forget what I’m doing.
---
The gatekeeping and the blinders anger the fuck out of me. It's why I can't help myself but argue with them. 
---
Retails got some good things, Classic has some good things, they both have bad things. 
---
Personally? Give me that WOTLK /w Mythic+ added in and shoot that shit *right* into my veins. That was WoW's peak in raiding, dungeons, leveling, pvp, world, economy, professions. It was perfection. Just give it that boost of M+ for an alternative gear path and challenge and you have super perfection.
---
The queues back in the day (I played EU, which was released like 3 months after US though) were way less as they have been the past week. 30 minute queues were common but 1+ hour queues were exceedingly rare.
---
Blizzard just threw more servers at the problem back then. 
---
I'd wish they did the same for this release and announce free character transfers to mitigate player drop off and ways to get off dead servers.

Gotta thank the german localisation team for translating **almost every** name in the game by the end of Vanilla.
---
He died in 1989 at age 64. He is credited with 90 movies and over 100 TV appearances.
---
One of my tips is if a quest reward is barely worth an upgrade always take plate or a 2H weapon. They sell for a lot more. Also if you skin it can add a lot of revenue
---
Ohhhh garbage water???
---
Well yea, the brother was 100% aware at that point.  If this one was staged he really sells it well.
---
Some linen and coarse thread will make him a glad man
---
Enjoy your gold, I had no idea!
---
Actually feels like leveling now
---
Speaking of helping - anybody know how I can get enemy cast bars? I have Quartz but it doesn't work for that, think there had to be a cast bar already to effect it
---
I put them there
---
Yeah this work weeks mornings have been tough lol...

You can always grind mobs and sell the loot. If it feels tedious, then good luck in the future.
---
not true.
---
they said they're not going to add more servers, allegedly to keep the community feeling.
---
instead they're " increasing" capacities, which isn't going to put a dent in large queues.
---
they're not delivering, they extremely underestimated classic and extremely overestimated retail.
---
Activision wants to save money, that's why they were breadcrumbing out new servers, which they should've done within the first week of name reservation.
---
A guiding light yes thanks

I’ve seriously considered calling in multiple times since launch, the only keeping me from it is a 3 day weekend coming up.

---
Oh go fuck yourself.
---
Thanks peeps, got it to work via iDeal. Thanks for the suggestions =)
---
But she's clearly drinking red! Wtf is wrong with these people?
---
Lol I knew that would be the case. Thanks
---
Running to save someone on Fenris Isle trying to fight off 3 of those Rot Hide Gnolls made me feel like more of a hero than those scripted cutscenes in Legion and Draenor.
---
Yeah HotW spec is pretty much a compromise spec too. That 20% int is nice for healing, but not as nice as the 30 talent points you could have spent in Resto or Balance instead.
---
I really hate this, especially since gold was relatively difficult to come by in vanilla. It really sucks for Hybrids if you want to explore another spec etc besides your main. Even worse when you decide to PVP or something and then hard pivot into raiding/dungeoning b/c that's what your friends/guild wants to do. Dual spec was a QoL option I was advocating for early on.
---
Nvm, found it! Thanks!
---
Waiting in queue and just chilling on reddit. 
---
Haven't logged in yet but i have seen WoW gameplay off and on over the years (My brother played hardcore back in Wrath) and have played other MMO's and understand the basics like tagging and all that. 
---
Just wanted some beginner knowledge is all.
---
Day 1 I bought 12 tigerseye for 50-70c, then turned around and vendored them for 1s
---
Well it's technically still a recurring sub that charges monthly. But yknow you can always just go in and insta cancel the renewal after checkout. Just seems you can't use PayPal for it anymore.
---
This is what vanilla was all about, I’m so happy to see people keeping the spirit alive. Even though I’m spending most of my time in retail, I’m enjoying casually leveling my Human Pally in classic, bearing the same name as my Human Pally on retail, that I made 15 years ago. It’s an incredible level of nostalgia and even though I’m not sinking my teeth into it the way others are, I’m so happy it’s there, even if it means my retail server is now half as packed as it used to be (looking for a busy alliance server on retail if anyone has suggestions).
---
We had an older guy in our guild, same race and class as me. As the class captain i spent a lot of time playing with the dude. 
---
one time in ZG he accidentally left an open mic on and just laid into his kid. screaming bloody murder at him. The whole raid got to listen. It was intense.   
---
Anywho. hope his kid is still alive.
---
love the downvotes here when it's 100% accurate, the truth is Activision-Blizzard is a greedy company at its core, they probably want all the press and hype all this builds. These idiots will still eat it up from daddy Blizz.
---
That makes zero sense.  Merges down the road are a trillion times better than the cluster fuck this has been,  unless you've been logged in for three days with ahk?
---
Yeah solid amount of people, but not enough to get stuck in super long queue. Only one I had was about 30 minutes otherwise I’ve been able to get right in. Folks are friendly too
---
And home I will be
---
I remoted in today but the mouse made the camera super wonky and barely playable.  Don't think I'll be playing much remotely.
---
I've been enjoying BFA this whole xpak, and I don't even want to click login to BFA right now I'm enjoying Classic so much.  So many guildies that left in Wrath have come back to our guild in Classic though so playing with all those people again is amazing.
---
What happen to joanna?
---
I've even noticed old language coming back automatically like tell instead of whisper and using char names instead of calling them by their class. 
---
If anything I think people are behaving even better than we did in vanilla. No randomly opening trade or just inviting randoms to group or whispering begging for money.
---
It's like voluntary rehab and we all want to be here! It fills my heart.
---
That thought process is part of the problem. You think 1-119 is just a 'training exercise' to get you used to a character or something. It's a game. It's an RPG. It's supposed to be MMO (but has as much multiplayer as diablo these days)  as well. 
---
Once you remove the MMO and the RPG, then sure, all that's left is to slowly be introduced to your abilities like it's the tutorial level to a MOBA game.
---
I remember, in the depths of my addiction as a 14 year old in 2006, my parents showing me an article about how WoW triggers similar activity in your brain as cocaine. I thought, "lol adults are so fucking stupid. It's just a game, chill". Now, having tried cocaine, I can see that they were definitely exaggerating. WoW is way better than coke.
---
I want to be free to chase a level of completion to my hearts content, letting the population naturally die out to the last remaining fanatics. It doesn't have to last forever.
---
Ohh I am sooooo sorry my water breathing isnt good enough to warrant my presence in this meme!
---
Gold?! If only.
---
I'm a looonnngg way from my first gold, still working on getting them silvers
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/gathermate2/files/all
---
"what an idiot. Look at him having fun in MY game!"
---
Because that would result in overly populated servers once they removed the layers. A short term fix that would cause bigger long term problems.
---
The capacity of each server is already *MASSIVELY* more than the original vanilla servers. Layers stops servers being terribly overpopulated while there is a huge number of active players, whilst still giving Blizzard a way to merge the layers as people quit to end up with good realm populations in the long term without needing to merge physical servers at a later date.
---
Yep I'm hearing a lot that these concerns are unfounded, which is nice.
---
A guildy has a rogue named nightman and a paly named dayman. I’m so happy that person exists.

Thanks so much for getting back to me! Is there a community of macro writers or are you talking about specific people? I found things like [this](https://www.wowhead.com/forums&amp;topic=8778) and [this](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/1764414699) but I'm not sure if these are the kind of scripts you're referring to or are out of date. Thanks again!
---
Haha! It’s okay. I had no frame of reference is all.
---
Does Eng have QoL stuff like speed boost and teleports?
---
Slog or log? Lol
---
What do you mean? The item was not very good for a Mage I went to the auction house and got a way better weapon for the gold I got...
---
what about MotW?
---
Thanks for that. Just to be clear:
---
Type:Status can be used for spell cooldowns
---
but Type:Aura can be used for buffs like Arcane Intellect?
---
This is what I'm trying to understand in WA: which term WA uses that corresponds to what is happening in the game.
---
Thanks bud, i hope so too! Goodluck on acquiring a playable PC or laptop! If you have a facebook check on some "for sale and trade" pages for your locations. Can usually snag some pretty damn good deals on parts and semi-new laptops, especially if you live in or around a city
---
That's great English for a non-native English speaker.  Well done.

Hey man want to keep this under your hat?

I never see you dudes in melee-range of anything you kill after lv 10.
---
You are wrong. This is nostalgia and i hope you guys did evolve. You wont have the same time, you wont have the same interests and you wont be the same guys like in your teenage years. You are grabbing to nostalgia and those rose painted glasses will soon be taken off. You may have bonds but those bonds could have happen everywhere ells.like magic the gathering. The timing of the release, when 3d was fascinating in a world connected to each other while you could play it on a toaster made WoW so great. Blizzard got also the cash to heavy push it on tv so alot more people got to know it. Wich game gets promoted nowdays on tv? Those with a heavy budget. Also WoW was for the most part coded in china due the lower fees. WoW is not a bad game, but true vanilla was bugged and unfinished. Maybe you dont remember the open beta and release. There were quests that didnt make sense: walk 2h to get an item so you get an item. Those quests dont exist anymore because they were made to lengthen your gametime so you are forced to sub.
---
You're 100% right, apologies.  When someone says Warrior my brain goes straight to tank.
---
she's a keeper
---
Hate it so much I love it.

https://youtu.be/H6H2Zctz3-M

I've been going around to people saying "Hey, come get this chest!" then aggroing the mobs so they can loot it. A lot of new players aren't used to looking for chests so I see them walking right past them, and the chests have a lot of money and some really useful stuff inside so it's good to teach them to start looking for them.
---
While I can see where you are coming from, and like I said, I get that waiting sucks balls, I also tend to disagree. Not only did the community see this coming, Blizzard themselves said a couple days prior to launch they expected tremendously long waits on Full Pop servers (Herod, Stalagg, etc)
---
At that point you and your guild had the choice to migrate, which I also understand is a risky proposition, but you had a choice.
---
Set up a remote desktop client and queue yourself from your phone hours before you get home
---
And I am the bag apprentice. For Blaumeux was bagless, and i sought to fix that. I spent an hour and a half bagging it up in Brill. Then in UC. They said it was a waste of time for a lvl 12. But I, SmallChungus the Undead Mage could not rest knowing there were adventurers with empty bag slots roaming around, their packs filled to the brim with quest items and food/drink. Tonight I shall return, with new and improved bags. They shall be bigger, with more pockets. Squashed is the need for canvas and linen. Wool is the fabric of the future. Moisture wicking, sturdy, and warm. In a mere 6 hours, SmallChungus will be there. Ready and waiting to craft the finest bags, with the fondest of care.
---
the only server without a queue is the rp server.
---
nowhere to go to avoid them.
---
so I don't have a guaranteed access to the product
---
To be fair, you are right. I never played the vanilla end game before, so I can't tell anything about it. But without a doubt, I'm having a blast leveling up in classic!
---
Guys, it's Danny Devito!
---
Thanks. Looked in Prat for an option to turn it off but couldn't find any. Do you know if there's such an option?
---
Thats a pretty cat!
---
Peggle addon EZ
---
I've never so much as touched WoW before, but I have been playing Runescape since 2003. Playing Classic is genuinely the best experience I've had with a video game since I first played Destiny in 2014.
---
I don't typically invite people because i can't handle rejection.  The declining the invite just hits me in the feels.  But I get so excited when i get invited out of the blue.  
---
I think that people should invite random strangers more... for the community..
---
Normally someone who writes sits down with an idea they want to express on.  When writer's block happens the mind wanders or acts 'empty' towards the topic and nothing of substance gets written because of distraction.  The distraction in this case being Classic WoW lol...
---
1. There was a huge hype behind classic and people LOVE to counter-jerk just for the sake of looking different.
---
2. It might reveal some uncomfortable facts about the game they have invested thousands of hours into.
---
VC=Deadmines, DM=Deadmau5 
---
End of discussion.
---
Yep I’ve been having this glitch
---
Something that annoys me in BFA is that you lose your buffs whenever you leave a group. I can understand why they do it (although they should at least let you keep buffs while in the world) but it sucks losing your int buff when you didn't even get it from the group you just left anyway.
---
Imagine phase 2 queues with no layering
---
Welp. Got me!
---
If you had a 5h+ queue like i had you would
---
Same lol only on the first 2 nights was there a queue
---
 #NoChange
---
Ahmpy is the only person we have proof that no one is playing on their account to help while they rest.  Because Ahmpy streamed his whole run with face cam.  He should get the win for this race if the only people above him are Joker and Leshraque.
---
I'm on stalagg which isn't much better, all us idiots decided we didn't want to deal with the Herod queues and got burned the same anyways
---
More than simply the icon, it shows the cooldown and proc availability as well.
---
Essential if you want to use revenge or execute or overpower every time they are available.
---
Is mandrik considered a bigger realm/server ?
---
Sure 1050 TI is where it’s at anyways xD
---
Instant gratification for the win. I sold 5 lvl 8 greens in Org for 6s each thru /2 trade channel. I'll do that more often.
---
I never realized how much I hate that sound till you pointed it out.
---
Yeah I had to go to the dwarf dude in ironforge and it was just 10 silvers.
---
This is the perfect time to re roll. If you don't you will regret it forever.
---
So don't, just stick it out.
---
As a rogue it feels great being able to gouge a target jumping someone and throwing some bandages on them to save their lives. Likewise, fearing a mob off someone and bandaging them. God I missed first aid.
---
It's not a new concept dude. Everyone who has been here since Vanilla knows damn well that refunding game time is Blizzard would normally do in this situation and did often due to the issues of Vanilla and subsequent patch launches. You're arguing that the cost should be put on the players for seemingly no reason. Even if ActivisionBlizzard gave EVERYONE except me the game time back, I would be satisfied.
---
Do I count as a clothie as Rogue? All my gear is cloth with Agility/Stamina.
---
oh damn im heading to do that today, im begging friends to help me
---
Disappointed?
---
So true. Atleast something to so for next 12 years
---
DUN DUN DUN!
---
Seriously though, I made my bf play Alliance with me because I wanted to be a sexy female Draenei, and now I'm a male troll. There's always a chance!
---
Really? Cause my freinds don't blame me after they finally survived the struggle of thr starting zones yesterday.
---
If that's what you think I'm probably pretty rad.
---
I had a boar resisting my spells so much I felt like a cop. "STOP RESISTING!! STOP RESISTING!!"
---
Well yeah considering how much time it took me to enter queue, it probably won't get far.
---
Yeah, this is what I do.. just log in and queue up around lunch or before that and you’ll be in by the time you get home
---
The only difference it makes to me is if you want to look at 4 bars or only 1.
---
Personally I like being able to see all my abilities because my memory is shit, also I like to move things around on the fly and I don't want to go in and edit macros just to do that.
---
Big thanks!
---
I'm looking to join a PVE server thats mostly Alliance.  I see at the Realmpop website that we don't have classic servers listed there.  Is there an alternative location I can check to figure this out?
---
Yeah, unfortunately I don't have vacation so I can login only during peak hours, which is really painful
---
I feel you. I've lost almost all motivation because I need to work whilst my buddies are living off of welfare or just home 24/7 and don't have a reason to not log out of the game. They're just leveling the fuck ahead of me and I'm just chilling in 10+ hour long queues every day, ending up with me not even getting to play the game because I can't no-life the game the same way they are.
---
It's been a real nice experience so far. Good launch.
---
...that's the problem.
---
I wish i could get a custom title..  "The Mad meat Fairy"
---
I think they're confusing it with Shaman's Water Breathing which required a fish scale.  Water WALKING was another Shaman skill that required fish oil.
---
body pull with frost armor/wand/rank1 frost bolt ---&gt; frost nova everything ---&gt; walk away to max range ---&gt; blizzard #1 ---&gt; blizzard #2 ----&gt; frost nova again ---&gt; blizzard #3 ---&gt; finish with cone of cold + AE + wand
---
if you get any resists, cold snap frost nova to correct. if you get any adds during the aoe, poly and chug a mana gem or reset.
---
do NOT get Frostbite. DO get improved blizzard and permafrost and arctic reach. blizzard can't crit until WotlK so dont look at ice shards or shatter for aoeing
---
I will find out tomorrow what they did, cant login right now, 5k, 120min queue. I wanna now too hahaha
---
I loved dropping resses on whatever dead bodies I came across. It's killing me right now to be a shammy with no buffs and being too low to have my res spell.
---
You had Diremaul North, West, and East.  But also DM North Tribute runs.
---
Because whats the point? You can still afk on flightpaths and I assume most people do. If you have to afk longer than the flight path? Your character just chills at your destination so it doesn't matter.
---
Gotham City needs you, Bag Man.
---
 Im quite pissed I cant do shit as a shaman, so I made a /lick macro.
---
The pet will have the ability already on its action bar if he has it. It seems it either is a bug or the pet you tamed do not have lightning breath.
---
I tamed a quest cat named Echeyakee, it supposedly was supposed to have bite 3 but didn't. I tamed a snapjaw instead which had bite 2 already on its spell bar.
---
Oh yeah! Kind of hilarious, as a warrior back in the day I'd always try to get AI before going out and leveling a new weapon.
---
Awesome breakdown, thanks!
---
Just seems odd to have spell binds on Q-S-E having your fingers move in two different directions for situational spells instead of just having them all drop down. Unless you've got S bound to backpedal for some reason, but hey to each their own
---
Yes, no trolling.
---
Warriors while leveling use the slowest weapon possible with the most damage.
---
Staff or anything else possible.
---
You're welcome &lt;3
---
I use ctrl + alt + delete for Charge and alt + f4 for Mortal Strike.
---
Does your PC have hibernation settings on? In which case it might go into sleep mode after like 30 minutes of you not checking on it.
---
Yeah, auras are buffs and debuffs on you or others. You can’t detect NPC buffs (not sure about enemy players) unless you use detect magic on them though.
---
Status can be used for spells (whether they are usable, on cd, etc) and even items (like when you get trinkets with an on-use effect), among other things.
---
I can remember way back during vanilla someone made a whole guild of gold farmers. Whenever he would find one, he would send them an invite and they would accept.  He spoke fluent Chinese and would fuck with them hard.
---
Yep, guy has used this comic to push Holocaust denial and his previous comic redpanels had even more outwardly fascist shit in it.

Ooo good tip!
---
...I log in faerlina and only waited 2500 for about 30 mins last night at 12am pst
---
not all heroes wear capes, but they do make bags
---
I've thought about calling in so many times this week lol. But I'm off Sunday Monday so that'll be my playtime.
---
It’s so surreal watching old WoW panels and seeing the same devs contradict their current philosophy. Yes there is a ton of inconvenience in classic. But that’s what makes it SO amazing. So immersive, and within minutes of launch I felt that community I haven’t felt in about a decade. I’m in love with this game again.
---
The servers are up. You can wait in the queue.
---
Have you never waited in a line before. Why is this any different.
---
Lol true. In his defense he’s one of those guys who carries people thru raids/pvp for $ so I get it. I never have a core group of gaming friends because I get super adhd and don’t like sticking to a playing schedule, plus I’m just used to playing solo.
---
I’m curious, did they bring back the OG method of organizing a party for a dungeon raid when you had to spam the regional chat channel for a priest or tank?
---
That would be because apologies involve admitting that there may have been a mistake.  You can't do that, it hurts the brand.  Though honestly, spawning a meme war can't possibly help.
---
What can he do? (Im huge noob)
---
Yeah, I'm just taking my leisurely time. Did 1-18 on Tuesday (but I played for like 20 hours), then 18-20 yesterday and just finished some class quests and profession catch up and gearing today, as well as getting halfway through 21.
---
Tomorrow I'm gonna go ham on Redbridge quests though. I've got very level appropriate gear for a level 21 rogue after some DM runs and AH browsing, got poisons on both weapons, and I think I slightly overlevel most of the quests. Gonna be a breeze to grind through some Gnolls. I'm more excited about questing on my level 21 rogue than I have been of anything in retail in the last 5 years.
---
It's nice, but way too fast.
---
It seems better today.  We'll see when people start getting off work how it looks.
---
12am PDT happens when this comment is 10 hours and 37 minutes old.

Thank you dirty breed.
---
Unless you’ve hit a point in your talent tree that grants more crit or damage to a specific type of weapon you should probably just go with the strongest you can get
---
You’ll have to increase your weapon skill all over again though so the beginning might be complicated

World of Warcraft Classic: VR with haptic feedback coming to you in the year 2038
---
Usually I agree but he actually is a nazi
---
I started in late TBC and have played on and off ever since. BFA killed the game for me. Meanwhile i haven't want to play this game this much since WotLK.
---
Once the healer's been eaten, that is. 
---
This sounds like a huge mistake to use in dungeons in most scenarios. Fun stuff!
---
Side question: There were none of this on the auction house, is it a good item? My friend told me to keep it in the bank for a month or so and sell it then. Is it really that good, even though it's only level 15?
---
Tried to set resolution to correct one, but it didn't help. Still getting same 3D accelerator thing popping up after clicking play in [battle.net](https://battle.net) launcher, i don't even get to see intro screen of wow, so it feels like it's not about resolution, i'm not sure. Thank you for trying to help anyway.
---
Eye roll. You are so over dramatic
---
Thanks!!!
---
this might actually get me to join in on PVP.    When you go to bed in the morning, and get back up in the afternoon, and that same Battle is still going.   it actually feels like a persistent war and not jsut a pick up game of sports ball.
---
Thieved my quest item while I was fighting the spawn right beside obviously intending to pick it up?  No heals for you, fucker, enjoy that corpse run.
---
I am a gentle god.
---
This leather chair is very comfortable.  What's it made of?
---
Almost any individual without a friend group/guild already invested in a server would make the change. Its not as simple as people like you make it out to be. People in guilds that want to run end game content also want to be on a server that has plenty of competent and regular players to fill out a 40 man group.
---
This fuck rains guys.
---
Thanks for the information I will take that into consideration, may do WC tonight or Sunday when I get back from weekend trip.
---
100%
---
Op is either too you or dumb to not  be able to understand accepted consumer protion laws.

Why you so mad bro? Are you ok?

RP on a PVP server?
---
A DISGUSTING ACT

So as you read, just know my friends: I'd love to stay with you all. Please smile when you think of me!

---
I think it's time to make new friends. Shaman awaits you. :D
---
Ive just not been deleting them this time, so they are at least getting stronker.
---
I'd start now on a low pop server if there is one in you region. If you're planning on PVP server you probably don't want to be months behind the curve.
---
..yes? Warriors can be sapped too
---
My eyes have been opened 😭
---
Hey, can you tell me on which level rogues can learn wearing swords? Really, I'm googling this shit and can't really find answer (I've tried to learn it on lvl 10 and couldn't).
---
If you have a competent group that actually clear fast and consistently then yea it’s worth it. Although you will be missing out on a lot of the world and community by doing so
---
You’re going nuts
---
It's a quest where you have to gather a couple items in the water.
---
Ohhh wow, you are right. Thanks for that. I suddenly get it now.
---
Especially that one high level rabbit, with the sharp teeth!
---
Oh shit, I used to play on Uldum too but I left that ghost town all the way back in ICC. I can only imagine who desolate it is in 2019.
---
Rogues and hunter pets love Battle Shout tho
---
i will name all pets like this, cuz when i rushing rfc i forgot to buy meat, and my pet leaves me LUL
---
lol no we don’t.
---
Do not buy gold you will get your account suspended for a day or two by they will also keep an eye on your account closely.  You can make gold the old fashioned way with gathering professions and selling vendor trash along with greens you do not need.
---
Aaah redridge, that zone hits the feels for me the most. I haven't played yet because I'm on vacation and I'll probably roll horde. (because of friends) But the amount of time I rerolled when I got to redridge because I felt completely powerless is just to damn high
---
It’s a quest chain that starts at lvl 16 in moonglade.
---
Now would it be possible for me to idle on my character to get logged off to select screen, then log back in and repeat? Main reasoning is I think I joined queue too early and may get in before I’m back from work. Can’t wait for the day we can just log in and not have to work around the queue but it is what it is!
---
You may have missed your call to be a hunter.
---
Wasn't there the Bam! Add-on that kept track of your crits?
---
I remember it pretty popular with rogues
---
You are home now, as we all are.
---
It's amazing. It's crazy how many people and experiences i remember from vanilla vs most recent expansions which I can't recall much from. Even running into the same opposing faction people in world/wsg is fun, always shit talking on forums over wsg.
---
Please tell me you're playing a hunter...
---
I mean what do hunters really bring to the table besides raw DPS anyway?
---
Nah. Remus has a better ring to it.
---
Hopefully bad enough to convince my friend we need to leave Whitemane.
---
Meanwhile this is why my selfish self played a Rogue
---
So thank you to all lol
---
Especially Priests. Fort Stam is godsend
---
Looking for the name Ashe Erica or Morgana on Fairbanks. 
---
I have the name Thalryssa on Deviant Deliant and Grobbulus.
---
I have the name Erica on Smolderweb and kurinnaxx.
---
I have the name Ashe on Sulfuras.
---
I have the name Xayah on Herod.
---
sounds like heroin lmao
---
Quick note for any mages seeing this: you should also buff warriors and rogues. Increased intelligence increases their rate of training their weapon skill. It might seem silly giving Arcane Intelligence to a warrior, but it's not.
---
You can just resize the minimap to fix that. I had to do the same
---
Yea people dump Aggro all the time, if they tagged a mob right before you deliver a bigger hit that causes you to get aggro, they’ll just leave it and go find another. I mean it’s efficient but sill dick move
---
Yeah I've noticed that "already being looted by someone else" bug a few times, it blocks skinning which is a big deal and should hopefully be fixed soon.
---
It's an option for the majority of people.
---
It's really damn hard not to pull aggro as a dps in the early dungeons when the tank can't hold aggro for shit. If you want to let your group die, sure though.
---
Don't like it, don't use it?

I understand completely mate, not too long ago I had an nbn technician come and “fix” my line, only to tell me my router had to be stuffed because he’d “done everything he could”. In reality, it was Saturday and he gets paid per job so he bailed and it was broken for another week.

It feels criminal because it is criminal, our internet service is like, worse then some 3rd world countries. Corporate fuck wits and shit politicians are to blame for all of it. All we can do is find people who represent our interests better in the future to undo this colossal fuck up that is the state of our country at the moment.

They did pull a Cataclysm, they just did it after their initial game turned out to be shit and took the whole damn thing offline for a year.

I was trying out blizzarding some gnoll packs south of Sentinel Hill... was funny to watch groups of 5 people tackle 5-6 mobs then popping a bilzzard and kill all mobs in one sweep. Mages are OP !

Since you mentioned Wailing Caverns: the quest rewards for killing the 4 serpent bosses also offer you a staff with really high damage, do not disregard it simply because it has caster stats on it.

It counts as a limited subscription, so it should.

Is there a hard leash on most mobs in classic? My understanding is most mobs can be kited extremely far In classic (ie, stitches kited to goldshire).

The auction house is full of them so I imagine that most people just vendor them for 15 silver. If the vendors weren't paying as much I imagine that the price would go as low as possible.

It's like waiting in line 7 hours at a theme park the very first day a ride opens.

Haha, that's harsh, but fair.

Problem is, Hunter's have alternate sources of damage, they have their silly little shooter things. Our melee weapon damage is literally all we got. I'm not sitting here advocating warriors need roll on every blue gun and bow that pops up.

For the same reason the original commenter here said "This is actually really sad when you think about it", I'm guessing.  For people, who may not otherwise consider it, to think.   I honestly don't really see that drastic of a leap given the comment I replied to.    It's not like I went into details or posted graphic videos.  Any time I see an animal suffering or abused in some way, I think of them all.

The you should consider picking gnome or dwarf, since their racials are top tier for pvp...

Dude I have died so many times because of people walking into my office to "chat"

That’s awesome I was 4 when the game came out and I remember my grandpa would let me sit on his lap and help control his character. First it was Everquest then WoW when it came out. Now I’m legal age and I play with him.
---
Welcome to vanilla life. 
---
It’s not common to have enough for a mount when you ding 40 and even more uncommon to have enough for an epic mount when you hit 60. 
---
You’ve got to work (grind) for it.
---
I would argue, that transmog is only terrible due to the shitty armor desings. Not only those that got released since transmog exists but also those that already existed. The T-Sets usually don't fit into the game at all and make the characters look like action figurines.
---
big if true
---
You make it sound like you only get one character. It's possible to have everything you described through the mundane magic of alts.
---
Sombra, ashe, and widow are my favs

You mean in the day and age of the internet, people are still paying for video game guides?
---
I sat in Goldshire on Mankrik making bags for 2 hours. It was honestly one of the most fun times in WoW. People saying things like “Sorry I’m playing with my dad we were at Stonecairn lake but we’re on the way”
---
Things like that are so nice to hear.
---
I tried, and failed, then asked

Does it eventually require you to trek to TB to get the quest that gives you the staff?

Wait what. No way. I never knew this!

Ya classic wow is totally about instant satisfaction.
---
upvoted for not backpedalling away
---
Not true. It is perfectly doable to get enough money for a mount at 40. Just, be smart with your gold. Heck on my first level 60 in Vanilla I bought my epic mount within a week of dinging 60.
---
I remember managing up to Atal'Hakkar, but yeah, it's a little dicey and requires some slow pulls.
---
It's a success but it's not an incredible success yet. A successful launch? Yea. A successful game? No, not yet. Bfa had a bigger launch audience than classic has but look at how its doing a year in.
---
If your calling classic a success now then bfa was a success too. Which is a ridiculous statement and goes to show why this whole post is stupid.
---
They are lulling you into a false sense of security... ;P
---
In vanilla, you have to be in berzerker stance to use. Back when stance dancing was a thing. Battle or defensive stance = sap target
---
as far as playing for content in BFA absolutely, I am only going to log in to BFA for about an hour or so 2 or 3 times a week to farm herbs and ore to sell for tokens to keep my sub going
---
You’ll find out by the second weekend. Expect this weekend to be ridiculous as it’s the first weekend since launch. But things will stabilize by next weekend
---
I played Vanilla and i only ever saw it called VC. But I didn't start playing until after Dire Maul was released.

6 hours?!  It took me like a week to get it back in the day.  Granted I was doing it solo.

I'm sure it wasn't 100% accurate but the fact he is currently the fastest speed leveler in the world speaks for itself. Lights hope has nothing to do with classic but it provides a very similar platform to practice on. The fact that he was the fastest there is obviously relevant.

That's a whole new level.

They are not reluctantly rolling out servers, they are cautiously rolling them out to prevent dead servers in the future. Short term problem for a long term solution.
---
I just hit 30 and I have yet to see an int buff.
---
No you can't, and my reasoning is simple. The experiences you could be having right now are unique within their context.
---
For example, people who only play one character are leveling their characters right now. Those types of players are in this stage currently and will likely never be again. You may not see bag crafters as often as you see them now because of this. Also, people have mains that thus have resources. We are starting from square one, and from within that context, these types of interactions (specifically, these exact interactions) will never happen exactly the same.
---
Pedantic as that is, alts still don't fix that problem, and alts are not mains, meaning there will be a non-zero number of people who won't be around to interact with. They certainly won't be on the same class and race combos.
---
Looking for the name Ashe Erica or Morgana on Fairbanks.
---
Nah, we were around 80-90(Alliance).
---
Yeah because we all knew what servers were gonna be full. The servers on release are completely full now anyway. As if the full servers were created by blizzard to fail, how were we supposed to know?
---
Unreadable screenshot in true 2006 fashion!

Lol what on earth is that
---
There is a guy I. My guild who has slept a little less than 20 hours since launch. He was level 30 this morning.

You need to train it at a weapon master. The sword trainer is in Undercity for Horde, just ask a guard where to find him.
---
My only experience with WoW is watching my friends play like 12 years ago. I jumped on classic for a shot at finally getting to play for myself and getting to experience what MMORPG's were like back then. I've had to ask a lot of questions but everyone has been pretty nice about answering them for me thankfully
---
I actually have one of each class made from when my board game group wanted to try the raid decks.   It's pretty fun once everyone understands how to play the CCG.
---
Not Guam lol
---
or just ask in game chat people are usually more than glad to answer, Lord knows i ask dumb questions all the time. Pro tip Alt-F4 is never the answer.
---
Didn't ask
---
&gt;People aren’t cooperating in Classic because they’re just trying to act like they’re in the old days.
---
It sure does feel like that. At least on my server. People are making the same jokes and memes they did 15 years ago but outside of that the toxicity of the modern WoW community has transferred over just fine. Pretty much no one communicates outside of "invite plz" and that's that. General chat is just Barrens chat times 1000.
---
I'm a fairly anti social player because gamers are fuck heads, but I was hoping reliving WoW Classic would remove that part. It hasn't. If I wasn't playing with a few buddies, this would just feel like a reset of retail. Again, maybe I ended up on a shitty server.
---
Yikes!
---
As a recipient of a health stone that had saved my life thank you for doing this.

Cause last week it was just 5$, and earlier this week he increased it.

All weapons are Hunter weapons in classic.
---
I dont really care about him but didnt he explicitly say he wouldn't take donations until after he got epic mount
---
Just letting you know.
---
ye i know, but thing is if the rogues dont find the mob, they go out and reset and that uses an instance run, and  they do that a few times before they find a rare mob, then we go in and kill and then next run they cant join since they are locked, but iv seen streamers do this grind for over an hour so i must b e doing something wrong.
---
Please link the data you found. Nobody is saying its bigger than classic or retail, but it definitely is not massively botted.
---
(And heavily played on mobile is not really relevant???)
---
I’m having sooooo much fun with my Orc shaman. Healed for a group of 6 in RFC last night and it made me feel so valuable.
---
So here's a question.  Why do different classes have different armor types? 
---
The answer, or at least the answer 15 years ago, is that so that some classes take less damage than others.  
---
Why would some classes need to take less damage than others when only the tank should be hit?
---
The answer, at least 15 years ago, was that not only the tank would be hit.
---
Deadmines is one of the first dungeons. You weren't expected to have a tank, or even a "healer".  Hybrid classes can heal, some can tank.  Everyone can take a hit to some extent. 
---
A mage gets hit by melee, and the mob gets chilled from Frost Shield and the mage can run away.  If this is not enough the mage can frost nova. 
---
If a priest gets hit by melee they can power word: shield themselves, and throw on a renew.  They can take a few extra hits empowered with Inner Fire and they can Fade the mob off of them. In extreme scenarios they can fear.  
---
If a warlock gets hit, they can have their voidwalker taunt. They can drain life and healthstone.
---
My point is Vanilla WoW made everyone pretty responsible for themselves and their own aggro.  The fact that everyone's hitting different targets is their problem.  In Vanilla, pulling aggro was not a problem with the tank, it was a problem with the DPS.  Especially so when it wasn't on the primary target.  There were things that a tank can do to improve secondary target threat, but it was not intended that a tank hold all mobs consistently.
---
Even in TBC that was uncommon, and it was Paladins that were kind of the kings of doing that when the situation necessitated it. Most of the time it was a matter of CC'ing, careful target selection, and individual responsibility.  Sometimes you would even have players intentionally kite mobs, I'm thinking UBRS for instance with Drakk. 
---
Dedicated tanks weren't really necessary until the top level dungeons, like strat, scholo, BRS. 
---
However, what you're going to be struggling against most right now is a culture clash of people who expect things to be one way and a game that doesn't provide an easy way to do it.  
---
You'll probably have things that aren't usual as well.  For instance, if you were a priest, you healed.  If you were a warrior, you tanked.  You could be a shadow priest, or an arms warrior. This wouldn't matter. A paladin is going to hit things with their hammer, but they're also going to throw blessings and heals.  A shaman will windfury it up, but they'll spot heal too. It won't matter what spec you are, because this was back when classes had identities rather than specs.  You also couldn't easily afford to respec every time you wanted to run a dungeon, nor did you need to.  You could be a perfectly good tank as Arms, as well, there are good tanking tools in arms and fury trees too. 
---
Everyone shares responsibility in this game, it's not all foisted on the tank. Tanks are nice but for most content not even mandatory. Other players being hit by monsters is not the end of the world because this was a time when non-tanks actually had non-trivial defenses. 
---
The reason a tank is nice is for control, especially in the case of a big target, and for the healer to use efficient heals. But in some cases, spreading damage across the group is actually fine, if not desired. If you can have a low damage add hitting a secondary target and keep them mostly healed with a couple of HoTs, this can free up capacity for handling the targets that are on the tank.
---
We're just conditioned to the situation where the tank is the only one who can take a hit, and has the tools to be the person to control all the aggro, and the DPS can just ignore everything except their damage.
---
Invite them to your group and give them a Battle Shout. Not like it will help much, but it's the thought that counts.
---
Well is someone what on the same track lol
---
I feel like they might. Maybe in an expansion? Imagine  a small barbershop in major cities with... I don'y know, goblin barbers? Would be hilarious.
---
Look, I get it.  I hurts your feelz to suggest that your "I'm ub3r l33tman ra1d0rz" was built on a training-wheels experience.
---
I *agree* that M+ raids are WAAAY harder than Classic raids.  No question, no debate, no quibbles: It is, full stop.

EVERYTHING ELSE IN RETAIL?  Spoon fed "everyone gets a trophy" easy mode.

Yes, but also explaining why they wouldn't be an option in cata.
---
How much for a designer Teo Bag? My Hargar needs to be fresh
---
They do...  I'm not sure why this idea that layers don't add capacity keeps getting parroted. 
---
Omar [explicitly said](https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo?t=330) layers increase a realm's capacity.  Ion talked about it to Forbes just like 2 days ago.
---
If they took off 2 weeks and are still doing rfc they're kinda bad
---
Why tell a guard when a constant barrage of groups, each with 5 fantastic heros, are already on it.
---
OCE servers were down the whole time I was able to play yesterday. I logged on to BFA, did the pet battle quests and then logged out. I just have no drive to go back to BFA.
---
It sounds like you should take a break my dude. Anecdotally, the community has been very helpful and friendly. If getting a tag stolen here and there makes you upset, try grouping with them instead of just raging.
---
Nah I got it working. I hadn't spaced things properly.
---
Awesome macro. I made it on my polymorph too!
---
Shamans will never top DPS in Classic, but in my opinion they are the unsung heroes. Think Offensive linemen in football, never get recognition, but they are a major factor for the things they do.
---
Shamans are more support, and in my opinion, the best support class. There is no other class that can stop a mass fear other than the shaman with the use of tremor totem. You can mass remove diseases, mass refill Mana or life, take beneficial effects off enemies, interupt spells with earth shock, buff everyone's weapon with fire, give everyone in the party more strength or armor, taunt everyone in an area if the healer needs a second to get the tank back up to health (don't just drop the taunt though . . . this takes communication between the tank, healer, and you), etc . . . Other classes might give 1 or 2 buffs, you have tons and can change them on the fly. Get used to roatating your totems as you fight so you can give the right buffs when people need them.
---
Knowing the fights is key as a shaman and knowing when and what totem to put down is the biggest part of your role. If more than 1 Shaman is in the group/raid coordinate your totems with them so you aren't stepping on each other's buffs. You can run enhancement and focus on moderate DPS, but then excell at dropping key totems at the right time and using other totems to buff the entire party. You can even throw in a random heal here and there to take some strain off healers.
---
You could run heals too, but you won't be able to focus on doing all the other things when you are trying to keep everyone alive. So if there is a resto Shaman running, let them have first dibs on permanent totems, then you run different totems and make sure you communicate that you are going to cycle through the totems so they can focus on healing.
---
A good raid leader will recognize what you bring to the table. Mods like "recount" or "details" keeps track of interupts, be at the top of that list (especially for AoEs) and raids will love you because the high DPSers can focus on damage (they might use an interupt, but DPSers would rather focus on pure dmg instead), healers will love you for stopping mass dmg, and the tank will love you because the healers can focus on the tank. The tank will probably be interupting things too, but a lot of bosses cast the spell again before the tank has the interupt back, so make sure you are communicating with the tank with who is using the interupt and when. While you won't top the charts, your play will make sure others are able to max out their potential.
---
Last but not least, Shamans are insanely fun to play, because no fight is ever the same for you. When classes hit level 60, most of them are on a 3 to 5 spell rotation to maximize DPS, that is their role. Good Shamans use a minimum of 10 - 12 spells/totems per bigger fights and they aren't ever the same. 
---
If learning the fights and being able to switch your style per fight isn't your thing, then yes, don't play shaman, people will hate taking you with them. If needing to be the top of the DPS charts is what you want, then don't play shaman.
---
Would anyone be generous enough to gift me a month of WoW sub?

I saw a furry guild be born on the General chat on Teldrassil, it was so surreal, I loved every minute. You do you furry elves

Just thought I'd check again, now 1700 queue.
---
Talk about a true classic experience...
---
Flying mounts were fun when I had a mage and could PoM/Pyro people and slow fall to gib them mid air, but other than that yea it really killed world pvp in a big way.
---
I've made a game of how many people I can save, rez, and assist when playing my Paladin. One of my favorite parts of the game was seeing someone engaged with an enemy duking it out, and then diving in to push them on to victory. 
---
In retail, I've had people ask me why I helped kill something as it's never a struggle. In Classic, I get thank yous all the time. Was farming copper in the kobold mine next to Goldshire last night, and just helping out the lower level players as I went.
---
It still doesn’t matter, I’m sure these guides are the culmination of hundreds, if not thousands of hours of work. He has every right to price it as he sees fit. Just as you have every right to not buy the guide and either level on your volition or by using a free guide. Stop complaining about someone trying to earn money on something they’ve put hours of work into.
---
There is no best and worst.
---
I remember back in the day I played on a server dominated by alliance.
---
Horde kicked our as almost every bg, they just had to stick together and got stronger throu this i guess
---
It's why I stopped playing. My favorite thing was levelling. The entire thing. Learning your class if it's something you haven't played before, getting new skills, professions, the thrill of getting new items, the challenge, the feeling of being an adventurer drifting from one place to the next, I loved that experience.
---
Pretty sure that's a level 19 twink belt for Pallies and Warriors. Might want to hold onto that for a few weeks
---
I did this when I was drunk one Christmas in legion. Woke up the next morning wondering why tf I was broke, had no cloth or enchant dust...
---
I don't see what's wrong with this image? Yea we are all enjoying it now but how many people will still around at lvl 60 when I'm trying to find a group to do dungeons with or to set up for a raid? It's a concern I have but we aren't talking about it
---
Icicle. +10 frost damage is too good to pass up at your level.
---
No thats something way more fantastic
---
Haha I appreciate it. My roommate just left work to log us in and I'm at 1600 now headed home
---
Good Riddance! It's even worse when they're driving up inside buildings because you don't get dismounted anymore.
---
This, also looking for a reddit guild on a server that doesn't have queues
---
Yeah im a shaman so I'll be healing and I'm familiar a little bit but I haven't played vanilla since I was a kid. I'll give it a try at some point, thanks! ^^
---
I would bank that for a couple of weeks at least
---
Nah, this expansion there are plenty of bosses where you can't just cheese mechanics. It really is like classic in that regard. About 10 people doing the mechanics and carrying the rest. 
---
The final boss on the first tier is a good example of that. You could max out the wipe buff and still fail because nobody was running the orbs right.
---
Can’t wait 😂
---
What the fuck is wrong with you. 
---
Stop playing video games if it has that much control over you.
---
This guy   [https://www.twitch.tv/fakeqt](https://www.twitch.tv/fakeqt) :) Mage above lvl 40

---
It’s rude to simply decline without a message
---
30-35 is doable with quests if you get creative about where you do the questing
---
STV will be a colossal pain in the ass for everyone on both sides but there are zones with quests in that range
---
55-60 is universally cancer tho
---
I've been talking about this possibility as well. Forking off a new line of expansions with classic style design would be SO cool. The question is how they would do it. 
---
Using tbc (and so on) lore but designing classes, loot, features, etc differently? Outland without flying mounts is a big change, for one. It's made with flying in mind. 
---
Making a entirely new time-line, lore wise? That's challenging, and will require a much bigger team. 
---
Either way it's a really big project compared to classic, which is just building a game that plays exactly like vanilla, but in a more modern game engine. No changes means there's really no decision making to be done, except the question of "how do we make this feel and play like the vanilla reference server?".
---
One can dream, tho. Man it would be amazing.
---
Lock for dps or Sham for healer, depending on your preference. Lock gets a free mount, but imo farming soul shards is a pain. If you go shaman melee will love you for windfury, if you go lock you'll have healthstones/bres.
---
No way, really? I feel like I've been slow...
---
WE ARE BREAKING THE CONDITIONING!!!!!!!!!!!11!!1!
---
Yeah rocks are needed but are extremely cheap and not worth a bag or bank slot at level 60. Just vendor them and buy them when you need them later. Save some of each type of leather too. That is also used for some engineering patterns too.
---
Bubbas crab boat
---
Yes, have the same issues, but no solution, yet. Not a connection problem, though. :/
---
I never want to see that fucking thing again as long as I live.
---
My group ran into the same problem last night. The troll ran really far right in the middle of the next pack and didn't agro. He didn't run back our direction for at least 30 and not towards a player.
---
Exactly the problem. We made guys on the first servers, then changed to the first new ones, then changed to the newer ones before release day. 8k queues. Couple of our mates changed to the ones even after launch.... still queues.
---
Add despawn? WTF Is that really a thing in retail? Kinda glad I’ve mostly avoided that.
---
I meant for you to take a break from the game... 
---
These things happen in online games, but the general sentiment is that the community has shifted to a much more cooperative experience. If you're constantly grouped with the same people, then you will undoubtedly struggle to notice people being more giving and friendly (as most of the groups needs are covered by the group). 
---
Take a break. If you aren't having fun, then don't play the game. Playing the game while ragging on it is somewhat counterintuitive, no?
---
I don't want to derail your post... but stuff like that still happens to me in retail WoW all the time. I think a lot of people who are writing posts about 'how social classic is!' are people who're making an effort to be social in classic that they do not make in retail.
---
Make the effort on either one, and you'll find it's very similar.
---
Probably because they personally don't like the game and see their friends moving to a game they don't want to play.
---
I've been playing on atiesh from 6am to the time I go to work, and its been great for me. Queues when I get off work.
---
Still living with your mom is more Yikes than "cool dude"
---
Lmao you’re an idiot if you do this
---
Huh? Retail is literally full of pop culture references like this. Its actually gotten obnoxious.
---
That’s just how little I was man
---
Priest is a pretty universal class that you can tailor to what you'd like to do and be decent at it, don't think you need to worry about your matchup with a random class in a 1v1 situation
---
It is in my neighbor's yard so I decided not to lose rep 😉
---
Fucking weeb.
---
There is no bigger sacrifice than giving your soulstone to someone else when you're just out and about. Anyone who gets one should consider themselves extremely lucky.
---
he's braindead apparently if he's not able to understand the concept of people reserving spots for when they wanna play later, causing other people to not get a spot unnecessarily.
---
I was able to get a few friends to play classic who have never played WoW before. They occasionally get frustrated with stuff (Defias Pillagers), but I haven't seen them this excited and happy to play something in a long time. I can't wait until we can start to pvp.

---
You've provided the perfect answer to prove my point about entitlement. The caps for emphasis really speaks volumes about your character.
---
Conversely, stoneclaw totem has proven itself an irreplaceable ally while I work on my herbalism and fishing
---
I totally get why people are mad at the "you think you want this but you dont", but its not like the changes made to retail were there to fuck players over.
---
Sometimes things have unintended consequences.
---
My only fear is that these realms become low pop/unplayable in a few months
---
Arent there tents in the game with human faces on it? Some creatures can skin humans I guess
---
That's not immersion, that's gear progression.
---
If someone happens to have nice gear then it doesn't shatter the vibe of being an adventurer in a fantasy world in the way someone driving by on a motorcycle that is too loud does.

Everytime I don't play orc i feel like a void

Yes in wrath is when Activision bought blizzard. No one will disagree with that but wrath was the last good expansion imo

Malfurion is in Darnassus. Illidan has fucked off to outlands and was first seen in BC I believe.

Arthas is also in Northrend which was the 3rd expansion pack.

The important thing there is.... he is PLAYING.... atm the OP is paying blizzard to look at a log in screen for 7 hours a night.

This guy is paying blizzard to actually play the game.

Back in my day the flightpoints weren't connected. Sometimes you fly to a place and you couldn't fly to the next one so you would fly back...
---
you mean get through queue
---
Except there are 3 stances.
---
Ah thanks for the reminder!
---
I just love love love how every level up in classic is huge. You get talent points, you get weapon skills up, you get to use new items that you couldn’t use before, you get to learn new or level up spells from trainer.
---
I've been playing for years.  How did i not know this!!!  I could have days of my life back.
---
It's an unsupported card so the best anyone here can really say is just a solid maybe. It supports dx10 but that doesn't mean there aren't features the game relies on that the GPU doesn't have. It could just be that the listed minimum are what's needed to run at a certain framerate and resolution meaning weaker ones will work but just run worse. You'd have to either just try it yourself or find someone who has tested it on the same GPU.
---
yeah when you kill a raid boss, all the add despawn.
---
as a Shaman, all I can give back is a "thank you" and a hug
---
You have a few hours of progress that is worth more than enjoying time with your friends.  And the great part is that your 'sunken cost fallacy' starts at 20 hours, and it will only get worse as you spend more time selfishly choosing yourself over your friends.
---
But you know, youre the one resorting to crass epithets having now been faced with your own egocentric nature.  You do you, booboo.  Im glad you have friends who are used to you choosing yourself over them.
---
I have an orc shaman on Grobbulus but I was defeated by queue boss so I started playing on Deviate Delight. On a whim I made a human paladin since I wasn't really intending to play much on that server.
---
Well, they're the same level now, so I guess I'm officially a double agent.
---
it barely did anything, queus are still 10k +
---
I just don’t sit in Q
---
Your sense of humor is still appreciated, I thought the same thing upon seeing this.
---
It's useful to have stance swaps before overpower or whirlwind, but I have no idea why you would want this just for 2 specific stances. You also need to go zerker stance a lot. Just bind "special action button" 1/2/3 to alt-1/2/3 or ctrl-1/2/3 and you don't need this macro.
---
Queues from the 6
---
I was waiting for a big raid on the docks but that was just disappointing
---
I saw a low of shamans day 1, now I see a pretty even spread of everything except druids and shamans.
---
I’m fairly sure movement is one of the things addons are not allowed to do. If you’re lucky there might be one that reskins that window, but I’m like 99% sure that’s the best an addon can do.
---
Yeah but what if he starts eating you?

No because I'm not a fooken casual

It's not a matter of making it hard to level. It's about making it a social experience. What is standing out to me right now is that because the servers are closed boxes, I already start to know the names of the people that are playing and chatting in the general channels and most probably I'll see them around the other zones as I level up.
---
With the cross realms thingy, the whole experience is "i play solo and sometimes 4 random names that could be bots, play with me to rush through some quests that require a group".
---
And yet i didn't forget about those two behind the rock.
---
Maybe i should have ran past it like i didn't know
---
I'm so happy to learn this. I Love snipping tool but having to open it up was annoying xD
---
i feel you bro
---
Our guild rerolled to Aahkandi because of the queue. 15 min queue at peak is nice.
---
But I like the red cloak :(
---
you have to shift click on t he quest in the quest window to track it. then it will show up there.
---
Queue dodging is easy with no one to leave behind!
---
No one cares what you want to know, we'd rather call you a piece of shit.
---
Try selling stuff in a major city. I have to get people to invite me to a group so that it phases me into their layer. Every. Single. Time.
---
Solution: restarting game fixed it for me
---
We can't hold aggro for shit b/c we can't hit shit. As a tank I won't try to tank a dungeon at a lowish level not b/c of survivability but b/c I can't hit shit.
---
My laptop has an intel hd 4000, laptop model came out in 2011, and it runs at 60 fps on the default settings. It does tend to run really hot after a few hours of playing but I have an external fan that i switch on to cool it back off.

I guess it’s because when you die you lose a significant amount of durability to your armor.

I never played wow classic and I am enjoying it a lot  
---
I played Daoc back then and when I looked at WoW it was way different from what I expected in those days. To me WOw Classic should have been the state of WoW for ever, even if back then it hadn't the pvp of Daoc , in the current era, it is the same feeling of old-school MMO ( to me, WoW classic is THE LAST of its style, and the one that sets  the precedent of the new MMOs that in my opinion have change drasticly the genre into something I don't like at all )
---
My brother in law played a lot before they had my niece. I caught him reading the website about it and hovering over the "sign up" button and I was laughing inside. Poor guy misses it so.

[Use Curseforge filtered for 1.13.2.](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons?filter-game-version=2020709689%3A7350&amp;filter-sort=4)
---
My opinion is that most players playing classic want similar things, a new begining and a better community, leaving the toxic mentality behind them in retail.
---
The game has the merits of attracting those idealistic peope at the very least! And to some degree, having less mechanism for automating the social aspects of grouping. Either from lack of dungeon finder or atomated shared tags, increased general difficulty etc. that encourage people to stop and think about needing to group at all.
---
Sounds about right, maybe more on the 5 hours side. Yesterday a 12k queue took about 6 hours. I almost had hope the server queue issues were fixed because in the morning I got on right away (said High population) and around 1pm it said full but I got in instantly as well.
---
Now it's 9k.
---
Apparently not. Doesn’t really matter though since addons can’t mess with movement.
---
For every 1 line that was posted there were a thousand more tags stolen with Earth Shock.
---
I just chase them down and give them my warlock cookies :D
---
I remember calling it VC, which was fine because Dire Maul became DM. 
---
(shattered hand) I have a feeling this is probably server specific.
---
This is what people cant seem to grasp. That each server had lingo for different things. They remember vanilla being a community, but don't remember that each community had their own thing. It's like the world. Each country has a language and thinks the other is doing it wrong, but it's all the same stuff.
---

Clearing a dungeon isn't as fun unless you went in and failed a couple times.
---
Holy shit that’s hilarious
---
.. I'm not sure what that has to do with anything. If you don't like classic, you don't like classic, that's perfectly fine. Don't waste time on something you don't enjoy.
---
I’d uninstall after that cause that sounds like hell

Hey thanks!

---
You don’t have such a glorious mustache.
---
it'll calm down in about 2 or 3 weeks.
---
Most people are only here for the hype. once they leave, AFK or not, there won't be any queues.
---
This game is 15 years old, so the younger generations won't stick around. They'll go back to fortnite, or a more advanced MMO.
---
You can already see them complaining about questing, poor graphics, poorly designed mechanics. Just wait a little more, and they'll be gone.
---
Not yet, but I'm only level 8. Now if you asked how many times I ran away while making sure my imp stays back to die, that number would be higher.
---
Fake news. I think the dwarves actually burnt it down by accident on a drunken rage.
---
Like I said, heirlooms contributed to the problem but they were not the sole cause of decline in retail. They changed the game in a way that I no longer enjoy. We have different tastes when it comes to the game and that's fine. I'm happy you enjoy retail for what it is, and now I have classic to enjoy as well. At this point, they are practically two completely different games.

Thanks for the responses all! I'm leaning towards Deviate, for the name if nothing else.

Does anyone have a sense of what lower population actually feels like, in terms of DD? I enjoy servers that have a small enough population for you to know a lot of people around.
---
OOF
---
Made this account years ago I no longer bartend.
---
Uh anyone who wants to grind to max level can just look up a guide and book a weekend to play. Boom.
---
Why? Are you mad you didn't think of it?
---
The game really eases you in to everything, while also not holding your hand. You have to hunt down questgivers, and will often discover you missed a few completely. If you pay attention to the quest text and let the game carry you forward for a bit until you're comfortable , you'll be fine.

Dude. The first peacebloom I tried to collect hit me with a **Failed Attempt** and I was like WHAT. my buddy returned with a "what..?" and all I could say is "I failed to collect the flower??" And he started laughing "yyyep!"
---
It was this amongst many other things that were just all rushing back to me last night as I was playing again for the first time in many, many years.
---
And this is why I play a mage, get to org much faster
---
Most classic players weren’t actively subscribed pre-release, let alone active in BfA online communities. They talked shit about BfA amongst themselves mainly. Entirely different from joining a classic wow subreddit and playing classic purely to undermine it.
---
No you’re breathtaking
---
I mean it has been 15yrs. I cleared every dungeon + raid in vanilla and I doubt I'll remember most of the boss mechanics I used to be able to do half asleep.
---
I think at level 14, even if mind blast had no cool down, it would still be faster to do a single mind blast and use the wand. The thing is a freaking CANNON
---
Damn that sucks.
---
It might be more "efficient"  but I always felt that reducing your playtime to a checklist generated by someone else made it a chore.  from what I've heard, that's all live is now:  a daily checklist
---
I'm not going to tell anyone how to play, but I'll never stop telling people that "it's ok to not take the shortest road to the end".
---
I dont know I guess I was overthinking the whole best setup possible for different scenarios
---
Bro I feel you, i can't decide between rogue / mage / priest and at this point i rather not play than invest x hundred hours and realise i rather had played another class. Like, healing is appealing, but so is mage and rogue. But i dont see myself being happy having to buy posion / flash powders every day just to use abilities. like........
---
I haven't downloaded the classic one. The retail one has a button at the top that sorts the junk from the good stuff for you. That may be in part to additional addons. Not sure.

---
there is a dw fury tanking spec for warriors that becomes viable in the later stages of vanilla ie t2/aq40/t3 geared tank/healer core
---
it gets hit a lot harder but it generates WAY more threat, which becomes the more pressing concern at those gear levels, is generating enough threat to maintain agro over t2/aq40/t3 geared dps
---
Pally has kings and auras!
---
Yeah man my best gaming friend abandoned me cause he wakes up at 6am and plays all day on his full server but my other friend was like fuck it man! I wanna play with my homie!! And made a character on my server so keep your head up. From what I’ve experienced this community is amazing
---
Yeah, I just looked it up. Also, I had completely forgotten about eye of kilrogg! Had some fun times running around with that!
---
I actually did download it, but obviously the server select screen isnt a great stress test.

Divide by 14 and multiply by weapon speed. For normalized instant attacks, weapon speed is replaced by 1.7 for daggers, 2.4 for other one-handers, and 3.3 for two-handers.
---
Oh shoot he got shoulda pads
---
In fairness, we're like 4 days in. The real test is player retention, and the only answer to that is time.
---
That being said...I just logged in again and saw MORE servers O_o?! Classic is succeeding beyond my wildest expectations, I'm heavily betting on the retention of this game, and I'm looking forward to seeing how Blizz is going to tactfully eat crow on this one.
---
Just start playing and if you feel you need to, read some guides online, but only if necessary. Reading guides doesn't ruin the experience imo, it didn't for me when I first started playing so you should be good. 
---
As for guides every thing you need is here: https://classic.wowhead.com/
---
I think the true success will be in 6 months. Will the same amount of people still he playing? That will be the eye opener for me.
---
Stop worrying and go play the game.

 In furtherance of that nomination I would state that Keanu Reeves' example of humility, graciousness and kindness should be practiced at all times in Azeroth.
---
The interesting part of the talent trees and trainers is that I know exactly why they made the changes they made, in fact they make perfect sense.... but it's not fun. It doesn't matter if 90% of the community always goes with the same talents, it's just more fun to have to train abilities and spend points on cool upgrades.
---
It does. I keep telling my mage brother to give me int on my rogue, he almost never does. Doesn't make much of a difference in the end, but I like to have my skills all capped each level.
---
I'm trying to time out my queue tonight... I just hopped in and it was at 7,600 but I won't get home until probably 10 or later.
---
In WOTLK they started adding some major convenience changes. Heirlooms, epic gear for completing enough dungeons which let you skip raid tiers, and then the dungeon finder. 
---
The game was at its zenith, and with 10m players many of these seemed like a welcome change. We had all been leveling through the same zones for a long time and many of us had busier lives than we did back in vanilla and BC. But therein lay the poison. I probably wouldn't have gotten to even set foot in ICC if not for welfare epics and the dungeon finder. But because of those everything that came afterwards just felt more like a disneyland ride than a world to explore. 
---
All that is not to say that I think WOW should never make changes. Of course it should. I think the devs should be open to doing new a bold things. But accessibility should not be a reason to make major changes to the game.
---
No addons and go into it and pick a character that you really like and a class that seems most interesting to you. Get immersed into the story and stick it out for the first few levels if you aren’t feeling it, the game gets incredibly rewarding.
---
It is clearly not on the flight path, look at the picture?
---
Don't remember the level, but I was doing well until Skull Rock, then everything changed.
---
Elvui for classic was my one must have or I’m not playing. Been using it on retail forever.
---
Pretty sure there is also a quest wand in Silverpine you can get even quicker.
---
Yeah mate, I actually just moved from the EU to the US so I'm quite aware of what house pricing is.  Fairly affordable.

go on your own adventure, go to a new zone when you run out of quests, etc. no need to rush to 60 but if you really want to then I guess pay for it. Part of the fun of vanilla is having your own adventure
---
I think this is a bit of an oversimplification (but not totally wrong).
---
I dont think an LFG auto-grouping tool is for the lowest common denominator, it just allows players to engage with the world rather than spam trade chat in one of the cities, for example.  For the majority if players (which isnt the same as the lowest common demoninator), better quality of life makes the game smoother and more enjoyable.

My favorite thing is seeing a lvl 12 Druid say something like "Balance druid LFG RFC"

Bro, you have 3 talent points.  How much of a difference do you think those 3 talent points make in determining what "spec" you are?  You are just a Druid, doing anything a Druid can do.

Last night I was doing a standard “kill n targets” quest. A rogue was obviously doing the same quest so I sent a group invite. Declined and then deliberately stole any target I was casting against (priest).

Well fuck you too, I guess.

OTOH, several other people eagerly grouped up for those quests and we finished them up much faster than if we did them independently.

I like your stance. But money definitely buys happiness. It buys stability. Which is buying comfort. Which is buying peace of mind. Which is cashing in less stress for more happiness.

No way... top players are only at 51-52 right now so I'd imagine it's going to take them a day or two more to hit 60.  That means they would only have a few days to try and get get geared and also find 39 other people that are equally as geared.

Throws multiple errors, but seems to be working anyway. Thanks!
---
Boil em, mash em, stick em in a stew!
---
Herb / Alchemy. potions help with leveling and you can tank your own scholomance flask runs.
---
when a gryphon flies above me I keep looking around scared someone just dropped from his flying mount to gank my ass
---
i don't mind daily log in rewards as long as you limit what they do. TBC is a great example of good daily rewards. you can only do 10 dailies you will at most have 2 max level characters only really 1 that can do the dailies. what do you get? well rep so you can buy a cosmetic mount and gold a lot of it. that means it has an end unless you need gold.
---
now look at BfA how many alts do you have 12 every class at max level how much dailiy content is there to do about 1-2 hours worth per character and nothing has a clear end point so you can spend your entire day just doing endless dailiy reward stuff and not being able to finish it. but what is worse is that you do the same thing 12 times in that day.
---
there is a real issue with retail WoW around alt balancing.
---
My son used to fly around on my mounts and explore the world while I was at work. Each day I’d log in and be in for a surprise for where my character was left parked. 
---
On Launch day, he rolled a Dwarf Hunter.
---
There are definitely kids who play retail coming to classic. Some of them have literally grown up listening to how awesome it was.
---
If you can beat em join em?
---
They've already mentioned the possibility but too early for promises.
---
There's like one person at 50 at this point? I haven't checked the leaderboards yet. 40 60s by week 2 would be impressive for a guild to pull off, plus you need a lot of rep for the glyphs. Month 1 Rag is going to be impressive.
---
Classic not easy. It is a different type of difficult. The mechanics are easy. The numbers are hard. Tank threat is low. Healing sometimes just doesn't measure up to boss damage output. More natural gating mechanics like rep, resistance, and dps thresholds are common. This game is not going to fall over in a week.
---
Final Fantasy XIV is pretty good. New xpac is the tits.
---
In what region? There were 3 for US - East, it's just one became the streamer server, one became the Spanish server, and that left Herod.
---
To be fair, I haven't bought Zygor in Classic yet.  My friend is using it and he's unhappy, and on Zygor's website people seem upset with it.
---
Didn't know that. Thanks for heads up! Haven't accidentaly stolen a kill yet by just throwing an arcane shot and serpent sting when I'm running by though.
---
I love this so much
---
Am I missing something?
---
E: I'm blind, just saw the currency lmao
---
Should've bought the guy a wow code and then the guy has to go one additional step to be successful in getting any money.
---
I didn't like zygor at all. It keep sending me from crossroad to silverpine to do 2-3 quest, then crossroad 1 quest, then thunderbluff to do 1 quest, then crossroad. Wtf. The only good is the in game add on.
---
I have arcane int bound to mouse wheel up. Anyone I pass gets it. Especially warriors and rogues.
---
Don’t blame them even without the afking the queues would be ridiculous
---
Grats!
---
I now want the name "Who".
---
&gt;	Look, Blizzard really believes in and loves layering, they wanted to keep it in forever, the only reason they say it’s out in phase 2 is because of the nochanges crowd. By keeping servers low, they have a ready made excuse to keep it in game, and honestly I kinda of hope they do.
---
They’ve said since the very beginning that they understand that layering/sharding does not belong and that they view it as a necessary evil for launch. It has nothing to do with the outcry from the nochanges crowd.
---
I always panic when someone buffs and runs past me. I have to target them /wave /bow and whisper thank you and also buff them in a window of 3 seconds of motion. I should make a macro...
---
This, you might encounter 1 ass that refuses to take you because you’re not minmaxing but it won’t matter at all in the long run.
---
Ya, I log off fully just so others can get in and then try to queue in about 6hrs prior to when I want to play just because that’s how long it’s been taking to get in. Today I went in too early. May have to have the wife or try using chrome remote to toggle my character until I’m back home.
---
Oh somebody mad.
---
No queue on sulfuras haha
---
My god yeah fuck those things, whoever thought it was a good idea to give the noisiest type of mount to every level 1 must be deaf.
---
Because even if 10% of the population stays on Classic, that's still a fuckton of people that truly wanted it. But it's more realistic for about 40%-60% of people staying on classic, which is enough for highly populated filled servers due to the high server capacities, even since before the launch.
---
It is fact that enough people wanted it.
---
Today I had a bad experience... when I found a chest I got into combat by accident and a guy saw that and ran in front of me saying: "sorry but I can't miss the opportunity". End of story: my toon died he got the chest, and his excuse was that if he was a horde player that move would be normal. The worst of all this is that he knew it was a dirty move. Anyway. Time to move on.
---
 I legitimately have a fun time with kill quests simply because grinding mobs is a lot of fun. You never know what will happen or what will drop.
---
Harder to week 1 MC when you can't pay corrupt gms for geared level 60s.
---
My wife supports my nerdness. She gets to watch years worth of crappy Netflix reruns with only my occasional snarky comment, and I get to nerd out while she occasionally comments on how hot my Night Elf Huntress looks. The kids sit with me sometimes helping me play by spamming the jump button while I run around. Makes me look like a real vanilla veteran to my guild homies.
---
Really brings me back seeing these weird ass guilds recruiting in general. I’ve seen some very bizarre names and recruiting messages. Can’t even imagine the type of guild chat going on in these rag tag groups of randoms.
---
It’s not within Blizzard’s ability to fix this. All they can do is take action against players using it.
---
Whenever I see VC I think they want to use voice chat... Who in their right mind calls it VC, it's pretty obvious no one in Westfall at 18-20 wants to do dire maul
---
Lol ok bub. I actually do, used to raid during Vanilla but sure “I don’t know” hahahaha you’re fucking pathetic.
---
But is there any official Cartographer for WoW Classic. I cannot find it even for patch 8.2.0. Or should I download something for 1.12.1 from wow vanilla websites?
---
Playing something like shaman in dungeons it's hard to click mobs sometimes so the tab/auto attack mapped to a hotkey helps a lot. 50% of the time shamans are autoattacking lol
---
Not sure where it all went wrong but,. Compared to retail endgame isn't all that matters. As others have said, take your time, there is no commitment needed. Relax, play the game and just adventure and enjoy the world. Endgame will still be there when you complete that journey. Just let yourself get sucked in and take it at a pace you're fine with.
---
I actually did that
---
Summoner I believe. Yea give it a try. Maybe check out people's streams to watch the game.
---
That’s a power move. If you’re on whitemane whisper me lol! Names plebb
---
So you're a bag guy
---
All full slots is bad guy
---
No linen I'm sad guy
---
Need no tip is rad guy
---
I'm that poor type
---
No one buys my ore type
---
A stranger in org type
---
Need my guilds support type
---
 I'm not a baaaaag guy, duh
---
Lol. Thanks. I can’t get down to plug my computer in to the wall, so no Warcraft for me today 😞
---
Are you on the streamer server? They said a select few would still have queues. It’s also hitting the time that Americans are getting home from work so if you’re US that’s why.
---
I'm the Bagman!!  Ski-bi dibby dib yo da dub dub
---
And I still roll on all the +spirit gear.
---
&gt;calling yourself autistic to own the guy that called someone else autistic
---
OMG YES
---
You think you do.
---
does this sub really need more brainless circlejerk posts?
---
He's right though if you think about it.
---
I've been doing Oxygen Not Included.
---
Didn't work.
---
Blows my mind that people are still playing on servers with these insane queues.
---
He's the one who's upset.  I just feel bad for his friends, thats all.
---
He's resorting to calling me dipshit and making assumptions about my highschool career.
---
Nah, I agree with you. Like I am all for helping others and many times i've sent something to friends who never asked but I know they needed. But I would rather this guy just be honest and beg for a sub rather than the what are my options route knowing he is hoping for a generous person.
---
ngl, love having it in retail, super glad it’s not present in classic though
---
I told many people this wouldn't happen.  Got a lot of Flak for it too about how easy classic wow was.  I'm enjoying the slowness of it, knew all along they wouldn't as well.  Week two is a high likelihood though.
---
People have also forgotten Naxx (4Horse+) and AQ (Cthun) fights, many who think they are gonna blow this content will hit a serious wall when there.  Once they hit them and realize they aren't the same here as they are in private servers, there will be a reckoning on the pride.
---
All good though, take your time and try to enjoy the game, this isn't a race at all.
---
Dude, there was literally one guy who ran past me to stop and craft me grand wand and some nice legs, I was like "thank you sir". He/she hugged me afterwards.
---
Thank you, comrade!
---
My friends are all rushing, it's basically killed my desire to play.
---
Idk, I keep seeing people on Herod get in with no Queue, seems to be much easier to get in at the standard working week bedtimes.
---
Sorry but this is probably the worst suggestion I've ever seen. WoW limiting play time? There would be an outrage.
---
Holy shit. I'm exactly 30yo. WoW ruined my life back in 2004. I had to repeat 2 years of high school because of it.
---
Fuck this rain guys
---
My work laptop IS my gaming laptop. Meaning that I have to bring it to work during the day. So remote desktop isn't an option for me :(
---
As long as you remember that rogues didn't actually get bucklers.
---
I am using Vuhdo in retail and in Classic. 
---
Not sure if curseforge or the twitchapp has a classic Version for Vuhdo yet, but you can find one on wowinterface.
---
Because they think Mythic+ makes their dick bigger.
---
When servers are doing endgame raids we’ll see if the player base is still this bloated.
---
didn't take you as long to figure out who this was as I'd hoped it would. Now I gotta get a new name.
---
I walked into Brill last night for the first time and almost cried.
---
and the week before, it was free! Next week it will be $60.
---
Haha. What a way to play. Got some friends who are first timers as well. The questions are great.
---
A few bosses of MC? Sure.
---
Ragnaros? No way.
---
For those who don't know, MC has a minimum level of 50.
---
I hate that they are using legion gnomes and not vanilla gnomes. They are too big!
---
You will appreciate my underwater breathing buff one day.
---
Sometimes enemies will just straight up drop nothing. Classic just be like that.
---
Some mobs don't have loot but the game still says they are lootable. It was that way in vanilla
---
Most servers have smaller queues but still hours of waiting. Grobbulus went from a 12k queue to about a 6k queue after the hotfix
---
Who could have possibly predicted this?! Oh that's right... we did.
---

---
i have been playing almost all day since it came out this week. currently level 30+. what sucks is that i don't see many people ingame anymore because i'm so far ahead. \`/who\` in STV right now just shows three other alliance players! and i have to coordinate in discord just to find people who want to run any dungeon beyond Deadmines.
---
meanwhile if i go to Redridge/Lakeshire where the more casual players are currently working on, it's brimming with people running around, socializing, looking for groups, etc. 
---
i think casual leveling is the way to go if you want to have fun.
---
Yeah I've had it too. I noticed in red ridge it happened about 50/50 with the trantulas. I ended up just shift click looting them. Seemed to fix the bug.
---
Stonespine has had a queue every day so far between 5-9pm.
---
Some quest are intresting, for example when they sent me to goldshire for horseshoe and the blacksmith said he will give 50 horseshoe. I read the quest and think in, ''wtf they want soeing 12 and half horse or what?''
---
No. Shouldn’t have to explain the difference ‘playing the game’ and idle macroing...
---
Queueing up before I get home so I can play then is much different than taking up an active spot on the server while I *don’t play*. But you’re right, I don’t care enough about this to continue this discussion anymore.
---
I also played on Deathwing. I exclusively heard the dungeon referred to as VC and was corrected if I called it DM
---
It's still your own decision to endure queues so you can play with your friends, as opposed to going on less popular servers and making new friends. An option you're unwilling to take is still an option.
---
Something that's tickled me is the raw chaos of the economy. Yesterday some dude was trading greens for goretusk livers and other quest items or "herbs in any reasonable quantity." Smart as fuck.
---
I think its cause retail is so easy compared to classic. Classic is so difficult that there is real incentives to be decent and to team up with other decent people for mutual gain and protection.
---
Wait are you seriously not understanding this right now lol. I thought you might be trolling, but you actually don't get it hahaha
---
Less people knowing about RDP means less people online during the day, which increases the likelihood of us being able to get in earlier because LESS PEOPLE WILL BE IN QUEUE
---
You are fucking DUMB BRO HAHAHAHAAH
---
i don't think you're really reading what i'm saying. i'm talking about people who haven't engaged with the wow community, who haven't had angsty classic wow fans attack them. i talked to someone like this just last night.
---
My Girlfriend tried Retail and she loved it! She plays a deathknight and just smashes all the buttons, then  runs to the next mobs. Perfect game for her
---
Dads still in que. Never did get those cigarettes
---
$18 for 2 gold is a rip off.  You can make that in an hour grinding mobs and cooking and vendoring it all.
---
Jesus I hate having so many max lvl characters in retail. That is what I did as well. Weapon emissary? Lets do this 6 times with different characters, even though I don’t play any of it extensively.
---
You're blaming players when its blizzard who has the technology but fucked up. You're literally defending blizzard.
---
You got the name Sam/ Nice one hah.
---
i mean around 15 the benefit will falter enough to were it dosen't matter but before that oh boy is the buff big.
---
Quartz cast bar has a swing timer and is working in classic
---
Nope, been logging in mid afternoon and logging off at night. Remulos OC
---
That contact though 😂
---
As a paladin I bless everyone I see
---
Nobody hurt me, you seem like you need to try and tell people to go to your low pop server cause your friends all left you for bigger servers. I actually haven't even sat in a queue a single time for Herod, its been a great last few days.
---
Definitely do your voidwalker quest if you haven't. if you're fighting mobs your level, for an easier time, set your mob on 1 of them and cast corruption and curse of agony, then cast those 2 on another mob, then fear it and cast immolate, if fear runs off just recast it, then focus down the mob fighting your voidy :)
---
Lol the millions that played Classic 15 years ago will tell you it isn’t just hype
---
Same. Glad I saw this.
---
Noted. Guess I’ll have to find a numpad emulator.
---
Looks good, pretty much the same spec I linked, except for those 4 points I said you could move from Totemic Focus.
---
No egg, break it &gt;:(
---
Glad I'm not in that server.

Ouch, it's really much worse on EU servers.
---
No just picked a low pop server which is now high but never had a Q.
---
Worked for many other games. Why not WOW? 
---
I don’t mean you can’t play for more than 12 hours a day. It simply disconnects you. You’re free to reconnect directly after.
---
At least it solves the problem of AFK’ers.
---
Now that's a solid meme!
---
Are you for real? There's 8-10 hour queues on all EU pvp realms and you are still refusing to give due blame...
---
oh yeah sorry, looked at the wrong row in my records. But the other two look pretty queueless
---
I came from RuneScape too and it was such a jump but after a while of trying and testing you get used to it- I no longer play RS which should say something!! :)
---
Instead of training skills, like Slayer or Smithing, the onus is on your character level ultimately and everything you do will be to mostly progress that.
---
At 60 you get to endgame content (raids) but until then you are doing quests, dungeons and exploring the world, which are a lot of fun! Don’t try to rush to get to 60, enjoy every level up to it (which will take a while), and with each you can feel your character getting stronger. :)
---
The quests aren’t comparable to the ones in RS; they are mostly just kill x or collect x, which isn’t necessarily bad!
---
Don’t be afraid to ask for help, type /1 to enter the general chat channel if you’re looking for help with a mob or quest because most of the time, others are also looking to do it too. 
---
Though If you wanna know more about the lore, story and progression of wow, look up Nobbel and Bellular on YouTube, because personally I wanted to know what was happening in the game (I.e who are the Horde and Alliance, why are they fighting, why are there certain playable races etc)
---
But apart from that, don’t see the game as a grind, ask for help, try befriend where you can and keep an eye out for any guild you like the look of because there you’ll hopefully find some cool people to play with which is a game changer.
---
yeah, actually thinking of deleting the lvl 30 i spent all week leveling so far and never looking back.
---
What are the benefits of having an alt in Classic?  I never even hit 60 in real vanilla, so I have no idea what shit was really like back then.  I'm leveling a warlock with my friends, but it's pretty slow-going so far finding time where everyone is available to play.  It's really not scratching that "itch" for me, I cleared off a lot more time this week/weekend than everyone else apparently.
---
I don't have any intention of leveling past them, it's not worth missing out on this probably once-in-a-lifetime experience with my friends.  But I also really want to play more than I'm being "allowed".  However, I don't want to just be pointlessly burning my own time.  Is there any actual point in having an alt in Classic?  I'm not sure, because it seems like everything takes so long that you maybe can only afford to have one character of any actual value, unless you want to torch your entire life grinding.  Is that true, or are there tangible benefits to having 2 characters at 60 (eventually), even if one of them doesn't get any of the raid/grind stuff?
---
The bit about someone having to be hospitalized - doesn't that seem like a weird AF flex for them?
---
I have an opinion as well, and it's likely a shit as your opinion.
---
Buying gold fuxks the economy  and comes usually at the expense of someone's compromised act. That's the real problem
---
You’re doing the lords work!
---
The said they massively increased server capacity and increased the amount layers each server had to reduce queues.
---
This. When they were first released it was a good way to get some gold and a couple decent items from the rep, as well as the mount (Netherdrake, etc). Now it's like half the game.
---
what is this anime?
---
This isn't needed at the moment at all. Let people move their characters between servers and guilds and friend groups will move. This is how you disperse the playerbase by this point. The best option would have been if enough servers were open from the get-go but it's a bit late for that.
---
I've been drinking green tea all week to try &amp; stay awake. My body literally woke me up this morning &amp; my first thought was WoW before Work!!!!! Today was supposed to be my cardio day &amp; I like to think all the running I did around Azeroth counts.
---
This crack is really moreish
---
Because we are older, wiser, and appreciate the small stuff
---
It really is jarring seeing that.  It feels like something that should be a parody of WoW, not wow itself.
---
Hey! I'm helping!
---
Yup, just flew over Camp Taurajo to get to Camp Taurajo via Crossroads haha.
---
Just brought back memories of sitting in Org for an hour before raid starts crafting 10 stacks of water to pass out to the homies.
---
No. If you can't afford a few cents a day then you should probably not be playing anyway.
---
https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/weaponswingtimer/

Amazing isn’t it, haha

This was when I learned about sap taking you out of stealth  back in the day. I first used it on one of those assholes without reading how sap worked and got straight ruined when, shocked that I was being attacked, i never tab targeted and stabbed the sapped one instead...

Your raging fucking autism. This whole threads reads like you're full of tard rage.

Just got 45 tailoring so I think that’s really all I can make at the moment

For everything else there is flight points. : )

It’s absolutely the worst! We were dead yesterday and the day before and it was absolutely torture having to just sit here and be bored. Here I am, almost done with the week and it’s the beginnings of another slow day....
---
Pray for me, and Lok’tar friends.
---
Couldn't be more fucking true. I'm trying to resist the urges pretty hard at 30.
---
Sometimes the login servers have queues, then the realm queue
---
Saaaaaaaaaame
---
This. I USED to be able to pull all nighters and be fine for work...15 years later and day 3 of game I have sore back, sore knees, shoulder stiff, eyes burn,  and a lack of sleep “gameover”. It’s magnificent!!
---
Thank god they can't wear plate armor!
---
Yep I’m playing as a Priest and love buffing people with Fort.
---
I’m looking to create a macro with some Priesty words as I play on a RP server, but would like a few random sayings when buffing to keep it fresh, any ideas on how to do this?
---
Or they know but they’re too afraid to get it themselves
---
I think every class has some abilities that should be skipped for leveling. I don't know for sure what should be skipped on rogue but looking through the list, I think I'd probably skip Expose Armor, Detect Traps, ranks of kick above the first, Feint, and Disarm Trap. Everything else seems like it would be useful for leveling. I'm certainly no rogue expert though so I could be wrong about some of those.
---
Playing as a Orc Warrior, I approve this message.
---
3 kids , full time job, garden and hobbies.
---
I am here for the fun, the journey and maybe some world pvp . I may never reach 60 . I may have 10 lvl 30.  Im here for the social fun this game promotes..
---
If I was trying to defend your position I would not engage people willing to look at facts either, but on the off chance that you are still reading this I truly hope that you understand I don’t want to diminish the culpability of the holocaust, it was clearly genocide. Clearly it was premeditated and made use of many methods of murder not just starvation. I also hope that you (as a living and breathing person) can grow into a mental state that allows you to engage in productive reasonable discourse with other people based on facts.

Stick to bfa

---
Thank you for your input!
---
If you are trying to level skip these quests (escort ones value of xp to time isn't worth it) unless you want experience that is. You are gna get the odd escort bug always used to get them :)
---
Thank the devs not blizzard
---
Depends really, as a new player I would say just do the quests until you kind of naturally go to a new zone. If you like lore like me, I find it fun to do the quest slowly, read the quest text and find out what is happening and why I am killing something. Sometimes it is interesting and sometimes it is not. If you just want to level quickly just do quests and kill everything along the way, and then when you can try and find a group to do dungeons (think level 20 something).
---
Those and mounts that are the size of buildings. I had to run through a thousand junky toys and crap to get to Inn in Goldshire on retail and it was just ridiculous.  Those and these ginormous and obnoxious moths everywhere is truly an eye sore and takes away a lot from the game which was already gutted from recent expansions.  
---
Glad to be back in Classic with some decorum.
---
If you’re combat swords then mainly focus on skipping over things that require daggers like backstab and ambush. Also expose armor sucks so fuck that too. ATM I can’t think of anything else lol

I want to see them butterfly effect the game. 
---
We've gone back in time and know the future, so it will be very easy to change the course of events. 
---
Give us a new altered expansion. Continue from scratch. But leave us in our current state of vanilla character
---
I don't see how. It doesn't interact with the game in any way.
---
Play on a medium pop. A medium pop today = high of vanilla.
---
Yeah my buddy took me to the quest to get the Voidwalker. He definitely does help, like ALOT, just dont feel like its working for me at the moment. Think Im keen to try hunter. Any tips on playing them?
---
Pretty sure the chrome remote is to just play the queue game
---
You are angry for no reason, and if you have been on this subreddit for atleast month, you know exactly what server they were going to be on. Lol, fuckin chill out.
---
20 for mage is huge.
---
I started randomly buffing a LOT more people when I realized it added 20%+ to their healthbar. The numbers don't sound like much but 20% is huge.
---
it does
---
And who has a better story than Deathwing...
---
He follows the road into the alliance town there, from the graveyard at the other end.  There is also a zone wide yell as he spawns.  If you know what to watch for you can get out of his way, or at least know what to watch for.
---
I mean, i can toss out unending breath i guess haha
---
lock is a good choice for solo. your void walker should be tanking and you should be dot'n and drain'n.
---
check youtube/google for classic warlock leveling guides, they will give ya some points one how to best utilize your class.
---
Even more so, that shit ain’t cheap to repair at higher levels..
---
Don't forget a 1 hander as well
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Instances_by_level
---
Of course it's limiting playtime, wtf? It wouldn't affect me at all, but there's people who easily play 12+ hours a day, and world first players who play 48 hours straight sometimes. They'd be piiiiiissssed to get kicked to a 9 hour queue every 6 hours.
---
Not really. Rejuv you will always use max rank and healing touch and regrowth you will use something like 4, maybe a good idea to have rank 3 healing touch too if for when you dont have to heal as much. And then you want to have a max rsnk healing touch and maybe a max rank regrowth but those you will only ever use whit natures swiftness.
---
So yeah i have 1 rank of rejuv, 2 of regrowth and 3 of healing touch anf i only use 4 of those consistently. The other e are as i said in combination with healing touch. Its not too bad i think
---
Until you see only undead around and realize it’s pointless
---
It gives a visual indicator of when your next weapon swing will be ready. As a hunter, keeping track of when your next shot is ready is critical. Warriors can also get some use from it to time slams between their weapon swings with a two-hander.
---
If you want to get on stalag with minimal wait time you need to be on before 10a est. In the evening it hasn’t been shorter than 4 hours since the open.
---
Oh that's good to hear.

Look into addons that are installed via the twitch app. “Quiestie” will show you where quests are., makes life much easier

You can find a list [here](https://www.wowhead.com/news=294645/biggest-changes-to-dungeons-in-classic-wow-if-youve-played-bfa) if you scroll down. Most have 10 people cap. Only a handful of high level dungeons have 5 player cap.
---
However mind you that you can't complete dungeon quests in a raid group and you also get a lot less XP.
---
I follow a bunch of smaller streamers but I think “taylordcraig” plays on Bigglesworth.
---
you will have to keep your pet happy by feeding it.
---
&gt; the whole group, not just you. If they are running around stabbing whatever they want, they're gonna pull aggro no matter what you do. It's hard to generate rage sometimes,
---
As others have said, it's important to mark the targets and have the dps focus on the target order.  Last night we did WC and had no CC, and I'm hunter, so I told the tank to mark an offtarget and I had my pet tank that mob while he worked on the others.  Always mark the biggest dps targets to go down first, and use LOS to get the casters to come to you.
---
Use a shield. Remember defensive stance. Aggro is hard. Thunderclap is not as effective. Sunder is your friend. Revenge does not cleave 😅
---
You will wipe. A lot. Until you get the hang of it.
---
Life has many boars, EdBoi.
---
That's Auberdine Lighthouse 🙈
---
Yes of course! Exactly.
---
I'm a firm believer that more options is better... The concept of looking the part based on items selected for stats and stats only usually create the funkiest and often gross looking rainbow mixes that makes NO sense in an immersive world...
---
Your armor's look most often doesn't matter to you nearly as much as the stats... That bandana is a novelty, all the way until better gear makes it ao obsolete that itll be vendored like all that other junk that still looked cool.
---
Ill see about it tonight, thanks for the help!
---
Go outside bruh.
---
Medium Pop is going equal what in 2 weeks? 2 months?
---
Even the devs themselves said they expect a large drop in players. I feel the players on medium (Latest Servers) will be people who came to experience a bit of it and leave first.
---
I let my nephew fish for me years ago when he stayed with us for a few weeks. He was about 4-5 back then. I gave him a bowl of goldfish crackers as his reward.
---
Oh nice! I do have a hunter alt. I'm gonna give it a try. Thanks!
---
Instead of that, you should get the XXL burrito and two cheesy gordita crunch. That way you can spread out the calories and burn more by unwrapping smaller tacos.
---
You own this cabin and ur playing wow? damn I need to step up my career game.
---
No, worries, you made a good choice!
---
Lmao, glad I skipped expose armor then!!
---
Kind if depends on whether you want to be horse or alliance. Theres a guide I'll try to find or you can just google but it tells you what all the passive abilities are of the races.
---
Anyone waiting in Whitemane queue? I'm almost 20 :(

Ya I bought them all in a sleepless stuper lol.

Those are the best fucking jobs.  I've had a few (the one I have now as well, before I moved up a bit) and enjoyed every second of it.

What realm? I'm also a tailor trying to make a living so I need to know where the toxicity is so I am avoid it.

Get classiced mf’er!

I’m completely new also. Never played wow until 3 days ago. I have tons of experience in other MMOs such as old school runescape, guild wars 1 and 2, flyff. Still wow has a lot of different components, probably most closely related to guild wars in my experience. What I did is pick a server with the time I like. Made 10 characters all different classes and races, but made sure they worked together well so that race complemented class. Mostly alliance and 2 horde for fun and because troll race has crazy good passive. Then I picked my favorite alliance made character to play. First off have 2 of those character slots reserved for a bank alt and a money maker alt. I used a dwarf for bank and get them to level 5 and get enchanting profession then park them at bank in a capital. Next the money maker I am working on slowly but it is a night elf hunter, I’m going to give that character herbalism and skinning and level her every now and then (progression fast on hunter night elf and best for money making in future). Lastly when playing on main (mine is gnome mage and human warrior tank) just complete quests and y’all to other players and really enjoy and get a feel for the game on your own and learn as you go. That’s just my personal experience from the past few days of constant research. I hope this helps from one noob to another.
---
Oh man, if you see me baiting with my guild tag on Remulos barrens then I'm sorry. It's just too funny flashing '&lt;Retail is BETTER&gt; is recruiting' in chat and seeing the ensuing screeching.
---
That's amazing. Well done for catching that 👍🏼
---
It will be, but the pvp gear isn't necessarily the best for it. It can be, it's just not a guaranteed thing like it often has been in later expansions.
---
Look more like the photo of Indian people cutting the wedding cake and the people not touching the knife being the warlock
---
I dont have power already
---
Wcgw?
---
My buddy seems to prefer alliance, but im happy to go either way
---
how about a Snow White followed by seven dwarfs
---
He worded the title poorly. He meant when the add doesn't despawn, then proceeds to kill everyone. 
---
What he wrote implies they didn't despawn.
---
In retial for awhile when you kill a boss any adds despawn. Van Cleef at the end of Deadmines has adds you need to kill.
---
TIL there's a white wine glass
---
Yeah I’m at lvl 17 warrior. I’ve got all the quests lined up and ready for the moment I ding 20.
---
the spawn rate is good, its using legions server as a base so all the starter zones are doing that increased spawn rate thing when all the mobs in the area die. I spent the first 5 mins of release sitting on a strider spawn spot hitting an endless stream of striders, since when it died a new one spawned
---
Yessss hahah.
---
I genuinely enjoy every single class, they're all fun and I want to play them all. But obviously I should focus on one at first. Any idea or advice on what class someone should play first when they enjoy all the classes and want to play them all eventually?
---
I've been using Chrome Remote Desktop all day from both my phone and my work computer. It's lovely. :D
---
You black out his name but not his name under his pet. :p
---
I’m sorry your experience has been bad. I haven’t seen any of this behavior though. Maybe it’s your server. Which one are you playing on?
---
I predict differently. Research them of course and what the community is saying but I don’t think there is going to be these massive drop people are predicting- it’s a fundamentally better game that captured the world for a reason. And I don’t think slightly less people will ruin things and with how cautious they have been with rolling out servers I think very few will actually die.
---
Lore isn’t foreshadowing but OKAY
---
Cant trade quest items.
---
Hunter is easy for beginners but with a mage you don't need to worry about ammo and pets
---
That’s a good thing imo. If every mob you struggled on, a passing hunter came by and stomped it then no one would be careful. It’s nice getting that lifesaving heal or tank every so often but if it was regular then it would be boring/retail. 
---
It also makes that random lifesaving heal or tank/dps more personal. Just 30 mins ago I saw a warrior in the gold shire mine struggling with 3 kobold miners...chucked him a fort and a few heals and he thanked me. We semi-followed each other helping out for the rest of the mine without partying. It felt normal of that makes sense? We weren’t explicitly helping each other but if we saw each other struggling we did and then just parted ways. No LFG, just a healer and a tank recognising that we needed each other occasionally.
---
Have you tried it? Because you should.
---
I saw that yesterday and I was hopeful at first. Now, not so much.
---
I was having a similar experience with the wandering protector in ashenvale yesterday. That bastard casts Roots too
---
13 years I've played this... wow.
---
Night elf, is a good one for hunter.
---
I also play alliance so I'm trying to find out what horde is, I'd assume taruen but could be wrong.
---
Same, I only played on it until MoP though, but I had no idea people actually RPed in the game until recently.
---
My wife - "Have fun babe, I know you've been waiting for this for awhile. Now I get to start my new shows that you dont wanna watch". I got lucky guys

So much much for the mount? 20$?
---
Where does your slippery slope arguement for special treatment end? Only the top streamers get special treatment so no other streamer is good enough? Or every streamer can get in by opening a bunch of tabs to give themselves fake viewers? From there why not exclusive grocery stores only for streamers because they are too good to wait in line.
---
No screw them. They need to crawl through the mud with the rest of us. Get out of here with your celebrity worship.
---
This is smart.

Except several exist dog, lol

Fantastic post 10/10
---
What a world it is!
---
leveling as resto doesn't buy you much. You'll be able to heal as feral spec in caster gear. This is the general advice for druid leveling. That being said, any spec can solo quest. Talents generally don't make as much an impact on how good you are as gear and skill do. 
---
Respeccing will cap at 50g after you do it several times. 
---
There are plenty of leveling specs out there. Can't search from work.
---
Yeah. Switch to Imp for Blood Pact you ninnies.
---
Battle shout causes aoe aggro or it used to on private servers nice for keeping mobs on you at the start of the pull.
---
I'd switch in an instant if you added waypoint integration (TomTom)
---
it could just  dump it into clickable text and we could set waypoint that way, would be faster then opening map, alt right clicking and spamming until it "takes"
---
havent met a single person ever calling deadmines VC, like what the fuck VC is even supposed to mean?

---
1.	This is how it was, chests were actually pretty common usually had junk. People can loot them and leave the trash also - just like before. 
---
2.	I’m assuming this is intentional, at least for the time being. 
---
3.	this has to do with layering, as layers get removed this will correct. As for healing aggro maybe it’s broken I haven’t noticed either way.
---
Dear god I'm reading this sub and actually considering buying a PC just to relive this magic. I played Beta Vanilla as a freshman in Highschool; easily one of the best video gaming experiences of my life playing this game. Now I'm 30 with a mortgage and also trying to figure out how to maneuver long sessions without my girlfriend going absolutely mental on me. For now, I will adventure vicariously through this sub! &gt;.&lt;

It doesn’t have to be a bug to be annoying.

It seems so hard for people to grasp that 99% of players will absolutely hate having to spam for groups in a month or two after their first experience. Not sure why that would ever be sought after.

Reminder that you do NOT need to jump´on that barrel you can literally just walk into the wall at the edge and save yourself 3 seconds.
---
I agree with your points, but I find it hilarious how low-stakes the first few days of this game have been. We're talking about trade deals over &lt;10 silver more than discussions on the 200k gold mounts and stuff on retail. It's a little humorous 🙃

Whats the default state for vanilla? 1 or 0?

Thats statistically impossible.

I don't think Blizzard is going to have a 'next MMORPG.'
---
i healed some guy and he whispered "fuck you i didn't need your help"
---
I mean if you really want to swing it that way, to say "hey blizzard there's money on the table" you can just tell blizzard to engage in paid server transfers off busy servers only.
---
Alts are great man. They can come in many forms with benefits to each. There are bank (mule) alts, there are profession alts, there are alts for every PvP bracket called twinking (basically drag racing with level cap).
---
My main is a hunter, and that's mostly for money. (I'm mining/skinning) I have much more time than my friends right now, so I made a druid alt that has herbalism/alchemy. Once the druid is 35 I can max out alchemy and start transmuting arcanite and mooncloth. Very profitable/necessary for raiding.
---
Warriors over here on their own, dying to a mob of 2 enemies. Nobody wants our shouts :(
---
Clearly you never got the chance to join one of my "Alts and Rejects" raids that I would run in LFG every week for eternal palace.
---
You did it on your character by yourself. That's another thing entirely.
---
That staff is friggin incredible for the level.
---
Wand dmg doesnt work that way?
---
Maybe the game needed better ways to entertain without giving stat increasing rewards.
---
WAH WAH WAH
---
Hunter/warlock Is an amazing combo you guys can solo all leveling content minus late level dungeons.
---
Rocket league!
---
Statistically speaking what are we lookin at?
---
Not sure if serious, or actually a literal pile of dogshit IRL. Too many retail WoW references for me to give a shit either way. If you want to be an elitist in classic, you should have quit in WOTLK with no regrets.
---
I believe you mean mages and warriors are
---
While there are some merits to the idea, the problem is that with such a list, the accused is basically guilty until proven innocent.  Any legitimate blacklist would need to provide some kind of evidence of the accused’s wrongdoings and the accused should be afforded the opportunity to be respond. Under these circumstances, players could draw their own conclusion as to the merits of an individual’s placement on a blacklist.
---
It was VC on Illidan in vanilla didnt see anyone call it DM until I made an alt after clearing MC. Still hate seeing DM
---
Who cares.
---
Possible controversial opinion... Now that mounts are account wide, I feel like they should be level restricted. It hit me just how immersion breaking mounts can be when I was doing some quests in Stromgarde Keep on my level 30ish tauren warrior in full heirloom gear and riding a gigantic  Antoran Charhound. If I was a random mob in Stromgarde and saw that I would run the fuxk away, but no, they all start chasing me and poking me with tiny daggers
---
Skinning and herbalism.
---
Im so embarassed, had no idea lol. Ty so much. No more diving and taking a swim.
---
Taunt does not generate threat but lets you gain more rage from damage taken. Its a short duration to take aggro off healer.
---
Battle shout and demoralizing shout generate threat! Use them often.
---
Stacking sunder armor will really help you hold aggro. When fighting multiple mobs tab target and sunder. Or they will aggro to other dps and healers.
---
Mark skull and X. You only need 2 and the keybinding for it is in the game settings. This helps with threat. As you stack sunder on skull target your dps wont pull aggro.
---
Line of sight pull, i rarely charge in.
---
Use shield block on boss fights and dont forget to use disarm.
---
These are just off the top of my head after a few deadmine runs.
---
Somebody has been watching Swifty’s stream.

Elvui. Honestly, i just tweaked the default profile (which has the separated chat by default, something I wanted.) to get the positioning I wanted, scaled things a bit, and after moving the map, I moved the movable buff and debuff bars to the corner. Using recount for the DPS meter and going to use plater to clean up nameplates a bit.
---
The bad thing about Elvui is you cant just download it from the twitch app. It has to be manually downloaded (or maybe its on curse but I havent used curse for a while.) and copy pasted into your addon folder.
---
Mankirk's wife comes to mind.
---
This is a real fear.
---
Skinning for gold for your mount. Vendoring it should net you enough.

Less prevalent at higher levels of course, as some people get lucky with dungeon loot while others keep quest items too long.
---
best post I've seen so far!
---
Of course!
---
Herb if you want to make some gold leveling. Enchanting is a big investment but you will have an easier time leveling it from the greens you'll make in tailoring.
---
Bro, why do you feel inclined to level from the get go in a guild? Trade chat is littered with guild posts, just pick a medium pop realm with no que and have some fun. Get a guild at like 15 and you’re all good
---
He probably wants to do other stuff, like spend time with his grandson
---
LOL... 
---
So there is a stigma against hunters.... because every weapon can be used by hunters thus they need anything that is slightly better.
---
I didn't say that wasn't a problem, so don't try and act like I did. I said your solution was stupid and not a possibility.
---
It's already too late. People wanted 50 servers at launch, and rightfully Blizzard figured that would be a bad idea
---
So now everyone is just gonna be stubborn and not move
---
You think Activision would be allowed to make major design decisions before they are even related to the company? That’s not how business works. It likely would have taken a few months AFTER the merger before Activision gets input.
---
That’s not to say Activision is a good company. They are both equally shitty
---
Ah, at least he is still much more powerful here than in retail!

its your fault tbh you probably logged onto your favorite streamer server or Herod

11/10 you actually had me going for the first couple paragraphs I was starting to twitch a bit.
---
Exactly, its almost as if we're playing adventurers that are out adventuring. Retail apparently forgot that
---
Z-Perl has an option in it to auto pass loot.
---
Exact same as retail. Dagger/Staff/Mace. Just a stat stick.
---
No as spirit is better if he knows what hes doing.

WC is basically dps warrior heaven apart from the lack of 2h

1h + off hand or a 2h staff

Priest can use maces and daggers and staves but you have to train with a weapon trainer

Your looking for stats like intellect, spirit, + holy damage, + healing, + mana

Why is blizz adding new servers when we don't even know what the size of actual player base will be once the nostalgia, and hype wears off.

My guess is you rolled on the blackened defias chest. This is kinda a dick move since the quest reward for finishing the dungeon is much better for a hunter. It would've only been an upgrade until you got back to Sentinel Hill.

Went into my first deadmines the other night at 18 with an 8.4 dps sword. Had two mages and a lv21 Paladin with a 14 dps axe
---
I basically was not the tank that night. I even put 4 sunders on the first boss and the paladin still had aggro.
---
I went back at 20 and knowing the shield block into revenge threat combo rather than spamming sunder, worked out way better.
---
I'm a mage, and i like not having a rotation and really just going with frost bolts for single target blizzard for multi, and then having to be aware for hexing "kicking" buffing and slowing to help kiting. Literally jsut spam one button all the time, which is how it goes for most casters i think
---
I am really enjoying the random buff, of course I'm not trying to rub it in. Perhaps you should tall and undead like me? *finger gunz*

If you think BFA is too easy then you aren't playing it in it's hardest difficulty. Nothing about classic is tedious or difficult except running till 40 and grinding mobs. Both have their pros and cons but both are highly enjoyable.

These past few days have been the most relaxed I have been in a long time. Wife is due for birth next week so I'm freaking out about that, all the political shit is getting crazy, work is busting my balls, everything is getting hectic.
---
But wow classic has given me something to think about and when I'm playing I am able to calm down and not think about everything going on in my life. It is one of the very few things that has given me an actual escape.
---
I can tell you stalaggisint Mitch better had a 6 hot queue yesterday
---
Alliance on Rattlegore. It hasn't been all bad and as people are spreading out it's getting a bit better. We had a troll day one tagging the quest mob in North Shire where like a hundred people were standing around waiting to get the guys head. This one dude just kept tagging it. It only got worse from there.
---
Ohohoh... Tell that to my friends who run Questies addon to "be efficient and optimize" their leveling. Also some of them "prefer" level alone as they think the time it takes for a group to restock in cities takes to long compared to what they do alone.
---
This is literally me and my wife

The #1 reason to go into BFD as early as possible

Man, point 7-9 (really one big point, but whatever) is so true! You need a certain class and spec diversity. Maybe at the cost of balance. 
---
Flying mounts had me so hyped. I was ecstatic for the first few days, until I realized how bad it was for world pvp. No one is running around in the world anymore, they just pop down from the skies, kill a mob, and fly right back up to safety. It also makes the world feel incredibly empty. 
---
Only disagreement I have with your post is that LFR could be fine. Let players see the fights from their own characters perspective, if it's really about "experiencing the content". Let it be almost like a more immersive version of watching someone stream a raid. Don't hand out epics for it.
---
I reached lvl 10 today and realised how time consuming the leveling was back in the day. I don't see why it would be bad playing it once in a while when you have done basically everything you need to do and have some spare time left to play. 
---
But when I think about that, I won't reach lvl 60 until next summer, lol. 3-8 hours per week is nothing in this game.
---
No need to delete your character though, cause then it would definetly be time wasted.
---
Right click your portrait in a group, think there's a setting where you control your loot options.
---
The queue is part of the vanilla experience it's not a bug it's a feature
---
Sorry what?
---
That's how I feel.  I can't find my girlfriend anywhere.
---
I haven't done the math, but I've heard that PW:S is actually less mana efficient than healing the damage.
---
Good, that's my wife lol
---
Keep complaining on Reddit that will help
---
Are the queues still bad today?
---
Yeah cause you are RPing as a female NE
---
It's off
---
Unless it's a quest where you need to loot items. Then my invite usually gets declined.

Those sorts of quests have honestly been soul crushing for me so far.  They seem very anti-social.

I can log in just fine. Seems like a you-problem.

Kind you say?
---
FOR THE........?
---
-_-
---
The point was people who took 2 weeks off to min-max to 60 are losers, especially considering RFC is the lowest level instance.
---
How are they trying to kill it? Classic just came out. They’re trying to keep the game alive. There’s always one of you people whenever a game comes out
---
part of the problem &gt;.&gt;, nice, but also not cool
---
My server doesn't have a queue tho. So I pay $15 to play the game, that sees like a fair enough transaction.
---
No aggro?? You, my friend, haven't hung around any murloc villages.
---
Yeah I am also not thinking about everything else. Sadly I have exams next week. :(
---
I'm selling everything I can, even if I have to go lower than I'd like to. You can always farm more in 6 months, or a year
---
It won't fix everything, but try to iron out loot rules at the beginning of the run. For example:
---
Need if you need for the role you're playing right now-- greed for other spec and cash-greeds. All materials drops are greed only. 
---
That way if anyone feels differently, they have ample time to speak up, or if anyone is in the run for exclusivity on an item, everyone can agree or they can find another group to run with.
---
Every time I hear someone say "dude, its classic back when [insert thing I just think of as normal] was a thing" or something like that I really wonder what the hell the game even is in retail. I quit after BC
---
I was very excited when I got gray shoulders during a deadmines run and completely forgot about them when Smite's Mighty Hammer dropped.
---
You've been playing wow through Chrome Remote Desktop?
---
Convince everyone to follow you to the new server?
---
ALLIANCE!
---
lOoK aT tHe PiCtUrE
---
I started playing in Legion, and its insane how pimplier really is better.  I'm only lvl 20 and my class has some meaning.  Each talent point, and skill i buy matters.  Each ding feels good.  I even liked RS3 just as much as OSRS, but classic wow compared to retail is a different story.
---
Hahaha! My friend on discord last night while we were messing things up in the barrens: 
---
"Hmmm... I really shouldn't be playing right now, i have so much important stuff to do.
---
...but then again this is really important."
---
To which the rest responded:
---
"It is the most important thing."
---
I started playing for the first time, at launch and I love that you have to think about where to go for quests no hand holding
---
Could definitely see you getting an NPC on Live called "Theo the Bag Man".
---
People like that get a rep and eventually struggle to do things, karma comes around on a game like classic wow
---
You soft lmao
---
You should go Warrior. I hear they are INSANELY omgwtfbbq powerful and OP in PvP past level 10. Do it.
---
I’m just glad you didn’t take a shot at being a Cowboys, Bama fan. Other sports I just root against my buddies teams
---
I was in ashenvale killing furbogs and I freaked the fck out when an an ancient protector snuck up on me from behind. It wasn't even hostile, just the fact a giant tree came out of nowhere was like fel reaver ptsd
---
Cool. Enjoy being an obnoxious twat I guess?
---
31. I'm toying with quitting my job in an investment bank...
---
of the decade lol
---
Have fun with classic but I hate when people say shit like this.
---
Fricking damnit, those are some words :W
---
I'm leveling as warrior because I can, and most of the time it becomes a race to get mobs and get in close enough range to use Charge. And when trying to get items in the world, might as well throw the towel.
---
...Oh, and lack of "free" instant attacks (as in, not needing rage to use), thank you as well for that people.
---
🤮
---
Karma fishing. No chance you do this.
---
That was me on Stalaag. I made 3.5g! Out of it!
---
Yours is not any less obnoxious even though you may not perceive it that way.
---

\*buffs your melee attack strength in Paladin\*
---
I. Love this ! I'm waiting for the paycheck to come in so I can resub :D almost there just 8 more days
---
And you have to READ THE FUCKING QUESTS!!!!
---
I can't stress this enough. If you don't read the quests you will only complete them accidentally. There's one where you have to /wave at a bear and then follow the direction he faces to find a cave. No /wave, no cave. Good luck figuring THAT out without reading the quest!
---
No more hand-holding.
---
We had a hunter join our group for a quest last night, making 4 people total. Saw a chest, started on the mobs around it, and specifically said 'Roll for chest'. Huntard completely avoids combat and ninjas chest. Absolute scum. Let him die a bit later on when he was overwhelmed by mobs nearby. Grubby behaviour.
---
Keybind them as macros though, correct.  If I'm in defense and tanking, I might only want to pop out for a quick second and back in.  I don't think the 2hand/swordboard is the focus here.  More the abilities.  And that charge/intercept macro (that is a must for any tank warrior) is on point.
---
reported
---
&gt; Tanks who don't wait for mana 
---
This has pretty much been my healing experience thus far. I remember this same stuff quite well as a mage back in vanilla days, too. Quite frustrating, I usually get vocal the first time I see it happen and remind them that if I don't have a full mana bar and they want to do big pulls, they're just going to take money away that could be going to that 40 mount or whatever. I plan on trying to stick to the guild for dungeon runs, anyway, so hopefully that'll help prevent this from being too much of an issue.
---
You're part of the reason queues are so long.
---
troll hunters have the best animations and a great racial/ also bow +5 is amazing even at cap it'll be 305
---
I kinda cheated, I bought the lesser magic wand at level 5 (way overspent on it) but it made my levelling speed so much faster! Overall a great investment.
---
Looking good out there.
---
How does it feel to be so very very wrong?
---
Maybe you should change server
---
It's not my problem if you deliberately go out of your way to avoid playing the game, including paying additional real-life money to do so..
---
You can run over the mountains in Dun Morogh quite easily, then die in Wetlands.  Rez at the spirit healer, grab the FP then hearthstone back to Kharanos.
---
EZ PZ gets you access to the boats, and saves you early silver.  Just do it before level 10 to save the rez sickness.
---
Sudden flashbacks to running that circuit spamming /target
---
As with anything, there will be shit posts. 
---
Classic isn't the end all, be all of mmos. It's a good mmo, but there are improvements that could be made. Class balance (without the homogenization that plagues later expansions) for one. Every class doesn't need to be able to fill all, or even most niches. But there is some pretty broken shit in vanilla.
---
There are points to be taken from how popular classic is, though. If blizzard wants to learn from this is a different question. Maybe their model of game design is making them more money, and that's what they care about. Maybe there is still someone who wants to still make a good game, not just a profitable one. I'm guessing we'll see that in the coming years, and I sure don't have high hopes haha.
---
I meant to say warrior, not warlock. But it’s honestly a funny typo so I think I’ll leave it.
---
Twinks will twink even before the  BGs are out I think, redridge will be a slaughter
---
Ugh, why?
---
If I may be nosying
---
Just curious I’m pretty paranoid about downloading things is that site safe for all the addons?
---
pve = rotation. pvp = “in the moment”
---
Lmao. Genius 😂
---
SO TRUE
---
Switch to Skeram, and join Oasis guild - ally
---
I rolled blood elf when TBC released. It was not worth it. If you want best of both worlds go a draenei shaman. That's what I'll be doing
---
Shazza and Dazza were truly the Romeo and Juliet of our time.
---
They finally banning fuckers that have those gadgets to keep them permanently in the game? Damn right.
---
Such a south park
---
Cool. Thanks. I don't understand.
---
So Proud I'm the first! YES! So worth it!
---
Yeah I'm kinda with you. Keep seeing all these posts about community and waiting in line for mob spawns and as soon as I get to Barrens it's just people stealing kills and ignoring group invites to share kills.
---
I've also had good groups but there's definitely a lot of assholes out there playing the "were all out here trying to grind bro" as they run buy and use an insta cast to steal a kill.
---
Asmongold would likely accept any object into his rectum, if having an object inserted into his rectum were the only gain.
---
Level 18? UUUGH OOOOGH
---
I feel your displeasure myself I work thirds and I was off yesterday and today :/ lol even though I waited until midnight eastern time I still waited about an hour and a half to get in to Skeram 😂😂 guess I’m packing up and picking another server so I can enjoy classic
---
And thank you
---
Whitemane doesn't have queues most of the day anymore.
---
Hello fellow adventurer and welcome to Azeroth:)
---
I got the blazing wand, went to the auction house, saw one for 6 silver and said “screw it I need to try this” then I had to spend 5 mins figuring out how to attack with it xD
---
Youre level 30 and calling yourself casual?  I'm level 14 and have been playing like 4 hours a day since it came out and that isnt casual
---
Got the blue ring from deadlines and then the staff from finishing. Was so hyped.
---
I dont recommend heroic strike over spamming shield bash + revenge, or adding a stack of sunder to the pile, tanks arnt here for dmg, they are utility.
---
Idk, it’s worth making some Alts to hoard cloth and boe stuff you might be able to sell later unless you really need the money
---
Friend of mine works for our Overlords, they know what cause servers to die. It’s their number one concern. It’s a complex balancing act between;
---
1.	To many players on a realm and you can’t remove layers by phase 2. (Hard Commitment)
---
2.	Adding so many realms that when the tourists leave they will die. (Worst case scenario)
---
To gauge whether or not players will stay and for how long they look at engagement of in game material. How long users are subbing for, what the demos of the users are so on and so fourth.
---
Classic was expected to be big, but not this big, and the reviews are huge, as is the buzz.
---
If you think you could have planned better than Blizz you should seek work in analytics.
---
There were 500,000 in que day one, and more on day two.
---
We’ve waited over a decade for this, a few days or weeks to level off is nothing.
---
“Lok’tar Ogar and all that” boy you’ve got me crying 😂
---
So my options are keep enjoying classic or unsub.
---
Sounds like a difficult decision.
---
Regardless of heirlooms, there really aren't threats at low levels anymore (the biggest threats are when you're up near 117 and your power curve is waaaay behind the scaled mobs). So 5-man groups are 30 minutes long at a maximum, and it's chain pull after chain pull.
---
A wise tank looks out for their healer, and will not forge ahead until the mana bar is full. Anyone who pulls can tank their own mobs. And unlike retail, they will probably not survive.
---
Someone posted an ad for the lesser arcane wand for 9s, so I snapped it up at like level 6.
---
scrub
---
Bubble drops Afro and the chest is RIGHT next to a pack of 4-5 gnolls.  It’s instant death.
---
thunderfury still has no queue
---
Yep it's safe
---
But stolen an adventure! Haha. You’ll remember this for a while. Goodtimes 👍
---
It's ok, buffing big strapping warriors fulfils a very deep, very confusing need.
---
I agree, I explain that in the guide
---
Viper sting my dude! Love those Aimed shot crits on clothies.
---
If you were already in IF you could have just taken the tram for free :p
---
After you make the macros you have to log out for the file that stores those to save.
---
Everyone who wants to be on an rp-pvp server is on grobbulus
---
You can shield him after he gets all that aggro. It will help you save Mana and at a certain point he'll be ok. You'll figure out these points with practice.
---
It's 3 days in. I really don't understand the huge deal over missing the first couple of days (even the first week or two) in a game that's going to take most people months and months to hit endgame.
---
Unless you're a streamer, or a "competitive" player and you're going for a server/world first (in which case, you're going to sit in queue once or twice and then barely ever log out anyway), what's the issue?
---
5000 person queue for Incendius, estimated two hours.
---
19!! You could PM me your btag and ill play with ya once you get up there a bit in level!
---
Adios
---
You would get them with the WoW collectors edition from back in the day.
---
I have more money than free time? But I’m not asking you to justify that, read closer.
---
Way to miss my point lol I’m saying that it’s enjoyable having a game that scratches that mmo itch and doesn’t let me buy instant gratification. I’m saying that I think that maybe it’s a good idea to force people into working to a goal in a game? Much less hollow.
---
And the warlocks? 😢
---
True.
---
That UI though
---
Good thing no one is max level yet then
---
but thats just from a ques t
---
 that does not count
---
Fuck off.
---
I agree +5 bow is super sweet and the racial is very good too. I dont personally like their bow animation though!! I know im picky af but i just really prefer animations with closer to proper technique! Holding the bow upright like orcs and ne female
---
[Elvui](https://imgur.com/a/yHr18a9), still haven't gotten it quite right yet.
---
Adapt to the group, might take a few runs before y'all sync up, dont spam taunt till you got a shield bash up for a revenge threat  to add to the aggro.
---
Need to tweak your play a bit, ain't easy but its doable.
---
Go play RuneScape
---
So how much would you cite WoW for having improved your English?
---
Was your first word 'fuck' or 'noob'?
---
trolls are the best hunters
---
This guy gets it
---
I think its hard to ween off some people that is coming from retail where you can pull the entire room and AOE them down, no need to drink or eat for entire dungeon, and threat was never an issue.
---
Personally since Me and my mate is playing both druid we're just going to TANK/HEAL and try to get competent dps since we can control the group dynamic since there are 100s of dps we can pick if they seem smart enough to start a convo.
---
They haven't made any changes
---
For a few hours the other day whenever I had extra linen I converted it, found a tailor, and gave the bags to people who grouped with me and quested :D
---
Depending on which wiki it is, but if it's the one i'm thinking of, don't bother with it. It has so much wrong information because it is a jumble of different xpacs mixed in. Even when it specifically states "Classic" it will still have info from like TBC or eve MoP muddled in there.
---
Genius lol
---
Why do you care?
---
Yeah sure, I'm certain that walking back to their corpses, they all thought how great you are for not camping them. And as they celebrated how fair these fights were, they put you up as top pvp players of all time, right next to swifty but with a bigger dick!
---
^
---
I'm on Herrod. If you're there let me know and we can quest together. Lvl 12 mage
---
Hell it sounds like they were begging for it
---
I’d say the benefits far, far outweigh the drawbacks.
---
Main tank in vanilla hear, MC and BWL 
---
Hunters pets should not be out. 
---
Make a macro to tell people if they have aggro to run to you.
---
Get your Pacific timezone bullpoop out of this thread you dirty heretic.
---
fuck im on reddit....
---
&gt; At this point, they are practically two completely different games.
---
Well no, not really. They are still very similar.
---
Damn!! That’s a pree good wand ain’t it?
---
This is something I'm really loving about wow. It really feels like we're all on the same team, and not just a bunch of protagonists running about
---
So the confirm.. there is no dungeon finder in classic?
---
Sweet :) I will totally do that
---
What map addon is that
---
i just raced someone who did that. saved me like 8 seconds
---
Lol I get you. Single player is just easier. The other people might as well be npcs
---
Waiting for someone who you know has skinning to loot a mob so you can skin it before them. People are getting called out for that on BSB.
---
Welcome to Azeroth:)
---
Thank you for sharing, forgot that.
---
*in goblin voice*
---
I completely agree with you
---
I sell on Whitemane for 20s
---
It's how I've already got 2 gold at level 18
---
[This is all I hear.](https://i.imgur.com/ID6YKWl.png)
---
The average person doesn't play wow so who cares about them
---
/reload fairly often with Questie or you'll miss a lot in the midgame
---
“When I sleep” lmao
---
I will drink to all of this, possibly several times. Why several you ask? 
---
Because I tank and sometimes that’s the only way to cope
---
I dont remember it exactly but it was something along the lines of "someone paid me 10s to suck them off for 10 seconds" some kinda sex RP in game honestly it gave me a fucking headache trying to wrap my head around what I read.
---
Holy moly
---
And weekend players in the next couple days
---
ITS NOT MY FAULT YOU CAN DODGE, DUCK, DIP, DIVE AND DODGE THE MOBS!
---
I would agree if there weren’t 2 weeks of warnings that any servers that said full were going to have ques. They practically begged everyone to roll on one of the newer servers for this exact reason.
---
Now you need to queue 5 hours before your work ends to beat all the 3 hours before work queue-ers.
---
Those QoL things, I don't prefer them. The world feels larger, more alive, more like an MMORPG. You prefer TBC and WotLK, that's cool, I prefer Classic. I got the version of WoW I really enjoy, hopefully Classic is profitable enough where you and others can get back to the version of WoW you prefer.
---
But please, don't ask for the changes that those of us who prefer this version feel took away from the game.
---
bro
---
I play paladin just for this. One thing that bothers me is if hunters want wisdom or might.
---
Hahahaha nooob I got a Staff of Westfall at like level 16
---
Curse is owned by Twitch, which in turn is owned by Amazon.   The site itself is quite safe.
---
Imagine giving a streamer gold. Way to accept your lot in life as a lower caste piece of trash, existing only to feed their betters with the  attention and material gains they demand
---
I know we’re all gamers and resistant to cancer but I’d really caution against drinking those plastic bottles OP.
---
Am I supposed to know them?
---
I have that turned off. Until MS can update on my schedule and not theirs.
---
Hate to break this to you, but I've been working on professions since 7am
---
Is there a list of how populated the servers are in order? I don’t want to be in the top 5 servers, but I don’t want to be in the bottom 5 either.
---
Exactly.
---
Queues are nonexistent during the day for the most part in NA, but I've heard it's worse for the EU servers. Grobbulus currently has a 2k queue with an ETA of about 40 minutes, so not too bad.
---
I specifically got UD, just to toss a buff back when i get buffed lol.
---
No don’t do that, that’s not necessary
---
Herod will be the most active server for the rest of the games existence. You made the right choice.
---
Go to your pet tab in your spell book
---
if you watch streams, yes
---
For me it started with Cataclysm to be honest.
---
I had the opposite happen as a rogue. I will sprinting to a mob I need and some will tag it and expect me to kill it for them. I just run around gathering everything I can at that point and vanish when people do that now.
---
Hi, /u/Wyldbylli

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cx8oqj/servers/). 
---
All your points are valid and also what's with hunters not rolling on any weapons? Don't they know they could equip that wand?
---
I just don't understand posts like these. 
---
Clearly, you are hate watching something or someone, and all that is doing is making you angry and bitter inside to the point where you have to post a venting thread on another form of social media. 
---
Why expose yourself to things that clearly upset you? You don't have to watch streamers. Literally no one is forcing you. If you don't like them, go find a streamer you do enjoy. 
---
Focusing so much on what others are doing, in a game, which is meant to make you happy; isn't healthy. Take a loooooooong break, and refocus.
---
Kurinaxx?
---
Do you want to play what you enjoy or begrudgingly play something because it's what's considered best? That should be the first thing you should ask and after you get past that it rules out a lot of things on both sides of the coin. I know damn well my choice may have not been the "best" but I've been enjoying the experience a lot so far as a Druid because I get to buff people, save people with heals, not have much downtime due to having three different resources, and the ability to actually feel like I can play around with all three forms freely without being railroaded into one be wise ify Specialization".
---
Set up remote desk top! I queue up from work around 1pm and am sitting in the character select screen within 15 minutes of getting home.
---
wholesome post
---
Someone post this to /r/wow and watch them all take the bait
---
INFERIOR PET CLASS
---
I definitely think flyers remove a lot of the joy from the game, but I think BC had some redeeming design aspects that made it work. Outland was so vertical that flying felt like the natural way to get around. Plus you weren't allowed to fly back in azeroth
---
They will learn as soon as pvp starts happening more often. I had to learn the hard way, and i am sure a large chunk of the world did too. SUFFER AS I HAVE SUFFERED
---
I’m not on RP server. Never understood it. But I think you need to find a psychologist. It will help you to build some decent social skills. More like being more social instead of exhibiting anti-social behavior.
---
Wut? If true, blizzard fucked up (again)
---
My computer is shit and I can run it on minimum specs. Really feeling the Classic vibes with the graphics looking like shit just like in 2005
---
Maybe it's a carry-over from my time with retail.  The blind invite comes across as me just being a tool for them to get the quest done faster. By the same token, I don't blind invite others either. I'll always send a quick message first. It's a small courtesy, but it matters to me.
---
Coming from a long-time druid: Bears are great tanks, with amazing threat generation. You can MT every dungeon with ease.
---
That being said - Bears cannot block, cannot parry, and are vulnerable to crits and crushing blows. 
---
They have no "oh shit" buttons, like a Warrior's Mocking Blow or Shield Wall.
---
That's why Warriors will always be superior MTs. It's a sad truth.
---
Lorewise Stormwind doesn't have the resources to wipe out the Defias due to Onyxias interference in their city, that's why Westfall has it's own militia and no armored guards from stormwind!
---
Somebody put a damn game in my queue session D: wth!
---
Yeah, I know about the tanking, but have heard it isn't all that great.
---
&gt; EDIT: reddit makes me put a ' before the # for formatting, don't use the '
---
Try indenting (4 spaces) like this
---
    #showtooltip Mark of the Wild
---
    /cast [target=mouseover,exists] Mark of the Wild; Mark of the Wild
---
Any time I see a solo warrior fighting I throw a corruption and agony/weakness on the mob. I remember leveling as a warrior back then and ANYTHING to reduce downtime helps.
---
Oh word? Maybe I should switch to this then
---
My greatest joy in this game is buffing fort on everyone. 
---
And heading warriors. Poor warriors, they're always approaching death.
---
Divorce.
---
I was doing RFC through our whole go-live last night
---
Go to the capital city and get beast training.
---
&gt; ~~Good talk.~~ I was wrong and I'm not willing to admit it.
---
FTFY
---
Genuine question: why not pick another server until the crowds die down? You'd be able to play at the very least as opposed to just watching the queue tick by, and I bet you'd be able to transfer the toon you roll to your server of choice eventually.
---
I’ve read about a macro that is mouseover for taunt which just needs a click to taunt on cooldown. Didn’t know how well that works. 
---
I’ll look into threat meter for sure.
---
Weakauras ill look into as well.
---
And a macro for marking targets is super smart. We are missing that coordination in our group haha.
---
An autoshot timer addon is really nice.  Makes it a lot easier to kite enemies to do maximum damage before they get too close to you. I use https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/yaht-yet-another-hunter-timer/
---
Traveling tip which might be obvious but I’ll mention it anyway:  if you’re trying to run by aggressive mobs that you don’t want to fight, you can have your pet attack them then immediately switch it back to follow you.  You can keep repeating this to avoid multiple mobs.  Great for getting past enemies that are too high level for you to fight, though in those cases your pet may end up dying.
---
Not only that but whitemane wasn't even mentioned in the severe wait times, was it? So far this server seems just as packed as the steamer server. Had a few 6-9 hour queues already
---
I don’t see the coincidence with the queue here... it doesn’t matter if he’s „sitting on a table“... it’s the Security/size of the door at the entrance that sets the speed of the incoming people.
---
Good job mate, keep these ideas coming folks.
---
Which server is this?
---
I will reference before I start tanking, thanks for being awesome.
---
I feel attacked
---
I was walking through the barrens and on my way to the stagnant oasis I saw a corpse so I resurrected it just to see if it would help somebody and sure enough he spawned half health and thanked me up and down. It was an awesome moment, this game fucking RIPS
---
Hopefully the bfabies get bored and leave soon
---
Yeah, but blood pact.
---
 /salute
---
Yeah, I played retail from TBC -&gt; Cata, then quit at the end of cata, picked up again towards the end of MoP and played on-and-off from then until halfway through Legion and just ultimately quit after that. Retail is too far gone. It's kinda fun, but has way too much bullshit that I don't like.
---
Huh? That's not right ...
---
I've not had issues with them, but it may also depend on how difficult they are.  When the mobs die easily, no invites, but when they kick your ass like the Blackrock Orcs in Redridge, people are quicker to look for help.
---
Blizzard already has dynamic respawns, which could be improved, but increase or decrease spawn rates based on how many players are around.
---
Shamans are the best raid healers with chain, and also the best pvp healers. Also with how powerful their totems are every raid group is going to want shamans. As for dps, sadly dps shaman isn't very viable in raids due to their high mana cost for spells, which leads to dps shamans having to use lower rank spells so they don't go oom instantly, which leads to pathetic damage because they use lower rank spells. They lack the mana regen abilities mages and locks have for it to be viable. In pvp however both ele and enh are very powerful burst specs. Theres a famous ele/resto hybrid pvp spec that makes you a very solid healer while also dishing out insane damage.
---
Playing a warlock myself. We have bloodpac on our imp which is basically another priest buff and we can soulstone the healer which = no running back. We win this one boys.
---
Those 7 levels are close to half the exp needed to 45.
---
Log out as in go to character select or completely reload game, just so i know if i have to go through queue again.
---
I fucking love Letterkenny.
---
Yep! Works fairly well. The main issue I've found is that the camera is nearly uncontrollable, as the clicking and dragging doesn't translate well. I bound a key to one of the camera views and set up a key to target mouseover and interact with target, though, and it's pretty great!
---
Saw a familiar face standing outside of the ag hall the other day.
---
I leveled multiple priests in the private servers and I found the best route is just to put 5 points in spirit tap and then flood into the disc tree.

Don't brother learning smite and shit, start off pulls with Bubble, holy fire, MB, SW:P and then wand until dead. Save all mana for healing and oh shit moments.

Indeed friend. We even have a podcast! :D

I tanked up to the last boss in WC with a Void walker last night. Normal people would say its not possible. we did it. Last boss (not escort) hits too hard though and we couldnt finish. We also were all mostly 16-17.
---
Saw it was Duskwood and knew immediately what this would be lol.

My guild had a bear offtank through AQ.  They're good if geared well.

I am 1000% convinced that when the Oceanic realms went down yesterday, the only reason it took close to five hours to get them back online was that there were no local techs actually in OCE who work on the Classic realms.  
---
They had to wake someone up in the USA and get them to fix them.  
---
The data centre that hosts Blizzard's OCE realms experienced 'no outages' yesterday.

Hello fellow warrior,
---
Just keep in mind, when you get to level 60 with another class, you will think to yourself, “I could have had a level 50 warrior by now.”
---
We should set up something like this in Hilsbrad in a week or so on Whitemane.
---
South shore Vs Tarren Mill. Ultimate edition.
---
I feel the same about Paladins. I was a pally as my first character and vowed to not do that to myself this time around. Auto attack only, buffbot, healbot, no thanks.
---
Today I grouped with a paladin and really appreciated the bluffs and aura. Still, I feel for him because I know his future. I lived it.
---
Every guild will need at least 1 leatherworker for Onyxia Scale Cloak in order to kill Nefarian. Devilsaur 2-piece is obviously the early earner but it’s good to have at least 1 for the previous reason.
---
Yep this, get the questie addon, it’s really helpful

Yeah, I want to think that's the younger generation, but honestly how young are you in your 20s...

Are you me? This was my entire day today. I can't wait to get my warrior to 60 so I can finally make an alt and enjoy leveling lol.
---
I was initially strongly against classic but hear me out. 
---
Before bfa came out I really enjoyed legion and my stance was that we should fix things in retail and make it more enjoyable for everybody rather than splitting the manpower between two games. 
---
But that was back in legion when i was having a really good time. 
---
Now I’m exclusively playing classic and I’m very happy with it. It’s a lot of fun and I’m glad blizzard made it. 
---
I still lowkey wish that they would make retail just as enjoyable :(.
---
I WANT to play their new content but I swear getting a blue in classic is 10x as rewarding as getting a 10ilvl titanforged piece from a freaking m+ box... wow became too much of a theme park...
---
couple things to check.
---
What level are you? What skill level is the weapon you are using? What level are the mobs you are attacking?
---
What is your durability on your equipment?
---
No one cares what you think
---
I love this game.
---
Your gear broken? Resurrection sickness?
---
God forbid people take time off to partake in their hobby. Dont these plebes know their place is in the quarry?

Thank you fellow tree hugger.
---
Word on the street is if you leave the old long queue you can get in immediately
---
Shadow really doesn't pick up for solo leveling until late 30s when mind flay actually starts to out perform as your filler. 
---
The reason you go disc is for self sustain and making all your instant cast spell cost less. It smooths out levels

Find a group to quest with! It will get easier when you get shadow form

One of my guildies saw someone with the name Randymarsh spamming “STAN? STAN?!” on launch day on Faerlina.

Wow, this reads just like the OP's satire.

Stop now and create a new character on a different server.
---
You can switch for $$.
---
Love being an image
---
Warriors are superior tanks, yes.  You can absolutely tank all 5 and 10 man dungeons (and do it well), but beer tanks will absolutely be second fiddle to Warriors in a raid environment.  Knowing this, I still rolled a druid as I love the class.
---
Can you imagine using an operating system where you aren't in control, where crap like the OP's picture happens? \*shudder\*
---
You are so in for a treat. What I would give to be playing this game for the first time. I envy you.
---
Shaman WERE pink back in the day.
---
Blue is a relatively new construct of Shaman, which was only introduced once Paladins and Shaman were available to both factions. At that point, it was determined that they would need to differentiate between the classes by adding another color.
---
Also playing from Japan, though I'm playing on an NA server since there's no RP-PVP server for Oceanic. My latency is roughly 150ms and it's not bad. Haven't had any trouble so far.

BLIZZARD: mstone#1761
---
Queue at 9400. I can't play the game!!!!!
---
Hmm I dunno then
---
No. Gotta start again dude. Sorry.
---
For everyone reading the comments here thinking that paladin bubbles drop aggro, that's misleading. It doesn't drop aggro, but mobs will ignore an immune character for the duration. If you are still the top of the aggro list when the bubble ends, they'll come right back.
---
If you're not already, start marking the mobs! Usually the tank will lead the way through a dungeon. That means marking mobs, assigning roles, and setting the pace for pulls.
---
I used to keep a macro just to explain at the start of the dungeon, and then had hotkeys set for my common marks. "{skull} = kill 1st; {x} = kill 2nd; {moon} = sheep; (etc)" (Depending on the group's CC I'd tweak the macro a bit before sending it to party chat)
---
Not everyone will always listen but marking makes it a lot easier.
---
I don't get whats so awful about LFR? Its not like you go there if you have a normal-heroic capable group. Its for people who just want to get involved with plot, nothing else.
---
Stonetalon
---
Okay, thanks. Guess I have to start again then :(
---
“As intended”?  No, taunt only works on npcs
---
That means that every slot available on the server is potentially "under reservation" for 10 minutes. Sounds hugely inefficient.

New player help! How do you display your quests on the right side of the screen?

I've only played the free trial a few years back and my quests are only appearing once I've found the thing I need to kill, or found the person I need to find. Plus there's no Exclamation Points or Question Marks on my minimap for finding quest objectives. Are there certain settings that need to be turned on?

people without instant casts were challenging people w/  to duel to mess with targeting... oh classic :)

Have to start over. It’s pretty early though so shouldn’t be a big deal.
---
We're on the West Coast of Florida so no biggie. Getting the kids Minecraft tomorrow and wait for this all to blow over. Lose electric? Generator can put it back online as long our local IP is still up. Got beer, water and canned food. Good to go.

To the East Coasters, please be safe and evacuate. Best of luck.

Thanks for putting this together!
---
My point was toward your post, not the argument you are making. Sure, as you progress further into tailoring, unless you are farming your own mats, you will be spending a lot of your income on mats. However, capping journeyman tailoring is very easy to do while questing, without spending your income on anything other than coarse thread and maybe a select few recipes. I managed to do it, and I'm sure others have as well. All I made until Linen Bags was Bolts of Linen Cloth and Simple Linen Pants. The pants cost 1 coarse thread, and one bolt =10c. They sell for 23c. That is 13 copper profit. I never purchased Linen Cloth. I didn't need to. By lvl 10, I already acquired all the cloth I needed, simply by questing. 
---
If you want to charge people 4 extra linen on top of the mats they've provided you, you do you. Just to be clear, I wouldn't call it a scam either, but you'll be making fewer friends in an extremely social game.
---
My first interaction was a female toon asking people if they wanted to see her “BIG BOOTIE”. And then me and him/her danced and giggled in-game. Lol
---
OP is  learning how the auction house works.

I don't use a macro, I use team viewer on my phone and just tap space bar once every 10 minutes or so, or I did before the update, the queues now for my realm are only like 300 people
---
Before I log off I take a minute to stand outside the inn and fort every mf'er who passes by until I run out of mana
---
Sadly!
---
He's not adding lower levels to the list, because it would be basically impossible to maintain the list.
---
Does the guarantee flight stops?
---
The main benefit to tanking with a dagger is fast hits = faster rage = more threat.
---
Check the garbage! Subconscious him wants WoW and threw them away. No escape!
---
So are you telling me that me asking my girlfriend to hit space bar if I'm gone for 20 minutes while I go take a shower/take my dog out is account sharing or against the terms of service? That seems like a stretch.
---
Many consider owl the best levelling pet in the game. Just keeping finding the new ranks of claw and screech as you level.
---
Well I am not apart of the younger Youtubes generation but I imagine it’s more entertaining to establish a narrative that is more reactive. It’s easier to accomplish this in a dungeon versus running to various points and collecting boar tusks. I am assuming they are playing more for money than video gaming at this point. And I cannot imagine the shelve life of your average streamer is long. Their longevity of playing World of Warcraft with advertisements will be determined by their early success.
---
Sounds like resurrection sickness.
---
"no u"
---
The other night I let a warrior who was trying to steal my chest die to a mob instead of healing him and pulling aggro.
---
I finished off the mob and looted the chest. He didn't release spirit, he just laid there and watched me loot it in front of his corpse.
---
Expected an angry whisper but never got one. I wonder if he's still laying there right now.
---
Level 20 rogue here. First time playing a rogue and I just found out that they can use bows and guns. Up until now I've been buying throwing knives from the vendors (are there any green or epic throwing weapons?), should I train bow or gun specialization? Will it be worth it and what ammo should I use? Thanks.
---
If the server ques persist too long sure put a stop to the afk botting. I just really don't think it would be worth resources to fix if it will solve itself on a short timeframe.
---
Skyrim is bad example of good RPGs.

I should play WC3, it’s obviously been way too long for me.

Do they pay a higher subscription fee or something? Why are they more important than other people who have to wait in queue just because they're speedrunning

Hail, fellow Penguin!

It’s technically already the same concept when you have 7-10k players in que waiting to get in.
---
To be clear, you can PvP in battlegrounds and in the world if you turn on PvP, but it's not enabled by default like a PvP realm.
---
What level are those mobs again? Been a hot minute.
---
XD so true
---
Good info! You beast!
---
Actually this is a good idea for a fresh server. Near 40 you can start to sell your skins and ore for a good profit which will help you fund your mounts. End game it will be a little less than optimal but you are new - end game is a long way away. Welcome to the addiction worse than crack my friend.
---
155 minute queue for incendius. Had my wife log in for me so by the time I get home and eat a quick dinner I will be able to play a couple of hours.

When I was in college, I met a 14 year old squeaker and we bonded over death knights.  Fast forward 11 years or so, him and my husband are bffs, we’ve gone to blizzcon a few times, and he’s moving in soon while he goes to college.  We’re playing WoW again like the good old days!  I also tell him I’m preparing the “nursery” and we’re planning what WoW art to hang in the (now 3-person) office.  😆

Thanks for the reply! You are not alone, but sadly it seems most of these types of addons haven't been updated in ages though they worked for some time despite that.
---
Here's to hoping we can get an update or new addon, cheers!
---
You haven’t had played any gacha games have you? If wow is crack that shit is heroin, at least wow doesn’t feast on your wallet short of the subscription fee
---
I just tested it out.  At 5 minutes you go afk.  At 30 min you get sent to character  select screen.  At 60 min you get disconnected from the server.
---
Awesome! My wife used to play other games on Pc but never got into MMORPGS and has been hesitant since our mutual friends (who are playing) have been getting a little too overzealous about the game. “It’s a second job” “you need to roll *this* so that we have a perfect party” “you can’t have those professions, I’m doing those professions” etc. 
---
So I figured leave them to their server and go to an RP server, which in my experience, have wonderfully awesome communities.

I feel you :( only one in my group who gets to work from home.

I know it's kind of a dick move and they do good dps, but I hope it helps convince more warriors to pick up a shield and step up.
---
My coworker and I are plotting to set up concealed PCs and tether off our phones at lunch time to play for an hour. Thinking about dropping  some money on a cheap build to accomplish this haha. Open to silent / cheap builds. I was thinking an Amd3 1200,8g of RAM, micro atx and a low profile passive GPU.... No one would ever know with my desk set up the way it is....
---
It’s had a queue since at least 11am today.
---
&gt; To avoid death the game will have to add new content that works with the feeling classic E.G
---
Or they can launch new servers that start from phase 1.
---
That's what effectively happened in the private server world for years and it was *awesome* to start on a fresh realm with everyone starting from scratch.
---
Ensidia got banned after using a profession item on normal lich king

I don't see the point in rushing to 60. What are those few first lv60 people do? Clear mc woth 3 people? Don't stress about the leveling speed and enjoy the game peeps ;)

No lol - Chris.

Since when is 12, 10?
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=416/rat-catching
---
Yea but how do you KNOW you were the first. Did the game like... send you a message or something? On screen?
---
What i find funny is less the fear of missing it, but i just get angry.
---
I have: 
---
Faerlina: Mesmerize, Eject, Softcore, Yuge
---
Kirtonos: Wiz
---
Fairbanks: Perplex
---
Nothing will be displayed on your map, except for quest turn ins, you’ll see a small yellow dot. Shift click the quests in your log to track them on the right side of the screen.
---
They do but they don't. They want layers gone by phase 2, and over relying on layers to deal with capacity issues is at odds with that. They are thinking towards to future where (bs sample numbers incoming) if every server caps at 100, they arent stuck with a server of 500 because of their over use of layering 
---
So yes, it adds capacity, but they are planning on removing that capacity so they need to consider that before just adding more and more
---
The XP in dungeons is crazy, even the regular non-elite mobs's drop a ton of XP compared to outside mobs. 
---
I'm not sure if it's patched out, but early on in Vanilla WoW mages could farm from like 55-60 in no time by going to Dire Maul and just AoE spamming some non-elite little vine creatures and resetting the instance, killing like 5-6 of them was the equivalent of farming monsters for about an hour or so.
---
You seem pretty skilled with macros, how/where did you learn?
---
I thought chat was layered as well
---
I wouldn't be surprised to learn that there are some systems that haven't even been rebooted in the last 40 years.
---
Holler if you find something. I’m Horde in that server and also have a family, a job, and hobbies that I won’t give up for a game I played way back when.

Funny I came here with the exact same problem,  hot spot,  no downloading,  30mb from happiness
---
How do you "keep finding" them? Is that just leveling up your pet?
---
Annnd....now I have a new place to gank with my rogue in SW....
---
I specifically use a macro to send my pet to attack that is separate from my attacks so I can keep him on another target. I have another macro that will recall him. 
---
From memory so these may not be perfect.
---
Send pet to attack and put into defensive mode:
---
(I use the icon that matches the pet attack icon)
---
    /petdefensive
---
    /petattack 
---
Recall pet and put into passive mode:
---
(I use the icon that matches the pet passive icon)
---
    /petpassive 
---
    /petfollow
---
Nice work. Would love to see you do a similar guide on your keybinds.

That's like going to r/fitness and posting on a thread about running like that.

Some guy threatened to say the n-word earlier. We begged him to stop. After a while he screamed NIBBA in chat. Turns out there was a very confused player called Nibba in the Barrens who answered. I've added him to my friends list with the full intention of asking him YO NIBBA WHAT'S UP when he comes online.
---
Yeah.  If only they had a low level dungeon with a solid weapon drop.  Or perhaps a dungeon with a quest to give you a weapon that lasts until late 20s...
---
Pallys have the best looking gear in the game (it’s up there for sure) lol. I’m glad your having fun, welcome

One of them says “This quest has no objectives to track.” But didn’t there used to be a golden arrow on your mini map showing you which way to go to find it?

Are these product pages wrong?

They both state at the bottom:
---
&gt;Can I use the Steam Link app with my cellular network?  
---
&gt;**No, you’ll need to be connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your host computer.**
---
I had no problems with the shaman tank I brought to my RFC one with single target but the moment multiple mobs were involved it was rough. No real way to gain some threat.
---
Also don’t be to discouraged, dying happens a lot st low levels.
---
Nope, achivements dont excist in classic so no notification. Even when you clear a dungeon.
---
At this point you just go by assumption. Realm first on a 2 day realm is more likely than world first.
---
In tBC, because a lot of %-based stuff from 60 remained BiS until 70+ otherwise.
---
I knew it wasn’t true when he said “I was good endgame” no one was good in classic
---
Thanks for the tip, where is the teleport?
---
I’ll admit I generally praised all the convenience changes as they came and thought they were improvements, but in recent years I reflect on the state of the game and it’s so apparent how these changes have stripped away what made the experience meaningful
---
I had a tank in RFC once named antiblack
---
he wasn't that good.

If you’re asking, it’s not going to impact you
---
Hey all I just started playing and see myself getting addicted. I chose an alliance rogue (gnome I think?) and had a question about rogues. Are they over populated? As I grind through the game is it going to be harder for me to get into groups and do dungeons and raids or stuff? Or are classes pretty spread out and it won’t be that noticeable of an issue.

---
Sorry if this is off topic but I figured this is a help thread and didn't want to create a new one. I know choosing the right server is really important, but I have searched and can't seem to find anything online involving details of classic servers. I'm looking for a website that shows more server details, mainly the ratio of horde vs alliance. I remember this being a really important statistic years back when I played WoW, the best servers for me were always the servers with the closest 1:1 ratio. Ending up as a horde player on a server that is dominated by alliance 10:1 would be a nightmare for most people.  
---
So, are there any websites that show these details yet? Or can anyone let me know if they are on a server med-high pop, with a relatively close 1:1 ratio, PVP enabled, no RP?

Hey, water breathing is valuable.  Just because you are in the middle of a desert or forest, you never know when a rouge lake might ambush you.

Haha, quality :)

That's a shit ton of projection just to protect the fucking image of a multi billion dollar corporation in your own head. Wrath was \*near feature complete\* before the merger, and activision would have had 0 say before that. Period. That's just how business works.

Damn hardcore brother. I dont have it but will you suck just the tip for Perplex - Faairbanks

Why would blizzard not get the +dmg?

Good attempt Mr. Allen. You think we did not wanted, but we did.

We like it. Bye.

Awareness is good with all the rogues running around and the spirit will be good because paladins are typically relegated to healing

Well they certainly bring more money to Blizzard than you or I do with the hype they generate. But that was besides my point, I was looking at it from a merely self-interested PoV: as long as it's not against ToS there's absolutely every incentive to stay logged in as long as possible.

I care that somebody is dropping writing a novel for this stupid ass game.  Video games are fun but they have zero benefit to any part of your life that isn’t being good at the video game.   But enjoy!!
