Same here. I couldn’t possibly bring myself to play a dwarf or gnome, ever...
---
---
---
Damn it hurts because it is so true. Boiled down they removed the difficulty to achieve things (gear, community, guild spots, items, titles, etc...) and now the game leaves anyone feeling unsatisfied and empty.
---
Get the slowest (3.6+) 2h Axe or Sword (sword or axe, or if you have to polearm e.g. Ice Barbed Spearspec only good weapons in Arms).
---

---
Have two good trinkets, like Blackhands Breadth and Hand of Justice - both very easy to acquire and on par with Ony, MC, and BWL trinkets. 
---
In raids spend your DKP on tank gear only (hint: hit, crit, str, agi are still tank stats, especially for thrat) exception behind a good 2h. The rest of your arsenal outside of weapon and trinkets is not as big a deal in PvP (obviously still helps but no at much as the big 3)
---
FWIW, Yth, the biggest outstanding question for the team is how they intend to approach progressive itemization (or the lack thereof) or item gating (or the lack thereof).  There are arguments that can be made for several different approaches, and "authentic experience" doesn't really shine much light on this one.  Would love to hear the team's thinking and rationale at this time.
---
Originally, You could have a raid in any dungeon (I think) (up to 40 people). With the release of Dire Maul, limits were put in place; 5 for Dire Maul, 15 for Blackrock Spire, and 10 for all the others. Later on they changed the limits again to 10 for Blackrock Spire, and 5 for all other instances.

---
I don't know why people think that there was some kind of a "mistake" made by blizzard that they did not introduce equal viability of every spec in raid, and try to dispute this. On the contrary, different classes and specs were deliberately turned into what they are as in patch 1.12 on purpose.
---
The statements Jay Allen Brack makes do make a lot of sense from a monetary standpoint. *Of course* they do not want players who have never had to deal with this sort of player overload seeing it and leaving within the first few hours they log in. I get that, and that is why nowhere in my post (and never will I say) that I am 100% against sharding and will not play if it happens. I would just prefer it not happen.
---
I am aware that it is a "minor" QOL change that will encourage these players to stay around and try it out.
---
I just feel that is not what this version of the game is truly about.
---
Eventually these new players are going to get repeatedly ganked and be forced to adapt. They are going to want to Kill Kazzak and be forced to adapt. So on so forth...
---
I understand also that I could (probably) am just be being a bit of an "elitist" in wanting it to be this way, but gosh darnit I think it would be good for these new players to get this harsh reality early because it is important to learn to adapt in this game.
---
Cool idea! I'm currently making a name generator before launch as I'm awful at coming up with something unique myself. I'll have it finished and share it before classic launches :)
---
What really kind of bugs me, is the fact that unplayable starting areas actually is a huge part of server, or in this case, game launches. It allows us to feel first hand just how many people are logging on, and it also allows us to experience something which very rarely happens, namely 1000's of lowbies competing and grouping up.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I can see where they are coming from, and actually dont believe they will be adding sharding past the release days, but I still wish they would let people experience how it is actually like when a highly anticipated server lands. 
---
Thats overrated. Clutch(10sec silence)+Shadow reflector is what is doing things in that duel.
---
Probably because you're a guy that sees himself in the character he plays. Really common.
---
When the started making classic wow in the first place, which took a huge push from the community
---
This is partly the reason why. When you PvP, it's always fun o imagine howmany hordies are livid a gnome just killed them.
---
They cant be making changes like this, or none of us will be playing it. They lose the original crowd who want actual vanilla completely to the private server scene and then there is no basis to bring newcomers into the classic scene. 
---
I think ( and hope) that blizzard is as aware about this subject. 
---
&gt; Do you think most tanks will suck in leveling dungeons? Trying to decide between maining mage and warrior.
---
I will go one further and say that most new *players* will suck in leveling dungeons if you are in a PUG group. 
---
I ended up being one of the top warriors on my PvE server back in 2004-2006 and the level of understanding about how the game works seemed pretty low. The number of PUG players - mainly rogues and hunters - who I had tell where to stand (keep behind me), what not to do (let me do the pulls as the tank, because this makes every fight easier, if you get aggro then run towards me, don't run away because you'll aggro more guys... oh and don't stand in the fire?), and generally didn't understand things like Patrols, Line of Sight, and not breaking Crowd control effects... 
---
I shudder to think how having a clueless tank plays out in a low level instance. Clueless healers too (Priority #1: keep the tank alive. Priority #2: keep yourself alive. Priority #3: everyone else - and if you get aggro then run TOWARDS me not away...). But a clueless tank would be the worst. 
---
But: I remember being that annoying guy once upon a time. I remember being in RFD and wanting to "see what is down there" - I was under-levelled, stood close to the edge and managed to chain pull half the instance. So don't get made with newbies, please take the time to explain things to them. Otherwise they don't improve. 
---
Implementing it to keep servers from crashing. They really don't like servers crashing. Lots of people are like "but that's the authentic experience!". No company will EVER be like, we're going to have an intentionally shitty launch where you'll be constantly kicked from the server. You just can't be a business and go around doing that. It's just unprofessional, and all they really can do is try to find ways to make the game playable. The main point is that it is very temporary and they recognize it can never be a permanent part of classic.
---
Of the original 8? For alliance I will NEVER play a gnome. And for horde I will rarely play an undead and only if i have suffered a recent stroke.
---
The problem with swoops was the actual attack swoop lol. It knocked you on the ground and you couldn't attack for a solid 0.5s minimum. This happened like every 8ish seconds. If you get a series of misses, you be screwed man.
---
https://writingexplained.org/bad-rap-or-bad-rep
---
I cringe every time I hear "For the Alliance", and I played alliance in vanilla..
---
Totally true. Aside from those few questions all they can really say is ''stuff is working'' so a Q&amp;A isn't really that important imo, even if I would be super hyped for one
---
I'm largely against rebalancing classes. Yes, it makes a lot of specs pretty bad at end-game, and yes people will be upset when their ~~meme~~ unorthodox specs get them rejected. However...
---
1) The information is out there &amp; people will be well informed that hybrids are told to heal &amp; some specs aren't very good.  
---
2) Class buffs &amp; utility make it worth diversifying party comp, especially in 5-mans.  
---
3) I'm pretty sure this sub would have an aneurysm if they made changes like that.
---
This is my thinking, since I'm an experienced player, maybe I can act as a guide to new players. Tanks really lead the dungeon in classic, and by rolling a tanking class I can set the pace of the dungeon while teaching new people how classic dungeons work.
---
I don't mind the zones, but the huge zones with one FP, and not even near the middle! They're not as large as the Barrens only because they're narrow/short, so the amount of running is similar
---
But Ashenvale chat was never a thing
---
I agree that the planning around CC and focusing fire is just as important as each individual's skill at playing their class. 
---
&gt; A good (warrior) tank can reliably hold aggro on maybe 3 mobs at a time. A bad tank can hold one mob. But even for a good tank if damage is all over the place it won't be perfect, and tanking three mobs at once hurts quite a lot either way, resulting in a lot more mana breaks for the healer.
---
your tank should really only be handling 3+ mobs at a time when things go wrong. Trash Packs are typically 4 max, and most groups will be composed in such a way as to be able to CC 2 mobs. Those that can't typically will have a character or pet that can function as an off-tank. 
---
Are there any changes you could think of that would make it more of a enjoyable experience? Calenders?
---
It's vanilla, engineering items define high level pvp.
---
diamond in the rough then?
---
The thing is they can't come out and say "hey guys,  we're gonna be so authentic that we're even gonna let our servers crash!" It's just unprofessional, and the backlash from allowing servers to crash would be so much worse than the backlash from adding temporary phasing.
---
You seem to be new to Mr. Ion my friend. You have to wait for the "that said" part, which is what people got hooked on. The current debate is what people thinks of them using sharding for the first few weeks of classic to ease the lag.
---
I just don't understand what people expect Blizzard to do. "Hey guys, we're gonna be so authentic we'll even have a shitty launch with crashing servers!" It's just not professional. A business cannot operate that way. The best they can do is find a way to make the game playable in any way they can. 
---
Right, I've read that warriors will be in very high demand between fury, MT and OT. 
---
I never tried hamstring kiting when I played my war in classic/TBC, how does that work? With rend?
---
So the point is that I would just like to be prot at 60, not necessarily looking to go arms/fury. However, if that secures me a spot in the raid I suppose that would be fine if the end goal was to bring me on as an OT. 
---
If I can stay as prot spec and tank dungeons, I feel like I could develop a good reputation for myself and therefore make my life a little easier going forward.
---
I may do hunter warrior as well, just unsure of the order.
---
Thanks for your thoughts. 
---
More like:
---
Frostbolt frostbolt frostbolt frostbolt frostbolt frostbolt frostbolt frostbolt frostbolt frostbolt frostbolt Portal to IF
---
Yea I see what you mean. 
---
I played the shit out of BG's and arenas with warrior 12 years ago. I'd like to say I played pretty well, since I pretty much nolifed BG's, arenas, and duels outside Org. I don't think I want to go back to that, so prot warrior is what is attractive to me atm. 
---
I dunno, maybe I'll just do hunter and level a warrior with everyone elses alts lol
---
Thanks
---
Yea I think Druid is off the table. Thanks
---
Night elf and priest.  I hate Teldrasil. I hate their flips.  I hate their ears.  I hate the inability to solo level. 
---
Like saying "I love cops" w/o moving your tongue!
---
And I only play females, because all the males are way too swole to be realistic representations of the caster classes I like to play.
---
Human... I'm already a human, I want to play a fantasy game as literally anything else. 
---
This is true, also a good farmer!
---
How do you compete with other players pressing 1 button? Boring
---
Wouldn't say there's that much super OP items from world bosses, it's more about the prestige of dominating them (as well as wbosses being a very fun activity). Usually the best guilds will be dominant in both PvP and PvE, and world bosses being a mix of the two so it's a must-have if the guild wants to prove it's the best.  
---
The only exception and what \*could\* be OP is kazzak's hammer, depending on its proc chance. It can range from either decent/good to insane. Guess we'll see when the beta's announced.
---
If your goal is to tank in a guild, even as an OT, I think warrior first is the right call. Get in the door early on, when people need tanks and be willing to tank even as a technical DPS. Far easier early on, than later. Hunter is also really easy to level solo, so it would be easier to level later when less people are leveling.
---
Hamstring kiting is basically, get a swing timer, hamstring and rend mob, get in range for the hit and out of range for the mob, so you take 1 hit instead of 2-3. Cuts down on downtime a lot.
---
It's a hard choice though for sure. I think since we are going alliance, I am firmly hunter, but if we were horde I would have gone warrior. Mostly a race preference thing for me though.
---
Mage is just too boring for me. Drinking all the time in dungeons and while killing mobs. Really hurts the soul when the rest of the party are advancing up ahead but you need to wait 30s before the next pack. 
---
I'd say Warlock is a better "all round" than Mage. More utility and not as popular of a pick while still being highly sought after for end game. Also very easy leveling and good in PvP.
---
I'm a tank and more often than not I'd pick a Warlock over a Mage for the last dps spot in 5mans.
---
[removed]
---
Did you make this OP?
---
There's a command to reset dungeons in Vanilla, up to 5 resets per hour.
---
In Classic, I wouldn't be surprised to see this command added to the drop-down menu when you right-click your portrait, like in retail.
---
Yeah, I'm on the sharding for starter zones train personally. I don't want sharding when I reach the larger social zones like Durotar/Barrens and Elwynn Forest/Westfall, that would ruin a ton for me and I think that's what's triggering a lot of people.. at least from what I have read.
---
Keep in mind that Ion said "the first few weeks", which means sharding might be in place all the way to 60 for people that plays a lot. That would kill the vanilla experience for a ton of people.
---
My old character was named rippenas cuz of my diet of Doritos and grinding made me rip ass. 
---
I dont really agree with the slight bias for cenarion circle. I would say they are true neutral. They have tauren and nightelves alike.
---
This I totally agree with. Unfortunately I can see them putting blanket phasing in place, and if that's the case I might skip out on the first couple weeks. I draw the line at the level 10-20 zones. If they're phased, Blizzard is seriously fucking up. You need to be able to see those people to make dungeon groups, find friends for the harder quests, and even find your server guilds.
---
Ah right, that makes sense, since there is [no where](https://classic.wowhead.com/) on the [internet](https://web.archive.org/web/20061205042701/http://thottbot.com:80/) that you could look up the [details](https://web.archive.org/web/20060822133950/http://wow.allakhazam.com:80/) of the [items](https://classicdb.ch/). 
---
At least you admit the impact of sharding or no sharding at the start will be minimal and that it's simply a preference. I have the opposite preference, I'd rather only have 50 people in the starting zone instead of 500, at least I can do things *while* I interact with other people. Neither preference is right or wrong but it's probably best that Blizzard launches with whatever preference the majority of players have.
---
The Pro-sharding people that make me roll my eyes are those that proclaim any sharding in any capacity will completely ruin Classic and make it completely unplayable in it's entirety or that Blizzard will inevitable make classic entirely sharded, both of which are ridiculous complaints
---
Oh brainfarts - I meant Kil'Jaden (who was of course just a pawn of Sargeras)
---
I understand how you feel, and I personally want the authentic server launch experience as well...
---
But, Blizzard is hoping to attract new crowds to the game including younger demographics than the old vanilla veterans and pserver players.
---
This is why I understand that they don't want to turn these people off during their first impression of the game.
---
I'm ok with starting zone sharding if it helps create a thriving Classic community in the end.
---
Would you recommend this institution over Bovine University?
---
Couldn’t it just be the same system? but not so grindy that only like 5% of players work toward it
---
Do you recommend this institution over Bovine University?
---
There will still be endless variations of Ninjja and Shhadowwxx
---
Sorry replied to the wrong person haha
---
I know all to well :( But a man can dream ^^ 
---
Ya this is just my opinion and I understand the other side as well. Just had some down time and wanted to voice it. :)
---
I’m probably a complete idiot and I’m just talking out of my ass here, but I legit think they just mopped up some decent 1.12 private server client and tweaked it and have been done for months. They are just waiting to decide stuff like sharding. Again, I know I’m wrong. 
---
&gt;Given the history and context, it should only be Human Forsaken. 
---
Negative, and I'll explain why after the next quote. 
---
&gt;The Scourge devastated Lordaeron for the most part
---
Correct, but that doesn't mean that ONLY humans were present there during the invasion. Dwarves were present via the [Mortar Team](http://classic.battle.net/war3/human/units/mortarteam.shtml) and the [Flying Machine](http://classic.battle.net/war3/human/units/flyingmachine.shtml). Their presence, particularly being close and plentiful enough to be part of the human armies, alludes to the dwarves having some presence in Lordaeron. 
---
Next, we also have Trolls. Trolls were present in the WCIII campaign for both humans and the Scourge as enemies, IIRC (if I'm wrong on that, willing to be corrected). If they were in the general proximity of the Scourge, they were more than likely victims to it, too. 
---
Sorry, meant Kil'Jaeden. The Orcs and Draenei lived relatively peacefully together on Draenor.
---
This is incorrect. You were only able to link items that existed on a server. 
---
For example, if no one on the server yet had Thunderfury and you tried to link it through atlasloot it would disconnect you.
---
You didn't have to actually "see" the item it just has to be on the server.
---
Yep agree completely, Just felt like throwing it out there that something as chaotic as a server launch without sharding also holds some merit. 
---
Fully prepared for them to shard the starter zones for a few days though, and it wont be a deal breaker for me personally. 
---
The nightmare dragon pvp raids were pretty sweet back during classic. I missed out on them on Nostalrius though.
---
If you enjoy large scale pvp, no MMO does it better than Dark Age of Camelot. Developers of Classic WoW actually said this. Check out Phoenix DAOC, where you can experience the best World PvP has to offer.
---
&gt;The only "pure" high elves in game can be found at the Quel'Danil Lodge in the hinterlands
---
There was a spot in EPL too, WAY up near the top of the map that had one. 
---
I'd really like to know what their plans were for them when they were originally put in the game. I know that they were all hostile to the Horde but I think the ones in the Hinterlands were neutral to the Alliance. 
---
Yeah obviously Sweden. Just like Counter Strike, vanilla/tbc was basically played by WHAT FELT to be half the population. So per capita, Sweden by far.
---
content schedule is an easy change compared to mechanics but aight.
---
Yea us Swedes who grew up with it had a culture who basically promoted gaming and as we've seen by time its even getting bigger.
---
For sure gonna be a ton of nordics in general. 
---
I mean, a Hunter that uses Shaman gear to buff his Arcane Shots and Stings.
---
Google will tell you but:
---
Agile: iteration based workflow.
---
waterfall: linear workflow.
---
I played wow since vanilla beta, large scale world PvP always worked fine, it wasn't unplayable at all, the only time it was unplayable was if you had shitty ram.
---
&gt; 1+ year and nothing to show outside of two zones?
---
The entire land map was done. Did you not watch the videos of the people who bugged the demo to explore the world and all the main cities?
---
You are making it seem like NOTHING but Two zones were done, when it actuality that's merely what they chose to show us. It was a demo, not a beta.
---
Orcs and humans. I hate the way orcs look, and if I'm going to play a fantasy game, I'm not going to enter it as a human since I am human irl (rearry?)  
---
Thanks Google!
---
XxLegolasxX
---
Idk what gear you're reffering to specifically, but as a whole (atleast from the dragons in vanilla) the loot is ordinary af for how insanely difficult it is to camp &amp; then compete for/defeat them.
---
That's a fair point but in terms of classic I don't really trust the modern Dev team to touch the classes at all. I mean we're at a point now where they've made them all so homogenized and boring and they're still not even perfectly balanced. I just don't think it's healthy to open that can of worms
---
In 15 months since the announcement they hired a team for it. Gave a 6 month development update, Launched a playable demo at Blizzcon, gave a final launch date for the product along with the planned patch rollout setup, and told us that since Blizzcon theres not much else to add atm but that they are still working.
---
But yeah, "nothing to show" since announcement...
---
Draenei are my favourite race actually :)
---
If you think priests can't solo level, you just haven't done it right yet :P
---
It’s funny how people say they don’t trust blizzard with classic but they stay here and talk about classic.
---
Trolls. Lanky blue Jamaicans with Mayan architecture nothing about them calls me to play them.
---
In Vanilla I played Alliance only and a Undead Priest. 
---
That Being Said tm
---
It wasn't a mistake a. but a time issue there were a few class revamps, but they decided that instead of drastically changing all the classes in patches they would turn that effort to tbc which as you can recall did add alot of changes to viability.  
---
That being said vanilla wow is vanilla wow not tbc and they are creating the way it was not some not what they might of done in vanilla given more time.
---
Sharing is fine early on, cross realm is not ever at all.
---
[Original Source](https://www.reddit.com/user/AggressiveConcert/comments/ags2qj/stormwind_university/)
---
Because the horde slaughtered the fuck out of them on Draenor? 
---
Guldont
---
Thats why I can't wait for TBC servers. It really felt like that was when WoW finally left Beta.
---
This is gate-keeping. Plain and simple.
---
&gt; not every spec was supposed to be perfectly balanced or viable in all situations. 
---
It's understandable how players have come to believe this, but the fact is that the devs have never stopped talking about all the ways in which they sought to make all specs viable. Balancing was interrupted during Vanilla for taking too much time away from [developing the first expansion.](http://blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-shaman/668634.htm)
---
&gt; “Right now the class team is heavily focused on the expansion. We will be announcing details of what's in store for each class in the weeks to come. There are a number of improvements we're considering for Shamans in expansion, such as improved totem UI and functionality. I've also been studying the development of new talents and abilities for each class, and so far I'm fairly excited at what I've seen for the Shaman. Despite the belief that no one reads the Shaman boards (ironically, our loudest forum), we're fully aware of the feedback that's been expressed here, and will do what we can to address it. **Much of the improvement players are demanding will have to wait until the Burning Crusade launches, which isn't too far off.**”
---
An additional culprit was a lack of ideas, as Kevin Jordan pointed out on the Classicast:
---
&gt; “[A Protection Paladin] was fine generating threat as long as the mob was on him, but once it was off him it was really difficult to get it back on him so that he could go back to generating threat, whereas the Warrior was more direct and, you know, consistent.
---
&gt; It’s one of those things where we didn’t have the idea worked out yet and we didn’t want to just band-aid it by giving him a taunt, because once you give him a taunt you can’t take it away, right? Like anything less than that or even different than that and people are going to be like, why? why would you do this to us, just give us the thing back. It’s very difficult to take mechanics away. **We didn’t have the total specific idea worked out on how he was actually going to taunt** so we were still experimenting and learning as we went.”
---

Feral OT isnt a crazy thing. My guild had one and he was great. Not exactly an exciting experience id imagine tho. 
---
Don't do something you're against. Simple. If a feature is antithetical, there is no justification to adding it in any form. 
---
I've never gotten one to 20. I get sick of it by 12 or so. 
---
Dwarfs. They just don't appeal to me.
---
Yes because Dark Iron Dwarves are cool
---
That's some sweet yammification. Man this zone brings me back to when I first rolled a tauren druid. I was so clueless but so excited to play. After playing warcraft 3 and hearing the announcement for wow at the time it was just unreal when you first logged into the game and saw azeroth like never before.
---
That's perfectly fair and reasonable :D
---
Sorry my friend, but did u even listen to the video and what he said?
---
they litterly say it's for starting zones only, if it will be "1-6 area" or "1-12" area we don't know (He said valley of trial which is 1-6 but after says elwynn which is "1-12")
---
So u don't have to worry about that, they will just have it for the starting zones only. 
---
The only thing we should worry about here is if they "don't keep their current word" but we have no indcation that is the case as of now.
---
That is completely fair. Tauren Druids made me QQ initially too.
---
Ironically Feral tanks are MORE important for Horde then Alliance, because the major benefit is their TPS and Horde doesn't have Salv. Outside of a DW Fury tanking with TF, I don't think it is possible to keep up with a Feral's threat with MCP. Without a Feral all your Horde DPS Warriors with WF will just be limited by agro on burn fights constantly (which is what happened in actual vanilla).
---
Sharding is almost guaranteed in at least the 1-10 zones.
---
Classic is not a game where Protection warrior lets you be tanky and survivable so you can go slow but steady.
---
You literally do so little damage that mobs at your same level can end up killing you just because Protection warriors aren't *tanky* like they are in retail.
---
The fact is, even at end game the tanks are mostly Fury warriors.
---
call yourself "nobuffs" make a nightelf priest. stand infront of mc or bwl in melt. target enemy faction maintank, dispell = profit

&gt;Is the old Rank 14 system returning?

Hopefully not, god willing.

fite me no changers
---
I've never played male dwarves or male orcs. I like male dwarves but just prefer the females and I despise male orcs.
---
Why the hell do you write . (?)
---
If we try, we'll get sharded or teleported by a GM, sry :(
---
[can't wait to get my old look back :D](https://i.redd.it/qjabqsfupdq11.jpg)
---
Most likely. Otherwise /script ResetInstances()
---
perhaps in the future when the game progresses to 2.0+
---
Do whatever you want. You'll learn on your own.  
---
I’d fear the private server streamers moving to classic. Those are real threats as well to ruin game economy and possibly promote toxic gameplay.
---
I’ve played on a few private servers, and plenty of people are great and normal. But those that follow some of the big streamers and their guilds,  are usually not ones you want to be playing with.
---
I remember using this in vanilla on my orc enhancement shaman. It was my go to because when you would use storm strike sometimes it would proc wind fury. If that happened it was pretty much over for anything in front of me. If it didnt finish them, that is what earth shock was for. I had so much fun in battlegrounds with this weapon and I honestly enjoyed it dearly. Hoping to rock this weapon once again in classic.
---
My favorite race is also Gnome! Sadly, I love to heal and hate that they aren't healers in Vanilla. Although it was weird, I was very happy when they were made Priests in Cataclysm. My main was a gnome priest from Cata-MoP till I stopped playing. 
---
I have names picked out for my warrior, priest, mage, and warlock already. Gotta be quick on that trigger come launch night. 
---
Your comment history is cringey in the extreme.
---
The head of a boar
---
If you listen to or watch Taladril or read his tanking guide I am pretty sure he's committed to believing at least 1 feral OT is optimal (Correct me if I am wrong). However that player needs to be on point.  
---
  
---
To impress others and earn your spot you have to: 
---
1. Farm pummelers
---
2. Have tons of elixir buffs.
---
3. Confidently powershift effectively
---
4. Lots of armor leather/hit gear/smoking heart/agi
---
5. It helps to be alliance.   
---
   
---
Honestly the DPS isn't even that bad at the start of 60s either. On an instant 60 server in dungeon blues (without wolf helm) I was pulling 330dps for 10 min. Only used innervate once, and only motw as buff.  
---
People kind of overexaggerate the the disability of feral druids. It just takes a lot of work to upkeep and they don't have the best itemization.   
---
I want to main one just to prove it to people. I also love feral
---
My characters are usually all Latin names

I seriously hope not, because they do have the tech to do this. I remember doing 80 vs 80 wpvp in MOP on emerald dream and it was beautiful. 
---
My guess is they  will use this level of server tech. They have shitty servers now, but it's because they depend on sharding to keep the shitty servers. They won't have sharding for 99% of vanilla, so I'm guessing they'll use decent server tech to keep it from crashing in just regular cities.
---
The boar of a head? XD
---
Its a meme at this point.
---
Sweden masterrace, we dominate in whatever we do.
---
Why that green though?
---
100% man. People overrate AR given this will be patch 1.12, there's almost zero need for it.
---
And the way they shoot ranged weapons, swaying back and forth being all extra and shit lol
---
Scarlet Monastery: Library
---
It wasn’t early on. The majority of vanilla you could do most dungeons with raid groups. Dire maul was the first to have a 5 cap, and the other dungeons still had no limits
---
they are all just degenrated trolls.
---
The lawyer talk really triggers me after hearing so many IRL dodges you'd think he's a night elf tank.
---
I was sad when they changed the knock back...
---
There's the most interesting part: NO competition, even considering that. 
---
You can provide food/water for days, the person you gave it would still have those in their bags after the dungeon run is finished.
---
You can take people home in one click, also comes handy while levelling, considering there's a quest chains around (like Uldaman necklace).
---
You can CC with polymorph.
---
You can CS casters so they would come with the rest of the mobs to the tank.
---
You can single-handedly deal with some mob packs, or kite infinitely using a low-rank cone of cold.
---
Dungeons groups would kill to have you in their group. There's a shitton of damage dealers yes, but unlike the shitty-tier fury warriors/rogues alike, YOU are the special one. I was pleasantly surprised when I've discovered that :) 
---
Both lodges were friendly to the alliance. 
---
You are talking raid dps. Being in a bg vs being world/raid buffed with consumables is huge. Evening the dps isn't nearly as major as you make it out to be. In raw dps numbers it is much less than you say it is. Even just a 100 dps increase from scaling would be improved a ton in a raid environment while not mattering as much in pvp, because you rarely aimed shot when not opening
---
Also, the example you give, steady shot, is more likely to be used in pvp than aimed not counting an opener. Yet you treat it like this pve only ability that allowed hunters to be scaled. Either you think tbc had the exact same problem with scaling as vanilla, or you are completely wrong in your assessment. It is the latter
---
I also don't think you are familiar at all with pvp. Increasing scaling to make naxx even would not have the impact you are saying. You really don't understand just how much more burst a mage, for example, has over a hunter. It's night and day, which is why hunter scaling was addressed in tbc. 
---
You are wrong and just being an ass. 
---
Swear words in lesser known languages work too. Like mother fucker in khmer works for character names
---
I was pretty happy on Nostalrius...
---
No reason to think about this. They're bringing back vanilla, not changing it so that it's a "better" or more "balanced" vanilla.  
---
That being said, I don't really see the issue. Yes, there is a clearly developed hierarchy of 1.12 vanilla and what classes you favor in any given content tier, and yes that does mean that you will not have an equal distribution of all classes in a 40 man raid environment. HOWEVER, no guild is going to forego having a balanced, reasonable roster just to stack and cheese MC (or bwl, or AQ, or Naxx) since that brings its own issues. Guilds are in it for the long run, looking for players that will last from the start of classic til it's end (content-wise), and reaching that without major roster overhauls is by having a good, balanced class distribution.  
---
This man fucks
---
Dwarf, why would you want to be short and fat?
---
rable rable rable rable rable
---
If warlock is using eng items and player is same skill level WL&gt;Rogue.
---
Reprint them to come with new tcg codes for classic.  People will buy them again for tcg mounts easy money.
---
Pshsssshhh dark iron pulverizer all day for that proc baby
---
I’ve been considering rolling enh as well because it seems so fun in pvp. The only thing that worries me is bg’s not being out on launch, and not being able to raid due to my spec. 
---
Maybe I’m overthinking it, but I’ve tried to heal before and it doesn’t appeal to me, and ele has never appealed to me either. 
---
I’m thinking I’m going to roll and main a hunter on launch, and use him to fund a 39 twink enh shaman, which I will pvp and level with up to 60. 
---
back in Vanilla not many people actually raided.  So almost literally every class that could wield 2h maces was using this bad boy
---
Some of the best gear in the game is locked behind that grind. Easing it would make that gear more accessible and people would call them welfare epics.
---
So say that. Don't post a video in attempt to mislead or somehow justify sharding from a standpoint of "they understand."
---
Also, its bullshit. A "certain private server" had a launch with a concurrent population of 14k in the first week. It was nearly flawless- I know this because it was fucking creepy how stable it was.
---
Maybe Blizzard is more of an indy company than random private server devs tho, who knows.
---
Vanilla WoW is lagom.
---
Warlock = Free mount, Cheaper epic mount, PvP in PvE spec made easy, grinding with ease, can solo farm Mara for gold too.  Can coil / fear / charm to steal herbs / ore to profit more.  Also you can sell epic mount runs to other warlocks to save them gold (250) and you ask for 100 in return.   If you group with a pally it's more fun then playing as orclock.  If you have 2  buddies that's enough to summon so barely any wait time for dungeon groups.  Locks are always welcome on alliance side for raids and pve is a little more engaging then mage.
---
Always pvp realm because higher pop and the world feels more engaging.  From experience it is best to pick your class / faction then have your friend pick after because friends typically quit before you. 
---
This thing was unstoppable.
---
How about moonkin.
---
Dwarf is the best pvp race for hunter.  They are always monsters in pvp from day 1 until endgame.  Deadzone is easily manageable in 1v1 and doesn't really exist in group settings.  
---
Well there is our update. I guess we can shut up for a week now 
---
Nost? There were periods where the server would crash every hour for weeks. I remember around when BWL launched I could barely play because it crashed so regularly. 
---
For sure... we are now relics, who enjoy even the strangest of novelties in our video games.
---
Holy lord I've never seen this.  
---
This was the first weapon i put crusader on. Big moment for me.
---
Yep, same.  All class/race combos picked out and named already, it will be the absolute first thing I do on launch!
---
Look man I was trying not to be ethnically insensitive, okay?
---
Nost's launch was a shitshow, and it was nowhere near 14k at launch. It was a recent launch but afaik I can't mention names on this subreddit cause censorship.
---
Morcgora
---
I would have welcomed new races, if it hadn't required them coming along with expansions that destroyed the game.
---
It looks like a shitty text book tbh
---
Ms paint. Picked an unedited color. I'm no graphic designer, will double check product before deployment next time
---
I had a Shaman friend in vanilla who loved elemental and enhance. But, he spec'd resto for raids. He didn't love it, but he got access to some awesome stuff. Flash forward a few months and he was one of the best geared Shaman when he switched to either enhance or elem. He eventually got rank 13 (he couldn't quite get 14) and started raiding elemental and enhance, because he had the gear to support it.
---
TLDR - In classic, you need to put in the time and work as a group towards progress. If you're willing to heal when needed and collect the gear, you gain the ability to do whatever you want. 
---
gate keeping is literally the dumbest concept the internet has ever invented 
---
Yes, definitely remember the mace spec rogues. It never seemed to be terribly popular but they were incredibly annoying to play against.
---
This particular screenshot is actually from Westfall, but the same set piece exists in Mulgore as well. Just couldn't find the one from Mulgore.
---
Yeah I want to see the old game, but not that part.  Playing 10 hours a day should never be a requirement for anything.
---
Played Nostalrius a little after launch (read a week), and it was basically the experience I remember from back in 2005 (I started actual vanilla about a month or two late). I had all the information at my finger tips and the players around me all knew what theywere doing this time around - but the emergent gameplay and sense of community was still there. Even with a much larger audience and an international player base it was still what I recall as 'home', it was still that game my 11 year old self fell in love with and it was still that tight knit RPG experience that fosters lasting relationships. I haven't made actual friends in a game for long time - but here I am still talking to a couple of people I was bumping shoulders with in MC and BWL on Nost. Trust me OP, the game itself is the experience and it doesn't matter how much that gets 'tainted' by external min/max knowledge, it will still be how it was.
---
how do i delete someone elses comment
---
Yeah dog, they can just move those puppies around on the fly!
---
Right? MonkaS in the chat boys. That's how you do it right? Fucn plebs. 
---
Also don't forget that you don't start knowing how to use all weapons you class can use.  My Orc rogue had to make the journey to Undercity to learn swords, for example.
---
This right here.
---
People argue about "meme" specs so much on this subreddit. But this is how it's always been in my experience. You put the time in, you play what's needed. Be the group member that people are happy to have around. You collect gear on the second or third pass, and indulge your passion on farm nights.
---
Even in cutting edge guilds, you go hard on progression, so that you can play loose once it's all on farm.
---
What happens when the unstoppable force meets the immovable object?
---
If they do classic will die. WPvP is an important part of vanilla/classic
---
After the big Warlock patch (deathcoil buff) I'd say Warlocks became the all around best class.
---
Blizzard has always done their best work when they stay quiet and stick to the grind instead of worrying about PR.
---
The thing is...I wouldn't even call it hardcore.  It's unhealthy.
---
The format of this graphic is annoying me
---
Have never played probably will never play Tauren or Troll, I just cant click with the aesthetic
---
On private servers, people go with the PvP set which typically is available from the start on those servers. However, Classic will make these available in "content patch 2" together with BWL and ZG, and that could be six months down the line. Same with BG rewards. This makes it awkward for arms warriors who rely heavily on those things. I think a lot of people are in for a rude awakening when they realize that there's actually nothing but dungeon blues and crafted gear for this spec.
---
....i thought they were just humans
---
Tauren because I always feel like I am moving so slowly.
---
The only redeeming factor is feeling like you're running faster.
---
Current pserver standard is to plan your raids around weekly resets. You raid the day before reset and day of, allowing you to farm or pvp for the next 5 days with and only have to respec once each week. 100g a week is very doable ( 1-4 hours of farming at most depending on class ). I'd expect to see most classic guilds adopt a schedule like this to ease the burden for the majority of guild members who can only play 10-15 hours a week.
---
They'll sell themselves in their advertisement. Experienced guilds will list their experience and so on.
---
That's how they've named plenty of Magic the Gathering cards
---
NO CHANGES REEE
---
FYI, "sakin" is not how you say 'knife in Arabic. It's pronounced or transliterated to: "sikkeen".
---
"Sakin" would mean 'living', like if you wanted to talk about where you live.
---
Yes, slowfall will help you fly through any instance in the game.
---
I think they should recreate it exactly. DPS warriors should be dog shit prior to naxx like it used to be, the raid comps were way more diverse prior to that. 
---
To be fair they meant it more like "yeah right" regarding only having 2 zones worth of showable content.
---
There are a handful of items from world bosses that are BiS during earlier phases of the content timeline. The pants from Kazzak are BiS for Warlocks &amp; Shadow Priests *i believe* through BWL and I’m pretty sure the cloak from Azuregos is BiS for Rogues during MC.
---
A lot of these items had different stats throughout different patches of Vanilla but there are definitely a handful that are BiS in the early content with 1.12 stats
---
Can we please for the love of god get a megathread about sharding, loot trading and spell batching?
---
We don't need a million separate ones about the same beaten horse. 
---
because its a question?
---
AV won't be available for quite a while. They said PvP rewards and BGs are introduced in "content stage 2" together with BWL and ZG.
---
If it was a feature I don't think they would go so far as to disconnect users.
---
Dwarf... because why would you.
---
Yes, three factions balances pvp while two factions leads to the current shitfest
---
Because im not sure if its a statement or a question. Sounds like I was right but wasnt 100% sure if Mages were widely considered the best all around or not.
---
definitely not accurate as nobody on our server cleared Naxx (or even did more than 1 boss) and people in my guild were able to link a KT drop after inspecting someone with it in a battleground
---
If the priest is wearing Truefaith Vestments and the warrior is wearing a Lionheart Helm and Stockcade Pauldrons it's unmistakable. If a player has born the expense in time of something that visible it's safe to assume the rest of their gear is reasonable but hopefully not immaculate. Every class has iconic tier sets that you can glance at and say oh, "T2 shamy" compare to present retail where nothing stands out and even if you do inspect rings and trinkets you have no clue beyond ilvl who is better geared.
---
So far you said mage raid pve is boring.
---
In pvp and 5 mana tough mages arent boring.
---
They are crazy good. 
---
Lock druid priest is a crazy combo to level with too, just insane. Mage druid priest is possibly even better tough in world pvp. Mage and priest can pull like 10 mobs and aoe them from
---
Lvl 18 so add a druid in the mix to help pulling and things are really easy.
---
Raid spots dont matter, mage and locks are always in high demand, especially the closer well be to aq 40.
---
Did you consider warrior? They are the opposite of boring to play in raids and combo great with druid or priest, especially with both haha
---
I’m not talking about now.
---
when that thing was pulsing black and you saw a warrior or enh shammy coming at you, look out.
---
Dont go warrior if you hate farming.
---
Id recommend druid for have fun leveling and tanking.
---
Engi is a must on any class but as druid if you dont like pvp  you can run away and skip engi haha.
---
As horde druid you start with +15 herb. Going herb engi is great, you can always level an alt for alchemy. Level 5 gets ou 75 alch for decent starter potion. Lvl 10 gets you 150 alch. You acces armor potions, 6 health per 5 sec pots etc.
---
At 20 on your alt you can get alch to 225 already and craft some real stuff like great rage potions, elixir of fortitude, defense, mighty troll blood(12hp/5sec crazy for lvling ur main) etc.
---
So yeah its always dumb to be alch on your main... just rested level your alt to 35 and enjoy the free transmutes everyday/2 days.
---
Pvp server no question if you dont want to miss on a big part of the reason why wow never felt the same after vanilla.. you really need to watch your back and play different in the lvl 30s+
---
Druids are awesome coupled with the classes you mentionned. Warriors require ton of gold at 60 to be decent in raids and pvp. They can be the most rewarding class too
---
gnomes, dwarves, night elves, and humans.
---
I'm not a fan of paladins or ez mode pve.
---
Also, that perfect tea bag technique
---
Really fun in most 1v1. You really crush mages rogues warrior while leveling on a fresh server. At 60 too if your gear is similar. In group pvp you are just annoying, ppl will ignore you since you deal no dmg so get engineering to at least help with Cc and grenade interupts
---
Lockdotcom
---
Mages really shine in 5 mans.
---
That's the truth.  I ran UBRS close to 50 times.  Got outrolled every time the magisters robe dropped and only once was it to another mage.
---
I leveled a mace spec Orc Rogue after 1.9.  I was an unstoppable PvP murder machine.  I'd do shit like taking on 2 hunters both higher level than me, murder warriors in T1/T2 gear while I'm blues, etc.  And at the time everyone though mace spec was garbage.  It was lovely.  However, I hated PvE as a rogue. Bored me to death.
---
I need to see a vod of you MTing Nef as a feral Druid where your guild doesn’t overgear the crap out of it. I don’t see how it’s possible to hold agro unless your dps stops attacking and the healers have to blow a lot of cds to keep you alive. 
---
Hey! We probably played together, though I dont remember your name specifically. I mained Gallstaff, a NE warrior who MT/OT in Recoil for the first year or so. I remember Tigerzero! I think he was the lone dps warrior during BWL. I can't remember the guild leader's name, but I think Tinythunder was an officer. Do you remember Spade? (another Hunter)
---
People can call it whatever they want. But something can still be hard to get with the current system, and not be insanely, stupid hard to get.
---
All I’m saying is if most people agree it’s a bad system, and most people also agree that they don’t want many significant changes to classic, then there should in theory be room for compromise in a situation like this. Change it, but do not change it so drastically, that people are justified in calling them “wellfare epics”
---
This literally proves you haven't.  If you're in a good guild no one dies?? Everyone has progression fights my friend and everyone needs healthstones and soulstones.  I never said farming shards was difficult, I was saying you can't "coast" through... if I try to use your concept of "Oh I didn't mean that, I just meant the class is easy to play during fights"  then there isn't one class besides a properly played feral that doesn't fall into that category.  Nice try but you got called on your bluff man.... move on. 
---
Feral OT is very uncommon because every raid has a shit ton of warriors and it makes more sense to have them OT, then get back to DPSing at much higher levels than a feral druid. 
---
Raided through AQ40 in Vanilla.  Guild had 1 prot warrior(MT), 1 fury warrior with Prot talents(Primary OT, held aggro better than MT), and 10+ arms warriors.  They all raided, OT, and the alike.
---
If you you want to get into raiding at a high level but don't have a guild lined up, by far your best bet is just playing a crap load and getting to max level quickly. Virtually every guild will just be desperate for max level members for the first 2 months.
---
I've loved trolls ever since I was wrecking humans with Zuljin in the wc2 campaign.
---
WoW TBC era lore was a retarded shitshow.
---
+5 swords.
---
Spec enhance 0/31/20 and get the heal talents.  All the enh goodness, 5% less damage on shocks and no clearcasting.  You'll be fine =P
---
Kim Possible
---
Want good dungeon runs?  Join a guild with lots of people.  Guildies simply play better together than PUGs. 
---
Kill DM E lasher packs with holy nova for gold instead.
---
Whatever the guild decides on 👍
---
I made a thread about this yesterday and it got shot down hard. No discussion, people like the system apparently...
---
Good guilds don’t progress through 14 year old content, they just kill it lol
---
Seems like you guys play in a separate tier. 
---
I even got their appearances planned already so I take the least possible amount of time on character creation.
---
I hope to go by best website.
---
Level the priest with herbalism, pick black lotus before anyone else is 300 skill. Or just stay shadow for a few days and farm elemental fire.
---
Being ahead of the pack is insane for gold in my experience. Got epic mount in under 5days /played on a rogue and a hunter on various fresh privates.
---
The DM Lashers are good once people start catching up though, can do that as holy with bad gear ezpz
---
No
---
So upon hitting 60, you are going to 1shot every single boss that's released?  Keep embarrassing yourself ;D  You have no clue what you're even saying.
---
But the thing is that **no one**, here, can know anything sure about it, unless they work at Blizzard.  
---
A GM, on the other hand, can send the query up the chain, to whoever is responsible for it, and their answer will also determine any subsequent behavior.  
---
If the GM tells you "it should work", and it doesn't, you have scratched a card (*i.e.:* lost a potentially valuable asset), so they will have to do something about it.  
---
If the GM tells you "it will not work", on the other hand, you can decide to sell the cards on EBay, or to use the codes on retail (if they still work there).  
---
Asking here only means diving into a sea of uninformed conjectures, and that's just wrong.
---
Bro, that’s exactly what happens. I’ve literally done that multiple times. The raids aren’t hard if you actually know how to do them and prepare ahead of time. 
---
Again, you’re on a separate tier. 
---
Still can't decide if I should plan **Priest** or **Mage**.
---
I love priest, especially shadow priest. I feel like I'll just be asked to heal come end game though. I also enjoy playing support and helping others. Someone said that shadow priests got their useful skills/talents in TBC though, so that's put me off one.  
---
I've never played mage past level 25ish. Seemed fun, but also found myself wishing I could heal. I remember spending a lot of time drinking because it as oom. Not sure how sought after they are for raids either. 
---
Any advice? Thanks in advance.
---
Ultrazord / megazord was the leader. Your name kinda does ring a bell! I don't recall spade though. 
---
You still playing retail? 
---
Plans for classic? 
---
Group with people who are competent in groups, join their guilds.
---
How do you know the design philosophy and thoughts blizzard had about the system when they developed it? 
---
A lot of it's early philosophy was to remove unfun aspects common in every other mmo at the time. I highly doubt Blizzard was thinking let's add this unfun grinding system into the game because it's super hardcore.
---
Chances are that you'll run instances with pugs where there's 2-4 guildies. If they're good in a pug, they might be worth investigating as a guild.
---
1) Yes originally that was patched in vanilla early on and dungeons were given max sizes.
---
2) Yes but it was capped to 5 per hour, as in any person could only entire 5 dungeons per hour.  As it was a per person cap you couldn't game it by getting someone who hadn't done the dungeon to join. 
---
Yup. Easily averages to about 50g an hour.
---
This
---
My best way so far is NOT joining a guild at all, until you find the one that suits you well. 
---
As an example, on the last private server I've pretty much no-lifed to hitting cap + pre-raid gear/professions in a matter of 1,5 months. By that point, people who raided basically couldn't be bad, because if you can manage to do the same, you're either really experienced or nerdy enough to be good at the game. I've been invited to join the guild several times by that point, but passed on all of them.
---
Then the first pugs happened, I've been doing it for 3 weeks and we successfully cleared all the available content. In one of those raids, dude whispered me and said "Hey we're forming a new guild, here's our rulebook, here's the days we raid, here's our format/philosophy,   wanna come?". 
---
Not only I knew some of the members already, I've also seen in action how the stuff gonna look like. How the RL manage things, how the other folks communicate, what's the overall atmosphere, et cetera et cetera. And I've liked it. 
---
So I've ended up in a guild that both good at the game and my presence here is not a chore, meaning that I'm enjoying hanging out with them rather than being forced to sit there for the progress.
---
Just do the same. Look narrowly at players around you, and choose a bunch that you like the most.
---
The paladins leaving SW, so epic.
---
priest has no chance to farm fire ele early on. That shit gets locked down hard by a mage, lock, hunter. Usually pairs as well and PvPing around the area. 
---
The general level of competency will based on how long until after launch they have their first raid. Just a general rule of thumb of course there will be good guilds that are late but pretty much the hardcore guilds will be formed first. Then the guilds to be formed afterwards to step into mc will be the semit hardcore guilds and the guilds that have their first raid day 5 months into launch will be the casual guilds even if they advertise as semi hardcore it will be mostly casual. 
---
this is a great point. My first character was named Ikoichul. I don't know how it should be pronounced(I also don't know how to write phonetically) but I read it as: I-koi-chul. Everyone else pronounced it Ickoi-chul which i absolutely hated. Later changed it to Iko (I-co) but others still said it Icko.
---
You can tank even in raids with the cat dps spec, but not bosses really. Dungeons,for sure. I used to tank adds on some bosses and trash as well in raids. Healing can be done with proper gear in dungeons but i would not recommend it as your casts even with talents are so slow and without talents it's gonna be horrible. Pummelers are used only in raids, you dont benefit from them that much in dungeons where everything dies so fast. And the grind would be too much so better use them on raid bosses only.
---
50g/hr? I wish.
---
More like 20-25g/hr in vendor junk and an extra ~10g in AHable herbs. Still pretty decent though.
---
I automatically downvote the term when I see it, even in otherwise good posts. Probably accounts for 75% of my reddit downvotes. Implying that standards, tradition, or opinions are pathological is an abhorrent way of thinking. 
---
3 days a week for naxx is more than enough to clear it
---
The most ridiculous thing about it is it implies all opinions are equal just because you decided to have one. Sorry, but they aren't. 
---
Except hockey
---
Translation: We're still trying to decide how to best approach cosmetic microtransactions.
---
Yeah, the one I responded to is definitely not equal. It's subhuman.
---
Making a money alt isn't worth it.  If you go really hard and way ahead of the pack, find a friend to will farm Devilsaurs with you for about a week.  Then you'll be good for a long time.
---
Otherwise just do the traditional farming methods, nova lashers.  It was nerfed on the recent private servers.  It may not be on classic.
---
Both i guess.
---
Im also dead set on a warlock, so that and probably a druid or ill even start druid im not decided yet
---
How was it nerfed?
---
Still Wednesday, so might as well ask before I get sober enough to forget about it.
---
I've been playing a boomkin for a long time (Wrath), and a druid since vanilla.  Originally went the feral/resto route for PvE and managed to reach blood guard with my limited hours, but no desire to repeat that grind at all.
---
My heart wants me to go druid again, because I love the idea of being a ranged caster, but still able to shift into other roles in a pinch.  But everything I've read says they were not a viable spec for PvE before 3.0.
---
My backup plan was to go Warrior, but the time requirement for farming consumables just feels daunting and impossible for me to allocate.
---
So my question is, what do I do?  I have 0 interest in the other Horde classes (and all alliance races).  And picking something with the hope that it gets buffed later is not a smart plan given the community backlash at any notion of *change*.  But picking a class you can't put in the time to play properly just disappoints everyone.
---
Australia says “blinkers”
---
You get more rage when you crit.
---
Am I the only one who thinks the cover looks hack as shit? 
---
I agree, later on. However it didn't originally have an AH (which hurts it because people don't want to change their habits), so before that it was kind of shit.
---
Also there is no zepplin until a few expansions in. Sucks for cross continent travel.
---
But goddamn that outdoor AH is nice. Definitely the best city for bank alts once it's there.
---
Strongest argument for axes over swords. If you're fighting some jerk face who controls you with a snare or freeze or whatever and you only get a window of attack to land a Hamstring and a Mortal Strike. I would much rather have my Mortal Strike critical hit more reliably (34.6% was what I was at without buffs.)
---
A 5% sword process is more like a Hail Mary play to me. 5% chance of killing some fucking mage or hunter that is going to bend me over with Frost Novas and traps? I'm not putting all my eggs in that basket.
---
Undead.
---
Zero interest, and to be honest I thought the idea of being on the Horde was stupid to begin with. 
---
Really hard to say since I don't know you.

But with that said, I had a lot of fun as rogue in vanilla. You can always find something to do... Annoy people (sap raids going to MC) , go to the allie cities, kill, stalk rpers, chill with gold farmers at Tyr's Hand at nighttime, easy hiding when gathering or camping something, spam feint over and over and over again. 
---
I mean, I loved playing rogue back then.
---
If I'm not going rogue, then I'll be mage. Very fun for worldpvp.
---
If you will pve, then both of these are very very dull. Maybe a warriortank or something. Possibly healer. 
---
It's like dividing by zero, or googling google.
---
Can a shaman heal 5 mans while working towards 60 or are they only good for late game? 
---
From devs understanding to activision bosses respecting &lt;- that chasm
---
Well boring class to play is different than boring friends you play with, so mage and rogue might be boring but if I have a good time with people I may not mind, but thank you for your help this has made me lean a bit.
---
I was reading that it’s hard to get into the main raid parties as a Druid because of the lack of rez. I found it hard to believe seeing as I doubt all healers in a 40 would ever be druids lol. 
---
Yeeeeehaaaa!
---
Lights hope messes with the lashers' loot tables.  They also nerfed hunter solo tribute. 
---
No that i remember, mind control used to do the trick iirc.
---
Very true. I was mostly talking a out the mechanics when raiding (which I did a lot with my rogue in Vanilla). Very mind-numbing.
---
Hope you'll enjoy whatever you choose! Vanilla will be fun 
---
No one has mentioned your post at all dumbo, we're over here talking about gate keeping. I guess we're also now kind of talking about your insecurities but none of us care all that much about that either. 
---
It was an old comic since Vanilla, never knew who made them but I found their [site](https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2005/11/28/wow-patch-notes-1.9)
---
I was a NE warrior in vanilla :/ . I hated the animations and the way thr armor never fit. After t1 I at least looked better.
---
Some of us aren't either of those irl so it's fun to see what all the fuss is about
---
Yeah, the blood elf are was awesome. But them joining the horde was still a stupid step. The Horde and Alliance both lost their identity from BC onwards.
---
How will we know what we are getting....oh wait.

---
&gt;Literally the only thing that holds us back is lack of shield which allows for crushing blows that hurt. 
---
I don't think you really understand tanking mechanics tbh given no bear is getting crit immune and they are a much bigger deal than crushing blows.
---
Pallies struggle with crushing blows, bears struggle with crits.
---
Using a bear on some bosses/gear levels leaves you open to tank deaths with unlucky crits and there's simply no reason to deal with that when you could just have a warrior instead.
---
&gt;For Chrom you need an ot with you as his enrage will probably crush an under geared Druid or a Druid with a healer not ready for it.
---
Druids shouldn't be either OT or MT on this fight until you are overgeared as both tanks potentially have to deal with the enrage.
---
Relying on not getting crit is not a valid strategy when you have options that don't need good RNG.
---
&gt;For nef, it’s doable again but just not ideal as we are not able to stance dance and we get shape shifted into cat where we get fucked up quickly. But when you need a tank you need a tank. Again doable not ideal
---
I think I'd prefer a pally or even a shaman tank to a Druid on Nef and both of those rely on pretty heavily outgearing the content.
---
Dealing with Nef hits+breath+cleave in cat form simply isn't a thing and I don't know why you'd suggest it is unless you lucked out completely. Losing all that armor and health on a hard hitting boss is not a viable way to play the game.
---
&gt;Druid feral is NOT a meme spec at all, it’s the only other option available for tanking besides warrior also as paladins cant taunt.
---
It's certainly not something I'd suggest as a default main tank. They make far better off tanks and are better on some fights, however their weaknesses are larger than warriors'. Anyone thinking about rolling a druid tank should be aware of their strengths and weaknesses.
---
I remember 30k like it wasn’t that long ago, oh right it wasn’t cuz this hype train going strong!!
---
CHOOCHOO
---
Feral OT is HIGHLY DESIRED - though slightly rare. Mostly because most Druids aren't dedicated to Feral and just shrug and begin to heal, since gearing isn't as simple as saying "Sure I'll buff MoTW" and getting your full Tier set in a couple weeks - it takes some 5-man slogging to find the best pieces.
---
Having a Feral in your Tank group increases everyones DPS due to crit aura boosing their threat, and for certain bosses it's incredibly useful to have a Bear Tank. One of the nice things about Feral Druids is you can deal moderate DPS compared to a Prot Warrior (and giving your buffs) makes it really undervalued by more people. You'll do great!
---
No the factions shouldn't have evolved beyond that. Burning Crusage may have been WoWs high point in terms of gameplay but the Alliance and Horde lost their identity right there.
---
But there are some mistakes here. Kul Tiras is not part of the new Alliance. Same goes for the Kirin Tor. They should be put on Slight Alliance bias.
---
Lmao. I’m just speaking my mind dude. Therea nothing “fotm” about recognising the inherent difference between a story told passively through environment and a story told through cutscenes and melodrama with the same recurring cast of characters, the only change over time being the death of WC3 characters and their replacement by MMObois, with the few WC3 characters still left being treated like deities. I don’t just mean BfA, this has been happening pretty much since ICC patch. 
---
I’d rather have lazy books that no one reads lying around ingame rather than vital plot told through external, non-diegetic fanfic books like War Crimes.
---
It’s like you’re clutching at straws to defend retail.
---
like others mentioned, aoe'ing lashers is actually good money, no need for an alt haha
---
&gt;or Tauren cause Druid is a major choice for me cause I wanna heal
---
Play a Druid.
---
Teleport, food &amp; water, blink, sheep...great selection of spells.
---
Ah men, this brings me back to when i started playing wow. I was a bit of a late bloomer so I started mid WotLK. I started as a Tauren Shaman and these things are the ones i remember so vividly. 
---
Good ol' times, but i do not think we can recreate that with classic wow. We already know the WoW universe. There is not much that is to be rediscovered. Perhaps some places or questlines or w/e that you didn't know, but the real WOW of WoW is gone i think.
---
Wait, What?! What's all this negativity? FK RETAIL YAY CLASSIC WOOOH. Let's grind our asses till there's nothing left!
---
Arcanite Reaper
---
YEEEEEEEEE
---
After 30k it just became memes.
---
I think they should find a way to allow pvp rankers to take a break. Maybe something like: If you have less than 15 HK's in a week, there is no honor decay for that week.
---
Cause it's a really long grind, and life happens, especially now that we're older. Nobody should have to choose between something big, like a funeral/wedding/jury duty/etc, because they are **this** close to rank 12-14.
---
Why is Sweden so overrepresented in hardcore PC gaming like this?
---
Is it the combo of €€ and bad weather?
---
Actually makes more sense to use a Feral OT. That means you can gear up your MT and your other offtanks faster as the feral share very little gear.
---
They still need to get some good dps pieces however, like boots of shadow flame f.ex. But that is no different from how you would gear up your warriors with good hit plate for Threat.
---
Dude, just buy a comode. Maybe alienware/razor/madcatz can start making gaming comodes, with red/blue/green raceing stripes, black leather, mic holder, bucket seat.
---
i guess i would be ok with sharding in the first week for lvl 1-10 areas.
---
but i am really scared, that if they do it once, they will to it again.
---
Wow, I looked at the numbers last night and wondered how long it would take to reach 50. So impressed it happened overnight.
---
Unless you get stuck with being your guild's shadow weaving bitch and they also want you to have PI. So no holy nova.
---
Please send thoughts and prays for ya boy. :(
---
Seen no evidence this would be the case
---
Exactly my sentiments
---
Shoulders
---
Yeah, good luck convincing 22 mages to split loot while you DE 90% of what drops each week. These "problems" correct themselves. 
---
&gt;it will trigger an avalanche of arguments and hate
---
I mean, you're kinda right with this part, but it's Blizzard we're talking about here, not some small indie company. They're definitely not scared of posting anything, especially these days. If they wanted they'd post it and they wouldn't listen to anyone. 
---
I ran 10 mages WSG in Vanilla. Good times. 
---
Not just animations, but the significantly simpler textures, slower refresh rates (think energy ticking 10 every second instead of 1 every 1/10th of a second) and models make classic SIGNIFICANTLY easier on bandwidth than retail, which is relatively bloated both in bandwidth and graphical requirements.
---
For the HORDE!
---
Terrible mobility, too much threat generation, shard farming is anti-fun, summoning is annoying and costs shards, too dependent on deathcoil... I mean warlocks are great but they get outshined in a lot of areas tbh.
---
gotta make money to change specs to keep playing to keep making money to keep playing to keep making money

Please don’t hype mages as ”the best all-round class”. 
---
They have a lot of plusses, but let’s have a look at the drawbacks:
---
- squishy
---
- drinking issues
---
- commitment issues
---
- arrogant
---
As you see, mages may on paper provide the best dps, cc, mobility, aoe, kiting and world pvp utility, BUT. Do they bring meals home? I’d like to say yes.
---
But what good is a drunk gnome staggering through dungeon only able to cast frostbolt on the wrong mobs, who doesn’t use sheep right, goes ”oom” after two minutes and dies to the most basic aoe packs.
---
Trolls, Tauren for Horde. Dwarfs for Alliance. 
---
I didn't like visuals, I didn't connect with those in War3 and I never felt like playing/RPing as Dwarf. Their jilly jolly lifestyle doesn't suit me. 
---
Isn’t the 2H fury before 40 build still valid without sit macros?
---
the starting zone is one of the best, it was so fucking magical with that beautiful music
---
You can casually tank your way to 60, and for gearing through dungeons at 60, and then switch to DPS for raiding. This is an easy way to get all the groups and gear you need while remaining relatively casual for raiding. It’s a common warrior strategy too.
---
I don't know. Can you? ;)
---
See I want to but I'm too much of a pussy cause I hate mulgore 
---
Then run over to durotar or tirisfal. 
---
Try a Pandaren Carpenter or Goblin Accountant. I also like Human Bus Driver’s.
---
Lvl 1-10 takes what? 3-4hrs? Or at worst 6hrs if you're going slow?
---
You'll be out of that zone in no time.
---
Alliance: Gnomes. I really dislike the short races. At least Dark Iron Dwarves look really neat, and for that I made *one*, but only the one.
---
Horde: Goblin, Troll. Short and ugly, respectively. Followed by Tauren --- I'd rather play a Tauren than an Orc, but I do have an Orc shaman. I suppose if I got Highmountain, I'd be more apt to play a Tauren.
---
Both: Pandaren. No thank you.
---
I circumvented this problem by finishing Teldrassil and taking the boat (RIP) to Stormwind, then continuing in the human areas.
---
Yeah, at 10 I ran to UC to Weapon Master. Was just confused after! 
---
Yeah true.
---
Mulgore is like 0.001% of your whole lvling experience, just go for it 
---
&gt; Mostly because most Druids aren't dedicated to Feral and just shrug and begin to heal,
---
This is wrong for 1.12 private servers.
---
Plus I have honestly been thinking Mage since Vurtne is one of my favorite players out there so idk
---
As u/jurgenaut says, you can run to any other starting zone. However, I'd just like to point out that levels 1-10 are over pretty quick. Most classes are into the next zone within a few hours.
---
But Kul'Tirans are just humans, who come from Kul'Tiras and aren't part of the Alliance (Normally they wear white and greenish clothes/armor).
---
Looks like a good amount of new friends to appreciate the game with me once i get started again ;)
---
I mean CC like sheep. In a 5 man in theory a rogue could try to stunlock a mob, but that dps would be missing on the other mobs you are trying to kill. SAP, the rogues only long time CC has a % of revealing you, thus you have to vanish instantly (has a CD) or die misserably.
---
The worse your group is (e.g. because of gear), the more CC you will need. Stun-locking a mob is therefore not an option. In PvP you are completely right, a rogue can 100-0 you without you being able to move for a even a bit.
---
Feral OT works, for me it was more of a ”how much fun is it”.
---
Not hating and I know there is worse classes but you basicly spam Maul and use swipe to ragedump. 
---
For me warrior was more fun with ”save the situation”-buttons.
---
This is true
---
People underestimate how much desperation can be involved in trying to put together a cohesive 40 man team. If you’re lvl 60 and speak the same language as the GM you’re pretty set in the early stages. 
---
Wait what? I used to live there and never heard anyone say that. Then again how often do you talk about indicators.
---
In the UK a blinker is something you put on a horse.
---
For example a tribe, a clan or a cult.
---
but enh is a meme spec. its actually bad 
---
How did Horde not get ogres. I was hoping for them ever since they came out with the ogre idol toy
---
Dwarf, Gnome, Tauren, Orc and Undead were the races I have never played seriously. Maybe an alt for fun a little but that's it.
---
Nightelf are my favorite Alliance race and Troll my favorite Horde race. I have also played a female human mage just because I thought they had the best animations in the game.
---
The starting areas are not that important since you leave them pretty early. Mounts on the other hand are very important. Sabers and Raptors were my favorites. One of the reasons I played Troll/Nightelf. I know you can get these mounts with other races, but I think most mounts fit their specific race the best. A Tauren on a Raptor doesn't really look that cool. 
---
I didn't really bother with BGs in retail.
---
I started on a private server in November, hit 60 over Christmas and have been checking out BGs/PvP rank system recently.
---
Whilst I have no clue what I'm doing in AV - I do find it strange that it seems to involve riding straight towards the enemy boss, killing some high HP boss mobs and mostly avoiding the other team?
---
There have been some games where lines of horde/alliance ride straight past eachother
---
They are one of the best, but there are some things you are missing.
---
Mages have the highest quality in Vanilla in 1.1 WoW. This ain't 1.1. This is 1.13. Example would be 16 debuffs in tier 1 and 2 that never existed when it was current content. Locks are just as good as mages now in those tiers. Locks sucked in PvP in 1.1. They are just as good in 1.12.
---
Locks level WAY easier and better on a new server because AOE grinding will be so contested. 
---
They can both farm gold easily. Mage makes more money AOE leveling after server pop dies down a bit though or if you get WAY ahead of the pack and don't sleep for a few days. Hunter also farms gold extremely well,
---
Mages CC and utility in 5 mans is not really that boring. In raids? Yeah they are pretty boring outside fights you decurse on, but raiding is NOT about rotation in Vanilla. It's about threat. With how dumbed down tier 1 and 2 is in Classic, the first real raid will be AQ, so raiding is going to be "boring" mechanically anyways. Basically have a party in tier 1 and 2 with fun guilds imo. Play music and joke around like people did in Naxx in WOTLK. AQ will be like jumpting from Naxx to Uld. The only thing close to a difficult ranged raid rotation in vanilla is hunter who has to use a swing timer for autoshot. On melee it's feral druid and sword rogue (far and away their best spec due to 1.8/1.9 changes) because you can't clip auto swing on the main hand just like the hunter with autoshot. Tanks are the only really "pro class" in Vanilla raiding and it's much more than rotation. They have to adjust for comp, have a stupid amount of gear sets, sometimes tank in dps gear and on and on. Tanks have tremendous power inside guilds in vanilla for a reason. They are the one thing you can't replace.
---
 In PVP mages are one of the highest skill cap classes though and use every spell in their spellbooks including ranks. Do they have a higher skill ceiling than the other ranged? I don't think so. Higher than SL Lock, but that spec is stupid.Higher than BM Hunter but that spec is stupid to. Marks Hunters and burstier Lock specs might not be as twitchy but still take a lot of skill to master. 
---
So while mages have a very high quality of life in Vanilla compared to something like a Elemental Shaman or Boomkin who has to heal and doesn't even get any gear from ranking PvP, I would say it's arguable that they are the best all around ranged, let alone class. They are in no way bad though. In group pvp think utility. In solo pvp think skillcap.
---
Do you have an idea of the class population in private classic server ? It can give me a small idea of what's gonna be needed the most.
---
300g an hour?
---
I would wake up, pvp all day in ab, then go to bed. Got rank13. My friend would duo pvp with me all day and held rank14 for a few weeks. We'd sit in long matches 24/7 and just have fun playing the game.
---
You don't need to do quick wins.
---
Never played the souls games. What do you mean? How are monsters and environments there fundamentally different than wows?
---
This is the hearthstone mmo bro
---
This is specifically when you are one of the first few on the server to 60. I had the fire eles in felwood to myself for hours in a row.
---
It of course depends how much you nolife it, but typically it should be deserted first 10 days IRL time or so. You can also do it to grind the last few levels, makes /played worse but $$$
---
Definitely once the pack catches up grinding open world is no good, but that's the time for getting prebis anyway
---
Ikr 
---
Yep crackin skulls for days lol
---
Oh yeah! I raided on won't mention which server for like a year and finally got my hands on Ash'jrethul just before AQ dropped, and those big aimed and multi crits are unreal for pvp! Sniping clothies in AV was my go-to for a short while just because it was so fun to unleash that truckload of damage on people!
---
Yep, I did the same thing when raiding zg, mc and so on. Always went resto for the group.
---
Yes, though imho the main thing that ruined draenei was making up bd lore so they wouldn't look ugly.
---
What kills it for me is their feet. Can't they wear shoes normally?
---
Try out a class on the "those that shall not be named" servers just level to 15 or 20 and you will know if you like the class, or a instant 60 server, pm me if you need directions
---
Nothing can stop this train!
---
It's one of those 'can only have one per guild' positions, kinda like spriest. You need to be a committed player to pull it off.
---
Paladin and Druid both can play 3 roles, right? I don't know how viable Holy Paladin is at all, but since you said Paladins are kind of lesser in tanking compared to the Warrior and the Druid.....thanks for the reply, I'll check the Druid out, but I can already feel that I'll just end up being a Priest, that's just who I am in WoW. :3
---
What is the difference between horde and alliance here that I'm missing? 
---
Regarding wpvp, rogues really get to pick their battles, hunters more just have an awareness of what's incoming. Don't go hunter if you don't have excellent ping imo, or limited fd/trap shenanigans.
---
MS debuff will be considered an issue by serious progression guilds though.
---
Mace stun was a seperate DR from KS/CS, and combined with the massive damage from HARP in TBC it was about the most OP rogue had ever been, even moreso with glaives. So no, the extra stuns weren't worthless.
---
Does anyone know if the QoL Shaman changes will be making it into classic? I'm talking "drop 4 totems at once" sort of thing.
---
Tipsout and madseasonshow. tipsout produces some good content and needs more subscribers.  He has been building up lots of well produced guides with great personality behind them. Madseasonshow is more retrospective then guide but if you're wanting to learn about classic he produces good stuff. 
---
You'd be surprised how much you can forget. I haven't played much since vanilla. I rolled a char 2 days ago on a private server and it hit me. Both nostalgia and curiosity. I was young when I played so there are a lot of stuff I missed or didn't understand.
---
Perfectly balanced, intentionally worse so they don't imbalance PvP.
---
&gt; The Orcish Horde would be pissed off at their Forsaken leader for starting another war.
---
I don't think so.  
---
As long as there's fighting to do, the Orcs are happy.
---
Will limit it to Horde side, since that is all I play usually and old WoW. 
---
Trolls. Not because I think they are stupid. I think Troll male caster animations are the greatest thing ever. Unfortunately their racials suck (for PvP) outside shadowpriest and I prefer Mage, Ele Shaman.
---
Warstomp is game changing for ele shaman. WOTF less so for mage, but still better against soft counters like Lock, Spriest.
---
As far as lore starting area, I think the Undead one speaks to me the most I guess. The old Brill Inn music was awesome. I like Silverpine a lot and Shadowfang keep. The idea that the Undead live in a sh%#hole and that everyone wants to kill them and they are kind of loners and their own faction is interesting. You feel...well...forsaken. It always felt like the orc/troll starting areas were kind of rushed and thrown together compared to all the other races. I think they kind of suck to be honest. All the alliance ones are really good. 
---
One thing which is funny to me is People who want "Manuell Server merging" over sharding in Starter zones....
---
Sharding is basicly  Automatic Server Merging with shared name Pool... merging two complete Realms with own Communitys, market, Names etc. is way more Anti-Vanilla in my opinion then having 1-10 Zones sharded.
---
There just is no good solution for the Community. Either we have lag and queue or sharding in Starter zones. Both suck. But from a Dev. standpoint i can see why sharding sounds better.
---
Female dwarf naked rogue named Pawgchamp would be pretty clutch.
---
This was the reason for so many AFK people in alterac valley lol. 
---
Yeah, when I play Horde the Undead starting zone speaks to me the most, too.
---
Regarding the "forsaken" feeling: if I recall correctly, don't they start at neutral with any other Horde faction to show just how alien and begrudgingly accepted by the other three races they are? I think it was like that once.
---
Or that they're friendly with just Tauren for lore reasons... Idk.
---
yes these items are bis I'm not counting them as "OP" like the original commenter mentioned. As good as CaC is for a healer it's still only healer loot and not going to be a game breaking piece. Same with Puissant Cloak - yes it's probably bis until AQ for rogues/warriors but I doubt it's much more than a single digit dps upgrade in the end (maybe more with full wbuffs). Sort of forgot about kazzak legs and they're bis for locks in the absolute endgame. Bis items for their given periods of time and very cool pieces of loot due to uniqueness, but hardly OP. Maybe I'm just being pedantic about the terminology here.
---
It depends on if Blizzard will allow hunter soloing in DMT or mage/Paladin soloing in DME. 
---
Many private servers broken that with un-blizzlike changes for the same of server economy and keeping down inflation. I would imagine blizzard might do the same to certain ways of solo farming.
---
It's important not to confuse hate with valid criticism. 
---
Kul Tirans have always been "just humans", until they decided to make them buff in BfA.  
---
The buff and lanky humans should have just been alternate body types for humans, and Kul Tiras as a separate race makes no sense...
---
It all depends on what route blizzard will take in regards to progressive itemization.
---
Briarwood Reed.  
---
Never got it back in the day despite doing enough UBRS runs to see 4x Flask of Titans recipes
---
And a bit stockier
---
early game feral is fine, lategame feral... not so much
---
My main will be holy priest so I’m prob gonna have tailoring and enchanting at 60 so I’m thinking herb/alchemy on a paladin alt.
---
^This pretty much. We wont see def-stacking in Classic as we saw in vanilla because the cieling will be higher, thus putting more pressure on the MT to produce more TPS.
---
Also, defcap is kindof a meme really. Only needed in 1-2 bosses in all of vanilla and only in progress raids really.
---
That’s a really solid trinket
---
I've never been a fan of Gnomes, they're just silly to me. Also I can't really play Trolls because of how gear looks on them.
---
Yeah all neutral cept Undead. I think in TBC you were friendly with Blood Elves? Not sure. I really hope this music is in the Brill Inn.

BFA Collectors Edition, literally the only reason I bought it!

Last night I made a pot of tea, snuggled up on the sofa with the book &amp; played the Vanilla WoW soundtrack on repeat... 
---
SUMMER 2019!!!!
---
Those two are Brady Games Vanilla WoW guides . Original edition and master guide 2nd edition.
---
You've stolen my idea 😋
---
They could post nothing but good news and fulfilled community wishes and yet there would inevitably be a flurry of shitstorms ravaging the forums and YouTube. The community has brought this upon themselves.
---
As someone who learned the story from wow then went back to wc3 it still makes no sense
---
Feelsgoodman
---
Always dreamed of making a druid only guild but there's NAY way that Gerald are going to cut it in classic as the goto DPS and Tank when it comes to raiding. Won't stop me from maining one though 😋👍 
---
Dont not play what you want becasue of the first few hours. Its gonna take 2 hundred or more hours to hit 60 
---
only ever played human, gnome, nighteld and undead. 
---
all the other races are so ugly I can't imagine looking at them for an extended amount of time. 
---
oh yeah andcI always play the exact same style combo for each race.  
---
alli only female, ud varying. 
---
Well there was one thing that wouldn’t move out of its’ way..
---
Huntard is a way better leveler IMO. unless you want to aoe farm or some shit all the way to 60. Warrior destroys everyone in world pvp with gear more than mage. You often roll vs the healer and mayber another dps like someone else here said. Cloth gear doesnt look as cool as mail or plate gear. hybrid classes also fucking heal themselves in pve a mage cant do that. Mage is certainly one of the best classes but I dont think many people really consider it to be the best all around class by any means. Tbh i always considered warrior to be the best class. Its tough to level but not super elite hard like everyone says
---
Sweden as a country is pretty well off and we didnt go broke after wwii, for example, which helped a lot (as far as I know, cant factcheck now). We got good internetconnections early on... and depending on where you worked you were able to buy a new, top notch computer every 3 years (I and my siblings always made sure she got the best one) tax free. 
---
And we also got bad weather, yes, so that prolly factors into it as well (a tiny bit at least).
---
I thought mace stun was tbc?
---
Really nice answer IMO
---
but menethil and theramore are kul tiran and alliance only, and nethergarde and ambermill are kirin tor and alliance 
---
For those who haven't kept up, why are the Zandalar only friendly to horde now? Did both sides not help defeat Hakkar? Did alliance rep get deleted when that happened? I don't understand this whole allied races shit, not sure if I want to hah.
---
For my BA it depended on the quality and depth. This person conducted 20 in depth interviews which is obviously worth more than 20 reddit surveys.
---
I remember getting rep with AV to exalted allowed me to purchase the ram for very cheap. will that be thete too you think?
---
Theramore is not part of Kul Tiras. Same goes for Menethil harbour. There are members of the Kirin Tor which would be loyal to the alliance. But many members are bloodelfs, which would reject the alliance. Kirin Tor would be in the slight Alliance bias category.

I bet you have been eye balling it for days just so you can eat up all the karma..

Tell us how to farm 300g on a warrior.
---
Swoops are evil. Oww, a lonely lvl 6 bird... I can handle that as a lvl 5. BOOM SWOOP IN YOUR FACE! 1/3 OF YOUR HP GONE! WELCOME TO THE NEW ZONE BIATCH!
---
...and took off 30% of your hp
---
Least popular role is tank. Hybrids are forced into healing because they are mostly shit at dps/tanking unless played by a good and geared player.
---
Devilsaur Leather can potentially be 300g per hour depending on the market. You would need to be in control of the spawns though.
---
Other option is duoing DM: East with a priest, which is around 200g per hour. Hunter alt can get 150g-200g per hour in DM north too.
---
For 300g per hour you need to level mage alt and farm ZG crocolisks.
---
&gt; ps - oh yea and for WSG you're the MVP
---
Resto druids are WSG Mvps, not feral.
---
Ah yes the good old *pull two mobs and you’re fucked* thing! 
---
Except for the 30m rabies...
---
This sounds like exactly what I'm looking for. Here's my credentials:
---
NA, PvP, Horde, Orc Warrior, unknown play times (variable work shift/girlfriend), Priority will be casual to moderate PvP with some casual raiding included. Please contact via PM

About me: I played vanilla WoW during original beta through Burning Crusade. I mained a resto Shammy in a hardcore raiding guild (Warmongers on Ner'Zhul), but am not looking to recreate that particular experience. We full cleared MC, BWL, ONY, ZG, AQ20, and about half of AQ40 before infighting among guild leadership splintered the guild and effectively killed it. I'm 100% down for some raiding, but would not be able to commit to a regular raiding schedule. What I'm really looking for is an active guild interested in running some organized PvP, leveling/instances, world PvP (gankin' ally noobs all day long), and some 20-player raids. I'm not opposed to doing some hardcore raiding as long as my role would be primarily backup/fill-in for missing dps/off-tank slots. I've alted a Tauren warrior to 60 in the past and absolutely loved it and am looking to re-experience the ally smashing dominance that is the Warrior class. I also have some experience leading healers in raids and guiding new shaman through raid encounters. No raiding experience as a warrior. 
---
Apparently Arms from the get-go is more efficient without /sit.
---
Most important in vanilla is picking a class and sticking with it. Dont be that guy that just changes class every 3 week and doesn't end up with a good char. A friend om mine did this.
---
You're literally are talking about my comment, Einstein. Damn dude, I hope you at least wipe your mouth after sucking me off so much.
---
give the female a decidedly male name and people will treat you like a male, yet you can enjoy the better site of looking at a human or night elf female if the armor of the class you play fits better on a female.
---
Horde don't have paladins to give blessing of salvation to DPS to reduce threat. Instead they have shamans to give the melee wind fury since you aren't going to use the threat reduce totem.
---
Also the paladin buffs make feral DPS better/ easier to play.
---
What rationale? Progressive itemization means nothing without the progressive talent changes that caused the itemization changes—not to mention how stats like haste and threat were calculated differently across the various patches.
---
Factions had meaning when there was an exclusive class for each one, I'm one of the few, but I prefer when it was like that.
---
Phasing is not sharding.
---
Vanilla WoW raids can all be cleared by 25 people so idk why this would even be a thing.
---
I'm thinking of cool names all the time and even got a list specifically for Classic.
---
Heck, even this Reddit handle was something I randomly came up with
---
Not so long ago I tried to play on a launch day of some private server. [https://imgur.com/FKThRm4](https://imgur.com/FKThRm4) After this I'm 100% for starter zone sharding.
---
For the ALLIANCE!
---
And the fruit of your union shall be know as Whorecock, Prince of Darkness.
---
nah no one cares about what you have to say besides the gatekeeping part 
---
I kinda wish Alliance had a better war cry. For the Horde and Loktar'ogar sound so much better. 
---
For Lordaeron was so much better but we can't really use that any more and its not very race inclusive.
---
I've called my Kavat in Warframe "Ikati" for a while, it is an awfully neat name.
---
Not really, lore-wise they "fit" the Horde just as well as the Forsaken. 
---
If you're against BE in the Horde, you also have to be against Forsaken in the Horde. 
---
No need to stay triggered my friend.
---
nice meme

no im food spec!

worked every time in vanilla ;)

Not really a spell but Hardpacked Snowball can be found in AV during Christmas period and have a knock back effect + it works on enemy and ally

Nå vet vi kanskje ikke hvilke servere som kommer, men hadde vært bra å samle mest mulig norske på en server. Raidet med norske guilds i TBC og WOD. Likte det.
---
If you're after a hardcore guild then you'll know by their website and expectations, for more casual ones then it's all about whether you enjoy playing with those people.
---
...even worse than 2 mobs are 2 swoops. Normally you can beat 2 lvl 6 mobs as a lvl 6 shaman or druid,but 2 swoops? 
---
 *&lt;interrupts heal with swoop attack...you die&gt;*
---
Not entirely so. There's also a lot of 'ya we did that intentionally because of &lt;insert silly reason&gt; ' marketing bullshit answers so they didnt have to acknowledge they fucked up here and there.
---
Understandable of course.
---
Cant say I played shaman but I did play priest and there is no point in downranking in 5 mans.  Much better off wanding and then using a max rank efficient heal and then letting the 5 sec rule get your mana back as you wand again.  Not sure though if shamans play differently besides the obvious no wand so maybe autoattack or something.  Downranking is mostly effective when you have a lot of +heal gear and need to land near constant heals on a tank for a long fight.
---
The mechanics will be new for plenty (old warrior, stance dance), a long with every dungeon have quirks to bypass.  SFK initially at least with magic resistant worgens, and the damn curse.  WoTLK and dungeons beyond were cake due to "heroic" being added.  Cata had the initial patch of a challenge, then reversed. 
---
The problem with the Bloodelfs and the horde is that the bloodelfs are there to join the horde in the first place. They got slaughtered by Arthas in Northrend but are somehow still capable of retaking their homeland and then for some weird reason want to join the horde. Bloodelfs were just a cheap way of bringing Paladins to the horde. Same goes for Draenei.
---
The Forsaken fit the horde in so far as they got no other chance than to join. They were beset by enemies on all sides. The bloodelfs could theoretically just chill in Quel Thalas. There is no immediate threat to them. Also the bloodelfs would never join a faction full of orcs and especially trolls. They resent them with a passion. The bloodelfs are far to proud to ally themselves with "filth" like the horde.
---
1.3 limited all other dungeons to 10 players, still a raid but not unlimited. 
---
I also hope that blizzard is aware that the loudest people also tend to be a minority. 
---
If they do some minor class changes ot make offspecs more viable in raiding, I would still play classic.
---
If they are able to give boomkins &lt;x&gt; more dps in some way in PvE raids to make them acceptable dps by other raid members, but not enough to make them jealos I'd still play classic.
---
Same goes for all offspecs.
---
If they imroved pally's or druids in such a way that they could main tank (at the cost of completely gimping the healing power they have) , I'd still play classic. In fact, I think it would make classic the better and more diverse game for it.
---
And with me are thousands who wouldnt care either.
---
On the other hand, you are right...thousands would care and complain. Would they stop playing classic? Would they REALLY stop playing classic if a ret pally ended up in the top 10 dps in MC? 
---
The current trend and what a majority guilds do. Is to continue pushing the clear speed, even when it’s farmed content, so there most likely won’t be a spot for specs like Enh. Unless you find a guild that doesn’t do the above, but you’re narrowing it down quite a bit.
---
Well I have to disagree. Sure there are streamer who does nothing but playing the same game 10h a day and that's it but it's not true for all. On the french scene of streaming, streamers tend to do more than just playing all day. For example, Zerator is a french streamer, he created an international tournament on Trackmania, an annual event to gather money for Red Cross, created a video game, etc... I think he has more "life skills" than you'll ever have.
---
Being a fan boy of such a person is embarrassing? So it is to be a fanboy of a football player; a singer, ...
---
the hardest part about mage is having compete with all the other mages on the server. hard to get raid spots. aoe leveling can be fun but realistically barely any will be able to because there are always so many. 
---
The original version was the best and I really wish they brought it back. High ground never tasted better!

Almost more than retail wow subs!

I remember that on my first hunter with track undead on.... I saw all these dots, but they were invisible or something. Had no knowledge whatsoever that there was a huge crypt below me.
---
Pretty sure this was on a normal server. And the framerate is horrendous, lol brings back memories.
---
And the server crashed.
---
/train
---
As I wrote in the similar post in r/wow: It would have been cool if you could choose different subfactions during character creation. Ofc, I don’t want Blizz to add it to Classic now - but I think it should have been an option 15 years ago. 
---
they even get the kek meme, like who says Bur?
---
Obligatory: Ele shamans run out of mana quick so if you’re not clearing bosses in farm in 2 mins or less then Ele spec isn’t viable. 
---
Also: Reeee.
---
Agile in my place of work refers to creating a team based on their specific skills to complete a project, then the team disbands and people go back to their regular boss.  e.g. pulling together a team to work on the implementation of sharding in starter zones; once that's  complete there's no need for those guys to continue working on classic, in a major capacity at least
---
i mean they kinda imprisoned their princess and prophet
---
At least they don't expect you to find 2 people to summon their lazy ass.
---
It's essentially 5/5 tier 2.5 (AQ40) or 4/5 with deep earth shoulders.

Amulet of Vek'nilash or Choker of the Firelord

Cloak of Consumption

Rockfury bracers / the bracers from Broodlord Lashlayer

For gloves I couldn't tell you outside the C'thun ones
---
Ban'thok's sash

Ring of the Fallen god / Ritssyn's Ring of Chaos
---
Neltharion's Tear
---
Talisman of Ephermeal power
---
Totem of Storms
---
Lok'amir or Claw of Chromaggus, Scepter of focus or something from the 0,5 boss in strat living.
---
Most of these pieces are AQ40 loot mind you.
---
You do mention having researched elemental shaman a lot as is, so you most likely know this already but better safe than sorry. know that even with all of the above you'd do roughly half the damage that a warrior, mage, rogue or warlock might in similiar get-up, and that is assuming you bring all the consumables you possibly can, including mana pots and dark runes to try and combat the insane mana spending of the shaman, and you'll be running on fumes in less than 2 minutes.
---
I used to play on one of the unmentionables, and the GM of one of the better horde guilds raided as elemental in farm content. For reference he did about 480 DPS on Magmadar, the warriors were all closing in on 1,500 DPS, and that fight was short enough for mana not to be a factor.
---
I played all races in Vanilla, I like diversity and all of them appealed to me one way or the other.
---
Probably the least played one was Troll, not because I have something against them or hate their lore but it just wasn't my first pick compared to other Horde races.
---
I think I'm one of those weird people that liked gnomes back then, I always played a Gnome when playing Mage.
---
Now if we're to talk about starting zones I hated the Durotar starting zone and it was the starting zone for 2 Horde races.
---
There ain't no gettin' offa this train we on. This train we on don't make no stops.
---
Used it before it was cool xd
---
In raiding it's not remotely viable until AQ due to no way to bypass boss spell resists. ANY class is viable in 5 mans. You just might have a hard time getting invites. There are even people who tank 5 mans on shamans. It's not the best idea, but dungeons are not = to raiding.
---
Also no one is bringing you to Naxx after AQ as elemental so it's never really viable. It's only "viable" in the sense that you can run older content than AQ when you have AQ gear as elemental. Something you will never bother with in AQ plus since you will be respeccing anywyas. 
---
Ele Shaman doesn't get PvP gear worth a darn and has to heal. It's just the way it is.  As to what people CLAIM that makes it viable, they are talking about gear that decreases magical resistance that comes in content post release. 
---
I always thought you could do blood elves, Naga as a faction with Illidan as it's leader. Afterall he lead them to outland in WC3. You could even put the Forsaken in there and argue that Sylvanus was once a bloodelf so would have more affinity to them than to either the alliance or the horde. You could even explain it as they are all after magic for different reasons (blood elfs to live, Naga for power, forsaken to reverse their curse).
---
They could also be an out and out evil faction not tied to 'honor' or 'being the good guys' 
---
Yeah pretty sure that's right, after the Horde landed on Kalimdor.
---
&gt; Because im not sure if its a statement or a question.
---
Thats the weirdest thing I have ever seen anyone write...
---
That's not strictly true, WF buff lasts for 10 seconds so if your lovable totem bot is decent at totem twisting you should have both. And no, you don't twist GoA since that agility will do fuckall for you when you're brushing up the threat cap anyhow, sure tranquil air isn't 30% like salvation, but I'll take the 20.
---
Will the classic servers be able to handle lag better or would the same thing happen in the new release of classic?
---
Imagine 50K classic wow enthusiasts playing on one server. All with a shared love of being back in the game. Gee, not to sound cringey, but that would be such a great experience.
---
Any short race, doesnt matter the game. I have an unreasonable hatred for small races. It didn't used to be so bad, but I just can't stand them now. I think the turning point for me was when I first started playing dnd 5e and was playing a half orc barbarian. Well, this other guy in our group was playing a halfling and during character creation we rolled stats as you usually do. He ended up having higher numbers in every stat and it just drove me crazy. I should be able to punt him across a room, but he was stronger than me at the same level. So not only did it take away my "big bruiser" role as he could somehow do it better, but it also killed my immersion. It's a silly thing to get annoyed about, but that's just how I am. 
---
I will give dwarves a slight pass though as they're built like tree trunks.
---
I completely get it. My half elf rogue has less dexterity than my friends Wizard cause of shit luck with the dice.
---
True. Dwarves in WoW are like those real life 5" 3' men who can and will wreck your shit if provoked.
---
I think the BE situation was way more dire than you're suggesting here. I don't think they could have just chilled in Quel'thalas. Plus I don't think old grudges against orcs and trolls matter that much in their situation. The Third War was a major gamechanger, some kind of reset point.
---
After the third war they are near extinct. It's misrepresented in the game because players can make as many BE as they want, but according to lore there were only very few BE. So the BE desperately needed allies, because hey can't realistically expect to stand a chance without any. There ARE threats to them.
---
The biggest immediate threat would of course be the Forsaken, should the BE choose them as their enemies instead of allies. But also the Scourge remnants in the PL and parts of Quel'thalas are still a great threat given how few BE there are, but one that just so happens to also be targeted of the Forsaken. Already two reasons for the BE to ally with the Forsaken at least. Plus the Forsaken leader is one of their old, fallen heroes. Plus the Forsaken are geographically the most valuable ally. And the Forsaken just so happen to be part of the Horde.
---
As for the Alliance: the BE's most recent encounter with the Alliance (and IIRC their only encounter after the Third War) was Garithos... talk about burning bridges. With that in mind it's surely helpful to not only have the Forsaken but also more major forces in Kalimdor as allies, should the Alliance decide to pull another Garithos. 
---
Giving the Horde paladins and a "pretty" race might have been part of the motivation to add BE to Horde, but it still makes sense from lore perspective. 
---
I think the whole stolen light shenanigans that made the BE able to be paladins makes way less sense than the BE joining the Horde in the first place. 
---
Wow, it was like 47k not even a week ago. Been hovering around that for a while too. 
---
&gt;your fav memories from then
---
Not having reddit so I would have to read these ridiculous threads. 
---
you can explore with your pet in prowl, so its like half a rogue haha
---
The only place it has been 50gph is on private servers with incorrect drop rates. 
---
Blizz could change spell values which would make sub par specs more viable. Wait until more info about classic is out.
---
Can't wait for more upvoted misinformation!
---
/u/esfandtv
---
This is actually very significant, and let me theorize why:
---
At Classic launch, it is expected that *a lot* of people will join in. In fact I's say the majority of players will be those coming in freely from Retail and trying it out for a week or month. So maybe total population will be upwards of 250-300k.
---
But when people get filtered out, and when the recurring playerbase stabilizes, I believe we could have anywhere between 150-200k players always on.
---
Thus, if we accept that the 50k of us here will *definitely be playing Classic forever and ever (you damn better be!)* then a fairly respectable part of the Classic playerbase will be 'from here', so to speak. So it's very possible that we will come across each other frequently if we choose the same realms. And thus, when people post their experiences and stories, more people would be able to relate.
---
Also group/guild finding and RP communities will be much easier to set up because of this.
---
5 more months to go bois!
---
If I have to wait even longer than I do now to loot Felix's toolbox in the dwarf starting area I'll blow my brains out, and I wanna main a dwarf when official classic comes :(
---
Holy paladins can tank onyxia
---
&gt; On the other hand, you are right...thousands would care and complain. Would they stop playing classic? Would they REALLY stop playing classic if a ret pally ended up in the top 10 dps in MC and go back to the private servers and roll a new char once a new 10k-active-player server opens every several months and the entire player base of their server moves to that new server?
---
Yes, we would absolutely not be playing "Classic" wow if they shake up specs and take it away from what it used to be. I can only speak from a personal standpoint obviously but everyone I know who is hyped as all hell for classic wow ( a good 10-15 RL buddies) would bail the second they start messing with class design or anything gameplay related for that sake. 
---
wait, how?
---
You misunderstood me. The main problen is not the bloodelfs not fitting into the horde. Allthough they still don't, just as the forsaken which joined the horde out of necessity The problem is, that there are even enough belfs after the events of tft left to justify putting them as a race into the game.
---
Let's go through it.
---
The belfs were just a fraction of the high elven population. 10% aproximately
---
After that they keep fighting the scourge, start fighting the Alliance, have to flee to outland to be save from the Alliance, have to fight fel orcs and demons and then after all that have to return to Azeroth to fight the Scourge on Northrend. They lose. Arthas slaughteres them. Illidan gets killed (or that was what was supposed to happen) and the few survivors had to flee. 
---
The high elfs with their full force had no chance against the Scourge when they attacked Quel Thalas. How just a fraction of the former High Elves is capable of standing a chance against the Scourge and retake their homeland makes no sense whatsoever from a lore perspective. It was done for gameplay reasons. No more no less. Blizz wanted the Horde to have Paladins and to have a pretty race.
---
Burning Crusade killed WoW lore big time. The blood elves have the most interesting story arch in the warcraft lore, but got shit on by Blizz with BC. The Draenei retcon is even worse.
---
The Bloodelfs should have stayed the way they are in Classic. A few scattered Npcs here and there not a whole playable race.
---
50s/stack. 50s/stack. 50s/stack. 50s/stack. 
---
&gt;They won’t have sharding for 99% of vanilla
---
Boy are you in for a surprise...
---
Well, they have a conection with Sylvannas who was a high elf, who also died in the hands of Arthas, while protecting her people.
---
So it makes sense that they'd join the horde just because of that. Actually IIRC the last quests in Quel'Thalas talks about that and the first place you go after leaving Quel'Thalas is Undercity
---
Not arguing with that. That was Blizz's justification to put them in the game. But that still makes no sense within the lore as i explained in my previous post.
---
They were added as a playable race just because there were people that wanted to play the horde but didn't play hunchback, tusked characters.
---
They shouldn't have done that, but I can understand why they did it like a business decision.
---
A reason not to choose mage is that there will be tons of them fighting over gear and you'll have a hard time getting any. If that doesn't bother you then they're solid in both pvp and pve for the whole game, level fast, and have lots of utility in 5mans. BRD for example is easy mode if you have a good mage for lyceum!
---
No way that happens. You need a lot of healers in 40 man raids. It would break the game. There is a reason TBC has 25 man raids when heal hybrids became viable dps.   
---
Everyone has to respec in raiding past initial tiers and you heal to get elemental or boomkin gear. Don't like it, play another class. There is nothing here to even complain about. The mage raid spec sucks at PVE. They have to respec to. 
---
If you play as an elemental shaman over healing you are simply a selfish player that no guild would ever want anyways. 
---
I don't know how people get this delusional and why people want to break the game. Go play modern WoW and enjoy the ele shaman and all classes being the same. Stop trying to ruin Classic.
---
Exactly. It's a business decision. Not a lore friendly position. But wow lore has been a mess since BC.
---
Once aq drops maces are great for all melee dps, so that's when things get really crazy for mace rogues.
---
male taurens are bulls. its their natural crest and withers. (google some bull images). overall their back and body is straight.
---
&gt;However they aren’t going to shard 99% of vanilla
---
Where are you guys getting this from, they’ve never said they wouldn’t share stuff like this. 
---
Pre 60 you'll never struggle to tank a 5man with a 2h arms spec for example.
---
At 60, a prot warrior will get into guilds easily.
---
Forgets that it's activision at the helm and not pre-2008 Blizzard.
---
Hence why Google Translate can't be trusted to get the direct translated word you want
---
Some of the weapons are AQ40/Naxx level. I don't think you should make it less grindy.
---
MAYBE you can make ranks 11-13 less grindy (the gear is not that awesome), but rank14 should stay the same IMO.
---
What's funny? It's the only future Activision product that has a CHANCE to be good and maybe right the Blizzard side of the company and prove the fans were right all along.
---
Yeah I've seen some of these items, but there are a couple new ones, so thank you. However, what I've seen is that shamans use rank4 lightning bolt in long fights, so mana may not be that much of an issue. I also havent really seen any pre raid gear advices. Can you help me out with that please?
---
I also just seen a video from Pudgy playing enhancement shaman with a one handed axe + caster held in off hand. It sounds crazy, but he was toppin magmadar(although he was rocking 2.5). Do you think enhance could be made viable, even during mc?
---
At the end of the day, all game decisions are business ones, and then the lore team tries their best to fit those in.
---
Retail's allied races are a good example of that.
---
Exactly, yet people don’t even trust blizzard to get it right. It’s insane.
---
Either the game is going to be good or it isn’t, no amount of whining, crying or complaining is going to change it.
---
Well, downranked spells are of some use. Ofc thats lower damage, but more uptime sounds better than no uptime.
---
I want to hardcore raid and I agree so much.
---
Having a guild where you like the people and want to hang out with, is so important. 
---
I was in a raid guild with fights in the chat nearly daily. 
---
It sucked so much. I left the server with some ig friends in tbc, because the drama was so annoying.
---
Yes I agree. But some of those decisions can't be set right by the lore team. BC is a prime example. If you fuck up the lore you fuck up the story telling potential of the game. One of the things WoW has suffered massively from.
---
Oh, it's an old post... I came here thinking it was something new
---
The Immovable Object was quite the shield. 
---
Troll. The drug culture thing never appealed to me, and aesthetically they're lanky hunchbacks.
---
No I don’t 
---
They did that
---
In TBC
---
I don't agree that 25 man raids came about because of the spec changes. I think it has more to do with the logistics of pulling 40 people together for a fight, and the fact I have seen hundreds of guilds fall apart not being able to maintain numbers.
---
I also don't think classic wow is fragile enough that a few QOL changes for hybrid specs would "break" anything. Classic WoW isn't one game where everything was set in stone, it was a collection of patches where things got tweaked constantly, an argument could even be made about the two weeks prior to TBC where we had TBC talents but no TBC was vanilla. Tweaking a few mana % on spells to make hybrids not OOM constantly while trying to dps isn't going to hurt anybody. 
---
Being a Resto Shaman instead and letting a Mage or Warlock doing the raids's magical damage sounds even better.
---
Gnome.
---
Can't stand being a gnome.
---
Tauren Druid?
---

Depends on the population of your server, more the more competition you had the longer it takes.
---
There is some kind of an unlucky coincidence that during the early PvE content when fights are short (BWL/MC phase) and your mana pool would be sufficient the mobs are highly resistant/immune to nature damage and gear is somewhat scarce. 
---
But in AQ40/Naxx stage gear is nice and there are no resists, but fights get much longer and you will go oom. And nobody really wants a DPS which could stay active less than halfway through the fight, or does terrible damage because of excessive downranking.
---
Pay!? But you make it for free? Cheapskate
---
On the subject of Ally lowbie ganking: I'm for it. 
---
Apologies in advance for the 'Teebu's Flaming Longsword' mix up :P

Argh i can't wait. I'm playing some on a private server right now but i can't fully commit to that since i know that character will be gone in 6 months. I want the "final" version of vanilla so i can go all out and fully enjoy it.
---
What a coincidence, retail wow did as well
---
/duel, polymorph.
---
They're laugh is 👌 
---
thank you but i will stick to Polegrinder
---
And then the healers would get the aggro
---
I feel you. I downvoted my own post 
---
But the emotions I felt when they were Varians last words. That shit was powerful.

---
compare that to the other classes and you can see how bad it is. the number 1 shaman is actually a rogue who got glitched to be displayed as a shaman. probably shared the same name as a deleted shaman 
---
Fair enough. I am strongly considering to give it a shot, at least as a trial start. Never used it. 
---
Assume august September as worst case. 7-8 months to go
---
ele is already very powerful in pvp they dont need any buffs
---
Then make it a raid only buff
---
whats a raid only buff?
---
You changed the basis of your arguments here. First it was "BE don't fit because unlike the Forsaken they don't need the Horde as allies", now it's "BE couldn't join the Horde because they couldn't have retaken their homeland". 
---
In the Third War it's not only the HE at full force, it's also the Scourge at full force and being led by Arthas and Kel'Thuzad with clear leadership and strategy. They came to Quel'thalas with a purpose and their whole concentrated power behind them and used actual tactics.
---
After the events of TFT the scourge remnants in the EK (as seen in Vanilla WoW) were far from being at full strength. No real leadership, no strategy. At least none even remotely comparable to Arthas when he lead them in his war campaign. KT is gone from the EK and just returns to the PL, not Quel'thalas. It does make sense that the BE could have taken at least a a part of Quel'thalas from a more or less mindless, leaderless and not strategically acting Scourge. 
---
What does not make sense and can be attributed purely to gameplay reasons, I'll give you that, is the **extent** to which the BE re-established Quel'thalas. They've got most towns and villages back instead of just a few ones, and they're well populated. You don't get the impression it's just about 10% (a little less if you count the BE that were lost to Outland and Northrend) of the former HE. That IS an inevitable result of the BE being a playable faction with decent starting zones.
---
So while you can argue BE shouldn't have become a playable race, it definitely makes more sense for them to ally themselves with the Horde rather than staying completely neutral or even allying with the Alliance. 
---
I cant wait to play classic with all of you😘
---
Well its about time we changed that :p
---
1000 people fighting over the same 15-20 mobs isn’t a community it’s just annoying.
---
There are spells which affect NPCs and players differently. For example, hammer of justice interrupts NPCs alongside the actual stun, but it only stuns players.
---
great idea, I will make one certainly
---
lots of fun when im bored of herb gathering
---
its a buff that can only be gotten or used in raid, kinda like how you can only use AQ mounts inside of AQ
---
I've had a hard on for the Corrupted Ashbringer and Shard of the Fallen Star for 14 years now

If I don't get that far then Skullflame Shield.

always cool
---
Ferals are very needed as tanks on horde side because of threat problems of horde
---
It’s needlessly slow on a class which is already a slow leveller to begin with, you can tank 5 mans just fine as fury.
---
Hi, /u/missing_string
---
&gt; And then blizzard will say, "I told you so."
---
You know Blizzard is interested in making profit from Classic, right? 
---
A lot of people in this sub seem to seriously believe Blizz wants to intentionally fuck up Classic intentionally just to spite Vanilla fans. I wonder how bitter one must be to come to such a delusional conclusion. As if Blizzard is even remotely interested in telling someone "told you so". How does "told you so" translate to profit exactly? It doesn't. 
---
They want the subscriptions of the people they're missing out on currently with only retail WoW available. And how do they get those? By providing Classic. If they fuck it up, people will just unsubscribe again. 
---
Blizzard has absolutely no interest in being able to tell anyone "told you so". 
---
LOL
---
*one of the many
---
At least in this sub :)
---
Yep phasing is within the server. Sharding includes other servers. There's NOOO way they're sharding.  
---
Why exactly would they use sharding beyond what they've told us?
---
Meaning only for the starting zones and only in the very beginning to handle the player onslaught at release. 
---
Ion said in blizzcon that they knew phasing would be antithetical to creating a cohesive classic community
---
Now this is the level of autism I have come to expect from vanilla WoW players.
---
That sounds terrible and would totally ruin the feeling of vanilla. Its an RPG game and not some esports crap.
---
That's a controversial topic. They he way better server technology now. I know because I was in a few 80 v 80 raids in MOP and they rand great.
---
However, they've recently downgraded their servers in BFA hoping sharding would take care of it...
---
That being said, phasing and sharding won't be in 99% of vanilla
---
I named my characters from random sentence. Like "Chuiboirldsl" means "Je suis beau IRL, désolé", which is the french sentence for " I am beautiful in real life, sorry ". Yeah I know I'm fked up
---
And sadly - going by the attitude - a huge part of those people is the kind of player I'd absolutely HATE to come across old Azeroth
---
Yes I agree. I was about to say Mages are still cream of the crop but he's right, they dont enjoy the same lrivelaged position in 1.12+  They are up there sure
---
Mace stun with glavies? Pog  
---
Also Fangs of the Father during cata and Pre nerf Cloak and Dagger during mop were more op than harp.
---
Mage is the best Alt class. If you understand AoE Grinding you can quickly level it to 60, and then use it as a gold farm for an hour or 2 per day. You can then use that money on your main that is interesting to play.
---
Yes, but this is how it becomes barrens chat!
---
I recommend, if it's popular enough bracket, 49 enhancement shaman twink. I did it in vanilla with a Kang the Decapitator and all the best strength and stam gear i could find. I was literally one shotting level 60's sometimes, and in the BG's I was 1v3'ing. It was seriously so OP lol.
---
They'll have phasing in the starting zones, not sharding. Phasing just creates a few instanced zones, but only within the server. Sharding is cross server, and there are non plans to shard vanilla at all. Sharding is primarily used in BFA to fill out low pop servers.
---
I remember it being a niche thing toward the end of Vanilla. It was very strong but quite niche (like do you really want to sacrifice you PvE dps that much) but with 2 servo arms it could be crazy. 
---
Question is what race are you thinking?
---
Yeah, I know, I wouldnt change anything at all.
---
finally! this sounds like a great episode!!
---
It's only ever happened once.  It resulted in the Big Bang.  The only survivor was Chuck Norris.
---
Going to be honest, i have trouble taking Varians redesign seriously. Its the anime hair that gets me.
---
Best option as a druid is to flag carrier ot tank av bosses. You can powershift and get some mad DPS on people. For the most part you won't have high dps, but you can chase an escape very well and heal and be annoying. You will piss a lot of people off
---
Yeah. I'd rather they focus on working than putting together community events and dealing with the inevitable fallout.
---
They did change that, in TBC/Retail
---
Thanks for the link. I have a few questions though. I never played vanilla and played hunter on alliance side, moslty doing pvp during BC+WOLTK.
---
I'm thinking about rolling a shaman to heal people as it's what I did during legion when I started WoW again. I'm just wondering why the DPS rankings seems skewed towards alliance? Is it a server thing (i.e. lightbringer is dominated by alliance?)? I was under the impression from reading this reddit that shamans' totems provided a big damage buff, mostly for rogues &amp; warriors? All things being equal in terms of stuff and rotation, shouldn't a rogue/war have a higher DPS thanks to shaman's buffs than on ally side? Am I missing something?
---
Furthermore, in the same rankings, paladin's seem to be dominating the HPS rankings, alongs with priests, why is that? Is it because paladin's tend to be MT healers and these require lots of heals? Shouldn't a shaman healing a raid have a higher HPS as well?
---
I don't really care about whether I'm top HPS or not, just wondering why paladin's and priests seem to have higher HPS thank drood and shamans?

There's no way it was if you had personally seen it. You'd be disconnecting all the time, which didn't happened. I can't remember *exactly* what caused it, and it did happened to me a few times, but it wasn't any item you hadn't seen.  
---
Youll want all of them, for example the pvp trinket, gnomish net trinket, all the reflectors, tidal charm.. youll be swapping a lot.
---
u/madseasonshow makes the best classic videos imo... I love his story series!
---
Say that to all the people who still get 5 average views after 3 years. 
---
Been playing since vanilla and have played every expansion a little bit. Sticking to original races, I never have played a gnome or dwarf and only played orcs and trolls a little bit. 
---
Gnomes, I just find too silly to be played seriously and feel badass with. They're literally just funny to me lol.
---
Dwarves, I think are cool, but I wish they could just be a *little* taller.
---
Orcs, are mostly okay to me but something about their run animations bothers me.
---
Trolls, as someone else said, the hunch is so much. I just feel goofy playing one. Not threatening looking enough.
---
Found him recently, my new favorite.
---
How strong are hunters in pvp? I'll probably be going for a BM sort of build
---
Hell yeah man, I acutally started seeing his vids because of his relaxing voice. helped me with my anxiety, but I stayed for the in-depth vanilla content
---
I'd always try to include either a shaman or a warlock in any 5-man group I'm putting together, for the sole reason of wipe protection. soulstone and reincarnation are powerful tools.
---
Gnome and Tauren. Never played either. I guess I don't like the aesthetic look of the extremes.
---
He always talks about people saying he's monotone and lifeless, but that's half the best part of his videos! He has a calm voice, easy as hell to listen to, and his content is packed full of good and/or interesting content. I am rewatching his WoW Memories series... Helps me not feel like a total moron when I remember my first year or two playing lol
---
I think NE has the absolute coolest bow animation lol. Dunno about gun. 
---
The 2h animations do suck though, but I think they have the best dagger animations too. Front flip 180 stab is so awesome!
---
Don't use the C word!
---
I know the SM chests were heavily nerfed or some removed because of that. Not sure about world chests but you're probably right. 
---
Aggro shouldnt really be a problem  since you should have a big lead that should be enough even if you get into cat for 10sec (if its not use pummeler)
---
Mitigation tho... you would have to be healed really hard and hope you dont get crit. 
---
I am not sure and will decide on the looks of the character. Race bonus is not so important for me, I am a bit but not that hardcore.
---
Hello madseason lol
---
The tradeoff is that the hardcore guilds are the most antsy to complete it so everyone can profit from then in a way (and use the time to catch up ever so)
---
If you kill a lowbie unprovoked you're a dishonorable dog and this is coming from someone who used to main a horde sub rogue. If they're within level range all's fair. If they're attacking someone of your faction it is permissible to intervene and save your hapless compatriot. It's also permissible to stand by and watch them get punked on if it's a fair fight, your call. 
---
First thing that comes to mind is the mainhand sword, Dal'Rend's Sacred Charge from Rend Blackhand in UBRS. I already had the offhand and realllllllly wanted the set bonus. 
---
I remember when it dropped I rolled a 1 on it and was one devastated 15 year old. My character was literally jumping up and down out of frustration that I wasn't going to get the sword after so many attempts. I was competing with someone for the sword who won the roll, but they noticed I already had the offhand and let me have it to complete the set.
---
I felt so happy and grateful after that, and it was a huge dps boost for me which allowed me to finally put some numbers up on the dps meters in MC :D
---
Quick reference point for those videos, you need to be looking at his gear in comparison to the other people around him. In that theorycraft video he's wearing full 2.5 while the other players around him are keeping up in very inferior gear. Also the damage meter he uses across multiple videos seems to be off, either the server they're playing on has weird damage scaling or the meter itself is showing incorrect numbers.
---
Yea that makes sense. Do you have any idea what the class demographics might be like? Trying to decide what to play. Or did you just start putting this out there. Are you currently on a private server? 
---
5 out of the top 30 warriors are alliance. you must be looking at it weird or something. also paladins have an incredible 1.5 cast heal that is not only very effecient its perfect for "snipe" healing. basicly as a druid you have long casted heals so a lot of the time whatever your healing may already be topped off. so basicly its a lot harder to get a good heal off on someone with such a slow cast. this is especially the case when your in a raid with a lot of good healers and it can be very difficult. you can reduce this problem by going regrowth spec and using the 50% crit talent and natures grace to get consistent 1.5 cast regrowths off. still, the scaling is very poor on direct heal regrowth and to top it off, much more mana inefficient. now druids can still do really good if they are the only druid in the raid, as hots dont stack.
---
as for priest and shaman i dont really know. i know priest flash heal which is 1.5 seconds. its not as mana efficient but with mana pots and demonic runes it shouldnt be a problem. if i were to guess about shaman its that as a raid gets better the less effective chain heal will be. ive been brought along for some really good raids and it feels like a joke where the only reason your healing is for the chance not to be at the bottom of the meters, and it feels like no one is taking any sort of damage
---
Portal, plix &lt;3
---
I really don't get that comment (about his delivery). I seriously can't stand YouTubers that try too hard to sound LOUD, ATTRACTIVE and CHARISMATIC.

[The train gains more and more momentum!](https://i.redd.it/z9t8jub0jjn01.jpg)
---
There is always room for 1 enhance shaman with Nightfall axe, they keep the shadow damage proc up best.
---
Maybe you'll disagree but I feel like rogues dont have many quality of life issues in 1.12. It might actually be a benefit to be able to buy your important pre-bis pieces rather than compete. The little buffs they get help their leveling too. Rogues can solo many quest elites, warriors can't. 
---
Warriors still have quality of life issues and require acquiring the most gear of any class to stay competitive. They do get invited more often as a trade off but still. 
---
Of course this neglects PvP
---
Madseason inspired this. Live his videos. 
---
I'm the opposite. I never roll anything but night elves if I can help it and trippy northern kalimdor forests are my leveling zones of choice. Any state they're in. I'll even take bloodmyst isle. 
---
Just resign yourself to it. It's the only way to go.
---
Time is money friend
---
...even though I mostly spend it afk in IF tabbed out watching some video or a stream.
---
Font choice 10/10 would squint and not be able to read anything again.
---
I would grab herbalism , honestly I don't think any decent gear actually came out of crafting in vanilla from what I remember. Arcanite reaper maybe very early on but once you have access to MC I don't think anything you can craft was better than raid gear. 
---
Oh onyxia scale cloak i guess for nefarian shadow breath, untill it was discovered you could hide behind the throne lol. 
---
That's just the male nightelves. They're pretty useless. The ladies have perfect form. 
---
Depends on if you raid or not. I used Talisman of Ephemeral Power is a great MC drop, Neltharions Tear from BWL as a warlockin vanilla. If you're not raiding,  engineering trinkets are fun and useful in pvp.
---
Don't be elitist.
---
Because not everyone is supposed to achieve rank 14.  Just like Scarab Lord, it's designed to be extremely rare and mean something when you see a player walking around as a High Warlord/Grand Marshall.
---
You could always try shaman. Tauren shaman make great healers and are quite sought after due to totem buffs and things like reincarnation for wipe protection. Druid's a great choice too.
---
YES NEW EPISODE!!! Thanks for the wonderful 2018, Josh.
---
Yeah looks like I didn't look at the right graph for DPS meters, indeed horde warriors seem to dominate the rankings!
---
I'm still hesitating regarding which healer I'll roll though. Heavily leaning towards shaman but somehow tempted to play priest as well... The HPS graphs increased my hesitation, although my understanding is that shamans will always be required, I don't want to only be in the raid for my totems...
---
Doesn't Illidan have the same/similar hair? Blizzard really likes that dorky hairstyle.
---
Shit i remember the HARP days, it was OP but really fun. Just pop a million CDs in 1min every arena fight, either you win or you don't.
---
- Find some of those people and run outside of your zone to camp higher level mobs.
---
Vanilla dungeons didn't have a lock out, only raids did. They've added lockouts to 5 mans with TBC heroics.
---
&gt;  I'm wondering if a few could complete a dungeon, then regroup with the ones who haven't &amp; do it again. Do you just need the person who hasn't run it invite?
---
As others have mentioned you can just reset the dungeons. But dungeons took a long time, not 15 minutes. The 45 min Strat UD run was a real achievement that requires some preparation and if you just zone in with people that were still gearing up it could easily take multiple hours.
---
Which boots are those? I was expecting the pink ones from BWL.
---
Because people are morons. I have no better way of putting it. Like Blizzard knows we do not want sharding, but it is most likely a necessary evil at launch. Blizzard wants Classic to be successfull, so they won't "sneak" sharding into the game because they know if they do it breaks the game completely and people will quit. I've never understood how people can't understand this.
---
Because 99,9% of people in this sub have no idea how their architecture might work on an even theoretical basis, let alone knows how the hell cloud VM's and shit work.
---
Not to mention retail is pretty much a single player game, it's not weird that they have down prioritized things such as world raids.
---
Judgement T2
---
Tailoring as a good synergy with enchanting since you don't need gathering prof to level them but you won't benefit much from tailoring.
---
A good choice would be to take a gathering prof : herb or mining for money  as enchanting is very costy to lvl.
---
A better choice would be to lvl up a crafting prof like leatherworking with skinning and once you're 300 LW drop skinning and pick enchanting so you can craft item like Hide of the Wild (BiS for a longtime for every healer) and make good money without having to farm for hours
---
i would go shaman just because being able to go elemental for pvp is really fun. 
---
So... Who won?

Watching all of the Shaman running in ghost wolf to go fight the Alliance put a smile on my face.
---
It's a retardin who ninjad all that warrior loot? Shudder 
---
Just a joke :)
---
Except for the PvP trinket that you buy for rank 3+, the only real PvP trinkets are from engineering (there are also few others like tidal charm, but usually hard to get). After you manage to get some powerful trinket like Neltharions Tear, you will be swapping the engi trinkets on cooldown and keeping a generic PvE trinket between that, something like Eye of the Beast or Reed. 
---
The trinkets are not what makes or breaks your PvP gear.
---
No guild in their right mind would give a shaman half of this gear lol.
---
I like to combine words, especially from different languages. My latest retail character is Gloryond. Glory + Ond (evil). 
---
There are two different "pushing it to the limits".
---
The first is the casual, I got world buffs.
---
The second is the hardcore, MC buffed, nature resist rotation, 24/7 PI'd, Atiesh+BiS. Max buff capped.
---
You can get really high numbers with the hardcore route (personally: 1760 dps), it just depends on how much time/money you invest in it.
---
&gt;If you want to do dps or tank, just dont pick a healer class.
---
It is your __assumption__ that druid is a healer class, hence the confusion.
---
Whether or not I kill a lowbie is entirely by their class, name and attitude.
---
If their name is something retarded and I can sense their personality through it, I’ll kill them.
---
If they /wave me I’ll leave them alone but if they /spit they die.
---
Don't worry. There are gonna be way more people to play Classic than this subreddit number of subs.
---
Yeah!
---
At that level it takes persistence and skill to gather that loot! Thank you very much! :P
---
Or play a lock or hunter...
---
*"Here little pet o'mine, you go hit that bear over there, I'll stay over here"* 
---
I think it depends on how dedicated you want to be. If you only want to play few hours a day (or few hours a week), feral druid is perfectly fine and will find spots in casual/semi-hc guilds. If you want to be serious about you character though, I would advise against it, because I know from experience that the top guilds will not be looking for a feral at any point in vanilla.
---
For PvP, feral can be alright. Especially in WSG, you will be highly sought after. Further for TBC, feral is awesome for both PvP and PvE.
---
The thing is, most of my friends will roll DPS so it's always good to have a healer and I quite enjoyed healing in PvP during legion, although I imagine that things will be completely different at lvl 60. 
---
Druid are great MT/OF, but you need to be Alliance + a good guild and have Crystal of Zin-Malor among other things.
---
Not true at all. Enhancement Shamans are known to be poor Nightfall swingers. Most guilds use a off-tank which isn’t needed for that specific encounter, to proc it with hamstring. That way you don’t ‘waste’ a spot on having one designated DPS spot used for Nightfall.
---
There is a difference between being unfriendly and attack on sight.
---
I agree, but that's not the point made, I made a list of the gear an elemental shaman would need to "come online" i excluded Naxxramas since it'd be the end game of the end game.
---
&gt; an exclusive class 
---
And cities. And dungeons. And zones. And whole questlines. And skills. And mounts. 
---
There the jack of all trades: Dps, CC, tank, AoE and can give out water.
---
&gt; Pretty sure this was on a normal server. And the framerate is horrendous, lol brings back memories.
---
This was on a Roleplay server. Scarlet Crusade, to be exact. After this happened they did a 15v15 (I think it was 15.. Might've been 10!) Warrior only brawl in the karazhan crypts. they chose a lower number because they didn't want it to crash again.
---
I want to nominate the font used in this video to replace Comic Sans as the worst font ever made.
---
Yup, that's how it is during the AV weekend. If the initial one or two pushes to the boss fail then the bulk of the group will afk out leaving a "limbo game" that could go on for several hours. These are the games that turn into a more "traditional" AV with people fighting in the middle and trying to capture towers for hours on end.
---
I used to lead a rather successful guild on one of the unmentionable servers, horde side.
---
Granted I played a DPS warrior so I may have certain personal interest as well, but my general rule was you could absolutely never have too many resto shamans. Hell even if you had 6 or 7 of them that's still not too much, totems are that good and chain heal being the only smart heal in the game with 40 raiders is absolutely awesome.
---
Enough priests to cover your main tanks, a druid or two because they're cute I suppose but really you wouldn't be wrong with 2-3 priests and the rest shaman, having a feral OT to fill GoTW.
---
On top of that shaman has 3 very solid PvP specs.
---
Having PC powerfull enough to handle 80 characters and all the spell animations at once was a feat, let alone recording it. 
---
Most likely author used separate pc just to capture this video, especially since it's quite good quality for that period of time.
---
Let's be clear.  You don't have a release date for a product if you don't know the details.  This is nothing more than the delaying of bad news which has been concrete for some time.  If they told everyone right now that sharding was guaranteed, that MC wouldn't be balanced for 1.12 talents, that a lot of other legitimate issues weren't going to be included, hype would die.  Hype dies and sales die.
---
Hop off the hype train, be rational, wait for the beta.  The beta is where we learn if Classic is worth the investment, or if Blizzard fucked it up.  If they don't release a beta, well, that is very telling that the product will not be what we hope.
---
I'm sorry to tell you, but if you're playing on a PVP server, nothing is sacred. Stop being a snowflake and role on a PVE server if you're afraid of some good old PVP.
---
I could hit you up with a pre-raid later this evening I suppose, bear in mind the extent of my shaman knowledge is leveling one up to 60 to duo DM:E runs on my warrior main, so my shaman playstyle involved str of earth, WF totem, lesser healing wave and a shitton of alt tabbing.
---
Regarding the 1 hand build you're talking about it sounds like he's trying to capitalize on flametongue/frostbrand SP scaling. I don't see how it'd work though since you're limited to auto attacks and shocks for damage.
---
 I might've made a case for it if shaman could dual-wield and use swords, using fiery retributer and thunderfury and full SP gear, unfortunately that isn't the case and I don't see how you'd be able to do respectable numbers with the above mentioned spec.
---
Classic outfit. 
---
Madseasonshow, the greatest monotone youtuber.
---
Thank you for your input! On the PvP side, would you mind telling me which advantages and disadvantages shamans have over priests (healing wise)?
---
Do you think the rotations will stay the same when re-launch comes?
---
Boots are wrong and he should be using BRE, especially as a human.   Can't tell what chest he has on but it looks like mail... DM tribute crit chest?  The gladiator chest doesn't have sleeves iirc. 
---
For an organized guild though I don’t believe this is even remotely close to optimal. Like, not even close.
---
You impose a meta where tanks and healers need mage or hunter alts to farm gold to stay competitive. You encourage segregation, where people who don’t need anything will loan their gold to their friends to ensure they get their item to screw over someone they don’t like or because they’re selfish. You have absolutely no control where loot goes at all. You can have some total random who is a friend of some guildies join, with a truck load of gold, first raid win a staff of the shadow flame. Think about how you would feel, as someone who put in your time and effort building rapport with the guild, raiding every week, being prepared, spending the hours wiping, only to see that happen. 
---
Your original post about people getting mad because they didn’t get loot one week and spent time raiding and farming consumables is an antithetical mindset to what vanilla raiding is all about. If you get into a worthwhile guild, the raiding itself, the time you get to spend playing with friends, and the fun of downing bosses is the reward itself. People with the mindset you posted are people I want no where near a guild I am in and I’m sure a lot of people agree. You completely remove any control from leadership for loot distribution and you remove any seniority or reward raiders earn for actually raiding and playing well,
---
While a gdkp system is fine for pugs, and probably the best system available to use there, I agree. For an organized guild I think it’s an abysmal system.
---
Most guilds will be bad.  But, it will be hard to distinguish them because 1.12 makes everything so fucking easy.  Just find people you like playing with, as being an elitist for Vanilla content just shows that you missed the boat the first time.
---
I think all of us left party and then rejoined. If no respawn, we would try to log off and invite again. would always work in the end.
---
The best Vanilla PvP players are constantly rotating between a variety of trinkets. Engineering provides you with a ton of trinkets that are amazing in PvP, reflectors and stuff like that.
---
Also you should know that the basic Warlock PvP trinket (Insignia of the Horde/Alliance) does not remove stuns, so Rogues will bend you over until you have a decent health pool no matter what faction you play.

&gt;lemme just 1 shot this level 20  
---
&gt;PLAYER VERSUS PLAYER BABY IM SO GOOD  
---
It has nothing to do with being good. It's about players playing a video game and immersing themselves enough to know there is a war between the Horde and Alliance. It's part of building the "hatred" between the factions, so that when this level 20 guy hits 60 and is decked out in gear, he's going to go ham on the opponent faction, just like he was taken down as a mere level 20 guy.
---
Is rather memes than the same convo:
---
What race are you rolling and why?
---
Sharding will hurt  the game. 
---
Pre-bis list? 
---
And my personal fav
---
Classic will not fail, because it’s fun it’s not rose tinted glasses 
---
Herbalism and skinning/alchemy
---
&gt; Making a money alt isn't worth it.
---
assuming:
---
- 150 hours to level an alt to a spot that they can start gold farming.
---
- "low" estimate of 25 gold an hour farming on main
---
Leveling that alt will 'cost' you 3,750 gold.
---
Warriors also use devilsaur.  They can buy even better epic BOE's though like edgemaster's. Warriors can also solo elites. Retaliation is a long cooldown though, so you better get it right lol . :) Imp hamstring is also really nice. Warriors are tougher to level though definitely. Gearing pre raid is waaaaaaaay easier on a warrior. You just tank and invite only ranged. It's one reason gearing a rogue is so hard now. Warriors have a lot of the same loot table for pre raid bis for Fury because they dual wield and need the hit. They wear a lot of leather.
---
No true. two points on this.
---
1) TBC had all of the raid content up through Illidan from the get-go, it just took the community a while to progress through it all.
---
2) You're not considering people who are not on the cutting edge from day 1.  You neglect that there are people hitting max level in 2nd, 3rd, and 4th raid tiers of expansions.  In today's model, they skip right up to the current raid, robbing them of any form of actual progression.  It used to be useful to gear up with previous raids.
---
A rule was pronounced long ago which still holds strong today - if it’s read it’s dead.
---
Summary judgment in my favor pls.
---
Doesn't matter for your race much. Bis would be tidal charm and the engi reflectors.
---
Then you want to get one of the on use trinkets. For PvP it's good to have toep or zhc. Obviously tear is a good item, but not as good as the on demand burst is for PvP.
---
You generally are swapping around trinkets a lot. But tidal charm is 100% worth farming/camping. Warlocks with a 3s stun and coil are really hard to kill 1v1.
---
I didn't see the videos of people bugging the demo to explore the world. Do you have a link please?

Looking for a guild. {EU} preferably UK time
---
Any faction
---
Never played classic, started late tbc and hit 50 when wotlk came out. Spent most my time doing pvp till icc then ventured into raiding throughout rest of worlk and cata. Quit during mop and wod and started again around mid legion and mainly been alt hopping and twinking.
---
Still deciding on class, warlock seems most likely right now. Will be taking herby and alchemy if i do.
---
Don't plan to do anything hardcore, just want play and enjoy myself with some nice people. If i can raid then awesome but i work shifts so getting on for a raid may not be possible most of the time. I plan to try a bit of everything though, my main goal for now is to get to level 60, obtain a full dungeon set and max out proffs, from there im not sure :)
---
Hoping to find a nice guild and make some friends.
---
See you all in classic :)
---
This. I leveled a mix of prot/arms, but did so with the aim at tanking, with the same mentality.

My credentials: Played vanilla hardcore through most of college. Cleared all raid content up to 4 horsemen in Naxx. Would casually pvp in groups, but it wasnt my main thing. Was a troll hunter and will probably roll troll hunter or mage. I plan on raiding but dont expect to be available for every single run.

I loved throwing a distract down into a mounted folks and confusing them. One time I got a few members of a MC raid to fall off the walkway into some lava. Of course 4 or 5 flares sprang out afterwards and I was butchered but it was worth it.

Haha. That's awesome. Rogues are the best.

I highly doubt the servers could handle 3.6 million characters if 40v40 made it crash

---
You're probably right.  My experience with playing priest vs shaman in 5mans is that with Shaman you have totems to drop so you have to keep a much closer eye on your mana.  
---
The AV grind was nothing short of exhausting.
---
I believe they can do it by mid June. At this point it's all a guess so I'd rather be optimistic. Doesn't hurt :c
---
Also for late 2019 especially September I am also expecting Cyberpunk 2077, which is another speculation but I love to speculate.
---
2019 is gon b gud. I'm trying to get as many things in terms of my personal life done right now so I can have those months completely spent in the virtual worlds.
---
*Because why the fuck not?*
---
If you have an AV pre-made (guild) to back you up, consider getting https://classicdb.ch/?item=20688

No tebus flame sword.
---
This is one of those things that really grinds my gears. I know the horde had some non horde affiliated "factions" that were neutral to them....but I just FELT (that word is important, because I could totally be wrong on this) that the Alliance had more of them in the world. 
---
I'm good without the zeppelin. If young players wish to level in a different zone, then the death run just makes it that much more rewarding.
---
I remember when I first started playing with a friend, I ran all the way from Death Knell to Mulgore to bring him back with me. Felt like hours and I didn't know the zones were called zones so I called them "States" because they were so massive.
---
The next day I work, I told an older lady about how I had to travel across several states to pickup a friend. She replied: "That's a long drive!" and I was like: "No, in a video game. It's crazy!"
---
And the first time I saw the walls of Orgrimmar, it for some reason reminded me of that scene from The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy where they are in that big city in the waiting room somewhere half-way through the film.
---
When you're first putting together you're tanking gear there is a strong preference for +Defense gear. As you need to reach a certain amount of Defense Skill to be uncrittable by bosses.
---
This means the Draconian Deflector is probably the better choice. I think Immovable Object likely wouldn't be better until you got your Defense Skill up enough with other gear.
---
I mean sure, those trinkets are awesome, but youll be using the ones i listed anyways, as well.
---
My rough plan is to level mage first and park it in DM when it's high enough to farm lashers. Farm DM until I'm instance locked and then switch and level my warrior alt while I wait for the lockout to be over. Rinse and repeat.
---
And what I said applies to both? World of WARcraft. It is not unusual for allied races to attack those who their allies are at war with. See: history. 
---

---

---
Yep, I am studying and getting lots of work done before I get a new job and live with the gf. Then we duo level together.  
---
As for release date, I hope it's more polished and done right rather than early release
---
Alright, I am losing my mind. Here is my thought process:
---
1) Dwarf Hunter - I love dwarves, I love their racials, I love the dwarf + hunter combo. However, I leveled one 1-60 3-4 months ago on a pserver and it was BORING: send pet, AA, serpent sting, AA, and so on... I love the fact that they have so much CC and utility. I love the fact that they are useful in group PvP and big team fights. However, I HATE kiting, alright? I am bad at it.  I can not develop the feeling for distance and map awareness in this game to save my fricking life.
---
Pros:
---
\- Shit load of utility
---
\- Lots of FUN CC
---
\- I love dwarves
---
Cons:
---
\- Leveling is boring
---
\- Pets are annoying to micromanage
---
\- I suck at kiting and hate kiting in this game
---
\- BiS is an X-Bow (I hate X-Bows, gimme dat sweet bow)
---
\- I HATE farming mara and generally dungeons
---
2) Gnome Rogue - I love gnomes, I love their racial in combination with being a rogue. I love the PvP set that they can get. However, rogues are overplayed, they are shit in group PvP and in huge teamfights. Hemo in PvP is boring as fuck, predictable and scripted. I love the idea of having 3-4 bars of spells where the last 2 bars are just full of Your sneaky, engy gadgets and trinkets. Have not tried daggers out yet. I hate the fact that You are soooooo cooldown dependant.
---
\- Class fantasy is really cool
---
\- Reminds me a lot of Shaco
---
\- I like the idea of farming dungeons with pickpocket.
---
\- 1 bar of spells + 2 bars of crazy engy gadgets and trinkets and whatnot
---
\- Can always stand Your ground
---
\- Looks cool, PvP army on ally side is sexy for rogues/druids
---
\- Cooldown dependant. Only class with strong, but huge cooldowns. No blind and no vanish makes You feel weak af.
---
\- Hemo PvP swords is boring, predictable, scripted
---
\- Overpopulated class
---
\- You suck in group PvP and huge teamfights (e.g. raiding Orgrimmar)
---
3) Troll Shaman - I love the combo of troll and shaman, specifically elemental. I see no problem with healing in raids. I love the fact that You are an offensive support who can 100-0 somebody in a matter of seconds. Chain lightning crits are so satisfying. However, I have no fucking idea how to bind all those fucking totems, I am bad at kiting. In group PvP and teamfights You can make a huge impact either healing or toteming or lightning them all out of their asses. Raptors are the coolest mounts in the game. I have no idea how I would bind all those fucking gadgets and trinkets with all the fucking totems etc... 
---
\- Reminds me a lot of Gragas
---
\- Great in teamfights and group PvP
---
\- Raptors are best mounts
---
\- You can stand Your ground against any class in 1v1. No hard counters.
---
\- I have never been a succesful hard carry player. The combo of carrying and supporting at the same it fits me.
---
\- Ugly PvP set
---
\- Have no idea how I would bind EVERYTHING
---
\- Girlfriend will be shaman as well, but Orc. Orc female + male troll Shaman lvling duo? How would that work?
---
\- How do I farm on this class? The only class I really like the farming with are rogues (pickpocket) and druid (travel form + profs)
---
\- Not a lot of talent builds...
---
4) Tauren Druid - I hate Tauren, they are so sluggish... Ugly cat form. Druid is a shit class, however it reminds me a lot of Nidalee :&gt;. I am BAD at kiting. I am definitely better at war of attrition classes than no self heal classes. I LOVE shifting!! Ugly PvP set though... Resto is shitty at teamfights (slow heals) and group PvP (only FC, which is not that fun, tbh and guarding AB Flags. I like to troll people, though...) I like the idea of travel form + professions. You can always run away.
---
\- Reminds me of Nidalee
---
\- You can always run away
---
\- Travel form + professions
---
\- Would be an easy ride 1-60 with my Girlfriend as shaman. You know, dungeons and the like.
---
\- Resonates with my own identityless identity
---
\- Lots of talent builds
---
\- I hate taurents, I hate nelves as well.
---
\- Shit at group PvP and teamfights, except for FCing, which seems boring to just run around and defending AB Flags (that is ok)
---
\- I am BAD at kiting!
---
\- High skill cap, but I have grown old...
---
Well Blizzard wiped all of my characters from my account so I can't post on the official Classic forums now. So here I am!

Feralas always reminds me of the monkey/rainforest exhibit in Brookfield Zoo near Chicago. The way the path is above the main area to guide the visitor through so you can look down at the environment is very much like the zoo - of which I have very strong memories of from when I was a kid.
---
But can you even afford half of that, especially as a warrior (Lionheart, Titanic, Edgemaster, Devilsaur, Epic Mount). I guess I just don't know how things have changed. 
---
Human and especially the male model. I can't stand it's look.
---
holy hell, can't unsee
---
Same for the most part for me. I always joke that I play an ape in real life so I don't want to play one in games.
---
I can't agree more, I just couldn't roll a Gnome. I can see them as Mage, Warlock, Rogue, but they are an affront to Warriors everywhere.
---
For Horde, I just can't roll Troll. I actually like their lore and accent. But I don't like their animations, feet, and their racials suck.
---
LOL, the racials are pretty good. I can't lie and say racials aren't a huge deciding factor for me.
---
Trolls and Gnomes
---
Trolls aren't my thing, as their aesthetic isn't as good as orcs for me.
---
Honestly, the laughing of Gnomes cause me to not play them.
---
As a side note, as much as I love Undead, I can't deal with the arm and leg bones ruining my armor. Floating cuffs from an awesome robe just *irks* me.
---

&gt;It has nothing to do with being good  
---
yea cause people that do that stuff aren't

---
There is nothing immersive about someone dying in 1 hit. 
---
These bosses probably won't be in the game until AQ release or slightly earlier depending on how Blizzard handles progressive content releases.
---
I'd like to take this moment to recognize my role as subreddit mascot. Without me, well, you wouldn't have a mascot.
---
I'm hyped to have 50,000+ other people to be hyped with for the impending Classic WoW launch... and I suspect we're only a minority of the total playerbase that'll flock to Classic at launch. I don't really know what Blizzard's expectations are, but I'm guessing they're going to be incredibly surprised as to how many of us login on day one, and stick around through Naxx.
---
Who cares, game is dead
---
What is powershift?
---
Female trolls' running animation strikes me as so goofy. I could never play one.
---
There's way less immersive things about letting someone you're at war with live when you have the chance to kill him, because "He's weaker than me".
---
Looking forward to it :D
---
Tell that to all the people in real life that bled to death on the battlefield just because they took a sword thrust through their gut.

It was already changed.

You shift back and forth into catform with the furor talent in resto tree. You combine this with the wolfshead helm from maraudon and you get 60 energy Everytime you shift to catform. If you time the energy spikes correctly you get 80 energy Everytime you shift. So basically all you have to do is shift, shred shred, shift shred shred, shift shred fbite. That's to say there's no crits or omen of clarity. People act like it's really hard but it's not too bad when you practice it

---
Tfw you want to be a plate DPS boi but everybody else wants to to be one too
---
I would much prefer this as well.
---
I'm tempted on picking EU AD as well since I made a human pally during MOP and played him up to Legion. A very nice and lively realm.
---
However I think I'll have to roll on a RP-PVP server for that sweet sweet world pvp (and endless corpse running/ganking). It's just how it was, so we gotta preserve that.
---
Chugga chugga chugga chugga CHOO CHOO! CHOO CHO!
---
Yeah I've seen people take both when leveling (between parry/heroic strike cost), I'm not sure which one I like more tbh. But once you're deep in the PvP at max it's a lot less often you get to use heroic strike.
---
I'm actually not sure about heroic strike for Arms PvP though, I've only played DW and 2H Fury as PvE DPS.

DM at release is going to change a lot. It all depends on the guild you are in. The GOOD guilds are going to try to take advantage of how nerfed 1.12 Classic is compared to real Vanilla tier 1 and 2 and run with half raids to try to gear faster, and yeah they go hard with gold farming. Everyone else is going to streamroll this with 40 until AQ. Think WOTLK Naxx if you ever did it. Remember how we pugged it, it was so easy? Same thing here. Kungen's guild did 25 man Naxx with like 10 people in WOTLK and this will be just as easy.
---
All that changes in AQ. I would say as a warrior, if not trying to be in cutting edge progression just focus on getting the Dal'rends and as much hit pieces as you can. They are good for quite awhile with enchants. If you get ironfoe? Great. It not, don't sweat it. You are still gonna dumpster people on DPS. The only ones close will be rogues, which have a much harder time gearing as the smart warriors aren't inviting them to dungeons.
---
AQ is where dps warrior gear gets awesome anyways outside weapons and some odd pieces. Not worth going super hardcore until then imo anyway unless you plan to sell runs, gear and make tons of money.
---
I'm so happy that you're using the Egyptian Pantheon &lt;3 It needs more love. Especially the obscure characters, like the Ogdoad of the Old Kingdom. I also enjoy using names of obscure deities for my characters sometimes. I once made a Frost Mage called Orithyia, who was a Greek princess who became a Goddess, and was titled as the Mother of Snow....so I felt that it was a cool name\~  
---
Other times I just roll with a super minor but cool sounding character from one of my favorite books, like a child's name or a shopkeeper's name who probably no one remembers cause they barely had any 'screen time' in the story.
---
That brings back memories 
---
No, they will add BfA cooldowns for you to use
---
Gnome, Orc, troll.
---
Me too.
---
I hope we have lots of lowbies to gank on both factions
---
Yeah I don't think I'm ever going to get upset with the player who decides to kill me while I'm leveling in STV. Sure, it sucks to get camped by a 60, but *shrug* it happens. People can play how they want to.
---
I hope I can outlevel and gank you &lt;3

---
So your argument is invalid. Good players also do that. Specially to see someone like you QQ on forums/reddit.
---
Truth. The only heal hybrid dps that can compete at all is feral druid in early tiers and that is more due to a gimmick with a level 40 blue headpiece they probably never intended lol.
---
Anyone thinking they are going to enter a raid and compete as dps on the hybrid spellcasters or enhance/ret is delusional. **Elemental is probably the single worst as raid dps while also bringing nothing that resto can.** You can raid as anything if you know people or run the guild. No one is bringing Esfand because of the dps though. They are bringing him cus he's gonna be the guild leader/officer and is social. They KNOW they are carrying him. With enhance/ret it's ok. With Elemental or Boomkin people are just going to think you are an ahole, because the gear is the same as ele. You are making it harder on everyone for no reason.

---
Just remember:
---
Not every class have it all. Picking 1 means leaving some strenghts behind. You need other players to complement your character. The same thing comes when picking talents. You can't have it all. Just make the most of what you have at every time. Making most of every ability and focusing on what you have instead of what you lack. Everyone lacks something (damage - burst or sustain, HP, stun, root, etc).
---
Me - I try to pick class from an RP point of view. What is the class fantasy I want to live?
---
Also I think this fits into everyones lives aswell. Picking 1 option in life excludes a lot of other paths. The most important thing is just picking one you think u'll like and stick with it :)
---
&gt; a feral, a boomkin and of course a ret

Its really not a big deal. You can clear all raids with several empty slots so 3 meme specs is nothing in a 40man raid...

Ganking and getting ganked is part of the game. If you don't want to get ganked, you shouldn't be on a PVP server. If you get ganked on a PVE server, why the hell was your PVP enabled? 
---
Yes you're right, that's my bad I meant to say the male's animations specifically annoy me

---
Make about as many Strat Live farming friends as possible and always have a group rolling with round robin righteous orbs.  
---
If you and the tank roll together often, you can give him first orb, you second orb, and the rest to the dps. That's also fairly common.  
---
Fair points, I do agree. I feel that there's a fairly empowering feeling of being much stronger/higher level than a nearby enemy player and  going past him, having him on target but not attacking. It just puts you in that complete position of power that whatever happens, you can wreck him. So that's enough to suit the alpha thirst. 
---
In the very rare occasion that he's a rogue 15 levels lower than you and still manages to stunlock and melt your face. Then it's GG hats off to you sir.
---
I'd only really provoke another player if we are more or less similar levels and I really need to kill that mob he's fighting or the chest he's about to plunder. OR if I see 2-3 players in my vicinity I might try to preemptively start killing them one by one before they gang up on me. Which is also fair play I think.
---
that music is unbearable
---
That's one reason I dislike DPS meter fanatics. There is an additional DPS bonus to the melee group with improved Windfury and Strength of Earth totems that doesn't appear on the meter and has to be calculated more carefully. They might not out DPS a warrior on the meter in a direct comparison, but the overall DPS increase of the group is greater than adding a hunter or warrior spamming hamstring or wing clip. 
---
If you believe, you can achieve!
---
440 defense is needed against raid bosses because some of their crushing blows/crits can kill tanks in one hit. Especially if your gear is lacking stamina. For everything else it doesn't matter so much. Level 62 and lower raid trash and dungeon mobs are nowhere close to killing you in a single hit. Getting capped is really just a way to stop sweaty palms on big pulls.
---
To take a serious attempt to answer your question though. The 440 number comes from each mob having a base percent to crit, ~5% iirc? Plus the extra crit chance that comes from being 3 levels higher, or having 15 more "weapon" skill. This would mean to remove the 5% crit for a level 60 mobs attacks as a level 60 character is probably around 125 defense (440 - 300 - 15 = 125). 
---
I'm unsure if defense becomes less effective as you gain levels like rating stats did in later expansions. So it's possible you don't need as much at lower levels, but again you don't really need it for dungeons - stack stamina and armor and you'll be fine.
---
If you're so interested in RPing there's not just one way to do it. You can be a ruthless butcher as either Alliance or Horde. You can also be an honorable warrior who shows mercy and doesn't purposefully slay those weaker than himself unless absolutely necessary. Real world warrior codes are applicable to both military societies like the Alliance and honor based societies like the Horde. [Bushido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushido#Eight_virtues_of_Bushid%C5%8D_(as_envisioned_by_Nitobe_Inaz%C5%8D)) for example:
---
&gt;Respect:  True warriors have no reason to be cruel. They do not need to prove their strength...   
---
Heroic Courage:  Hiding like a turtle in a shell is not living at all. A true warrior must have heroic courage. It is absolutely risky...  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Benevolence, Compassion:  Through intense training and hard work the true warrior becomes quick and strong. They are not as most people. They develop a power that must be used for good. They have compassion...
---
It is easy to see a proud orc warrior neglecting to massacre a vastly underskilled opponent who has no chance of harming him because it would bring the orc great dishonor.  
---
Basically in the end you're just being a dick by killing lowbies for the most part. The least you can do is admit it.
---
Is there already a wow cosplay sub?
---
You probably won't be rolling in full T1 while it's current content, but if you can put in 15 hours a week at max level and allot like 6-8 of those to raiding, you can absolutely get your gear in a casual to semi-casual raiding guild. I have friends who played basically that much from the start of a server and played about as much as you, if not closer to 8-12 for some of them (6 hours of it being raiding in their guild), and by the time BWL came out they had 4/8+ T1 and 2 pieces of T2 each.
---
A more casual guild won't be clearing MC on week 4 or whatever, but assuming our content release schedule is remotely close to the base game/how private servers handled it, you'll have a solid 4-6 months of MC being the top content. But even then, basically anyone who wants it and has a decent set of pre-raid gear can find a spot in a guild or PUG depending how prominent PUGs are, especially as a Paladin.
---
Once MC isn't current, you'll have a really easy time farming it as it will be less contested and there will definitely be PUGs doing it at this point. Beware though, if you plan on raiding as anything but Holy you'll probably be prioritized below all of the Holy paladins on tier pieces unless you're the GM or an officer or something. (and rightfully so, not because haharetsucks but just because holy makes much better use of the gear)
---
Very easy because it's mostly bad except for some people use it in Naxx for the SR I think.
---
You'll be wearing cloth and leather mostly

This was my first proper epic at level 60. I had a human warrior. I was 12. I thought I was so fucking cool
---
Comparing it to Scarab Lord which is 1 person per server seems ridiculous. 
---
I mean sure it is supposed to mean something special. But when you can get it through botting/account sharing by having your character in a bg 24/7. It kind of loses its meaning. The system in itself is flawed. You have to acknowledge that.
---
Wish I could draw like that. Job well done, sir!
---
IIRC, the math is 1 point of defense = 0.4% less chance to be crit by a mob. A same level mob has a 5% chance to crit you with your base 300 defense, and each level causes that to go up by .2%. So a level 63 mob has a 5.6% chance to crit you.
---
So defense from gear needed is 140 @ 63.
---
135 @ 62.
---
etc....
---
I also assume that if you fight a mob of a lower level then you, that their chance to crit you based on level decreases at a similar rate.
---
That said, I don't know why you need that, as it's not a very important stat for anything but crit capping against raid bosses. Crits aren't the biggest concern for tanks by themself, the issue is crit + crushing blows (which come into play with level 63 mobs). Without crushing blows, there are better stats to prioritize on your character. 
---
Months after release, when people are progressing AQ40 or at least during Naxx progression, MC will be on absolute farm.
---
You can PUG or fill in for a guild and easily get T1 geared by then, by the time big guilds are just running MC on farm.
---
Harness the power of hype and anything is possible!
---
What? The server isn't crashing?
---
But Activision Blizzard apologists on this sub told me that it's ok that BfA crashes the servers and has 5 second lag spikes with this many people because Vanilla servers couldn't handle large scale PvP either??
---
You mean like Indiana Jones Land, err Uldum.  Yea
---
Another great video Frost. Keep 'em coming!
---
I still think it was a massive missed opportunity to create a third faction in TBC rather than blood elves and draenei. 
---
The factions could have been some of the other humanoid races in the world that constantly get shit on by the horde and alliance. They realize their weaknesses as one and decide to align themselves together. I'm talking Murlocs, Centaurs, Harpies, and Gnolls (or maybe Quillboars).

But there is something immersive about a dishonorable jerk running around killing weaklings just because he can. If you want to stoke the flames resentment and conflict in a video game, giving people the capacity to be a jerk is a strong method. Jerks pop up, people want to fight the jerks, more world PvP happens. Jerks and gankers and trolls are a healthy component to any world PvP environment.

I'm so excited to jack all the cloth and leather gear for pre-bis resto shaman &lt;3
---
I'm not really a fan of the 'PvP server' excuse. I like PvP, so I prefer a PvP server. At the same time, I'm self aware enough to acknowledge that one-shotting a lowbie isn't PvP, it's just a power trip aiming to screw another player. If I did that, I'd feel like an asshole. Consequently, I'm going to consider anyone else who does that an asshole too. PvPing and treating others decently are not mutually exclusive.
---
You don't have to be a good player to get R14. You just have to have no life. 
---
I think he's referring to the 8 set bonus where the paladin can heal the party for about 200 on auto attack.
---
You have the terminology wrong. Watch the video you posted, he even said "that's sharding."
---
Phasing was introduced in wotlk. It when you complete a quest and the environment changes and you are put in a different phase. So if another player hasn't done the same they will not be there and will 'phase' out.
---
Sharding is splitting a realms population into smaller realm 'shards', dividing the population to ease server loads and cap players in an area, while allowing everyone to play.
---
They both appear the same to the player witnessing them. When something vanishes right before your eyes. 
---
Scarab Lord isn't limited to one person per sever...you just have to complete the chain and ring the gong within 8 hours of the first person doing it.
---
How is the system "flawed" when it is meant to be a giant timesink to get to R14?  I wouldn't go for it personally but it's not like R14 gear breaks the game.  It's a niche achievement for dedicated players.
---

Thanks guys for the inspiration. Sorry I did not think anyone would comment on this post as it was finally approved by the kids after like a month of waiting? Or possibly a fault of my own? They removed it stating it named a private server which it didn’t but I digress. 
---
Thanks again to everyone who answered. 
---
The t1 would be for the 8set bonus to solo dungeons so I won’t be wearing cloth. I plan to push the absolute limit of what is and is not solo able. 😂. 
---
Cheers and see you in Azeroth!
---
Yeah I loved his series that covered the legendary weapons, as well as the Dungeon Set 2 quest line and the Paladin/Warlock epic class mounts. 
---
The crit caps for 62, 61, 60, 59, etc. are 435, 430, 425, 420, etc., respectively.
---
Yes this is correct thanks for clarifying. Aa is auto attack. 
---
Each level of difference adds 5 more defense, which is 0.2% crit (1 def = 0.04% crit). With that, you also have to negate the flat 5% crit.
---
The formula for mob crit % is `(mob_def – player_def) * 0.04 + 5`
---
mob_def being `mob_level * 5` and player_def is `player_level * 5 + bonus_def`
---
You can therefor get the bonus defense you need to get 0% crit doing `5 / 0.04 + (mob_level - player_level) * 0.04` (add 300 if you want total defense as level 60)
---
As a level 60 you need : 
---
- Vs lvl 59 mob : 5/0.04 - 5 = 120 bonus def (420 def)
---
- Vs lvl 60 mob : 5/0.04 = 125 bonus def (425 def)
---
- Vs lvl 61 mob : 5/0.04 + 5 = 130 def bonus def (430 def)
---
- Vs lvl 62 mob : 5/0.04 + 10 = 135 def bonus def (435 def)
---
- Vs lvl 63 mob (raid bosses) : 5/0.04 + 15 = 140 def bonus def (440 def)
---
If you want to main tank then you need to cement that role in early. Find a guild before launch and let them know your intentions, they'll want someone committed and who puts the time/effort  in to be in that spot. 
---
In game, make sure to keep up with the main levelers in the guild so you can do things with them. You also want to be one of the first to hit 60 so you can get your gear and attunes done. You've got to remember without you the raid fails, so if you can't turn up to every raid then MT isn't for you. 
---
Again thanks to all who commented. Classic won’t be a rush so a cpl months to get t1 is not a big deal. I will be rolling alliance boomkin/feral or a splash of all specs for wpvp and a reckoning/holy pally for wpvp.  Hope that I can meet some of you guys!

Where abouts would you recommend finding a guild for classic before it releases?

Too much too fast and fake enthusiasm is a major turn away for me. Unfortunately 80% of YouTubers are exactly that.

UBRS shield is easier to get and doesn't cost gold to buy. Also the extra bit of Fire Resist is helpful as you'll want it for some bosses.

I ask you one more time
---
&gt; it is meant to be a giant timesink
---
How do you know that was the point of Blizzards design decisions? If you don't work for blizzard, how can you possible know their design philosophy regarding it.
---
You fail to address my point of it being easily achievable by cheating and unfair play. It is a system that can easily be exploited. You can't see the flaw in that?
---
The PvE and PvP specs are quite different, which can result in a lot of respeccing. Also optimal AoE farming is a different spec as well.
---
 **&lt;Requiem&gt;** \- Horde | NA-PvP | Semi-Hardcore  
---
**Intro:** We are a group of friends from the mid-west all jumping back in for Classic. Most are classically trained up to and including MC, ONY, and BWL, with a few who saw AQ40 and NAXX content prior to the release of BC. Many in this group, myself included, have been active across various private servers over the years and are eager to bring our knowledge and experience to the Blizzard stage. 
---
First and foremost, this will be a Semi-Hardcore Progression/Raiding Guild.  Our goal is to progress through all Raid content efficiently but without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing the game -others have referred to this as relaxed-progression.  Don't let this intimidate you, we understand we're all older now, with families and careers.  We're not asking you to put in an extra 40 hours of WoW on top of real world responsibilities.  We're also not asking you to give up PVP.  And while we'd love to begin progressing through content as soon as possible we understand the level 60 grind, and preparing for raids, takes time and effort. 
---
**What we're focusing on now:**  Building a core group\* of like-minded players who understand the level of effort and coordination behind building a successful raiding guild and have the drive to make it happen in a friendly and laid-back, albeit efficient, environment.  
---
\**If you have past experience with being a raid/class leader (or even no experience at all) and are interested in applying for an officer position, PM me.*
---
**Expectations:**  Be courteous and respectful of all members.  No gatekeeping. We don't expect everyone to know strats to every encounter, but if you don't, we will expect that you show up with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn. 
---
**Raid Schedule:** Thursday &amp; Sunday 6:00 PM PST. As more content becomes available we may add a 3rd day, this is still TBD. 
---
So many Europeans play on private servers. Maybe it's because they're more comfortable with a free service than Americans.
---
I don't know if that means you'll see even more Europeans play Classic, or fewer.
---
Item that exists did not have to drop. It's enough for it to be on a loot table of existing raidID.
---
He's a YouTuber who puts out good content... You expect him to type out a wall of text instead? 
---
Thanks! I appreciate it.
---
Take it for what you will, but if your team isn't ready, you're fucked regardless. I'm not wasting time on deaths on a lost cause just because the tank is a happy go lucky pull wagon. My healing had never been an issue since Vanilla,  
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd-yRVtNBuI&amp;t=28m39s
---
Pretty much this. I would wager putting the zones together like it was back then would be the easy part and wouldn’t take a whole lot of time, comparatively speaking.
---
It's not a fair fight, but this is a role playing game in which you play as a member of a warring faction. It is fair role play. And perhaps this is a time to remind you that "all's fair in love and war" ;)
---
Sorry meant where as in is this on a private server?
---
No problem. I know what it's like as I had to find a guild that would allow me to play feral druid.
---
I understand all these words individually, but not at all together.
---
Pretty sure you understood what I meant
---
I hope it's possible the query the server for items in Classic because there are so many questions about itemization. Are Naxx blues in the loot tables already? Which versions of items made it in the game? Did a particular patch's items get lumped into this content cycle?
---
There is otherwise no way to know these things.
---
Today on things that never happened.
---
Hi,
---
I am an EU player that is open to either faction and prefer Horde. I am going to be rolling a warrior tank, and am looking for a serious PvE guild where I would be able to main tank. I am on a very large amount during the week, and eagerly looking forward to helping people with things like attunements and pre-raid BiS runs. If there are any other opportunities for me to help out in the guild with other responsibilities, then I would also be happy to do that to. If you think I could be a good fit for your guild, then please let me know! :)
---
Lawbringer drops in MC and is technically easy to get. You'll just be competing with the other Pallies in there
---
perhaps.
---
Only time will tell.
---
ret btw
---
It depends on your spec and priorities.  Draconian Deflector is going to be more useful more often in my experience, but Immovable Object's higher shield block value does translate to higher TPS if you are shield slam spec in 1.12.
---
If you're just putting on a shield as a fury warr for 5mans or offtanking, stick with UBRS.
---
I'm playing a Human Paladin this summer.  
---
My question is what do I play UNTIL then?  Guild wars 2?  ESO?  Some single player game from the past 5 years I never considered because I was playing wow at the time?
---
10 players is a raid
---
Thank you all very much for the answers here.  
---
The question was not born of need but of just a small interest in messing with tanking ideas. I am always trying new things just to see how they work.  
---
Again, thanks.  
---
Paladins are great healers. Ret is fun in pvp. I really like the class fantasy of the Paladin and its been my main in retail forever, but I don't care for its playstyle in Vanilla I'm afraid! You may love it though so don't let me discourage you. Druid is equally boring to heal with (from a raid perspective) imo but you may have a totally different opinion if you were to try it. I just think if you do want the versatility, druid might be good for you, If you decide you wanna stick with healing instead, shaman is fun to me and priest has a pretty fun kit as well.
---
I care
---
Really? damn
---
Skining by far while everyone lvls
---
Later I think ingi is picked a lot 
---
7/10 needs more tiddy 
---
Pretty sure leatherworking is the least popular profession.
---
Depending on the path you choose and there sure you are it gives you options.
---
And you can craft some cool stuff to sell if you can get the mats
---
Tailoring and Enchanting for the casters (mage, priest, warlock). Nobody wants to pay a bunch of money for items they can just make themselves with little effort. Cloth is easy to collect, you can make your own cloth armor and turn the excess green items into Enchanting materials so that you can make wands for your character too.
---
That's my prediction anyway.
---
Euros are probably overrepresented on pservers because thats where the servers are hosted. A lot of NA players are turned off by a default "low ping" of 115ms+ with big latency spikes being very common.
---
For end game raiding i always think herb alch is the best combo. For while you level you cant go wrong doubling up on gathering professions.
---
I hope they bring back the knock back
---
While leveling probably skinning... In endgame, I'd give it to herbalism.
---
What do I just read?
---
I was expecting the ZG plate chest. At least that's what I used back in the day. 
---
I don't expect anyone from the opposite faction to treat me fairly. When I round the corner and see a mounted 60 with decent gear on my lvl 20 I fully expect to be cut down. When I don't, it's just a pleasant surprise and a fun player to player interaction. I can remember when my group of 5 level 30 somethings were working on an elite quest and some alliance came through with a 60 helping them. Instead of being dicks and wrecking us, the 60 finished off the elite giant with an aimed shot and we all saluted and went about our way unimpeded. 
---
What it comes down to really is that RP reasons and all that aside, you can choose to be a dick to people or have a positive interaction. Yes I include meaningful PVP as a positive interaction because we all love that shit or we wouldn't roll on PVP servers, even when we're on the receiving end. In the end I always prioritize not being a dick as much as I can. This is what I expect from myself but I have no real expectation of that from anyone else. But like I said when people are cool, it's positive all around and pleasantly surprising. I find myself pleasantly surprised a lot.
---
Darkshore for me
---
&gt; How do you know that was the point of Blizzards design decisions? If you don't work for blizzard, how can you possible know their design philosophy regarding it.
---
Literally can ask you the same thing...your point is moot.  Using my brain and understanding how it takes weeks of grinding BG's to even have a shot at getting R14 helps me understand it is designed to be a giant time sink.
---
&gt; You fail to address my point of it being easily achievable by cheating and unfair play.
---
It's not "easily achievable" even with account sharing.  You have to operate a premade, run sub 10 min BG's all day, every day, for weeks on end.  That's not easy by any stretch.
---
No Devilsaur/Lionheart 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
---
Prot has far less damage output and the less survivability.
---
Download swing timer. Hamstring kite and only take hits while you are hitting the npc. If you pull multiple mobs, you can hamstring kite up to 3 with cleave. Assuming you are using hamstring kiting as prot to minimize the damage you take, you will simply be trading less damage with your 1 hander, than you would with a 2 hander. Not only is prot slower, it has significantly less survivability as you will take MORE hits during an encounter. This doesnt even factor in the deficit you will experience in pvp. Assuming you roll on a pvp realm, you will not win any fights, you will ALWAYS die. Prot is for group content, but even low level dungeons often dont reward good xp per hour (with a few exceptions pending quests). Prots low damage also impacts their threat generation, making them far weaker in low level dungeons as tanks than feral druids or hunters.
---
Prot is gimping yourself for the sake of gimping yourself. A lot of DPS classes can hit 60 in sub 6 days. Warriors (solo playing) typically struggle to get between 6-8 days and in my experience, it is reasonable to assume about 10 days for the average player... Prot will slow the warriors efficiency by A LOT. I dont think its hyperbole to assume your friends could be hitting 60 in 5-6 days played while you are going to take upwards of 20-25 days played on a pvp realm IF you dont plague your friends with demands for help... If you truly take the solo prot warrior as an average player and take a prot build you will have to sink an unreal amount of time into leveling and when you do get the chance to tank, you will be worse than a fury warrior of equal gear/skill at tanking pre raid.

Now downvote me so I can be on my way.

---
ITT: a lot of people assuming private server resistance values are accurate.
---
It's not really a good idea to try to hit the def cap before BWL, mostly due to how much other stats a tank has to sacrifice to hit it in pre-raid gear. If shield block is up then a tank with only a boss mob on him can't be crushed or crit because those outcomes are pushed off the attack table by the block. A few bosses in BWL have mechanics that prevent shield block from being up all the time (extra physical attacks from Broodlord, stuns from Chromaggus if he has the dreaded bronze breath, warrior class call on Nefarian), so it is useful for preventing burst on those.

Ironically enough I don't think UD NE's would exist, they were the only ones NOT present in the area AFIK to have been affected by the scourge (I do remember them going to the Eastern Kingdom continent in WCIII at some point, but I forget if they fought the Scourge and, even if they did, there wouldn't have been enough of them fallen to have warranted them being a UD playable "race" in classic). 
---
But yea, BE's should totally be in the 'roster" of UD models as far as I'm concerned. 
---
How do I save this. Me and two friends will be playing and we need a home. And I love playing janky specs while leveling etc. I’ll be rolling alliance maybe you can pm me? We can exchange numbers and the it launches we can roll on the same server? Lmk!
---
What is more important to you, gold or raiding?
---
I played both of these classes to 60 because they were also my two favorite considerations. 
---
Mage is a struggle in pvp while leveling until you get your big frost talents towards the bottom of the tree. I’ve leveled a few and my least favorite levels are that 20-30 range. Then the class is turned on it’s head and becomes a blast. In group pvp at poor early level 60 gear, the class works great as a utility and an annoyance. However, dying fast because of low stamina or doing low damage in exchange for stam and int gear is meh. But once you get that pvp gear and some raid gear it’s great again with huge shatter crits, endless tools between your class kit and engineering and survivability. 
---
Priest was extremely boring to level (single target SWP + wand basically) but also the strongest I’ve felt ever playing a 1v1 class while leveling in vanilla. I won nearly every time except against other priests, in which we often avoided each other because of how boring the fight would be. Pvp, even while winning, was actually pretty boring all the time compared to my mage. The downside is after I beat someone, or if I was outnumbered I didn’t stand a chance in leveling gear. Not enough mana and no mobility on the priest like mage has. Once I hit 60 I tried to enjoy this character but I had no fun on it whatsoever compared to my mage. If I wanted to do something right I had to do it as a healer and I couldn’t be bothered playing what I found to be a boring class overall to get the gear to win as shadow in casual pvp, which was often a boring matchup from my perspective. 
---
I will be playing mage on the real thing and honestly, I don’t think I’d max a priest again. 
---
Transmog cured me of inspect-sickness, but it destroyed a big fun.
---
Some servers have lowered their drop rates of greys and essences.
---
The "correct" drop rates are a bit of a matter of debate.  Archives of empirical drop rates show some changes in long term drop rate - suggesting it may have been changed during the course of vanilla retail.
---
Will be interesting to see what the true 1.12 drop rates turn out to be.
---
* Probably depends on what build they go with.  I remember a few low-level ones would technically allow you to bring more (something like 10).  However, when you switch to a raid, the XP gains drop massively and you can't complete any non-raid quest.  Plus, you have to distribute loot to 10 people instead of 5.  I believe BRD had a 40-man limit because you had to go through BRD to get to MC.  
---
* As someone else said, 5 resets per hour.  The limit is mainly to keep people from farming the first boss or the trash up to the first boss without doing the dungeon.  This resets ALL instances, though, you don't get to pick and choose.

Before any would-be Classic tanks watch the Alcor's segment and get enamoured with the idea that this pre-raid weapon is truly one of the best TPS weapons in the game, you should know that this statement is based off faulty private server data! Alcor's was truly as good at the time of early Kronos/Nostalrius era because boss hits were generating ridiculous amounts of rage since it assumed warriors had basically 0% mitigation despite having really high armor values. This resulted in what Frostadamuz describes; tanks being infinitely rage capped, meaning they could sustain infinite Heroic Strike spam, which would make Alcor's truly one of the best TPS weapons in game. This bug was fixed, however, and Alcor's usefulness dropped where it's not that great of a weapon. It is still the best weapon to use on Vaelastrasz, since that fight literally gives you infinite rage to sustain spamming Heroic Strikes on every swing, but that's not the case in the gross majority of fights in the game.  
---
The only way alcor's could rise again to be one of the top TPS weapons is if private servers SIGNIFICANTLY underestimated boss damage, which I doubt. If I, and current pserver emulation is correct or close to accurate, then Alcor's will definitely not be worth the hundreds - thousand gold people will try to sell it for, since it's only bis on one fight.  
---
Enjoyed the video otherwise!
---
&gt; Literally can ask you the same thing.
---
I'm not ascribing anything on to why the system is like it is. You are.
---
Just because it is a timesink, doesn't necessarily mean that was the main goal of it. Even if it was, the amount of time needed could be something they were going to fine tune. PvP has always been third or fourth level priority by Blizzard, or perhaps lower.
---
Well, it sure is a lot easier than not account sharing. You also have the problem of queue dodging. 
---
The system is flawed, in multiple different ways. There are no other way of putting it. It has multiple issues and that will be exploited. Queue dodging will not only impact the top PvP players, it can impact the whole realm. You can keep on denying this if you want, but I would urge you to take a deeper look at the system and reevaluate your opinion.
---
I don't buy this argument.  The rotations can be complex and people leave because the rest of the game is boring.  People play lots of other games with simple rotations (most FPS games, MOBAs, or Action RPGs you mostly use the same few abilities) and play them for a long time.  I still play Counter-Strike and it's 99% the same as it was 18 years ago - all you got in there is shoot!
---
I'd rather spam frostbolt on a mage in Vanilla than suffer through the monotony of live with a fancier rotation.

I think all the rogues would like the old weapon speed balance so that dps warriors went two-hand and the rogues could get their Maladaths and CTS in peace. 
---
My money is on Blizzard releasing Classic with post 1.9 tuning which means all the warriors will go fury in raid and two-handers be reserved for PvP warriors or the odd dps paladin/shaman/druid.

id eat me some of that vanilla
---
Head back at level 10 and 20 to get priest racial abilities. Other than that the main issue will be needing to trek to thunder bluff to train new priest skills since there isn't a trainer elsewhere in mulgore.
---
i'd love me some of that vanilla
---
So you'll think I can simply right click my character to reset the dungeon?
---
Also, getting more than 5 people would simply be for the gear or for kicks and giggles.
---
It’s more of a nuisance than anything. A funny one though. Those are the kinds of things that make a server feel alive.
---
I feel like everyone is going to have this thought &amp; the economy will be weird because of it haha. 
---
I'm thinking of doing leatherworking/skinning. I think it's kind of fun to progress a crafting profession while leveling. SOMEBODY's gotta buy all that stuff people are gonna throw into the AH
---
Yeah, that's a good &amp; common combination for the reasons you provided. It would be helpful to have a skinner who can lend you stuff for those random recipes requiring leather.
---
Most of the guilds that have already formed are set on main tanks.
---
I.e. I joined a guild 2 months ago and the crucial roles had been taken away prior to me joining the guild. There were Like 20-25 people in the guild already. 
---
This ist due to people knowing themself for longer time and thus know they can depend on each other. 
---
Therefore I think it ist pretty hard to get a spot as main tank, because reliability/raid attendance is as much important as skill.
---
My advice would be, to look out for guilds in the process of creation. Otherwise you have to get lucky to get a spot as tank, since you only need 2 dedicated ones in the early stages of raiding.
---
Before  any would-be Classic tanks watch the Alcor's segment and get enamoured with the idea that this pre-raid weapon is truly one of the best TPS weapons in the game, you should know that this statement is based off  faulty private server data! Alcor's was truly as good at the time of 2015 private server era because boss hits were generating ridiculous amounts of rage, since it assumed the tank had basically 0% mitigation despite having really high armor values. This resulted in what Frostadamuz describes; tanks being infinitely rage capped, meaning they could sustain infinite Heroic Strike spam, which would make Alcor's truly one of the best TPS weapons in game. This bug was fixed, however,  and Alcor's usefulness dropped where it's not that great of a weapon. It  is still the best weapon to use on Vaelastrasz, since that fight  literally gives you infinite rage to sustain spamming Heroic Strikes on  every swing, but that's not the case in the gross majority of fights in  the game.
---
The only way alcor's could rise again to be one of the top TPS weapons is if private servers SIGNIFICANTLY underestimated boss damage, which I doubt. If current pserver emulation is correct or close to accurate, then Alcor's will definitely not be worth the hundreds to thousand gold people will try to sell it for, since it's only bis on one fight.
---
It depends if you're leveling by yourself or in dungeons.
---
**Solo Questing**
---
By yourself, a big 2H weapon is the way to go.  
---
Use hamstring to slow enemies down, and then only be in range of them when your swing timer is up (you can use a swing timer addon, or just try to time it yourself).  Let's say you and the enemy have similar HP and DPS values, but you have a 3.5 swing timer and the enemy has a 2.0 swing timer.  If you joust with Hamstring, you will get a hit for 350, they get a hit for 200, and their faster attack doesn't apply because they're out of range.
---
If you use a sword and a shield, then you can't take advantage of this, and will instead have to rely on your ability to whittle enemies down.  One thing to keep in mind is that in a dungeon you'll have heals to bring you back up, and damage dealers to quickly finish enemies off.  So the ratio may or may not work out (it will be worse against casters because armor has no effect on them).  Where you will notice a big issue is when killing slower means respawns get you.
---
**Dungeons**
---
The biggest issue with low-level dungeons isn't tankiness, it's rage.  Going Arms for Tactical Mastery and Anger Management, or going Fury for Unbridled Wrath can give you a big rage boost.  Also, simply being able to take a little bit more damage can keep things on you.  (I remember in TBC the T5 and T6 tanks would do dungeons wearing only half their gear so they could keep rage).  More important than your health and armor is that everything is attacking you. 
---
With that said, Prot gets boosts to Bloodrage, gets rage on blocks (and better use of Shield Block), and gets rage cost reduction in Sunder Armor and other offensive abilities.  I've leveled mostly through dungeons as prot and it's worked well for me.
---
**Conclusion**
---
If you plan to level almost exclusively through dungeons or with a group, Prot is viable.  Fury/Arms is also viable.  If you plan to level with a lot of solo, Fury or Arms is better.  So Prot isn't completely useless to level, but you  have to know what you're in for and know where the best use of your abilities is.
---
Why is it the least popular? Is it just not very good?
---
&gt;That's one reason I dislike DPS meter fanatics.
---
You brought it up yourself, by saying Enhancement Shamans were the ones keeping up the Nightfall proc the best, which wasn't true. 
---
&gt; There is an additional DPS bonus to the melee group with improved  Windfury and Strength of Earth totems that doesn't appear on the meter  and has to be calculated more carefully. 
---
Improved totems doesn't make up for the 50% less DPS they do. There's a reason why Feral Druids are starting to get accepted now, which is because they're rivaling melee DPS on many Patchwerk bosses, while also providing a crit buff, but even then, they're barely accepted. They're actually pulling numbers which make them comparable, unlike Enhancement.
---
&gt; but the overall DPS increase of the group is greater than adding a hunter or warrior spamming hamstring or wing clip. 
---
It really isn't, because that Warrior or Hunter is 100% needed in many raids, either for dispelling, pulling, off-tanking and what not. Unless you want to switch people out between bosses, then the best thing you can use a off-tank for, is to get the Nightfall proc up, which makes up for the awful DPS they would've done anyways.
---
Is that engineering?
---
This.  Also the dynamic cross-server merging is called cross realm zones (crz), not sharding.

Good video.

Constructive criticism: Personally didn't like the cinematics of you flying through DM. Or if you do it, don't do it in third person view. You're going for more or less realistic footage and that just broke the immersion for me a bit. I'm pretty sure there are GM commands that make you invisible to mobs so you can just walk through without getting attacked. But maybe that's just me.
---
To get R14 you need to be #1 on your faction in terms on total honor.  That means you need to run BG's a lot.  That means you spend a lot of **TIME** PVPing.
---
&gt; Just because it is a timesink, doesn't necessarily mean that was the main goal of it. Even if it was, the amount of time needed could be something they were going to fine tune.
---
Except they never did from 2004-2006.  The fact that the R14 grind was never modified before BC asserts to me that they were, in fact, fine with how long it took to get R14.
---
Queue dodging is an issue.  Simple fix would be giving people the deserter debuff if they don't accept the queue.

They only made draenei shamans, because the pre-retcon draenei in WC3 had shamans.
---
And Blood Elves being Paladins, but actually they are Blood Knights, was just a dumb stretch (but not as bad as sunwalkers)

Really stellar.

The forsaken make a little bit of sense because they are undead who gained free will and broke away from the scourage who are just mindless minions. The night elfs though were their totally own faction who hated all invaders equally.

Yea soldiers should just go around killing what is essentially a civilian because you're at war with his nation.  
---
Sounds great.  
---
&gt; PvPing and treating others decently are not mutually exclusive
---
It's a video game.  Let's calm down on the morality.

Honestly you look pretty cool 
---
Yes
---
I think my pre-raid goal was 420 defense. I obtained more before tanking MC and ZG...
---
My school district would send kids who were out of school suspended for violence to a special school who had handled kids with behavior problems, and the school would just send homework there. This school wasn't in the school district, but part of the state special education system.
---
Once there, you had to stay on track or they would keep adding more time to your suspension.  If you got kicked out of that, it was because you fucked up and were going to juvenile detention or prison.
---
Yeah now the kid gets to play for 105 days. That’ll teach him. 
---
It really depends on your  guilds loot system as well as how much the other paladins in your guild want it. 
---
It's no good for raid healing but in my current guild everyone was still trying to get the full set to use for farming and pvp and other fun stuff. 
---
One guy in particular went after it early by agreeing to pass on all main spec healing drops.
---
the paradox wirth raiding is that the casual shit tier guilds actually will spend signifcant more time raiding.  with a good guild you'll be clearning content way faster. (for example killing onyxia in 1 try, then running to MC and clearing that in under 30 mins, depending on patch and gear ofc)    10-20 hours is plenty per week, so long as your free time aligns with raiding time.    
---
i think people really over estimate how much time raiding takes nowadays with a good guild.  (though you can argue private servers these past few years arent an accurate representation but in the end i dont think it matters)
---
Conspiracy confirmed! Azeroth is flat you guys! 
---
Ashenvale. That run from Astranaar to Zoram Strand...
---
I couldn't have said it better. Someone mentioned his channel a few weeks ago and since then I've been basically making my way through his library one video at a time and loving it. So far, the patch history videos have been my favourite.
---
The Horde needed Blood Elves though. They had way smaller population than ally before TBC.
---
And with boomkin your at least making a couple casters happy by increasing their dps on the meters. 
---
I quit most recently in Legion. 
---
Feels like such a shame that the dungeons and raids have fun mechanics but are completely wasted by being too easy (undertuned plus group finder) and giving rewards that feel so meaningless. (I couldn’t tell you the name or stats of one piece of gear I got on a heroic raiding protection warrior.)
---
If only WoW had just kept the social aspect and progression of Vanilla throughout its lifespan while adding all the technological advancements of today.
---
Yeah you can find a Mage raid leader as a boomkin sometimes. Boosts his ego and dps so you get that raid spot, even though a guy doing 360's while casting frostbolt would bring more raid dps. :)
---
What days of the week were you thinking? I get home at around 5:20 pst and would love to join you. :)
---
It's pretty bad, you lose a lot of money compared to just vendoring skins, and there isn't a ton of useful gear. There's a little bit of early BiS with devilsaur, but the cost is going to be mostly from the leather itself, not the finished pieces. Armor kits aren't particularly big earners either. 
---
Tbf it's a super easy profession since you'll have plenty of raw mats, so if money isn't a problem it's totally fine to go. I leveled a hunter on a private server and did LW as I leveled, I was pretty underwhelmed though. All it got me that I cared about were quivers, which I could have gotten off the AH and saved a lot of cash.
---
They should punish the parents for letting their child play a Paladin.
---
I would love to have a side-by-side comparison how the classic classes look like at key progression points. Just roughly, with the gear most people would use pre-raid, tier 1/2 etc.
---
For example Warlocks have to wear a weird crafted set from ZG (?) for a long time, looks really bad. Something with Vine. Blood Vine?
---
Would be a great idea for a youtube content creator. Aesthetics matter a lot for some, and we won't have transmog. How a character looks might help deciding on a main!
---
Yeah this seems fake. Got in a fight or two in highschool and the longest I was suspended for was 3 days. 105 seems like overkill or a joke, pretty sure at that point they’d just expel you

PS Why is 'Vulgar Language' marked? They wrote out his entire quote but I don't see any vulgar language there.
---
Engineering number 1 for insane utility, especially in PvP. Blacksmithing least popular since it doesn't make any money unless you are fortunate enough to be one of the first on the server with a rare recipe. Tailoring will be popular for priests, warlocks, and mages as it is needed for truefaith vestments and bloodvine set. Skinning, Mining, Herbalism, and Enchanting (kept at level 1 for disenchanting) all will be popular for making money. Skinning is by far the most popular profession while leveling because skins vendor for a lot for how little time they take to get. Leatherworking and alchemy will be relatively unpopular, but they have cooldown craftables for decent passive income.
---
The group leader can right-click their portrait and select "Reset All Instances."  The instance must be empty to do so (i.e. no players inside).
---
You can get Blacksmithing as a profession and chose Axesmithing as your specialisation. Making Nightfall. Then you can spec Enhancement and get a spot as a Windfury buff bitch with Nightfall.
---
Let's be real, you were going to the bakery anyway.
---
Never argued it didn't need time. The question is how much time. 
---
You don't need to be on standing 1 each week to progress, but to get rank14 yes you most likely need it from rank 13 to 14.
---
&gt; Except they never did from 2004-2006.
---
As I also mentioned, PvP has never been a huge priority for Blizzard.  Which would explain minimal to none changes.
---
&gt; The fact that the R14 grind was never modified before BC asserts to me that they were, in fact, fine with how long it took to get R14.
---
This is extremely poor logic. You can apply this to almost any change of an aspect in WoW that came later on. 
---
Just because they didn't change the system before TBC doesn't mean they were happy with the system at all. If you knew anything about game development, you would know that you have to prioritize, and different aspects of the game have different priorities. Blizzard never had PvP systems or balance as a high priority.
---
Aye, I understand now. Thanks for the help!
---
I mained an orc warlock called Chupacabra. You know, after that blood sucking demon/alien thing. Which is basically what a orc warlock is.
---
Remember that the opinions on this sub are generally of those that have min-maxed post-vanilla, i.e., private servers. Classic WoW will have plenty of people who never stepped into the pre-cata world and expect all specs, professions, etc to be viable and fun. 
---
At launch I went Mining/BS and switched later to Mining/ENG and finally saved up enough mats to get enchanting pretty high up there. 
---
Today I would grab skinning and herb or mining and save useful mats, sell the rest so i can level whatever other profession at 60. This isnt how the average player will approach the subject by any means. 
---
Nah.
---
I want to say because pretty much everything they make is BoE so you don't need multiple ones in a guild besides maybe the 3 different types. 
---
You could just ask the realm for a lw and they could make you the stuff.
---
LW/skinning will be great for when everyone wants devilsaur pre bis

Literally listen to madseasonshow to go to sleep, his videos are so relaxing 
---
No in general vanilla gameplay itself is from a technical perspective much easier.  Things take longer but rotations are in general much simpler and mechanics are also much simpler.  The average 5 man boss now adays typically has more mechanics than a raid boss in vanilla.
---
Tyr's Hand and Hearthglen immediately comes to mind.
---
I probably won't be there quick enough. Maybe I should do it just to have the satisfaction of making stuff. 
---
It's fake lol. "Referring staff memeber: GM"
---
/u/madseasonshow get on this 
---
Do Finn-Swedes count?
---
Mechanics wise vanilla is easy. It's just punishing and unforgiving and relies more on people doing their jobs correctly
---
Problem is, most good guilds will be getting to 60 very quickly and rely heavily on out of raid work to make the raids so easy. I suppose playing healer would mean a lighter consumables load, though, but playing 10 to 20hrs a week he'll get to 60 when those guilds are already formed and farming content, it's gonna be tough getting a spot as a fresh 60 into a good guild months after release. 
---
I gank every warlock I see, no matter what the level. Same with hunters, too, even though I generally play hunter. I just feel like they probably deserve it. 
---
This is one of my favorite places.
---
Yeah, I've been looking at those recipes. They sound satisfying to make! I did see, however, a lot of resistance gear. Are those useful for ZG, MC, &amp; AQ? Not sure if Frost or Arcane resistance gear is useful anywhere.
---
The bug hives, especially in Silithus.
---
Pyrewood village in silverpine is a fun little low-level elite area/dungeon.
---
Thats right, I remember ultrazord! I've only touched the last few xpacs just to get to max level but I'm all in for classic. A tichondrius revival server would be amazing. And you?
---
Ogres in stv 
---
&gt; Classic WoW will have plenty of people who never stepped into the pre-cata world and expect all specs, professions, etc to be viable and fun.
---
To be honest, I kind of doubt this. The vast majority of the population will end up being Private Server players. I really do hope it ends up being as you said though! I just have my reservations... Perhaps it's my bias from this sub being the only source of information lol. It really feels like everyone will be doing the gathering professions. WHO WILL CRAFT?!?!?! Gonna join the union now.
---
No expects that everyone is going to act like that, if you want to be a jerk no one can stop you but at the same time people aren't going to have a very high opinion of you.
---
Up to 20 would impact several day's worth of playing when players ought to be building a community and forming friendships. I'm resigned to sharding in 1-10 zones even though I think it's a terrible idea, but implementing it up to lvl20 would definitively have lasting ramifications on the game.
---
If they can't cope with the initial surge how are they going to manage the entire server converging in *one* zone for the AQ opening event?
---
What kind of scrub takes holy shock and Seal of Command in the same talent spec? Shockadins use SoR and weren't really a thing until TBC anyways.
---
I've seen a shammy tank most of MC... So I'm sure some of that gear had to do with it. Frost is for the end of naxx
---
Perfection. 
---
I love to gank, but I can see your side. And there is nothing wrong with people getting pissed and wanting to group up or call in help against the gankers.
---
I don't get the people who just shout "roll pve server" at anything regarding this topic. You need the people who loath the gankers. Because their counterattacks are what make it all worth while.
---
Hell. Some people are so up their own ass on this topic that they get pissed just when you ask for help. 
---
"Getting camped by 2 ally. Anyone able to help?"
---
"Hurr durr, roll pve server scrub
---
"I'm literally trying to recruit more people for the sake of pvp you moron"
---
Exactly what I think. Not only my faves, but most played &amp; first played.
---
&gt; As I also mentioned, PvP has never been a huge priority for Blizzard. Which would explain minimal to none changes.
---
It's literally one of the biggest draws to the game.
---
&gt; Blizzard never had PvP systems or balance as a high priority.
---
Except for implementing the ranking system in general and creating 3 of the best BG's in the game's history, then creating the extremely popular Arena in BC.
---
I honestly don't get what you are advocating for in general.  R14 takes too long?  Getting rid of the ranking system?  
---
&gt; Just because they didn't change the system before TBC doesn't mean they were happy with the system at all.
---
Do you have a source to back this up?
---
They stated at Blizzcon their philosophy was to recreate things as they were during Classic so we won't be seeing any PVP system changes, making discussion surrounding PVP system changes moot.
---
I didn't get up that way much...are those both EPL or WPL?
---
What about Andorhal?  Is that elite in Vanilla or just the one quest?
---
Does swapping trinkets trigger a 30s cooldown on the on use effect?
---
Ah, I wasn't doing it for the "All druid guild" idea, I was doing it for the "Potential PvP confusion" idea. A lot of hunters name their pets "druid" for the same reason.
---
Ok should I have just said J. Allen Brack then? 
---
Grim Batol in Wetlands
---
Both in EPL.  
---
Andorhal was mostly non-elite, but I believe some of the mobs guardian Araj were elites.
---
Server merging would mean that at some point down the line some people will leave and some people will join the server, just as people are bound to do anyway.
---
Sharding means you'll see people fading in and out of view, resources and mobs disappearing before your eyes, being unable to find your friends unless you're already in a group with them, the server appearing completely empty if you happen to be placed in a shard with few other people, etc. Most importantly it ruins the immersion and the feeling of community you get from knowing the people around you are actually there. 
---
9-5 but raid till 1 am? Wtf ? Raid 6-9, do you guys even qualify sleep?
---
Omg, I do the same thing often in IF. It's hilarious watching Allies stand around confused as fuck.
---
It's better to do in IF because there are buildings to hide in afterwards and the corpse run is not nearly as long.
---
My last year of highschool I watched someone get knocked out from a head kick and bust his noggin on the ground as I was sitting in my car eating breakfast in the parking lot. Was only gone for 10 days and I'm sure it's mostly because they had to go to the hospital.
---
Tier 1 and 2 will be a joke in Classic due to changes and nerfs from original design (talents, itemization, debuffs). AQ is prob like a "Normal" raid. Naxx is like in between Normal and Heroic. There is no Mythic's but getting 40 people to stay together, not cry and fight over VERY LIMITED loot and farm all the consumables you need in Naxx is hard. So while Naxx is not mechanically close to anything like a Modern Mythic raid it's still very hard to achieve and get done. Naxx is not going to suddenly be mass cleared. It will be as rare as before, because it's so time gated. AQ should be pretty attainable by Heroic type raiders.
---
**It's really not comparable because the modern game is so different that it might as well be a different game.**  Old WoW is time and gear progression locked. Modern WoW is mechanics locked. Threat was the only real hard mechanic in old WoW and people just tank with consumables and world buffs in a lot of DPS pieces to bypass that now. Your raid DPS in old WoW until WOTLK is only as high as the threat the tank can put out.
---
I will say this though. Raiding was never meant to be the be all end all of WoW in Vanilla. It was just part of the game not the focus. That changed a lot in TBC. Vanilla you could have a few characters and raid/pvp (the blue set is easily gotten) and gear was good for a long time. TBC? Say goodbye to the alts and kiss your life goodbye. Again it was not skill locked. The time investment in TBC was disgusting though. I did it once and I will never do that again. For people that only care about raiding and not pvp? TBC is probably the greatest PVE MMO ever done. I still will never do it again. We were DRAINED by the end of TBC. WOTLK ease was a kneejerk reaction because of how disgusting TBC was.
---
All this is opinion, but I think TBC ruined the game. I think it started everything that eventually killed WoW. WOTLK did minigames as well as they could be done. TBC is what started to turn WORLD of Warcraft into World of MINIGAMES.
---
All downhill since.
---
What does the fire resistance gear actually do in MC? Like, do some of the bosses have a fire-based melee attack? Or are there unavoidable spells that need to be eaten up? 
---
I never got far in Classic, did leveling most of the time. 
---
Spellshock Leggings are the rarest item in classic WoW

because it's a separate game

Since I’m scared you’ll believe him and tell other people, he’s joking.

Raiders use up a shit ton of herbs for consumables.  Herbalism is a great money maker.

https://i.redd.it/mfavi0qrrot01.jpg
---
And being able to fight 2-3 bears at once is immersive?
---
&gt;simple rotations
---
&gt;most FPS games, MOBAs, or Action RPGs
---
You do know that the rotation isn't the gameplay for those games, right? Aiming and positioning isn't a thing in wow. Reaction times also are barely a thing in wow pvp, absolutely inexistant in wow. Also most MOBA "roatations" are more complex than wow, there's 4 spells + items on use in League of Legends, that's higher than most classes even by BfA standards. 
---
It's a really, really bad comparison. MMORPGs can't compete with those kinds of games on gameplay, because they don't try to. It's a RPG. 
---
Playing an action rpg is more like playing an entire 5man yourself. Dark souls, for example, you're tanking (and in this case, tanking isn't standing there and taking hits, the mitigation depends on you actually blocking/moving), doing dps, and eventually healing yourself with a potion that works similarly to a casted ability. 
---
It's not even in the same ballpark, gameplay wise. 
---
You can fish up leather from the sea. :)

https://classicdb.ch/?item=20708#contains

In terms of mechanics of fights, vanilla is pretty simple. The difficult part is gettings 39 other active and able players, grinding materials for consumables, and not having to flexability to swap specs as needed. This is only after you grind countless dungeons for gear/attunements/profession recipes.
---
Vanilla is more of a grind and less forgiving than retail wow.
---
Classic will be 1.12
---
2h fury with bonereavers edge is 100% a thing in 1.12
---
I think this sub is probably like 50/50 on BC being better/being equal to or worse than vanilla. 
---
If they released vanilla and bc concurrently it would be hard for me. One the one hand, BC/wrath play tanking was the most fun I remember having in wow. On the other hand, I think pvp was better in vanilla, hated the introduction of resilience, and liked worldwide chat (that couple months of worldwide lfg chat in vanilla was amazing.)
---
I will keep advertising and attempting to recruit and hopefully I can find I a place that everyone interested can sit in until launch and we could discus events etc that we can do.  The whole point of the guild is to bring fun back to the game and play it how we want to play it.  Bring back a decent community and stop saying things like "it would be cool if..." and actually doing the cool thing
---
Do you actually think they care about your feedback.  People have been clamoring for a classic server for years.  They are only doing it now because they feel it makes financial sense to.   They don't care that you dont agree with the content release schedule.
---
Shard farming is blown out of proportion. Even if you're the only lock in your raid, 40 is most likely going to be enough for a full raid. That's like 30 minutes farm, but you can farm them while you farm gold, so it's not really wasted time, more like 2 birds/1 stone. 
---
Unless your guild expects you to summon everyone but at this point just tell them to go fuck themselves. 
---
My warlocks always forget to put a soulstone down. I got the worst fucking warlocks. 
---
There was a time I listened to this just before bed time to help me fall asleep. It worked for me.
---
Also the first thing this reminds me of is The Valley of Trials, Ratchet/The Merchant Coast, Booty Bay and a very small part of STV, when on my brother's account I made my first character, which was an Orc, leveling in the Valley of Trials walking around to wake peons. [When I entered the same area that's right before that hidden area where a shaman has to talk to some earth elemental for the Earthbind Totem quest](https://youtu.be/yYhvyVVcXCY?t=88), I thought "hey! there's a pathway in between those rocks, I wonder what lies there!". Then I was on the edge of Durotar behind The Valley of Trials, looking across The Merchant Coast toward Ratchet. "Oooh! That \[Ratchet\] looks interesting, and the soundtrack changed, too! I want to go there! \*jumps from the cliff into the water and starts to swim\* These crab thingies are attacking me out of nowhere, and they all have a skull icon! \*dies\* Damn it, I'll keep trying until I get there \[to Ratchet\]. \*releases spirit\* Oh, I'm already in ratchet. \*talks to spirit to ress\* Hey, a boat has arrived, I wonder if it goes somewhere! \*arrives at Booty Bay\* \*attempts to explore STV\*".
---
Did you even read what I posted lol? I said it shared dr UNTIL patch 1.9 in vanilla. I also was commenting about mace stun in VANILLA and mentioned it wasn't widely used until TBC when the proc chance was increased.
---
Most people will vendor those leathers immediately but yeah leather is never really any worth unless it has devilsaur in front of its name
---
Full time job and a new born and you *only* get 10-20 hours a week?! 
---
I have a group of 4 friends including me who will be rolling Ally side, we play PST mostly in the evenings. 2 of us myself included know our class. Ill be a druid(Most likely feral/resto hybrid), another friend has always been a tank since vanilla the first time until now in BfA and will be going Prot Warrior, my other 2 friends are not sure, but almost certainly will be DPS. We plan on PvP, dungeons and some casual raiding. Always looking for more people to play with. 
---
The warrior will likely raid much more hardcore than the rest of us. as he wants to head into Naxx
---
All these are fake, no teacher would write in the comment section like that.
---
I just feel like the tauren would NOT be ok with allying with undead corpses. The trolls maybe wouldnt care and the orcs would maybe consider it for the up coming wars but idk about Thrall. 
---
Finally another video! It was good, though the parts with the backstory of developers on those items were meh. I prefer the information of their practical uses or uniqueness.
---
What class has less than 4 abilities in BFA?
---
Yes.
---
If you plan to poke fire bosses with your weapon or plan on being hit by them you will want fr gear. I wouldn't say mandatory for dps especially later on. But if you want to make sure you survive the full fight take some fr gear.
---
Casters can usually get away with the pots and buffs.
---
and if you plan on raiding or are in a raiding guild - herbing is incredibly useful for your own pots and helpful to the guild 
---
2-handed fury with BRE is legit, and so is about any 2-handed fury spec for speedrunning dungeons/raids, where you do plenty of AoE pulls.
---
Apparently I offended some people. Settle down, vanilla pals. 
---
Unsure on region yet.  I do in fact live in Europe, but lived most of my life in Australia so my Account is tied to US servers.  I would buy a new account though if it turns out EU players are the ones interested, tbh I just want to have a refreshing new experience instead of the same old song and dance and  do what I can to make that happen for myself and others wanting the same
---
No that's the lore justification, they only made shamans for ally and pally for horde because people were QQ'ing...
---
There is NO point in worrying about guild until you are at 60 and ready to go. The likelihood that you will find people before that stage who are able to deliver on their promises is SO low. Summer is still far away and everyone could have a lot of life changes by that time that will completely shift their schedules... Trying to assemble 40 likeminded individuals months out is not going to happen the way people think it will.
---
I will be one of the first hunters to 60 on my realm and will be in one of the first MC clears. That’s my plan. I don’t need to spend time organizing for that because as one of the first 60s, it’s just going to happen. I anticipate that run will struggle to find 40 members and we will likely run short.
---
Focus on yourself and you will find likeminded individuals naturally. If you’re a slow poke, you will be around tons of other slow pokes. If you can only pay weekends, you will end up spending all your ingame time with people on the weekends. Don’t waste your time stressing.
---
Additionally: Why would a school in New York write the date in DD/MM/YY format?

---
Yeah, in fact this song starts to play in my mind when I'm leaving those zones. It almost feels like I've finished watching a TV series and get that feeling of something being over.
---
Is it though? At the end of the day, there's a real person you're interacting with, who is putting in their very precious time to have enjoyment. By ganking, you're taking both away from them for your own pleasure. The video game screen just detaches you from the moral implications, it doesn't remove them.
---
Why lie on the internet tho?
---
You aren’t going to have 22 mages mate 
---
4+item uses, which work basically like CDs in wow. So, yeah, most classes only have one filler spell, one or two procs or DoTs and then it's just CDs. 
---
But that's not my point. Gameplay wise, MMORPGs are absolute trash tier compared to any of those other genres you mentioned. That's by design. Anyone arguing that it's not are being dumb on purpose. 
---
Even the pvp, which is the most gameplay focused aspects of the game, is incredibly slow. Imagine putting a 1.5 GCD on your abilities on a MOBA. 
---
I'm not saying that it takes no skill to play wow, I'm just saying that the gameplay is very basic and not the primary focus of the game. 
---
I would have to agree, but ganking people on my human female rogue was just so satisfying for some reason.
---
Yes they would. They would play and and they would love it, because it’s still better than retail 
---
but why not lionheart?
---
&gt; It's literally one of the biggest draws to the game.
---
That has nothing to do with it. It doesn't change the fact that Blizzard didn't prioritize PvP systems and balance. This statement clearly shows that you have no idea of what you are talking about. No serious PvP player would ever say that.
---
&gt; Except for implementing the ranking system in general and creating 3 of the best BG's in the game's history, then creating the extremely popular Arena in BC.
---
I never claimed they NEVER cared about PvP. Of course they develop the PvP side of the game as well, but it's never been a number 1 priority to refine balance or the systems.
---
&gt; I honestly don't get what you are advocating for in general. R14 takes too long? Getting rid of the ranking system? 
---
I'm advocating for some change to the original PvP system in Vanilla. I don't know what the exact solutions are. I just don't think the system will be of any success if they don't apply any change or additions to the PvP aspect of the game.
---
&gt; Do you have a source to back this up?
---
Well do you have sources of your claim that blizzard was fine with it? No. Again, I'm not claiming that Blizzard found the original system good or bad. I don't have that kind of information. You are the one that came with an assertive claim that they were fine with it. I am showing you that you cannot draw these kind of conclusions from that there were no changes.
---
&gt; They stated at Blizzcon their philosophy was to recreate things as they were during Classic so we won't be seeing any PVP system changes, making discussion surrounding PVP system changes moot.
---
I mean that's what they are trying to do. But every aspect of the game will not be the same as it was in Vanilla. You yourself advocated for a change of desert buff for queue dodging. So you do actually acknowledge some faults with the old system.
---
Some changes will happen regardless. Classic will not be a 1:1 replica of Vanilla. Blizzard won't allocate the amount of resources to achieve that. It is possible that some changes will make the game better.
---
bist du krank*
---
It makes financial sense to have a better timeline. They've expressed the interest in Classic being a long endeavor (to the tune of 15 years), beyond the initial 2 years it would take the servers to run their course.
---
With the information you gave, the only advice I can give is play the class you really want to play. You will be playing it for a long time. Don’t settle for anything less.
---
sounds like you are low energy. you should start a channel and try to be obnoxious too, it may help
---
I think people are forgoting that in vanilla wow how long it actually took to get a full set of tier 1 or tier 2 gear. Guilds would go months without seeing a set piece for a specific class. On top of that if you weren't the main healer/tank/etc you may had to wait your turn to support the progression of the guild as the main tank was getting beefed up before the 3rd off tank.
---
I looooove the look of this axe, I always wished the stats were different though ;(
---
This is not a guide....it’s a guild fix your title
---
I don't know how to read emotions like that so I don't know how to emulate them... I am often told I'm an asshole because I'm blunt... Maybe I could figure something out and find a different side.
---
nice troll ;) but that hammer of justice tho :D
---
Games are social events. Morality is built into it by nature.
---
&gt;Even just a 100 dps increase from scaling would be improved a ton in a raid environment while not mattering as much in pvp, because you rarely aimed shot when not opening
---
How exactly did you manage to boil down PvP scaling to aimed shot?
---
&gt;Also, the example you give, steady shot, is more likely to be used in pvp than aimed not counting an opener. Yet you treat it like this pve only ability that allowed hunters to be scaled. Either you think tbc had the exact same problem with scaling as vanilla, or you are completely wrong in your assessment. It is the latter
---
Again, why did this become a contest of aimed vs steady? A hunter has little to no reason to stand still in PvP. You shouldn't ask yourself "should I aimed or steady here?", but rather "Should I use concussive?", "What sting should I apply?", "Should I quickly hop into melee range for raptor/wing clip?", "Should I scatter shot?", "Should I FD/Trap?", various others and even more importantly "Should I just keep running?"
---
Hunters only freely use Steady Shot when they're being completely ignored, in which case it is identical to Mages/Warlocks and many other classes which can start dealing massive amounts of damage in those circumstances. Your enemy should rightfully feel the pain. In fact, that has essentially been what I've been saying the entire time, because if a Hunter *is* being completely ignored, they're essentially not much more dangerous than if they were being focused. Their DPS is just so mobile that it makes little difference. That is very much unlike the other main DPS classes.
---
The entire problem here is that a Hunter in vanilla will spend a large amount of time just doing *nothing* in PvE. The rotation is Auto, Aimed, Auto, Multi-shot, Auto. Repeat. That is a 9'ish second loop in which you use just 2(!) abilities, and 4 of those 5 shots you can and will do in PvP *while moving*. The addition of Steady Shot meant 3 additional shots within that same rotation. Instead of firing 5 shots, you fire 8. I don't see how you are even trying to argue that such a massive increase in effective usage of time was not what solved the problem.
---
&gt;I also don't think you are familiar at all with pvp.
---
I don't think you are familiar at all with a lot of things.
---
Play how you want. There will be plenty of people around to help if you need it.
---
I think you are getting phasing and sharding confused. And more so of a reason for no sharding at launch, players have the option of skipping out on the first weeks. You don't want to be a part of the shit show (which it will be without sharding) then yes, skip out on the first couple of weeks. But sharding will hurt the community short term and in the long run.
---
Mazthoril in Winterspring is one I never hear brought up in these kinds of posts, but I think it's pretty cool.

In vanilla i barely did duskwood. Playing recently on a pserver was amazed at how much shit is actually under the cemetery that almost never gets used. Its like a mini scholomance with no instance.
---
You only need defense cap for a handful of specific encounters. In most cases you're gonna wanna be rocking as much threat gear as you can get away with. Sure sometimes you might die to bad rng crit + crushing but it's not worth gimping your entire raids dps
---
AKA. how guilds got warglaives week after week.
---
So deep. So sad too ):
---
The ruins of alterac with Mug'Thol and his elite ogres. Love that area as it feels secluded and its the local culmination of mob power foa that area.
---
You clearly forgot the winterspring and blasted lands elite areas. The blasted land one being the one with doom lord kazzak. 
---
I thought I saw some decent PvP gear like the Stormshroud stuff? There was one that looked great for rogues/cats. Lots of Crit &amp; Dodge with Stamina &amp; Agility. Also great energy perk!
---
Oh totes. Crafting consumables that are in high demand would result as such.
---
So, maybe the gear wouldn't benefit people's main characters who will already have wiped MC by the time I'm up there, but would they always be useful to gear up alts quickly? Is that a thing? 
---
Is Leatherworking good in TBC?
---
No. Phasing is when a questline changes the physical appearance of the world. 
---
Sharding does not include other servers. It’s when you split the current zone into multiple copies to even out the population level at high pop times. 
---
What you are talking about is CRZ. Cross-realm zoning. Ever heard of that? That is what involves multiple different realms. 
---
Change the boots and belt to Chromatic boots and onslaught girdle and it’s pretty accurate for most of vanilla
---
Because the usage patterns will be different. Shards are designed to scale horizontally (more shards) rather than vertically (more cpu/memory).
---
The only time they have issues if more players enter a single shard than normally permitted. In normal use retail performs exactly as they expect.
---
They should seek retribution
---
Because it's asking that many players not be allowed to play the game as it was intended just so a handful of idiots can relive what they think is nostalgic: Server crashes and lag and log-in queues.
---
It's *literally* gate-keeping. It's setting up some arbitrary barrier at the entrance of an experience that solely benefits a few. 
---
Yeah this. Imo is better to focus on what is more fun rather than what is the best investment of your time in a videogame.
---
Its a lot of fun to level with a crafting profession. You have things to craft while youre leveling to look forward to, and recipes are fun to collect.
---
You can also make a few key LW items that people want for other crafting recipes or quests like Hillman's Cloak or Green Leather Armor.
---
in fantasy setting sure is  
---
but dying to 1 hit in that same fantasy setting where you can fistfight bears is not  
---
I've come to appreciate that to be honest. I very much remember how BioWare handled the SWTOR development updates, in that we would see bits of news coming from them for every little thing in a large frequency, from new SFXes and the development of that, to stuff about classes and zones, all to hype hype hype-up the product, only to be very underwhelming relative to the hype when SWTOR was released. Maybe BioWare thought that that was a good strategy, or maybe they didn't have faith in their potential customers in keeping interest, but Blizzard's mindset has been much more fruitful to them.
---
Are there not item uses in WoW?
---
Where is that?  (What part of Winterspring)?
---
I never ventured much into the elite areas of Winterspring, or Blasted Lands in general.
---
Thanks for the comment. I hope to strike a balance between fun &amp; "not retarded" gameplay haha. I plan to level a shammy as a Dungeon tank, so perhaps some of it could fill the gaps? Like stamina gear where I need it? Hopefully my buddies play a druid, rogue, or hunter so gear can be allocated better!
---
the talon den in stonetalon peak is brutal
---
Thanks for the feedback. Is Shadow literally just PW:S -&gt; MB -&gt; SW:P -&gt; MF spam in classic? Sounds similar to TBC, but with a few less skills (SW: D, Shadowfiend, etc).
---
Was frost mage the standard leveling spec for classic mages? I just assumed it was fire for some reason.
---
Yeah I laughed at that too. Expect to get 2 hours per week for the first three to five months. And don't expect to do any dungeons or anything like that because when momma and baby need you it's time to drop everything and run.
---
Engineering is easily #1 because it's extremely good in PvP. Herbalism won't be that far behind though.
---
Hey Steven!
---
I would be interested as well. A good buddy and I are stoked to experience the classic servers once they come out! We both ended up getting mid 50's right as BC came out so we never actually raided (or even hit max level) in vanilla. Both of us did a small amount of raiding in BC and WotLK though so hopefully I'd pick it up relatively quickly. The raid times your looking at would work perfectly for me as well due to work time constraints and whatnot.
---
Most likely i'll be rolling a priest so keep me in mind if need another healer! 
---
Cheers
---
doesn't mulgore have some quests that are racelocked?  sounds like a bad idea 
---
Congrats on the baby, OP. Have you figured out what class he/she is yet?

Oh God the SWTOR buildup was insane

ffs take my upvote and get the fuck out

Gottem!

Is skinning in cat form a vanilla feature or added later? Because that seems like a natural choice for me.
---
high quality shitpost right here boys
---
Deadmines = The Goonies
---
Fairly obtainable because the paladins that dont pvp will usually pass in an effort to get a higher priority on better pve items like salamander scale pants, wild growth shoulders etc. Personally because MC and BWL will be so very easy and will be all we have for quite some time, I'll prioritize getting 8/8 t1 because protholy in full t1 is near impossible to kill 1v1, especially with resistance off pieces depending on matchup.

Too bad Classic won't have sporebats. [Those are the best pets if you want to top the damage charts.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhvvNGeHHME)
---
Leveling and pvp was kind of just standing there and making sure I don’t get locked out of the school that I was using and keeping up on my health until my mana was out and hopefully the other guy is dead before that. 
---
Mage for awhile is just a lot of frostbolt and novaing. (Assuming you’re not aoe farming which, personally, I find aoe farming to be a delight. It’s just challenging and irritating with competition). But I prefer the player control that mage offers while leveling. Kiting and using the 3 dimensions of the world is much more interesting to me than endless pulling but I have to be a tank with PW shield up all the time and a wand face tanking everything. When you get into your 30s as a frost mage, your time spent drinking will dramatically drop because you get big talents like shatter which will make your spells crit on frozen targets. It’s so much fun to use and see those big frostbolts and instants crit. 
---
While leveling though I admit my mage was on the surface quite a bit weaker than the priest in pvp. Engineering helps mitigate that somewhat though if you can keep up with it during the process. Escaping an unbalanced gank with mobility and winning a battle on my mage always felt more flashy and satisfying than face tanking and melting someone on the priest. I felt like my skills improved with the more time I spent practicing on the mage.
---
Again, fun is subjective but I enjoyed every experience with the mage more than priest. 
---
31 holy 20 ret is a very popular talent spec.

The new TBC private server's population is falling like a cliff and it's the best scripted server out there and it's falled after it got stable. TBC is the rose tinted glasses. Not Vanilla. WOTLK the one people love to hate (usually people who never cleared anything until WOTLK and want to act elitist)? Will hold up, because it did minigames WELL, where TBC completely failed at everything except raiding. I still think WOTLK sucks compared to Vanilla, but it will hold up. The amount of people who raided in Vanilla was not what people like to claim on this sub. There was a lot of other stuff to do. I had multiple friends that just did 5 mans, got blue pvp gear, some crafted, some bg rep rewards and were competitive all the way until they made the rank 14 gear honor gear that you could farm in a week. I had a friend in pvp blues on his rogue and Dal'rends who kicked the sh%# out of people all the way to Naxx in duels. You can't do that stuff in TBC, because it's when the game became a wannabe Everquest loot fest.
---
You are never going to even get people to do the heroics for preraid in their pre nerfed state in TBC, which means that you aren't doing the real hard content and prenerf raids, so what's the point? PVE is all TBC has (outside arena that has aged really badly with those classes). Look at Cata and all the reaction videos from people like Boogie2988 at launch. That's what happened when they tried to make Heroics like TBC again. Once you let the WOTLK ease out of the bag, people are never going back. Vanilla is different. They have other things they can do. 
---
TBC nutthuggers are like the small majority of people who said femshep was the only way to play Mass Effect. We got official numbers from Bioware and they were like 10 percent. They are just loud. Most did Kara on repeat and never even raided what the claimed.  They just want TBC to come out so they can do what they failed to do the first time around. Guess what? They still will never get out of Kara unless everything is nerfed.
---
Every TBC private population is pathetic compared to Vanilla or WOTLK. It will be an even bigger divide with retail players because the private server community is more hardcore than them. That's the funny thing. The expansion that is "you think you do but you don't" is the expansion that Brack helped design.
---
Came here to say that
---
that's about the time a paladin needs to ding 60
---
lol northdale usually has a population of 6-7k online at a time. this sub has 50k subscribers. that's nothing compared to the ppl that will come back to play classic. 
---
depending on how servers are split, there's almost no chance of pserver players affecting the economy. i'd expect the current youtubers to have way more effect.
---
Thanks for the info. Do you know if Snarler in Feralas also get nerfed? He used to have an absurd amount of spell resistance.
---
It's the blue dragonflight cave on the western border, south of Everlook.
---
Why was it overpowered? Lack of shadow resistance?
---
Lots of threads &amp; comments in this sub bring about things I didn't know. It's fun to learn these random things lol.
---
Would that mean Alchemy is #3?
---
He dealt shadow dmg, hence ignoring the armor of your target completely.
---
Basically it was unaffected by armor, which is something everyone has to varying extents. The lack of shadow resistance is just a bonus.
---
Yes, lack of shadow resistance. Since every other pet did physical, he had an advantage in pvp and most pve fights because he ignored armor and enemies rarely have more shadow resist than armor. But without that ability, he doesn't do anything special.
---
I love this system! I've never heard of it but I really like that players can use the loot for whatever they want and it treats everybody equally. 
---
nerfed as well. i think the only unique combat trait a pet could have was attack speed by the end of vanilla
---
The raid window would be 8PM to 1AM EST. Doesn't necessarily mean we will raid that late. Having a 6PM to 9PM window might actually be harder for most to make, believe it or not. Many people have kids and family time during this window.
---
I'll never recommend any of the high profile named animals to people. They are going to be a pain to get for quite awhile due to competition, unless it's like Kresh or something. If I roll a hunter I'm going to go with one of those apes from Feralas. Cool color scheme and they look funny/cute.
---
It would likely be weeknights, with the consideration to raid on Sunday nights as one of the nights. I will PM the discord to you.
---
I actually wouldn't know for sure, there's way more viable options that people pick up for various reasons past those big two.
---
Yeah, and you can only swap when out of combat.
---
Engineering will be go to for any min maxer. Usually with a gathering prof like herbing/mining/skinning. If ur strugglin for gold double gathering is good. Way too many people are gonna pick non gathering profs like bs and lw which you only need 1 of per guild and they arent very profitable. 
---
&gt; arena that has aged really badly with those classes
---
Could you elaborate?  My memory is fuzzy on the TBC arena scene as I wasn't that engaged in it (I played FotM RMP and got Duelist).
---
Kids family time and 9-5? Good luck getting people to raid without distractions. That’s obscene.
---
Yeah that sounds about right. School disciplinary systems are broken. They also tend to punish the people who defend themselves the same amount as the people who started the fight.
---
I am confused by your comment, but 9-5 is a generic term for people who work 9am to 5PM, not raid times.
---
lol ok
---
Okay, well if you live in EU I'd play on EU servers. Less lag and the time zone difference is huge.
---
I've had this image saved since nov 2007.  Can't remember where I found it.

Can't believe how much you guys are poo-poo ing this.  hahah.  
---
What makes classic hard is the relative power between the players and the NPCs.  While soloing if you pull a group of 3+ the odds that you will die is pretty high.  Even in a duo it isn't hard to pull 3-5 normal mobs in a mine or cave and end up dead.  The mechanics are simpler but you are just weaker than in later expansions because toolkit classes have in Classic is a lot smaller.  The time it takes to level up and travel is also a lot longer.  While dungeons and raids are pretty simple because the contents has less 'tricks' to evade damage.
---
Do you have anymore of these? Also nice MadSeason reference
---
I mean, according to this sub, EVERYONE will be using gathering professions. I could see a lot of people pairing things like mining/blacksmithing, then giving up on the blacksmithing part lol. It's just difficult and time consuming to progress your character level as well as your profession level. If you aren't on point, you'll outpace your crafting professions easily.

Have been in a guild that used this system. Really suits a guild all starting out in content together has no real negatives except you have to make exceptions for your MT if you want to progress quickly

There are TONS of rape unique pets out in the world. I forget the website but some googling can find you a long list of unique rare pets that you can tame.

Lupos in his pre 1.7 state is strait up broken lol that's why he's recommended so often. With bestial wrath he can strait up solo geared players
---
This. And attack speed really has very little difference - almost all casters have knockback talents and a fast attack speed is also worse in some cases, like vs high block.
---
Pyrewood Village all the way for me! Early &amp; difficult experience.

Thanks. I struggle with sarcasm.

What patch did they normalize pet attack speed? I thought that was during vanilla.
---
The friend zone.
---
Horde, yes. PvP, preferred. East coast, I'm central. I'm interested, not sure on class/role, but I'm flexible.
---
yeah soc and holy shock is actually dece in vanilla. theres an old pvp montage of taht build with the aq40 trinket one shotting 
---
&gt;except you have to make exceptions for your MT if you want to progress quickly
---
I think very few people would have any qualms about this realistically. The MT is usually the biggest no-life that plays the most and helps everyone out. That has to be the case for you to be MT in the first place.
---
In that case, pretty much no one can argue with gearing up the MT asap.

Vanilla is incredibly easy mechanically. The individual classes are far easier for the most part too with few exceptions. What makes vanilla more ‘challenging’ would be the road to 60, the preparation for the raid, the assembly and command of a guild, the countless hours of work outside of raids like recruiting and organization tha lead to a successful raid... Vanilla isn’t some magical game that couldn’t be improved on. The core game philosophies are what made vanilla great. It was simple and straight forward... an elite mob was elite. A raid was a raid and consisted of 39 other players. Gaining experience to level took time and lead to the player gaining actual in game experience... I’m less excited about Classic (and I’m very excited) than I am about new titles releasing with some of the core principles that used to guide developers in early MMO’s

Aww if only u were playing alliance =[ well if i change my mind a roll horde ill find ya =]

I agree with this perspective.

I’m sure some will not come from private servers but like 80% of that percentage is definitely going to do their homework going in. 
---
Why give yourself a second chance at something and not do it right. 
---
There is always a personal price to pay for a piece of loot, but you can do with it whatever you want.
---
Casual players have a chance at loot, and the more frequent raiders will get loot more often.
---
Hi, /u/warpiz
---
Haha I remember that bad boy.
---
Getting 40 people to work together and be in sync in encounters where a single person can wipe the raid is the real trick
---
I will send a PM!
---
No, you're a shill at this point.  
---
Some classes benefit from armor pen far more than others, it wasn't a matter of having abilities that penetrated armor naturally.
---
if 80% of your kit came up against armor and another class only 20% of their kit was affected by armor, you COULD logically decide the item was not for class 2.
---
pff
---
I remember one of the lead up quests which ended in molten core and the quest text literally stated you will need an army. I loved that feeling of inferiority.
---
I hit 60 in Vanilla farming those guys lol 
---
They never normalized attack speeds. They normalized pet run speeds.
---
Nah, it was normalized to 2.0 sometime during vanilla or bc.
---
No that was early BC, BT still had 1.0 attack speed in 1.12.
---
very easy to get but the set bonus isnt that cool. do you really want to auto attack a raid to give your raid group some passive heals? 
---
Nessingwarys camp in stv. Filled with elite player controlled units from the enemy faction.

TBC Arena worked because no one knew what they were doing. The people that had a focus macro  were "pros" and we ran odd comps the only really popular bracket outside the wannabe esport athletes was 2's.  Blizzard had to remove rewards from 2's to make people play 3's, like in their tournaments in later expansions. Anyways us playing mediocre comps/classes and specs started to change as WoW tried to become a esport and people saw that several things were broken when lined up well and also saw the specs the pros ran. So everyone just rerolled. 
---
2's was horribly balanced and always will be and TBC is no exception.  All this can never be repeated (TBC Arena) because people know what's broken now and there is nothing close to real balance in TBC because the game was never designed to work that way. In Vanilla we have a balance that kind of works because of consumables, trinkets, engineering. You can play chess with items on top of the classes. Without those? Vanilla is a mess in PVP to.
---
As WoW Arena got better, something happened, which the designers knew would happen, and why the original WoW leads said Arena was a mistake. Classes all eventually became so similar they almost all play the same now. You have your swifty, defensive, CC and do a whole lot of nothing outside those "goes". 
---
The streamers promote Arena and TBC being something to look forward to because it's easy content that they can control unlike Vanilla PvP. When they get it though they will just trash it and complain about the dead 3's bracket. Then they will play 2's and will complain about the small number of viable comps.
---
Arena also made something else pointless. BG's. It also led to AV being ruined because BG's were worthless for doing anything but farming honor to play the new SMALLER minigame that was made all that mattered. Healers also became broken in TBC and they remain broken until today. They are broken because they had to survive Mage Rogue CC chains along with priest or druid. Eventually all classes had to get CC like that. PUG BG's are dead in retail WoW because it's just not fun anymore. Don't have healers you lose. That was not the case in vanilla. I could queue with a few buddies, none of us a a healer and picking up pugs we could beat the Alliance premades often. Healers were balanced because the game wasn't designed around 3v3.
---
Like I said TBC sucks. I say this as someone who did almost exclusively arena in CATA/MOP.  I would say MOP is when arena was really good, but it's still bad for the game. Arena should simply be a seperate game. It killed raid participation, it ruined class uniqueness and fun factor and it took away from wpvp and the world and replaced it with more minigames or replaced larger minigames with small ones.
---
I'm pretty sure fury warriors actually stacked as much armor pen as they could get in WotLK.
---
Fake or not, it's funny as heck.
---
Pretty sure this wasn't a serious post.
---
There are rare LW recipes that are worth a fortune, like Hide of the Wild.

You can make a lot of gold with any crafting prof, as long as you have the rare recipes.
---
Yeah in Bc
---
If you were Orc would this be stronger than UF?
---
I don't see that.  And didn't say that.  The fact there is the lack of 'curse of nature' beyond thunderfury (and only -25 at that) is indeed a reality in vanilla.  And even if that problem were not a problem, it doesn't solve all of the rest of ele's issues. And ret is irrelevant - both in this conversation and in classic.
---
That doesnt change the fact that different private servers have wildly different values for resistance and armor in raids.  We have pretty good data on armor (and should be able to acknowledge some servers are making things harder on purpose) but resistance values are much, much harder to emulate accurately.  The data just doesn't exist.
---
And so private servers have to guess on resistance values.  Take them with a grain of salt.
---
You sound like a robot... \*unsure gaze\*
---
\*slowly walks away\*
---
It's fine. There's never any shortage of leather and there's an absolute shit ton of gear that's great to wear and sells well At all levels. Barbaric bracers, shadowskin gloves, dusky boots, heavy scorpid set, nightscape shoulders. I mean theres a TON of stuff. Anyone who says otherwise has never put in the effort. Or they're min maxers who think nothing exists besides the endgame. 
---
On a server of 12k active players without respawn values altered I was able to get Lupos and Brokentooth in less than 10 hours combined while competing with dozens of hunters on both factions in a PVP environment. It isn’t that hard... Very diplomatic, but not difficult.
---
Needed exalted?
---
It's a decent loot system for laid-back guilds, but nothing would ever replace a good loot council where the power is equally distributed to the class leaders who make the decision and the master looter/GM has only right to approve it. 
---
Just like DKP it's *weak* part is that the player who appears to be on the top takes the pieces he personally wants, but not the person which showed the best efforts/DPS/the item benefits the most.
---
Of course if you are playing non-meta spec or you're interested in obtaining some specific item you would not get priority at (Like DFT as hunter) then this system is great for you personally, but it's not the most efficient way to distribute loot in terms of global raid performance.
---
I also like that if you are already on the bottom its of no great consequence to take items that everybody else already passes on.
---
Are those BiS for Twinkers?
---
Lupos does more damage in a vacuum, but (depending on how Acti-Blizz devs do it in Classic) his attacks consumed Improved Shadow Bolt stacks and was thus a decrease in raid-wide DPS, even though it's more dps for the hunter in isolation.
---
I was in a hardcore guild in the earlier days of vanilla. I’m not sure if this was before damage meters, but my guild certainly didn’t know they existed. The guy screaming at us to DPS harder was a firestone warlock who would melee and was an officer. I didn’t know any better. As vanilla progressed and we got meters that same officer was eventually removed from the guild for poor performance in BWL progression. In the early days we didn’t know any better.
---
So are you just using Luna unit frames?  Explains why you see the resource/mana bar and the class colored bars.
---
enh/ele/ret/prot pally are all epic fail specs in pve 
---
Same experience from someone who got into raiding casually late in Vanilla. So I can verify these sentiments. 
---
Engineer as the top tier choice for both pve and pvp. Gathering proffs would be next. Then I assume alch/tailor for the transmute and cloth cooldowns.
---
I have lived in Australia most of my life,  I was born in the lag.  Molded by it.
---
It's absolutely massive under Duskwood. I'm going to explore the hell out of it come Classic.
---
I play on pservers and still don't think I've seen all of it.
---
I find cataclysm quest content (both 1-60 and 80-85) especially monotonous because of how it is designed.
---
In vanilla, every mob's location was hand placed.  Those designers put them there purposefully.  Mobs at a camp are posted in clusters.  NPCs are placed beside one another like they're chatting until you interrupted their day.  This design gave the world more character and provided better gameplay.  The lengthy TTL of mobs made facing more than one at a time a challenge.  Vanilla also had mobs of varying degrees of difficulty in an area.  Camps would have leaders that would throttle unprepared players.  Think of how memorable the Echo Isles starting area is thanks to Zalazane's tough camp of casters.  Many players formed their first group thanks to the difficulty of that area.
---
In cataclysm you do not encounter this design.  Mobs are all perfectly spaced apart like they've been procedurally laid out on an invisible grid.  You only ever aggro one at a time.  There are no patrols walking through an area to catch you unawares.  Furthermore, every mob follows the same template.  It doesn't matter if you're fighting a seagull or a sea giant, they will have the same HP and deal the same melee damage.  There is never a challenging moment to encourage grouping with another player.  The entire leveling experience is unforgettable when it could have easily been much better with a little more intentional design.
---
I don't disagree. But we didn't kick people because of that. We would just laugh at you when you were last in damage meters.
---
It only works for casual guilds.  Otherwise eventually, your good players will leave because they are not rewarded based on merit.  
---
I'm not familiar with that one.  Where in STP is that?
---
Or are you thinking of the one in 1K?
---
TBC is looked on so fondly because it was where a lot of players started.
---
It personally annoyed me that TBC got released. So much in vanilla is unfinished, I wish they had just expanded on this rather than shipping everyone off to Outlands.
---
Oh ok.
---
Also wasn't there one area that was friendly to alliance but not horde?  Huge mining cave.
---
OH YEAHH!!!!
---
Haha sick burn, my brudda
---
1. The strongest playstyle for a feral pvp druid is to ignore doing damage. You can kill a warrior or rogue very slowly by wearing them down in duels (as long as you have as good or better gear than them), but it's completely pointless in BGs. A pally/priest will come along and heal the warrior to full in 3 seconds even if you wear them down over 1 minute. What you are good at is running and surviving, and interrupting people from 30 yards with MF. These are all useful things, but no, you won't be killing people.  
---
2. Yes you can heal. All you really need is imp healing touch and reflection and you can raid heal with your healing gear set. HotW obviously helps a fair bit even so even though your missing some the good resto talents you can make do well enough.
---
Funny.
---
But...no.
---
I don't know anything about twinks, but there's a lot of good gear that sells well. Something doesn't have to be BIS for it to sell well. The majority of people aren't power levelers. They play casually and buy lots of upgrades along the way. I leveled it during late vanilla / bc on my shaman and that was my experience.
---
Sounds a good bit like my experience!  I was with a guild that definitely wanted to finish through Naxx, we had a solid and frequent schedule, and we had a lot of min/maxers.  But at the same time it wasn't a job, it wasn't a stress at all.  Everyone involved, ESPECIALLY the leadership, was dedicated to having fun.  This is a video game.  It's purpose is to entertain.  If we're not having fun, then there's no reason to play.  So as serious as we took it, it was because it was an investment not just in our character, but our team and in our fun.  The hard part about raiding is first, getting 40 people together.  And second, making those 40 people work as a team.  But that within itself is kind of magical, and at the end of the day, win or lose, boss down or up, if we learned and we had fun, THAT was a success, and our leader and officers made that abundantly apparent.
---
Yea all this is fine if you want to spend 2+ hours in MC and then really slog through BWL for 4 hours every week. 
---
If you want to down more than a few bosses in AQ40 though you need majority of you raid operating on a more efficient level. 
---
Everything becomes a lot easier when 40 people spec/gear correctly and spend a few hours farming consumes each week. 
---
I know what you mean. Seen a movie the other day and just thought to myself ‘2 hour movie? Could have just explained it to me in a book’
---
I agree 100%. We never had any realistic aspirations of getting through BWL. The people who did have those expectations moved on to better guilds.
---
I quit during TBC and can confirm that BIS was nit a term that I ever heard in vanilla or TBC.
---
I've never seen a "good" loot council, there's always grumbling and favortism and just weird choices. The reason people put up with loot council is it's often used by guilds who are making excellent progress, therefore as a member you're okay with the occasional bits of corruption because the rate of incoming loot is so much higher than the more casual guilds you still come out ahead.
---
Dude I got a full set when I was a clueless 15 year old playing on a super shitty 2nd-hand laptop that would crash flying into Ironforge &amp; on most boss fights. I believe you can overcome similar obstacles to become the shiny gold medallion you've always wanted to be!
---
it's a horde only quest at the top in the night elf area.  it's an extra large barrow den (maybe the biggest in the game? not sure) filled with elite mobs.  easy to get lost and if you die with respawns it's hard to resurrect 
---
Hardest part I would say is dispel, decurse, cleanse, maintain mana and health, threat management. moving coordination is rather static.
---
I raided early in Cata but most recently I did most everything Legion had to offer. Where raiding was fun in Legion most fights have some gimmick that has to be followed.
---
In some MC fights its like mages have to balance dps and decurse with decurse taking priority, or sheeping adds like in major domo fight. Warlocks will have to manage banishes on Garr instead of just becoming tunnel visioned....
---
I just feel like the difference being between vanilla and retail is tunnel vision. I recall alot of the poor players and even myself and good ones becoming to focused on meters or dps and forgetting to do the small stuff which not always lead to a wipe in retail... in vanilla the small stuff is more important and has a greater chance to lead to a wipe... but there aren't the gimmick mechanics (like breaking floors  [Fallen Avatar](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Fallen_Avatar) of ToS)
---
Sorry tried to explain it the best I could for you.(and others)
---
In a DKP system, a lot of items end up getting DE'd even though they'd be a massive upgrade for someone who can't afford to bid.
---
In a loot council system, the loot ends up going to gear an officer's 3rd alt, or the GM's "girlfriend."
---
The majority of people that defend loot councils were either never in a loot council guild (the vast majority) or were part of their guild's council (the smaller majority).
---
A minority of them were in top tier progression guilds with good loot councils (which still typically are full of drama).
---
Loot council may sound good in theory, but in practice systems with no room for human error are often better.
---
I believe they also stated it was becoming difficult to balance more complicated raids when both factions had different comps.
---
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9yt514/world_of_warcraft_classic_census_and_demographics/) is the survey many people did about a month ago. It will show you what percentage of people are planning to pick certain professions.
---
I dunno. The cloor scheme doesn't look clown-like enough.
---
This was basically my experience as well. By now people know that fire resist gear is only necessary on the tanks and really only for Rag so that's not going to be an issue.
---
if the best playstyle for feral druid is to not damage people why not go balance? 
---
Putnam NY. You live in the booniee
---
Lots of MC and ZG while getting no loot, hahaha. -_-
---
At least you be able to net a bit of money from curing rugged hides on cooldown. Like a barbarians version of arcanite transmute. 
---
From a healer PoV, unless you need def cap go with Immovable Object. More threat=more DPS
---
I can attest to this as well. During Vanilla I raided semi-casually 2 times a week for ~3 hours a time as an OT in MC, AQ20, ZG and parts of BWL. I was pretty young (14), hardly used consumables, only relevant addon used was DPS/Threat meters, and people were totally fine with that. By the time our raid composition of three different guilds disbanded, I was in almost full T1 + few T2 + other epics. These were the most fond times of WoW for me.
---
I would like people to remember that the tryhard attitude of many in this sub will not be relevant to 90% of Classic's population, even though information about the game is much more abundant these days.
---
At least you'll have refining deeprock salt on cooldown as a barbarians version of arcanite transmute. Will net you a bit of money. 
---
Back in the days I was a bit hardcore and made it even into NAXX (Thaddius). All of us were certain that even if we killed him we would never ever get past the 4 Horsemen in lack of enough perfectly! equipped tanks. 
---
I quit many years later and I definetely plan to come back to classic. 
---
From today perspective I am sure that many people will quit before lvl 60 because the experience will be very different from todays mmos which are very streamlined and very dumbed down. Running very long distances until lvl 40, not many fast travel options, no group finder, quite hard elite mobs...  I am looking forward to that experience but I think it is not for everyone...
---
Raiding bwl and above with 40 people is another story...
---
I was in the top raid guild on my server... I tanked as an arms warrior.
---
Nobody gave a shit about debuff limits.
---
Very few people used any consumables outside of some basic stuff like mana pots.
---
Almost none of this private server bs ever happened on live.
---
The fundamental problem with loot council, lets say for a second you had a 100% fair loot council that distributed loot as justly as possible, fully taking into consideration raid performance, supporting the guild outside of raids, optimality of gear for class, all that good stuff. You would STILL have an issue because you're distributing finite resources to a 40-60 person roster. When those people don't get a drop, they're going to imagine all manner of drama, disagree, talk shit during raids in tells. It will eat away at your guild.
---
DKP, Suicide Kings, EPGP, sure they all have their problems, but one that they don't have is that they remove arbitrary human decision from the equation. You can't complain about something not being "fair" because you knew the rules going in, and as long as guild leadership enforces the rules, nobody has grounds to complain and they know it.
---
This is World of WARcraft.  I will use my pots in a duel, I will kill lowies, and I will bubble hearth if I get below 10%.  I might be a dishonorable dog in the eyes of the horde... but to my country and my family - I AM A HERO'S HERO!
---
I'm absolutely ok with playing as full support at BGs and raids.
---
As i say, i was worrying only about wPvP and duels.And what about stats prioritization, for pvp and pve?
---
"Everyone i disagree with is alt right"
---
I literally didn't even know there were debuff limits until after Vanilla haha. I'm not sure anyone in my guilds knew either, or else they didn't care.
---
They checked the box for vulgar language. Clearly admins were horde.
---
Well balance has it's own problems and is generally considered even worse. MF is moonfire. 
---
Alcaz island 
---
Moonfire
---
Much better than DKP which is very overrated and usually slows progression
---
As a NAXX veteran I can confirm that for about 90% of the encounters. Getting resistances and consumables wS quite demanding. Just try it out!
---
He defines it slightly different than I do (he's mainly looking at elite areas with at least one quest, where I'm looking at elite areas or isolated areas with a large number of quests).
---
If you want easy BiS you want classes that aren’t represented strongly in raids. DPS warriors are many in a raid and also have to contend with rogues for certain rings, trinkets, weapons, and leather armor pieces. But there are usually few druids and hunters (maybe 3 of each if you’re in a non-optimized group)
---
Druid is always a good choice in terms of getting geared. Feral might take you some time for all the BiS in MC and BWL (some of it is shared with rogues or maybe other offspec classes might want it). There are still good dungeon and world drop options for feral, but it can take some time. But resto is a cake walk. I did a MC a few weeks ago on a certain server and a Druid in the group walked in without purples and left with 5 or 6. Plus there are some really good gear options in general from PvP faction rewards. Really fun class for PvP (can make useful unique specs that strengthens multiple aspects of your toolkit. Not a preferred PvE choice, but fun all the same).
---
Otherwise Hunter is pretty good too. Usually not too many. The tier pieces are pretty good and the weapons you need are usually just for you and your brethren. 
---
Except it was Cairne who made the case for the Forsaken and convinced Thrall to bring them into the Horde in the first place. Probably because he took pity on their plight.
---
For all they've gone full Snidely Whiplash in retail, and despite the intro cinematic stating their joining the Horde was merely "an alliance of convenience," it's important to remember a lot of the content in-game painted the Forsaken as a thoroughly tragic people. Most of them had nothing to do with Sylvannas' and/or the Royal Apothecaries' scheming; they were just average Lordaeron citizens who'd been violently cut down by the Scourge then raised into a hellish un-life. Having finally broken free of the Lich King's control, they find themselves hated and hunted by what remains of their own people and their former allies simply for being what they are - which is something they never asked for in the first place.
---
Hell, even Sylvanas got a note of this in TBC with The Lady's Necklace quest.
---
I think it's perfectly in keeping with the character of the tauren that Cairne was the only one to see past the horror of their existence to the tragedy underpinning it. I think he understood better than anyone that the Forsaken were perched on a knife's edge and could all too easily fall back to the evil of their origins, and I think he was hoping the Thrall's Horde could help guide them in the other direction.
---
The Forsaken are a people irrevocably scarred by their past and looking for a way to move forward in a world that hates them simply for being what they are. If *anyone* should understand that, it should be Thrall. Fortunately, he had Cairne there to poke him in the ribs and remind him.
---
Alchemy is pretty great. The herbs for pots are cheaper than the pots and unlike crafted gear people consume a lot of pots.
---
 Craft a man a fishskin tunic and he'll have it for a lifetime. Craft a man a fish and he'll be hungry in 30 min.
---
Oh yes, that would be great!
---
You literally said that steady shot fixed the scaling issue, or do you have amnesia? You also said their pvp rotation was the same in pve and pvp. I won't answer any more of your stupidity until you learn to read what you wrote yourself
---
Hmm... That's unique.
---
Demons were being actively hunted by the horde from what I recall, the few leaders who remained weren't even close to the most powerful who joined archimond in hyjal. The feel that they were a lurking, broken power was absolutely perfect following wc3.
---
haha are you kidding me burning crusade is way better then wotlk 
---
Healers are easily the most active class in raiding imo; they have to manage mana while helping to keep track of the hp of the 40 members in the raid. I'm not sure which healing class would be the most active of the bunch but I'd guess either Priest or Pally.
---
Someone must have added a digit it. 105 days is half the year, I'd assume they would just expel him instead.
---
Warriors can do DPS at a high level once the OTing is over.  Ferals can't.  
---
Let them que up for the fixed pets while you go after the uberleets
---
The PvP set and the PvP rep pieces are really good, they are just a ton of all stats. For PvE just wear whatever you can find with the most intel/+healing you can - cloth/leather is fine.
---
Vanilla was a logistical challenge instead of an arcade challenge.
---
Naxxramas was very difficult. Nihilum needed every possible world buff (including hakkar) for every attempt on KT, and that was a minimum for the fight to be possible. There's obviously a limited number of times you can get that buff per week so that meant a lot of planning was involved before each attempt.
---
Yup! Sunwell plateau - OMG!
---
I hope they don’t do any of this progressive itemisation nonsense in classic or pet progression 
---
Loot council is as bad or as good as you make it. That's why I specifically mentioned "distributed power" type of loot council, where even the GM can't take the item unless the respective class leader nominates him for that. My guild also kept a spreadsheet where the attendance/consumables/amount of BIS items/date when the last item was obtained, so any loot council decision had it's own objective base.
---
This made any kind of any explicit favoritism and shady stuff nearly impossible. But a lot of guilds which implement "loot council" never care about this stuff and all the decisions are made based on some guy's opinion.
---
Dbw baby
---
I know this isn't what you're asking, but I would argue outside of raids mages are probably the most active, useful and skill dependent classes there are. That goes for in dungeons, in PvP, and in solo play. It's wack that they're so lame in raids, but you have to remember that raids are only one aspect of the game.
---
To answer your question, feral druid DPS comes to mind as "active." The rotation is more complex than most classes and requires a firm understanding of class mechanics. Unfortunately it requires a decent amount of farming. Plus you will probably be called on to heal certain fights that don't favor melee DPS (like Shazz in MC). Clearly, melee DPS and healing in the same raid is a pretty wide range of activity.
---
Otherwise, I agree with the other post, you probably want a priest. They have the widest toolkit and have to know when to use which parts of it in different encounters. Pallies (while supper effective) are kinda stale to play as far as I understand. A lot of spamming and buffing for pallies.
---
The other option, of course, is tank or warrior DPS. Either role quires you to do a lot of managing and understanding of each fight. And DPS warriors might even be called to tank, which would expand their role.
---
I remember as an armor pen stacking warrior that my guild gave the Deathbringer's Will to a blood dk. I've never ragequit a guild harder in my life.
---
To this day, it still makes me a sodium elemental thinking about it.
---
Very true.
---
Better to have a clear, non-arbitrary system that is completely transparent for everyone.
---
Mfw
---
&gt; There are TONS
---
&gt; Mentions only Lupos
---
Fake or not, I audibly laughed out loud on that one. I need a fake video made of some kid doing exactly this in a classroom. Would make my year!!
---
I disagree. I don't want my character's loot progress to be decided by somebody else, even if they have the best intentions. I want a completely transparent, rule based, non-human system like this post describes. If you value progression, your description might be ideal, but progression isn't everything for everyone. 
---
3 month server transfers, no PVE-&gt; PVP and no faction changes. That's not 'easily'.
---
I think this has to do with the “we don’t want to run 2 MMOs.” They’re trying to transfer everything into a new system with modern and sustainable templates. Perhaps they could call upon the assistance of the Current Wow team if needed if it’s set up a way familiar to them. 
---
I can confirm this too... 
---
I leveled a few alts during TBC and the easiest way to get into Kara was to farm a few pvp items so you could tell potential groups “have some epics” 
---
Even though pvp gear was poo because it was missing a stat. 
---
Oh my god...
---
who's it made by.. there's your answer. 
---
I can relate about everything in the OP, well said. And I even cleared some bosses in AQ40 with one of my guilds. Still the same behavior described.
---
This thread and the answer shows a big sample of players on this subreddit that are silent. Pservers players and hardcore players are probably in higher number here, but I would bet a lot that most players in Classic are gonna be casual / chill / non elitist players.
---
KT better have his proper voice acting, none of this WotLK throat cancer crap.

reckoning stacks reset on weapon switch. holy/reck is an epic fail bud im sorry
---
also fear/sheep/blind/scattershot reset reck stacks.
---
That actually sounds pretty encouraging. Somewhat matches my memory of it, but I played very little Vanilla, towards the end of it, and was thinking that my experience may not reflect reality. Good to know there was still a place for the casual raider back in the day. 
---
Where's the lion heart helm though??
---
Sodium elemental lmao that's gold
---
I was in a casual raiding guild for half of Vanilla, after having been an officer in a hardcore raiding guild that ultimately collapsed when we got stuck on Rag. I much enjoyed the casual approach even though the progression was much slower.
---
&gt;There was a lot of pressure to get fire resistance gear so we could progress in MC. We went as far as having fire resistance gear checks. 
---
We never even did fire resistance checks.  Over time people picking up enough MC gear negated the need for specialized fire resists gear outside the tanks. We cleared all the way through BWL and into AQ40, when we started to have to get tougher on gear checks for nature resists.
---
&gt;But I was NEVER told that I had to upgrade my normal gear. Before I had my epics, I had a random assortment of blues that were certainly not all BiS. In fact, I never even heard the term BiS until after vanilla. No one cared if your gear was as good as possible. 
---
My guild didn't care either.  However, we did like to spam healing/DPS meters and we had plenty of competition with each other, which resulted in a lot of gear farming so we could one-up each other.
---
Casual raiding guilds are fun because A) the encounters are difficult because you're under geared, B) you don't have to spend that much time focusing on raiding and prepping for raids, and C) the game seems more like a game and less like a job.
---
At what? Raiding? I said it was good for raiding ONCE. How is is fun to do again? I ran all those heroics so many times I never want to run them again. I ran those raids. I did those stupid dailies. I'm with Kungen who was the tank/leader of he top guild for all the non Activision expansions. Everything past Vanilla is bad.

Focus on raiding actually became a curse as he said. When they catered to that small demographic and the even smaller demographic of autistic people who think MMO PVP should be a esport (and I was one of those idiots at one point), the game got ruined. I'm not saying it's all Blizzard's fault either. Loudmouths on forums are just as responsible asking for idiocy like arena. A lot of the mistakes was catering to what they thought was the majority.
---
TBC had too much difference in gear level, too many raids and too big a gear carousel, that isn't even worth it for pvp players because resilience was stupid. At everything else? It's a really bad MMO. World PvP doesn't exist. Community was awful outside your guild and non existent and cross realm BG's also added to this. TBC had the precursor to LFD, it's just most people didn't use it because the heroics were so darn hard at first. No Wintergrasp to try to make up for lack of wpvp. It was flawed, but at least something similar. Not alt friendly at all. Small world that sucks compared to old Azeroth and made smaller due to flying. Dailies that are done by zombies that suck to try to make up for the fact they killed organic content that happened on the way to dungeons without flight or farming in the world.  Again I'm not saying WOTLK is a great MMO, it just does all these dumb minigames better than TBC. 
---
Vanilla WoW was more than just a PVE raiding game. TBC isn't. It's small, limited and shallow.
---
Pally:
---
- 1) Put Flash of Light on bar in #1 spot.
---
- 2) Target Tank
---
- 3) Press 1
---
- 4) See 3
---
I planning to be all out in classic as well. Not sure what class or faction I'll be, but we should stay in touch if you'd be down to raid again. 
---
My brother raided throughout most of vanilla as a hunter, and was working with a melee build in the latter stages and somewhat into TBC. Even with less damage, he brought consumables and knew the fights well enough, so nobody cared about his lesser spec.
---
My casual raiding guild got BWL on farm.  Razorgore took us 2+ months, but once we'd gone through that fire we downed a new boss every week and only spent 2 weeks working on Nef.  It's very doable. 
---
&gt;I just mentioned how their rotation is not the same, and it is actually more similar in pvp.
---
So you say they're not the same... but the pvp rotation is more similar? To what then? Cause in the same sentence you say they're not the same? Is it more similar to itself? Cause that doesn't make any sense. How am I even meant to argue against statements like this?
---
You're just writing off your own inability to word yourself properly on me at this point.
---
&gt;and now it isn't that the pvp and pve rotations are similar, it that there is too much empty time...
---
The **damaging abilities used** (not rotation, please don't even suggest there is such a thing as a PvP rotation) are very similar in PvP to PvE. And that's because none of their abilities outside of Aimed shot requires hunters to be standing still, and the inherent ~4 seconds of literally doing nothing can easily be used to cast spells that are highly effective in PvP.
---
Hence, again, the damage output of PvP and PvE is similar. The solution to this problem is to add good damage options for the Hunter to use in that time that they're just sitting there picking their own noses in PvE. And to that, we arrive at steady shot, an ability that you can spam the everliving shit out of in PvE but not PvP.
---
Scaling is not and will never be the solution to the problem of PvE scaling because it CANNOT solve that problem without unbalancing PvP. However, YES, stuff like pets and arcane shot should still scale! I never denied that, what I denied is your idea that that lack of that scaling is what caused their PvE scaling problems.
---
&gt;you have been really smug
---
You should feel blessed that I've replied to this borderline trolling for this long to be fair.
---
One of my guilds actually cleared to Chromaggus, but it was kind of a cheat, so I didn't count it. We had 10-15 people join us from a guild that already had BWL on farm. But I was doing BWL with blue gear, so I totally believe you that it was doable for a casual guild.
---
I never saw an issue with DKP.  Not sure why all the hate for it.
---
Similar experience here, although we were probably a little less casual - cleared BWL eventually, did a few bosses in AQ40 right before TBC. We did "make" off-specs heal, because we were always short on healers and typically had too many pure DPS ready to raid. You had to care at least a little bit about gear, you weren't going to get invited in full greens. Consumables were only for major boss attempts, and certainly not enforced. You would get more raid invites if you were more prepared though.
---
To me there's a line, too casual and raids will be very slow and boring: infrequent boss kills, waiting on unreliable guildies constantly, tons of wipes. But I'm also not going to spend all my free time farming consumables for every attempt and getting perfect blue "BiS" for before MC. I'll be aiming for a guild that knows their stuff, but doesn't no-life everything.
---
Activision should make no changes to the game, they lack talent and creativity.
---
I would have been classified as a "Hardcore" Raider in Vanilla -top guild on our server &amp; cleared everything in Naxx.
---
We raided 3 times a week for 2-3 hours each. We did restrict specs to their "best" role (priests/paladins/druids healed etc) with the exception of warriors. (i want to say we had 5 warriors - MT,OT, and 3 31/5/15 arms(i think that was the popular spec). This just made raids smoother and easier to do. 
---
For reaching T2.5 and T3 raiding, it's less a commitment of individual time, but rather finding 39 other people who are willing to grind it out together, at the same times, for an extended length of time. The biggest setbacks in raiding, which are especially true in Vanilla, are not having that consistent number. Teaching and gearing new people takes time.   
---
For Casual raiding guilds it hits doubly hard. If a raid slot of a "Hardcore" guild needs to be replaced, they're going to be looking to poach from the next tier down. Casual guilds have to contend with both losing people through attrition/acts of god/etc AND through being poached. 
---
The turnaround of people overall is the greatest detriment to Raid Progression IMO - not purely individual time.
---
Most shadow priest BiS is tier 2.5 (AQ40) instead of Naxx.
---
One problem is the players who would refuse minor upgrades to stay on top for that one piece they've always wanted. In the end raid dps could suffer 
---
Replace ”ganking” with mugging and ”PVP server” with East Harlem NY and you got yourself a real argument there. 
---
Just stop rationalizing and making excuses, makes you look like a coward. 
---
Thanks to being stuck on Razorgore for so long everyone had pretty much a full T1 set by the time we started progressing in BWL.
---
This style actually enables both the casual and the hardcore to do challenging raids without tweaking the same raid into a harder mode. I hope the snubbery and elitism that were present in private servers don't carry on to Classic.
---
i think bgs are still super fun in tbc, especially without the premade autism and people are just playing to have fun mostly. and im not all about that esports crap either but as someone who loves dueling outside cities i find going into arenas pretty fun, at least as a low rated player i had fun doing it. whenever i play wotlk server its always the same crap. hit level 80 and then do some joke heroics and then do icc. i know you can still do old content for "fun" but lets be real we dont go strip naked at level 60 and run deadmines. in tbc i feel like the things in the game matter while in wotlk it all feels invalidated. 
---
i agree it sucks how they made it so tbc was sort of its own seperate game. it was just outland and everything in vanilla didnt matter anymore. and cross realm bgs? i think thats poo, but sadly 1.12 had it too and it might be in classic.
---
but dungeon finder? come on man that thing was just an interface, it has a similar name and icon and thats about it. you actually have to invite people to group and go to the dungeon or at least get summoned. and its people on your own server. people on vanilla servers have an addon that pretty much works the exact same thing as that tbc lfg and no ones ever complained about it breaking any social aspect. 
---
Isn't the zg serpent the best hunter pet after lupos .?
---
I'd once pitched something like this to my guild way back in the day (BWL might have been out), except everyone had a set amount of points that could be used to queue up for different items, which were assigned point values. In my opinion, it was nice because it allowed you to make an informed decision on what to queue up for based on what you wanted and how long the queues are, instead of being put on the spot in the middle of the raid while you figure out whether you should hold out for that Azuresong Mageblade or take the Staff of Dominance right now. I've forgotten a lot of details over the years but it was pretty slick, if I do say so myself.
---
We never implemented it (or really finished fleshing it out) because it rewarded people that looked at what could drop and make decisions prior to the raid. They were pretty casual and admittedly SK is a much better system for a casual raid.
---
&gt; Casual guilds have to contend with both losing people through attrition/acts of god/etc AND through being poached. 
---
Oddly my casual guild didn't have this issue. Our raid schedule was limited enough that it attracted people who didn't have time to play more so it was very rare that people would get geared up and move on.  Honestly, we spent more time screwing around and PvPing than we did raiding or prepping for raids.
---
I'm going hunter as my main but I was thinking of making an alt to play with my girlfriend and less competitive buddies just to mess around and do dungeons, world pvp, helping out with quests etc.
---
I will probably not raid on this character as I don't want to outgear them making content "too easy". 
---
Things I'm looking for:
---
* Not having to respec all the time.(fill multiple roles with one spec)
---
* Being alright at dungeon level gear.
---
* Decently fun to play.
---
* Class mechanics not being too clunky, such as shaman totems.
---
* Party utility.
---
* Synergetic with warlock, mage and priest.
---
I'm thinking either Druid or Paladin as being able to fill any role would be nice but I'll probably play whichever class fits these criterias the best.
---
Any suggestions? 
---
STAR WARS GALAXIES
---
I'm debating switching.  I played alliance for half of Vanilla wow until the guild I'd helped build collasped in a very messy manner and then rerolled horde on a different server.  People I'd played with for well over a year lost their shit over that guild implosion.  Really put a sour feeling to my entire experience.
---
I had a lot more fun playing horde than alliance, but I was also more experienced and found a better guild.  However, I enjoyed the quests more on the alliance side(Jail break is awesome), the ascetics are better(Fuck the UC) and the people who are returning to wow with me will probably want to roll alliance.
---
I was on scarlet Crusade! My bud was in the warrior one! I miss Scarlet Crusade. Hope they bring it back in classic.
---
Now the one thing I have to comment on is that we don't know what it is going to be like on classic. Players have changed and so have their mentalities. There will surely be guilds that don't care much about gear and stuff but I suspect that the mayority of players and guilds will expect people to have a certain understanding of their class and the encounters.
---
So ultimately the past experiences aren't going to be worth all too much. Private servers show this pretty clearly. 
---
Yes!
---
that's why I said I'm not fun at parties
---
&gt; Sodium elemental lmao that's gold
---
Actually it's salt. 
---
I think you're probably right, but private servers are also a biased sample. As other people have discussed, the majority of casual players don't go out of their way to play on a private server. It will be interesting to see how it goes in Classic.
---
Hearthglen is in WPL.
---
Yes, I'm so blessed to have some dork who unironically uses "foolhardy" in a sentence try to flex his lack of knowledge on me. I admire the high self esteem you have at least, jfc
---
BRUTAL!
---
I originally was going to roll solo alliance since that's what I currently am. However since some of my old WoW buddies are replaying I might go back to my roots of the Horde where I started.
---
It's cool too, the NPCs are all human during daytime but turn into Worgen at night. Whether Arugal engineered them so they'd automatically turn at night or if it was retconned for gilneans to turn at will I don't know tho, but it's pretty cool nonetheless.
---
Why would anyone put paladins on tank healing when there are druids and priests with a 2.5sec cast heal... Paladins are raid healers in Vanilla.
---
If you're going to be doing leatherworking or Blacksmithing, don't expect to be able gear yourself using it.  It just doesn't work out that way.  
---
Now as a way to make money or help out your guild it can be useful.  When I leveled my hunter I did skinning/mining to 60, farming up the mats for my black dragon set and another hunter named Rocktar who had farmed the plans crafted it for me.   I was quite grateful to him. After which I dropped skinning and leveled engineering.
---
Yeah his videos are amazing, frostadamus too
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPlnHw7MfME
---
although it isn't shown in the stats, that thing also granted you +500 mmr to your arena rating as a warrior. 
---
Without a doubt!
---
However - Alliance also had longevity on the map. The Tauren were nomads until Cairne set up Thunder Bluff and the Troll tribes have been crab-bucketing each other since they squirmed out of the primordial ooze. 
---
One of the things that most enraptured me back in the days of classic was that the world didn't seem so much about balance as it was about being true and believable. You found quests where it made sense to find them rather than where they were convenient etc. (Well mostly... one of the exceptions of the Alliance's Scarlet Monastery quest in Desolace; that motherfucker is FAR afield).
---
Everything you typed can be applied to my hardcore raiding guild up until Nefarian. We got some very early EU kills, Ragnaros top 10 atleast and we were very early in BWL as well. I'm not trying to brag, i'm just trying to make a point which i will get to.
---
We had ferals in MC that eventually realized feral was shit so they went healing. We had rets that realized that, they were just healing all the time anyway so they went healing. All the rogues had pvp specs, all the priests had pvp healing spec(some tri spec with 20ish pts into shadow for silence) the only difference i guess was that they kinda figured that "this spec is shit, even if its fun so ill just change to something that helps us progress".
---
Nothing was really mandatory, rogues didn't use Slice and Dice at all, we all used evis. We thought attack power was shit, we were all stacking crit. Also though hit was shit, we didn't want that, only crit. We all just raided to get gear to pvp really, so everyone, including our MT was pvp specced. This got us to about Nefarian where we hit a brick wall and had to start doing some research into wtf we were doing, and not surprisingly we did many many things completely wrong.
---
After then we started demanding proper PvE specs and whatnot and turned what you would call a true hardcore raiding guild. My point is that everyone was like that for a long time. Meme specs, shitty specs, weird gear choices etc. I guess the biggest differnce in my guild vs yours was that the meme specs sorta just respecced on their own and we raided 5 times a week.
---
Career horde player since vanilla, I made 1 alliance character to 70 on a 5x XP BC private server almost a decade ago.
---
With a restart, I'm tempted to keep playing horde but... it could also be cool to see the game from a totally different light. I've pretty much never done anything in redridge, dun morgoh, wetlands, duskwood, darkshore; and my only experiences of stocks and deadmines are from the LFG days. It would be neat to try out a totally different quest progression, with new cities and towns. 
---
That and the only RP-PvP raiding guild I've seen recruiting in NA so far is alliance, so there's that.
---
&gt;There were maybe two guilds in my faction who made any actual progress in Naxx.
---
Were you on a low pop/med pop server? Because on Blackrock where I played there was at least 5-10 guilds on Alliance alone that killed at least one boss. My guild wasn't even that guild comparatively and we cleared Spider wing. 
---
Of course, which kinda makes this post silly as the times have changed. It's not like we are all going to forget what 'meme spec' or 'BIS' once classic drops
---
Which worries me, because one of the biggest issues with modern WoW is how elitist people are about DPS, gearscore, and achievements. That's fine if you're going to be in the top 1% of hardcore raiding guilds, its always been that way for them, but otherwise, it's silly to expect your teammates to worry about min-maxing every stat with consumables and obscure gear. 
---
He won't be nerfed, he already is nerfed. 
---
Just ask a druid to mt if you need threat at the expense of def cap.
---
I'll have to try and farm some stuff to help gear some people or alts. I noticed some good healing &amp; fire resistance gear that could help speed up the process for people to get into MC
---
&gt;My bud was in the warrior one! I miss Scarlet Crusade.
---
One of my friends was in it too. :3 and yeah. was a fun place.  I can't remember if any of my friends were in the paladin one. I doubt it. but who knows. \o/
---
Holy shit I never even knew that
---
I think you need to relax a bit buddy.
---
Its not about reliving what a couple of idiots deem nostalgic, its about the feeling of urgency and the spectacle it is to see so many people gathered to do just the same thing, kick off a game they have been looking forward to for a long while.
---
I feel like you are looking at it from an extremely binary way in which it is either only good or only bad, im attempting to explain to you how something which could be perceived as bad still holds merit. 
---
Also calling it gate keeping still makes zero sense 
---
Bind it to scrollwheel so you dont even have to press a key.
---
Whoops, yeah. Mixed up the locations of Hearthglen and that High (our Blood?) Elf lodge in northern EPL.
---
I had a similar experience in vanilla. We had several people raiding with pvp specs or off-meta specs (enh shaman, spriest, feral druid offtank, etc) and even most who had the "right" spec were in greens and blues (not even 60 blues but like blues from Scarlet Monastery) and/or didn't know how to play well. I played a hunter and frankly wasn't very good myself, but I was always in the top 5 on the damage meter, well above most of the mages/locks/rogues who should have outdpsed me easily.
---
We only had two people with experience beyond MC: the raid leader, who had cleared BWL and was progressing in AQ40 with another guild and was basically leading our group out of pity because he was friends with the officers; and a spriest who also raided BWL in another guild and came with us because they wouldn't let him dps on his priest and he wanted a break from healing.
---
It was slow going, but we cleared MC, Ony, ZG, and AQ20. I think most of the raid had no idea how "bad" we were and were happy with what we accomplished. When I got Rhok'delar that was a big deal to me and I felt like I'd beaten the game even though there were three entire raid tiers I hadn't seen.
---
Faster attack speeds means more chances on crit, means more damage. For bm hunters it has a LOT of difference.
---
sure thing. I struggle to understand what you gain from attempting to convince me anything blizzard does is able to improve on classic wow, I dont think they should be let within a mile of it in terms of balancing anything. Leave it as is and deliver to the people its intended for, or change it up and noone is happy in the end. 
---
Sounds like you wanna play retail way more anyway, so why would it bother you?
---
It really does help getting people into the MC.  It always feels good to help people out.
---
Make sure that you yell “BECAUSE THATS HOW IT HAPPENED TO ME!!!”
---
As is tradition.
---
Sorry not sorry
---
I already do it perfectly well. 
---
Nothing they could do would improve classic. Don’t assume my opinion, you only make yourself look the fool 
---
Doable. I would forget alts though as just getting to 60 with a job and young child? That could take you a year!
---
Agree
---
Isle of Dread is my pick. It's the island west of the coast in Feralas, south of Feathermoon Stronghold. It's largely been forgotten about, and newer players have never seen it as it sank like Atlantis during the sundering. Lord Lakmaeran, the lord of the chimaeroks and largely all other mobs on the island were only involved in one questline, the scepter of the shifting sands. They also exclusively dropped the meat required for Dirge's Kickin' Chimaerok Chops, the best vanilla tank buff food. You basically neededa holy trinity party to do the questline and farm the meat, that's how tough that place was.  
---
    
---
On retail, past the sundering, Lord Lakmaeran's son - Prince Lakma, can be found between Silithus and Feralas, and he bears the title  &lt;The Last Chimaerok&gt; 
---
... nice meme
---
I think we were low pop. My server may have been an outlier. 
---
We realized it on vael and used it to cheese him. That debuff the tank gets that blows him up, when there's 8 debuff slots u can just use priest mind vision x8 and it kicks the debuff away from the tank. So nobody died on vael since the priests just MV:d the bomb thing away.
---
You’re still describing a controlled situation. Having the entire population cap of a server in the same starting zones *smoothly* is *not* how Classic ever launched. 
---
So what you’re describing is a smooth launch which can realistically only happen with crazy log-in queues or sharding. 
---
So I guess you’re waxing abstractly about one of those two situations?
---
I'll keep up the good work ;)
---
There is cosplay and cosplay 8D 
---
Of course we won't forget it, but a large portion of the people coming back will hopefully dismiss it as nonsense. I truly hope it doesn't become like retail where you can't get a raid spot without full BiS gear.
---
Of all the comments that talk about No change i think this speaks the most. In My opinion i would let blizzard change Vanilla But not Activision.
---
That's the joke. 
---
Becasue it reward slackers as much as the better players that put in more effort...
---
Oh there was elitism allright. I can admit to being an elitist asshole in vanilla, i was young i guess is my excuse. But they were about different things. This whole "use every consumable in the game is mandatory" though certainly NEVER happened in vanilla. I remember when Death and Taxes said that to get worldfirst 4h they used flasks on every raid member, that was just mind blowing at the time. Nobody had done that, that was just... insaaane commitment. And then Nihilum topped that by flasking for everyone  on KT AND using an Onyxia buff, we hadn't even thought of that and we only had 3 bosses left in Naxx! That was like, nolife mega tryhard holy shit that is such dedication we all thought.
---
On private servers now they fucking Onyxia and ZG buff for a BWL run with every consumable in the game. I hate it, world buffs are too good. Shouldn't work inside instances, makes everything easymode.
---
That's interesting
---
No where did I mention the word smooth, No where did I mention not having log in queues. I would expect both log in queues and broken servers, struggling for mob tags etc etc. 
---
My point is that it is part of what a server launch is. Furthermore it does not last forever, eventually people will make it to elwynn forrest, westfall etc. and the pop spreads out, afterwards it is just a memory of a crazy evening where everyone was attempting to tag wolves outside the abbey. 
---
It is a fun memory at that. 
---
Not much abstract waxing merely trying to advocate that it holds some merit even if it appears to be entirely destructive. 
---
My daughter is 6 months currently and sleeps a solid 10-12 hrs once she goes down
---
You may have a better chance to hit, but the axe specialization won't allow it to do more damage.
---
Nah, WoW Classic means nothing in this case. Rehashing old games is not a sign of good game development and the only reason why Activision would allow Vanilla to be remade faithfully is because WoW in any form is likely guaranteed to bring return on investment. 
---
The only thing left in Blizzard that is reminiscent of old times are some 'rogue' developers who will attempt good game design despite pressure from corporate bosses.
---
Right. But I wonder how much that extra hit helps.
---
You're really going to go with that comparison? You don't choose to be born somewhere shitty, you don't choose to not have the means to move to a new location. Sometimes you're just stuck where you are. But not wow, servers are easily changeable and you even get to decide which kind you want when you start! You think if we got to choose where we're born, people would willing go to East Harlem? Nice attempt there though 
---
You can't get Atiesh as shaman (which is silly, for a weapon to be named after the Persian word for flame)
---
because feral charge gives you added mobility and an interrupt, thick hide gives you added defense and hotw gives you extra stamina in bear and intellect in caster form all of which is crucial to being a flag runner / support. 
---
The + stam and int is what the whole spec is based around, a druid without mana is dead in the water but with mana you can not only continue to shift to escape but also support your team with heals and roots. 
---
Have you ever played on the realm launch of a private server?
---
Before giving your opinion on how it would play out (lol @ “just a memory of a crazy evening”) how about you instead actually experience what it’s like and look up all the hacks and changes the Nostalrius team had to implement just to make the realm playable for the first week and a half. 
---
It was perfectly fair for a blood DK to have it as well. They worked the same way, stacking as much arpen as possible because they were also like 98% physical damage. Ragequitting over that is just stupid.
---
So did blood DKs.
---
My friend wants to be a druid, and VERY SPECIFICALLY does not want to be a night elf.  So, Horde I go.  It is not like I haven't swapped factions before.
---
Not even close. More like 15-20g in trash and then depending on prices like 10-15g in herbs. 
---
What is your problem with broken tooth?
---
Some of the older pservers had them dropping absurd amount of trash so you would make like 40g an hour just vendoring it. 
---
Now it's about half that which is still good money considering how easy it is and the fact that there is no competition inside an instance. 
---
Have you leveled a priest in Vanilla? Even with 1.12 talents and drops you ain’t going to be one of the first to ding 60 on a server.
---
Also any strategy that relies on being one of the first 60s on a server is silly.
---
So is it gold or salt or joke? I’m terribly confused.
---
Hi, /u/Hearald
---
WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH
---
Probaboy an easy caster class. I’d say maybe a mage, or why not a priest so she can healbot you too 👀 
---
Stonewatch Keep in Redridge and the ogre mound in Loch Modan are definitely classics. The Lordamere Lake town in Silverpine is pretty cool.
---
Yeah we had a blood DK in the guild who did amazing damage with that trinket.
---
I did have a guild I was in give a DBW to an Assassination Rogue though which made me salty (As a Fury warrior who still needed one)
---
Gold income on a server depends on the economy of the server if you want to make easy money the best thing you can do is take your time.
---
My first Epic mount took like a month and a half of straight farming, my last one took 11 days without super lucky epic drops.
---
Krol Blade went form 50-100g within the first 2 months to 1000g within a year, I bought my pristine hide of the beast for 75g i don’t even remember how much it was towards the end but it was a heck of a lot more than that. 
---
Same goes for all BoE and mats and especially lower level trade goods.
---
As money accumulates it’s easier prices inflate since the drop rates don’t change much you get a bigger reward for your effort for all things that aren’t affected by inflation such as talents and respec costs and mounts.
---
Indeed, I remember when I used to play before school and come back after school and rejoin the same av. omegalul
---
Thats the only logical way of writing dates damnit!!!!
---
You go smallest to largest, you dont go mis up the order halfway. Thats like saying time in hh:ss:mm
---
the only things working in favor of that scenario are the facts that at 40 slots to fill there will be less competition to make the cut, and that vanilla content is so mechanically easier that gear assumably won't matter as much. Other than that though why would someone who cares about these things today all of a sudden stop caring 6-9 months from now? We've spent over a decade optimizing this game, we aren't going to revert just for the sake of it.
---
To be clear, I agree it is nonsense and shouldn't be in vanilla, but I 100% expect ppl to not only care about everything you've mentioned but to also rely on mods for calculating gearscore and all other types of bullshit. 
---
Mage.
---
Looks spot on. Man I remember that look like it was yesterday and it honestly excites me for wow classic.
---
Yes, yes I have. I played on nost too in fact. 
---
Ive played plenty of anticipated private server launches through the time, all of them were unplayable for a while, but it was still an experience I value personally. And that is exactly what leads me to say that I personally dont think they should shard it, at any time. 
---
It is unplayable for a while but it does not last for ever. If you dont see anything positive in people for once getting to experience that tons of others want to play the exact same game, even at a cost of a day worth of instability, I dunno what else to tell you man. 
---
What we are discussing is irrelevant anyway sadly, since blizzard apparently agrees with you which I will of course accept, as mentioned first week sharding is not a deal breaker, its just not optimal im my optics.
---
Ret is fun and underrated, both in terms of damage and amount of fun
---
Feelsgoodman :)
---
First two are true. But WoW classic isn't gonna be curing this ailment. It'll just convince some of the old diehards to resume funneling money to Lord Activision for a low effort recreation of something we've already seen. 
---
It's a meme you dip
---
This is magnificent! 
---
I use my wife as a priest healbot.
---
She even wants to play a female dwarf priest so every raid wants us :D
---
Welcome to contemporary gaming companies. Unfortunately, the likelihood of there being rogue developers with good intention to actually take action, is a very small chance, if at all. Blizzard has been expressing the most bizarre things across all of their games, and it is unfortunate that it is happening. I left quite a while ago, not even sure if Classic will bring me back. I have no respect left for the company. 
---
Having done both the horde and the alliance side back in the day I’d highly recommend Alliance. The Alliance have so many better quest zones/hubs than the horde in classic. The horde leveling is pretty rough until you get to level 30 or so. Anytime I went horde I’d stick to the undead route as much as possible because it was the only startling zone I really liked for horde.  On the Alliance side you have all these pre level 30 zones like Duskwood,Redridge,Loch Modan that all have fun elite level quests that are memorable. I’d only go horde if I was making a shaman or if most of my friends rolled horde. 
---
Frenzy is an 8 second buff and pets have a base 20% crit rate. I'm pretty sure it would never drop for any dps category pet. 
---
I agree that this is probably the case - I saw the original meme today and added the bottom bit for fun. I enjoyed the hell out of the Blizzcon demo more than I expected to and, the way I see it, hoping a little doesn't do me much harm ;)
---
Schon ne Ahnung an welchen Tagen ihr raiden wollt?
---
Cataclysm dungeons were very hard though. I remember them being my favorite for this reason. 
---
Could be one of two things:
---
1. Schools back then (and some still) view anything to do with video games as satanic and devil worship. The days of giving students suspension while they are dragged to church just for playing D&amp;D are not quite gone yet I'm afraid.
---
2. More likely the letter is a faith, and it should be a carnal sin to spec Seal of Command, hence the pure vulgarity of the retribution spec warrants a suspension.
---
Dustwallow ony entrance area. The whelps there are doing elite damage but have normal mob health and give twice the exp as normal mobs. Crazy good grind spot if youre alone :)
---
Reckbombing though... so juicy whacking down a fully world buffed undead mage on their way to the raid in one attack :3
---
Pot, meet kettle.
---
It helps in raiding, but a raider would probably get a better 2H anyway. And in pvp TUF is better because more burst damage potential.
---
No no... I mean specifically for wow cosplay. Not overwatch, league, animes. So just r/wow? Also this isn’t going to become a ‘cosplay sub’. People recognizing their enjoyment of the game should be welcomed not pushed away at least in my opinion. 
---
I like it. Everything is better than dkp really, and loot council only works if the leadership is made up of decent peeps.
---
Tons of rape? 
---
I was in two high level raiding guilds from vanilla to WoTLK with almost no effort made during my WoTLK days. During vanilla and TBC no one ever asked my gear or spec outside of curiosity. This was hardcore raiding guilds, who cared more about your commitment and dedication, and less about your gear. 
---
In fact, instead of expecting you to have gear, we had raid nights and attunement runs for any new players. 
---
We knew great was important, so we helped gear new players. But we weren't snobbish and expecting you to join our guild already prepared. 
---
Because of this, I think we saw far more progress than most other guilds I would call "try hards" who minmaxxed and still never saw naxx.
---
 That being said I'll be going back to either of those guilds and we've already discussed that this is still exactly how we plan to run things. Players and experience first. Achievement and progression second. 
---
I mean, wtf are u doing in Harlem at this time of night?? Don’t you know what happens to people here - you even brought that nice purse too.
---
What arr chances of a weekend raid times?
---
I can't stand the horde starting zones and cities anymore. UC is my favorite but nobody stays there. 
---
I'll probably roll alliance this time to not get burned out too quickly.
---
Hunter. To be honest she wont be raiding. 
---
Hunter is easy to learn, the pet aspect might appeal to her, too.
---
My main is a paladin with 7,212 hours /played since Vanilla. And I skipped a few expansions.
---
All my other alts (aside from my bank alt) have maybe 400 hours combined.
---
I can't switch factions.
---
Would only go Alliance for faster BG que times so prob gonna stick to my Orc Enhancement shaman plan. 
---
I'm really glad to read this.  I'm looking forward to classic, but I am in no way in a situation where I can spend 8 hours a day playing the game like back in college.  I'm really hoping to find a guild of people that just want to have fun instead of autisticly screeching about having the optimal set and spec.
---
no
---
I want to power level, and I’d like to try raiding early on if possible, at least initially. But I don’t want to raid 6 nights a week. Happy to keep it pretty chill.
---
I honestly am not a huge ganker and am part of the guys who resort to kill some lowbies in order to get the big boys to town. 
---
That is MUCH more pleasant to do in Redridge and Duskwood than in Stonetalon or Hillsbrad. 
---
You kill lowbie alliance for 10minutes and if you arent a rogue who can just vanish, sure enough 60s will appear.
---
Therefore for me horde was the goto, because I could come back every once in a while to enjoy the lowbiealliance scenary with good wPvP. 
---
As alliance you are at the hordes whim to start something and in 99% of the cases it some bored dudu/rogue who takes off once reinforcement comes barreling in.
---
druid! all the women love druid
---
To want to play a game you can’t even play *though you paid for it* is... insane. It’s such a privileged position. I bet you just have all the time in the world and assume everyone is just like you?
---
It’s a fucked opinion. 
---
Why do you need to do damage?
---
barrels of it, can't give it away
---
This is actually true.
---
I started in cata as alliance but switched to horde for mop but in classic I'm definitely going ally for that sweet sweet fear ward
---
Combat pulled ahead of assassination with stacked ArP though
---
Well, I wouldn't say I am "switching" factions, I have been spending  relatively equal time on horde and alliance characters for a few expansions now, but I will stay on one of them simply because I don't want to waste the time to level two characters. Having one character which stays with current gear for a damn long period will be cool enough, making a full switch to Classic in terms of all my characters would be unnecessary. 
---
So, basically, I am sticking to one side because it would involve too much time to be on two. 
---
My sole goal is to have a R13 - or if the stars align 14 - tauren warrior. If I achieve that, my WoW vanilla days are spent wisely and I can let the game die in peace.
---
A pet would have to have an attack speed of 1.6 or higher to statistically have the buff up 100% of the time, then. Which would mean that you'd realistically have the buff fall off fairly often
---
I got that trinket and it instantly vaulted my DPS up to within the top 15 of my server. I was pretty stacked in all slots in addition to that trinket though with the 2250 arena rating 2 handed axe in combination with some raiding weapon which I forget currently.
---
Thanks I’ll check them out!
---
Yeah, we basically gave items to whoever they were the highest DPS increase for
---
It’s a good meme:-D
---
They will be doing regular maintenance, I expect it to be similar to live. Nowhere near 12 hours but servers need maintained and weekly reset is each Tuesday. So I'm pretty sure they will 
---
Honestly mage gets played up as spam frostbolt in raids but they DO have other roles on a lot of fights lol
---
Bro, what?
---
yes
---
Of course.  I want the vanilla experience of levelling a throwaway toon on another server just because it isn't down.  The way vanilla actually was.
---
your name confuses me
---
I'm also interested to hear what the "Other"-option pickers plan to do! :)
---
I'd add a "casual both". While doing hardcore more than one thing is hard, doing two things casually is very much in the realm of possibility. 
---
Nah, you're just describing bad loot councils, it's a common thing that people do when they cry about them. 
---
Just find a decent guild that intends to progress. The loot council will reflect that. If it doesn't then you're in a bad guild and you need to leave anyway.
---
Yeah man, this system that allows people to take items from other classes and disenchant them for the fun of it will NEVER cause any drama. Yup.
---
Is this in Feralas? I saw it but never explored it, What was in the area?
---
Ah indeed I didn't think about that. While I actually consider myself to be a "casual both" I'd probably lean more towards being a casual PvE player who does PvP for fun :)
---
I've been back and forth. My live guild is all drinking the coolaid, so we went looking for a Classic guild, since live isn't what I want to play.
---
Found an Alliance guild I like with a good schedule and plan. 
---
We've been back and forth since BC Live and have been horde since Cata. I was Alliance from BC to Cata, so I've done both. Just happened to work out nicely for a change of pace. 
---
Been playing pservers for a while and we always try to swap factions for different areas to start in.
---
Also Flips!
---
I'm basically trying to do the same thing with my gf and mage or priest is probably the safest choices. Hunter is good too but keeping up with the pet mechanics can be a but overwhelming fir a newbie especially having to manage aa range
---
AU sure? 
---
I feel like we gad a great community. I don’t remember having half the problems people on Reddit complain about. I really hope they bring it back.
---
Doubles?
---
because that is the proper way to do it? 
---
Pallys are awesome.
---
DPS Blood DK was only viable if you stacked ArmorPen. 
---
Yeah, your best option is to ride to Westfall. If you have no mount, though, it means running for a good 15+ minutes. Actually, now that I think about it, I am not sure there was a flight master in Westfall before 2.0, so maybe running to Redridge instead. 
---
I wish I could forget them. They were a bigger thing in BC when I played more, though, so that is why they left some PTSD. Even on a mage they were rough. 
---
Thanks :)
---
Best all around if you get picked. I mean, it's possibly my favorite class and has been my main through a few expansions, but plenty of other people feel the same way; meaning you may have to share your spot with other mages and will actually have to perform better to be recognised. Which makes is less of a "best around" simply because you would need to excel not to perform well, but better, unlike hunters for example. 
---
I just remembered this existed a couple days ago and had to go look it up after complaining about Hammer of Justice with a friend, thanks for posting it!
---
Ultimately what happens is going to come down to how much of a return on investment Classic makes.  
---
There's a scenario (though it's highly, HIGHLY unlikely - like a 1 in a million chance) in which there's enough retention after the initial 6-months or so (I imagine the first 6 months will see a HUGE boost in subs, but after that people who realized they don't want WoW classic move on), there's still enough revenue income from WoW Classic that Blizzard either (most likely) begins work on TBC Classic or (less likely) begins actually developing content.  
---
If it's the latter, they're not going to risk popping the carefully built bubble they've created, so whatever team is tasked with that will likely pull out the old design bibles developed early on and work off those, crafting 'classic' content.  
---
Activision isn't dumb.  If this makes them money... and it makes them ENOUGH money... they're not going to blow this second chance.  But it's unlikely this will happen because I don't think we're going to see enough of a subscriber base on WoW to warrant it.  
---
Ironically, the biggest threat to more WoW classic post-launch are the people playing private servers who aren't playing the live servers.  They represent potential income that could nudge Activision down the path of more.
---
This poll sucks.
---
Nope. Not until we have more info on servers there isn’t any point in worrying about it at all.
---
The loot council just needs to not be too anal about loot distribution. Instead of assigning loot to an individual, just "qualify" every person who would receive a roughly equivalent upgrade (fairly lenient) and let them roll for the item.
---
I really do understand the people that dislike loot councils. I imagine that a lot of people have been burned by them. But I can't help but think that people who claim that loot council has "fundamental problems" just have too little faith in humanity.
---
This.  Playing a Druid with my GF (Rogue) and we're both gonna take our time and enjoy the journey to 60.  Once there, however, we want to find a 'casual raiding' guild to at least experience SOME of the raid content (if not all).  The only ones I got to try in Vanilla were Onyxia and MC (I didn't seriously raid until TBC and at that point, we were focused on TBC raids).
---
I'd like to take a week off and go nuts levelling. Then chill and gear up while destroying fresh 60's and griefing level 50 zones. Probly make a twink while gears cheap and people are levelling thru too 
---
But mostly camp people until it turns into a horde vs alliance wpvp raid
---
I think back then most guilds just needed warm bodies.  I recall our (RP) guild joining with another (Raiding) guild.  The Raiding guild didn't have the numbers, but our guild was full of people with decent-enough-ish gear to attempt some.  BIS came in later in WoW's life when Raid guilds started getting super srs.
---
My experience in Vanilla was the same. Casual raiding guild that had MC, Ony, ZG and AQ20 on farm. We were just starting progression in BWL when TBC dropped and I decided to stop playing. Did clears take longer than they “needed” to? Maybe. But nobody seemed to mind. I think we had a preference for players in blues over “of the whale” greens but I don’t remember any gear checks, even for fire resist. Honestly the biggest headache was dealing with DKP (I was dkp officer for a while) and complaints from ppl when they didn’t get a drop they wanted.
---
So did most physical damage classes including hunter.
---
Nobody stacked as much as they could in ICC as that would be pointless. It was stack to 100% then switch back to primary stats.
---
Seriously? I had entire lists and spreadsheets for gear in TBC. I definitely didn't do that or use the term "bis" in Vanilla, though.
---
Also a 7 year old account. Interesting.
---
Well, it's perhaps not the most super exciting poll you've taken. It's meant to be a quick way to determine what type of players this subreddit consists of.
---
Druids are great when all that matters is health and armor, like Patches. Their threat is great too. There's really no reason to gamble with crits on any progression fight tho.
---
Maybe people just didn't expect to get gear fast enough in vanilla to warrant gear planning or the concept of a "bis" list. When only 3 pieces of gear drops for 40 people you kind of don't ever go into a raid expecting to even get anything.
---
My first level 60 was a Tauren warrior so I know what you mean. You get all those high levels from SW to come in and before you know it there is a huge battle going on. My post was mainly directed at the person I was replying to who only did the Horde side. You’re missing out on some of the best zones in the game IMO if you only played that one side. Classic Duskwood is still probably my favorite zone of all time. 
---
Its more the mindset of something being BIS and nothing else matters. Maybe I am missing some context on how it is used now in retail, just saying that people didn't use that phrase back then.
---
Maybe you missed the post that got removed that was just like 20 links to their social media pages. Like! Comment! Subscribe! Follow! It's literally just a for profit karma farming shitpost. Maybe create r/wowcosplay if you think there's a demand for it.
---
Eh, I can see myself having three nights a week dedicated to PVE (farming dungeons/mats/raids etc) and another 3 dedicated to PVP, just logging in for a couple of hours parked in front of the battlemasters. 
---
I played in a guild on a private server who had an interesting loot system that left no room for drama. 
---
You would make a list of every item you wanted from a raid tier, n a numerical list of priority. 
---
Each item would have a list of people who wanted it and the priority they wanted it in. 
---
When an item dropped only people with it listed as item #1 would roll, the winner being removed from the list. 
---
Everyone 10% attendance you dropped your item list would drop down by 1 number. So if you had 91% attendance and your #1 item dropped you got to roll. If you had 90% you had to roll against people who had the same item as #2 priority, if nobody else in the raid had it at #1. 
---
This system made it so everyone knew when they were getting an item. 
---
There were also a few rules about list structure. You could t put rings/amulets in order, there had to be at least 1 other item between them. 
---
Weapons and trinkets had to have at least 2 items between them. 
---
We kept track of raids for the previous 26 raids for attendance tracking. This includes ZG and AQ until it was deemed that they were not lucrative raids any longer. 
---
Exactly you do the raid for fun and to get better so it can be done faster which in turn benefits everyone. 
---
I remember very clearly using the term in tbc. The day I got cursed vision on my hunter(suck it rogues) was a glorious day indeed.
---
Other - I'm going to see where the winds take me.  
---
Going to stay in character RP-PvP and see what happens..  Maybe my character will end up in a raiding guild, maybe he'll end up in a strict Wpvp guild ...  who knows.
---
I was on a high pop in EU. We had 5 guilds total, spread over both factions who managed more than 1 boss/wing. I wouldn't call one boss in Naxx "progress" based on how many of the vanilla "Naxx guilds" fell apart after one boss. Mostly due to the difficulty.
---
Id say 5 or less was average for most servers. 
---
RFK Boars are best pets.
---
I was a casual raider. I saw MC, Ony, ZG, AQ20, BWL, and a few bosses into AQ40. 
---
The guild was a bit more hardcore I think we raided 3 nights a week, and I made an average of 2. IIRC Ony and AQ20/ZG were put on the same day. Other nights were MC and BWL. MC was dropped once we moved into AQ40.
---
Other than our top dps/tank/healer. Not many of us had a long list of consumables. 
---
I was a hunter, I only recall going to a few mana/HP pots, Resist pots, and food
---
Perfect description of my experience and I saw 2 wings of naxx. Its all gonna be fine, and I can't wait. 
---
Don't install a damage meter and you'll enjoy yourself more. The game then wasn't about topping meters (to most)
---
Was in a guild that used a master SK list, class specific SK list, and overriding LC. I liked that one the most. For most stuff the class SK is best because it keeps class items moving without prejudicing you on large items that drop once in a blue moon. Ostensibly you would get your class specific loot based on SK, but council could override for cases of equity. 
---
