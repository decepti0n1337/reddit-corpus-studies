Well it‚Äôs this or personal loot haha

---
---
Thank you :3

Next tune set the kids up with goonies and compare and contrast deadmines with the movie. Then run it again and put Peter Pan on. Hopefully you get your cruel barb by then.

When he hit level 60, he probably received couple of thousand subscribers on Twitch and hundreds of donations. He had about 350k viewers, so it wouldn't surprise me that he got at least 10k in donations.
---
Well since the post is here I might as well.
---

---
I just did the run with my Nelf Hunter, what I recommend is finishing Teldrassil, or at leasr until you finish your class quest, since you won't be able to do it anywhere else, at least that is how I did it.
---
The run itself I imagine you know, take the boat from Darkshore to Wetlands, and then do the pilgrimmage to IF.
---
I said to myself in a DM run; If I win this greed roll on the +7 agi Polearm, I'll buy Polearm skill, otherwise I'll go Dual Wield..
---
I won the Polearm - I can't really complain though, even though the animation is so annoying, *IT'S NOT A SWORD, DON'T SLASH WITH THE POLEARM*
---
I don‚Äôt think this was added until after vanilla.
---
I remember on my rogue in vanilla I joined a raiding guild and started raiding with them, building up DKP. One day a cloak drops that is an upgrade for me, has the right stats etc - so I bid my DKP on it. I get given the loot, another guy in the raid starts flipping out and abusing me because the cloak is "a better upgrade for him". I'm just like okay sure, should of just bid more DKP on it? Not really my problem, that's the whole point of a DKP system.
---
He continues to abuse the hell out of me and stir up drama in guild, I try and get the officers / GM to get him to back off - they don't really care because he's an old friend so I just leave the guild. Find out a week later when trying to join another guild and get into PUGs that he has told a bunch of other guilds that I ninja'd epics from their runs and just blatantly lies, soon no one on the server will let me join their guild or join their raids and I am outcasted literally because someone was mad I bid higher on an item than him...
---
Blacklists can be a good tool to weed out the truly toxic, but they need to be evidence based blacklists; just creating blacklists at someones word just ends up being a mess. I've seen people spamming general telling people to add names to a blacklist only for it to turn out to be because they "took some linen" or "didnt wait in line for a mob".
---
*Remodel crew comes through*

Porn... Porn... Porn... Wtf is this???

Yeees dude! He‚Äôs back! You are the guy who made that Mindful Vanilla post. Bro I swear I still show that to people to this day. That was so fucking funny I can‚Äôt even believe it. 
---

Haha fucking hell that is next level casual
---
Can I get discord ? I'm interested. I'll be on tonight as well. Want to hit 11 or 12 tonight

---
Ooof. My condolences to anybody competent that chose that server because they are going to be in a sea of baddies.

I have yet to win my first roll :(
---
Totally.  [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bagnon](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bagnon) Has been updated 2 days ago. Under Recent Files, look for the download link to the Classic version.
---
It's not sense at all, it's fucking idiotic and trying to have it both ways. Duh just raise caps, also remove layering ASAP, these ideas are totally compatible btw
---
I don't know if it's a bug for people who haven't played any Blizz games before and need to create a new account because I've seen posts like yours a lot.
---
I play Diablo 3 and also had an ancient WOW account so Classic was an option for me on the drop down menu when I checked it a week before I subbed. But like I said, my account was up to date and active already because of D3.
---
But then we‚Äôd see him hitting his crack pipe!
---
[removed]
---
If that item drops for one person, it drops for the whole group.
---
hahahah poor soul :c
---
THERES NOTHING WRONG WOTB LAYERING ITZ ONLY TEMPRSRY BLIZZARDS KNOW WUTS GOOD FOR VIDEO GAEM STOPS COMPLAYINIG
---
Nah. That's hermaphrodites. Futanari is just a chick with a dick. Ain't the same thing.
---
Don't ask why I know this.
---
Yes, world dragons should be phase 2.
---
I've seen this copypasta a few times scrolling through here. Way to be original.
---
back in vanilla days me and my friend killed a skull guy trying to grief us. We were level 30iah and he seemed to be around lvl 50-55 ish fun memories
---
Dude, thank you SO much for this. That gave me chills. Utterly amazing, the speedrunning community is really one of a kind.
---
Hasn‚Äôt it been less than a week?
---
All that guy needed was like 30 days vacation time
---
I wonder what it's like to have a life
---
hi there,

does your mac get hot? mine is like lava and i am worried it will do damage

Thats a fucking stupid comment, there is a difference  in exploitation of an unintender mechanic and game design.
---
Literally me last night. Usually go to bed at 12 or 1, but I was up until 4:00 üòÇ
---
DUDE ANOTHER MEME AWESOME
---
&gt;letting more people onto the server doesn't affect queue times
---
lol
---
I used a ton of addons back in Vanilla, even made a few for stuff that I couldn't find one.
---
But this time I decided to minimize it; I'm currently only using Prat (improvements to the chat window that I got way too used to).
---
Questing without any addon is a very different experience, I'm enjoying it.
---
You need to go to a warrior trainer in goldshire or somewhere else. The trainer in the starting area stops training abilities at level 6.
---
Do you have a check ticked so it‚Äôs not showing it?
---
I noticed a type in the picking your class google doc. Under racial choices for warlock it says "Only humans and gnomes can be warlock on alliance, and only orc and undead can be mage on horde" where its supposed to say warlock instead of mage.
---
Lol it‚Äôs just rng man...
---
Not really. He only used it on the last two hours to avoid ganking. He maybe saved half an hour.
---
Honestly, you'll be fine as a druid healer. They bring a LOT to the table. In fact, if you want to raid as a druid, you should heal. Priests also have a great toolset. But you'll be fine with a drood. And you'll be a BEAST in Warsong Gulch when it's out.
---
I have a good hustle. I‚Äôm a tailor and skinner. I skin everything and I mail all the leather to my guilds leatherworker. He makes greens for me, I try to sell them in trade chat cheaper than AH. If they don‚Äôt sell, I send them to my guild enchanter. He sends me the dust and essence. Those have yet to fail me when posted competitively. Last step is collect my gold. I‚Äôm level 23 and have 6 gold.
---
yup. mage is just to get the record. hunter would be his endgame class of choice to solo stuff.
---
The game play loop of classic is a lot more broad, overarching and satisfying, yeah sure. In terms of actual mechanical game play? Nah. The tab-target MMO has felt outdated for a while now. There are games that do single things, like combat, better than WoW has ever done. It is the complete package of Classic WoW that makes the right compromises to give an overall fantastic product. It just all depends what you are looking for.
---
I read this interview. Very funny! I hated hills of stranglethron with a passion!
---
My friends all split so idk if I'm even going back to Grob at this point.
---
If anyone wants to add me shoot me a message and I'll give you my battletag. I'll be in WoW mode most of the weekend starting like 8 PM MST tonight!
---
Agree 100%
---
Just means you‚Äôll get it in about 16 more runs xD
---
Lol how does that make any sense? The logout rate isn't some constant flow, of course there will be fits and starts.
---
And here I am still in queue.
---
Also alliance or horde?
---
You just need to subscribe and then download bnet click on wow install it. Then right where it says play or playable there is a drop down box that says world lf warcraft.  That has to be toggled to classic
---
I like your missus' beard
---
THANK YOU!!!!! I WASTED SO MUCH TIME TRYING TO GET THIS TO WORK
---
So what do you call this? https://clips.twitch.tv/DrabEagerDeerPJSalt
---
is there an addon that shows you where water is or do you have to find it on the map
---
My Blacksmithing is already so far behind my mining this would just completely throw me off I think lol
---
But the servers now are massively upgraded from vanilla, back then you had 5k people max, nowadays you have 100k people on a single server. It would be a shitshow.
---
Layers are okay, but they need to reduce them
---
I‚Äôve been playing overwatch for about two years now, so I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a bug for people who‚Äôve never played blizzard games before or for people who have never played WoW before.
---
If it is a bug, hopefully it gets fixed soon!
---
This is why they wanted to put loot trading in the game.
---
The word is camaraderie, friend.
---
With that said, why wasn‚Äôt he on a PvE server?
---
????????????????????
---
And how many wow players are logging out constantly? Especially now that they fixed dc's there's no reason a queue should be jumping like they do
---
Private servers look great on my shitty laptop, can't get classic to look as good...
---
LOL the entitlement on display in this thread is astounding. just raise the cap 4Head
---
Mograine is the most faction balanced server on EU
---
The continuing queue problems really affect my joy negatively. Playing is awesome but having to plan my game time and sleeo schedule and not really getting to play when I want but rather when I can and then without pause because logout threat...
---
The game and community are amazing but the queue really takes from the joy for these reasons.
---
Yep you were right, for some reason thought it was 2.
---
You can actually skip the queue when changing machines. If you logout out and quickly log back in on another machine you aren't put in a queue. So I've been queuing up at like 1 or 2 pm, getting in and playing for the last bit of work then RDP to my home desktop, logout, then login at home so I'm guaranteed already in when I walk in the door.

Honestly, my favorite thing to do is help out new players in this game. Asking for help with a quest? I‚Äôll take you there and help you do it. In a hairy situation and might die? I‚Äôll drop a heal and do my best to keep you alive while killing the mobs. Oh I‚Äôm making bags because I want to lvl tailoring? Random trade windows give away bags.
---
Giving them a cool experience is easy for you, takes a minute or a few, but will absolutely leave a good impression on that random that maybe isn‚Äôt quite sure about the game yet.
---
Have fun! I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll both be busy in the coming weeks/months with classic wow!
---
Words mean things; maybe clarify before you spout random nonsense. So what "world firsts" are we comparing it to that are held at such a prestigious standard?
---
"World first" would be the person when WoW first opened. so we are talking about a "world first" in classic, in a "race" that has zero way of ACTUALLY seeing who is first(vice the community) since blizzard didn't acknowledge or assist in this process, with zero reward. Okay.
---
He slept(offline and not getting experience) more than others who did have webcams, he didn't pool gold from his guild, he didn't have someone pressing buttons on his keyboard while he slept to avoid queue times, and he has the current world record for fastest run 1-60. Call it what you want, cheating or whatever, again, you like the OP, are trying to discredit a well-known(and fastest time) speedrunner because you can't stare at his face, on a random reddit post. Nobody will shed a tear over your slight glimpse and irrational anger into WoW speedrunning, and he's already deleted the character to go again.
---
But 16 runs man.. I'm about to loose my god damn mind, just think about how much xp that is. But atleast when i get it i can use it till about level 34 if not more
---
Will I be useful at all in PvP or would I want to be feral for that sort of thing?
---
Amazing.  Thanks man üëç
---
No but it has the perk of refilling life to life tap, and just soul siphon the succubus because she wont be using mana.
---
Nope, different game.
---
Jokerd was first and that is certainly an accomplishment, but really he just exploited a new mechanic meant to make the low level experience better during the launch period. I wish they had not extended layering into zones with high level mobs for this exact reason. He didnt technically break any rules, but he still cheated in my eyes.
---
Do you have a screenshot of your ban?
---
We need to know, vendor or ah?
---
¬øQue?
---
D'oh! Alliance. If you're an alliance player as well, check your PMs. Otherwise see ya out there.
---
I already have it downloaded, the problem is that there is no drop down box next to the play button. So maybe it is just a bug?
---
They come in many shapes and sizes.
---
I added the bit about a dangerous murloc somewhere in the mine on the left :)
---
Cataclysm&lt; was basically wow 2, they need a wow 3 baha
---
Very promising! Sick of queues on skeram so looking to new start
---
How are you using it and which one.
---
really? had no clue it was against tos
---
It was early and I couldn't understand what you would be doing with a closet...
---
I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm going to need more proof than this.
---
You must mate together now and so shall your pets
---
All you need is a subscription to play classic lol it‚Äôs not gonna give you bfa
---
Didn‚Äôt know childfree existed. Do the hate messages about retail get downvoted to hell? I‚Äôm lurking here all the time and don‚Äôt typically notice it
---
The barrens chat on my server is really ramping up to previous levels.
---
I forgot to note:  Check out how much damage rend does during it's duration and consider that it takes  the entire 12 seconds for the threat to apply - Whereas Sunder is instant and will give you threat immediately which is the most valuable thing for a tank. 
---
 It frees you to move on from that mob and allows your group to begin killing it that much sooner.
---
Also a good tip:  dont waste too much rage on mobs that are low hp.  You'll get a feel for how much sundering/revenge you need to use to hold threat, and when you can safely abandon the main target while your dps finishes it off.  Then you can start dealing threat to the next target and they can go all out as soon as #1 is down.
---
Above all:  be patient and experiment.  If you really want to try rend, go for it. Seeing this stuff in action and really getting a feel for it critical for tanking.
---
Do this experimenting early on in your leveling.  Even if it makes things a little more difficult at the get-go, at least you'll be confident in the technique you develop.
---
Let your group know you're still getting a feel for tanking when you start the dungeon too.
---
Good luck!
---
Why are you always so toxic John?
---
(Sniffles) I have allergies, shut up!
---
Q times can be crazy for the overpopulated realms but there are a ton with no q times. I am playing it for the first time too. Don't worry about race to 60 it will take the majority of players at least a month to get there. I would only check a guide for talents but other than that I've been coming blind and it's been great.
---
Wish I could "heart" this. That's really awesome.
---
xD
---
Alliance
---
Lol and wolf form to get away from fights they can't win solo it's great
---
*slow clap* üëè
---
I really don‚Äôt get this show. It does not resonate with me, and I don‚Äôt smoke marijuana any more. I just don‚Äôt get why Eric Andre is a thing.
---
Lol wtf??
---
He's horde so definitely the centaur quest ring.
---
"For years" decades even, at this point
---
Not just the Scion life cluster but life clusters in general. Sure there is a little wiggle room and maybe you want to do some really long uncommon travel. But so much of it is just a given.
---
Looking at the skill tree heat map on poe.ninja and you see how much overlap even different classes have.
---
IT'S OKAY BECAUZ QUEUES TOO LONG AND THERES A COOLDOWN BLIZZ SAID SO YES YES ITS OKAY
---
Usually these people come from BFA/other versions of wow and have no idea what wow vanilla is about.
---
It can take up to 72 hours but usually much faster.
---
If you mistake a flippant comment or anything I say as being serious then you‚Äôre a bitch and not allowed in my guild.
---
Thank you very much! Hoping for the latter
---
The full closing of the gate is a great watch.
---
i'm level 15 with 1 day /played right now.. but this is my first time playing any version of wow so I guess that might make a difference
---
That plus Swipe hits three targets, cleave hits 2.  Druids rely on dps for aggro while warriors use sunder.  So a Druid spamming swipe can hold more mobs than a warrior cleaving and sundering.
---
But because he was streaming it and giving away his position he invited people to gank him, if he hadn't of streamed this wouldn't of happened, it's a problem both caused and solved by streaming chill the fuck out
---
Don‚Äôt worry I had a feral Druid need on that spirit staff from WC... he won my priest cried.
---
You only wait for 5 hours???
---
My friend was supposed to have pets?
---
There's pvpers on every server
---
Work secondary targets for a little bit and then taunt skull back to you if you need to. I use this extensively and dps can go ham
---
Im pretty sure they said they wouldn't be handling issues like that for dungeons and were only handling it for raids. I could see how they would help you though if you actually wait the 5 days.
---
My advice just run the dungeon again. 5 days is hilarious though.
---
That's why a lot of us that called it VC on our realms are as equally confused and because they grew up with a different acronym, THERE ACRONYM HAS TO BE RIGHT, "MY ENTIRE REALM CALLED IT (DM or VC). YOU MUST BE WRONG." 
---
Its just kinda funny how no one will accept the middle ground and probably the most logical response that different realms called it different acronyms.
---
Yeah but. Most people won't hit 60 for 2-4 months. Let alone do anything they hope to accomplish. So, again.. what?
---
He healed after each encounter, he did get hit at times, but not enough to kill him, once they got too close too him, he'd move in, freeze blink out, and go to max blizzard range and repeat the process
---
Even if he had gone through with it Blizzard will restore deleted characters on request.
---
I was referring, again, to the macro AFKers who are taking up spots on the server; queuing in advance is not quite the same as literally ensuring your spot never frees up even when you aren't playing. Using macros/programs etc., to stay logged in, what I am talking about, is against the TOS.
---
I'm still not sure what you are talking about.  If you have a point why don't you just make it?
---
My guild let me be Retribution back in the day because I had the hand of ragnaros. But this time around I rolled a troll mage and I've been liking it so far but I hope it ramps up after 20.
---
What spell are you casting once as a tank?
---
&gt; And thank god for Jim.
---
Eeeehhhh...  You know, I've enjoyed Jim Sterling's videos a lot over the years, but the guy has a hard-on for hating capitalism in any form, and isn't really right in this scenario, so parroting him (and it probably says a lot that I could recognize the source before the last line) doesn't make the best argument.
---
Investors aren't going to demand "infinite expansion."  Expansion looks good, yes.  But so does keeping a decent level of revenue.  The only thing that really hurts the stock price is when a company has problems and ends up with a downward trend.  Such a trend is inevitable if a company has too much growth too fast.  Similarly, negative PR can hit the stock price hard - see the Battlefront II scenario, where the backlash to EA trying to make more money caused the shareholders to sell, dropping the price.  Heck, the more bad press there is about microtransactions and the like, the more likely it is for shareholders to not be keen on them.
---
A subscription's actually *better* for a company, because if you keep subscribers happy, you keep a steady flow of revenue, whereas microtransactions and the like rely on sporadic purchases, which people might not even be keen on.
---
Given that Blizzard is part of Activision-Blizzard, shareholders who "need" to see some kind of crazy monetization can get their fix with games like Call of Duty, which hasn't shied away from it... though it's not helped the PR.  But people upset after the fact don't much matter with CoD, as you already have the main purchase.  With WoW, you can't try to over-monetize it with things that might upset the player base, as then you'd tank subscriptions and end up with a net loss in revenue, especially with WoW Classic where there isn't an up-front cost so it pretty much relies on the subscriptions.
---
For keeping investors happy with WoW revenue, Blizzard would need to find some reason to keep people playing.  With modern WoW, that'll be new patches and upcoming expansions.  With WoW Classic, it's trickier, as they'll have to determine whether to re-release old expansions, or end up branching WoW Classic off with its own new content... but it'll need new content eventually, or people will get bored with what's there and wander off, taking their sub money with them.
---
(I know that was a bit long of a post, but wanted to explain my thoughts and reasoning, rather than just try to give a pithy sound bite response.)
---
Clearly I'm not the only one who doesn't agree with you.
---
so, like, are the queues not going to get better?
---
Let's keep it simple and say they look like their families have lived in the same area for a few generations.
---
Not going to do that while driving.
---
I think the problem is that it casts a shadow on his record. Can any one person verify that he didn't use it from 1-58? I kinda doubt anyone watched every minute of the stream. Why use it from 58-60? If he was that far ahead why do something that might call that record into question?
---
In my eyes if he used it to avoid PvP that's an exploit. Other people attempting world first 60 might have been ganked and it's unfair that they get a penalty and he gets a free pass to exploit. Using it to refresh mobs is also an exploit, he used a game mechanic in an unintended manor for personal gain. So at the end of it his run will have an asterisk. Maybe he didn't abuse it from 1-58, but he did abuse it for at least 2 levels. It was a bad move if he was after an unquestionably legit run.
---
This is so good!
---
Unless you spec into enhanced fortitude!
---
The problem _without_ transmogs is that the bloody colors don't match between the different gear or that you find a really nice looking piece but you'll never wear it because the stats are crap for your level (non BiS.)

Oh shit you right he should've have bothered trying to be the first for the prestige of it
---
Thanks!
---
1. There will always be queues during a game launch. Wait a few days, maybe a week or two tops.
---
2. Switch servers. I guess you're below level 20, so you won't lose more than 10 hours /played
---
3. If you want instant play and layered servers, play retail.
---
Ah hopefully that stays like that! I imagine a lot of the new servers will even fill up and get busy at this point since it's already so new.
---
Are you browsing the Classic WoW subreddit just to bash the game? You‚Äôre devoting time into typing out reasons that retail is better on a sub that doesn‚Äôt like retail. What are you trying to accomplish? If you hate Classic, just don‚Äôt play it. Do your thing on retail.
---
The power of friendship is too strong
---
Honestly that's how to do it. In a few months when populations start to drop a little you can always server transfer once those come in to play.
---
Sitting in a queue all day and not playing at all is pretty silly given how many empty realms there are. But unfortunately if you have a group of friends who want a particular server, that's where you're stuck.
---
This works a treat thankyou!
---
Interface - Action bars - Stack Vertically?
---
Respec to fetal and have those same people beg for you to tank their dungeons. Then you can respec to restoration for MC and they‚Äôll be happy to have you then.
---
I find 10 points in holy is well spent while levelling. 5% crit chance and .5s off your cast times are really versatile talents. Great for 5 mans and gives a good boost to your kill speed with smite.
---
going ret pally as well. if you stack reckoning, you are technically the best burst damage in pvp if you purposely save stacks
---
Imma just leave a comment to find this later when a real answer has been given. Sorry friend
---
Take me in :) Zae#11753... Started on whitemane, but the queue is way too much for me.

&gt; Futanari („Åµ„Åü„Å™„Çä, seldom: ‰∫åÂΩ¢, ÂèåÂΩ¢, literally: dual form; ‰∫åÊàê, ÂèåÊàê, literally: [to be of] two kinds) is the Japanese word for hermaphroditism, which is also used in a broader sense for androgyny.
---
&gt;Beyond Japan, the term is used to describe a commonly pornographic genre of eroge, comics, and anime which includes characters that show both primary sexual characteristics. In today's language it refers almost exclusively to characters who have an overall feminine body, but have both female and male genitalia (although testicles are not always present). In that case, the term is also often abbreviated as futa(s), which is occasionally also used as a generalized term for the works itself.
---
From Wikipedia.
---
Nah, it's specifically having both.
---
I‚Äôve stopped buying fire ones.
---
Yeah "empty" is a very different thing in classic compared to vanilla.
---
Ain't nobody worried about being judged. 
---
Being mercilessly PKd while leveling? Legitimate concern.
---
I have tried to really get in to EVE three times now, failed every time so far.
---
\*flips steak on grill\* thanks
---
No worries. I only "remembered" this from reading it elsewhere recently. So many things to unlearn and learn in classic lol
---
Worst they'll get is a forced guild name change. My brother had &lt;International Drug Co&gt; and got it force changed to &lt;Guild of the Koala&gt; by a GM
---
he did it in 2 days 17 hours on pserver without switching layers
---
if you want to blame layering -blame blizzard, blame streamers like asmon and classic cast who defended layering.
---
layering is part of wow classic - any speedrunner is free to use it to his advantage
---
Streamer shouts ‚Äúwhat the fuck‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs a language nsfw not a boobies nsfw.
---
Fukin lol mate
---
Hmm.  I don‚Äôt remember if we all for it all at once now. You might be right. We still needed to do the turn in which was down in the burrow and then kill a quest but were able to do it with two of us. Still thought it was a ass move.
---
Classic classic
---
This has always bothered me. Not sure why it‚Äôs like that
---
Had the same thing happen to me. [This layer ...is big enough for the two of us?](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EDBJ2mnXUAEIz2m.jpg:large)
---
Most PVP servers favor Horde
---
Just enable the additional action bars in 'interface options'
---
Maybe you should focus on life first and spend the time youd spend on gaming on getting a better job, or the money youd spend on a laptop for savings.
---
Exploitation of a game mechanic is using an absusing a mechanic not the way the developers intended. Please, I urge you to read the definition of exploit. 
---
People use exploit synonyms worh cheating. It is not. 
---
He still exploited a game mechanic of layer hopping.
---
It's similar in classic for some classes that don't use tier gear, I'd prefer that to knowing nothing about my target other than he farmed molten core for some transmog.
---
I messaged you
---
King's blood is that good good

Then Id rather have the alternative, nothing no p2w.

I know how shit works, im just saying thats the only fair way of doing it.

I hate it because I can't find people I want to trade with without grouping.

As far as chests go I usually just go for it and then post anything valuable in party chat

if he was really serious about it, he shouldn't have been streming it at all. just recorded the entire thing and used it to promote a streaming channel afterwards.
---
then he wouldn't have had that problem of ganking

Why not level with a 2 hander? Prot is trash for leveling.

you are attempting to run a custom script, running scripts could compromise your character causing the loss of gold and items "allow scripts or no"

NE Hunter currently with a bear checking in. I had a cat, boar, plainstrider, and crawler thus far hanging with me for their skills until I can camp Humar this weekend. ONE LEVEL TO GO.
---
like i know he didn't cheat or anything but he fully abused the new mechanics added to make launch easier such as dynamic respawn and layering. without that he wouldn't have even been over 50.  so can you REALLY consider this a record?
---
What videos do you make?
---
Find a guild to run around with. A lot of people have over researched the very solved meta of this game and have come to absolute solutions that certain specs are completely bad in every situation.
---
What they fail to realize is that any class that can heal can heal just fine until MAYBE the endgame raiding. And even then, if you‚Äôre good you can make up for it.
---
People substitute their researched knowledge for actual skill and adaptive skill.
---
I've had lots of those moments, but also polite requests to share. I'm really in it for the mining skill right now, copper I won't need till I hit 60, so I'm happy to share. Is there a way to temporarily turn off autoloot  to just get the ding and leave the ore?
---

I don't see any addons called that.

I can't afford the sub fee right now. Can't get addicted if I can't play. #checkmate
---
In all seriousness, it's just a game and I hope people like this get the help they need.
---
Yes, and you find this issue in a lot of MMOs now I feel, that a large portion of people research the best possible way to do everything, and they don't realize that for it to actually matter, you have to have the ideal conditions and everyone else also playing perfectly. In most cases, a player who knows their class and enjoys it is going to be better than someone just playing a class because they were told they should.
---
After all these years, we still need 4GB for classic.
---
Lmao
---
 Using this as well. On my warlock. Only problem is the super short range nameplates are visible. Think it's 20 yards. Would have been great if it was 30 yards or so. You tend to try and keep your distance as a caster when in a group and not solo leveling. Hence you can't see the debuffs. 
---
  If anyone know a way to increase the range that would be great. Tried neatplates as well and had the same short nameplate range.
---
I had 3 days vacation time. It's bit more complex than that.
---
It doesn‚Äôt take much prep and logistics anymore. The bosses are all problems that have been solved
---
Agreed, the game is secondary to your life man. Put your money to better use. Spending what you have left to become addicted to this game isnt a rabbit hole you want to fall down.
---
What's funny to me is that I often hunt down these oldass transmogs in retail. Both because I want em and because a lot of low level classic items are highly valuable on AH for slutmogs. I've gotten enough panty mogs to drop so far to make a fortune on retail but they're trapped here!

Nice man. Thanks for such an elaborate video! Was fun to watch.
---
Well I don't need a little rock, but I'm not one to turn down an offer
---
I loved vanilla as a kid but just don't have the time anymore. 
---
Retail is perfect for those who can only put in 8-10 hours a week.

I disabled sleep, turned off the monitors and just locked the PC.  No issues

I always feel charge is scuffed af but this is another level haha

People who are able to take a week off from work because they have a good job is a nice life to live.

Start your own group and bring a dps class with a rez. Tons of priests out there that would love to dps rather than heal, or shaman etc.

Lol. Nice

He was ahead of method by 2 whole levels before using layers
---
Erm... didn‚Äôt this guy literally lived up today like this? What is fixed then?
---
He had like 300k people watching him on twitch. Pretty sure he made more $$ in 3 days than both of us combined.
---
Try goldshire inn
---
They had us in the first half, not gunna lie
---
I use /whistle, /wave, /train, and /roll.
---
Probably not useful, but amusing.
---
I use Classic Aura Durations on my warlock and it works pretty well so far!
---
I watched it on twitch while it happened. They made a long tunnel of people from storm wind to goldshire for him. He then emptied his mailbox and then deleted the character. Crazy guy.
---
Mained warrior for seven years and forgot all about sweeping strikes.  Thank you.

Hey you take that back, [Ruga's Bulwark](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7120/rugas-bulwark) is a glorious shield of the Tauren people
---
It's not just you, in the next months as the average player can play enough without a queue to really get playtime in, there will be a growing contingent of people wanting some level headed changes or additions, surely. Lots of flame warring between nochangers and somechangers will be had.
---
So i ran it in administrator and it works now.. so random. But now im in the queue so fucking fuckers
---
In my personal opinion your opinion is shit lmao. Dude likes the game, wants to set a record, does what he needs to do to get it done, and that's pathetic? Let people do what they like. I wouldn't stay up for three straight days for a game, but I'm not gonna shit on someone else for doing it and achieving what they set out to do.
---
It‚Äôs comfy until a lvl 60 hunter sits on the roof of the town and one shots you every time you come or go.
---
For a moment I thought your censored the pets name
---
He never once showed his face on stream. You can white knight the dude all you want, there is nothing to say he didn't have someone else helping him out.
---
Hmm your pc shouldn‚Äôt be restarting. 
---
You may need to do some basic trouble shooting techniques to tie down the issue. 
---
Your pc would normally only restart to a blue screen of death (BSOD), faulty power supply, or bad memory. Depending on your setup, you could have a bad HDD. Or on the outside chance you have a heating problem. Any one of those can be diagnosed from google searches. 
---
As for wow crapping out as already suggested, try deleting your WTF folder. 
---
Download revo uninstaller. This will completely remove all the games files. Restart the computer and install the game to a different location say, c:\games\battle.net\wow
---
Try that and come back
---
Hope this help and it‚Äôs not a hardware issue
---
ROG sqaud reporting. Laptop is fine but the battery no longer holds a charge. Literally the only thing that's ever gone wrong with it, though in about 5 years.

‚ÄûChill bro, it‚Äôs just a game‚Äú crowd reporting in, as I see.
---
He won by the rules of the system.
---
If you don't like the system, that's too bad. It won't be changed.
---
See also: electoral college
---
I'm guessing the fact that adds tend not to be much higher levelled than the tanks themselves (compared to bosses) means the spiking damage from crushing blows isn't so much an issue?
---
Actually pretty useful too.  I've run by them before and thought "oh shit there's a dungeon here somewhere!".
---
He's just trolling, there are no bans for remote desktop.
---
What exploits and rumors?
---
Pretty much this. There's also addons to keep track of it. There might have been someone in China, but I haven't really seen anyone from there claiming world first.
---
To people spamming "no life": people who have good jobs with lots of vacation time are able to take an entire week off from work without suffering. It isn't a sign of having no life.
---
He still has faster runs on private servers. I'm not saying layering is a legit method but it's not against the rules as people do it all the time in retail WoW.
---
What qualifies as a "legitimate" speed-run? If some random player gives you BoE's is your run invalid? 
---
Even assuming layering was removed, the amount it saved him even from 1-60 would be a couple hours at best. 
---
It's not like other high levels are any less legitimate than him, most top levels right now are suspected of account sharing which obviously can't be proved.
---
However what can be proved is clip's of a guy manually playing each of Method's characters for them to keep them logged in to avoid a que. Which is 100% against the rules. Obviously they aren't going for a /played speed-run but even so they are trying to get to 60 in as little time as possible using real world hours.
---
Did joker abuse an in-game mechanic? Sure, but like I said that mechanic has existed in retail WoW for multiple expansions and people do it on a daily basis without any punishment because it's allowed.
---
It's no different than streamers resetting dungeon instances, if anything they are abusing more than joker did imo.
---
lol stop poor shaming. 
---
people are poor for tons of reasons other than not working hard enough or being underemployed. sometimes this stuff is the only positive outlet for people during their daily slog through the day, so I say go find a cheap latop on sale for $250 and enjoy
---
2nd.
---
Layer abused to aoe grind yup
---
Its Furens shield, and its glorious
---
Underrated comment right here lmao
---
Relax on the name calling? You brought this on yourself "21 year old adult male" who cries while watching Titanic, LOL. The models are shitty, the old water is shitty; I defend "retail" when people make piss poor arguments as to why it sucks. It sucks in many of the gameplay departments, not the art or terrain/geography departments.
---
I also call people out on their massive amounts of bullshit, like claiming Vanilla/Classic are incredibly dark at night and then proceeding to link Night Effect photoshopped screenshots which gather thousands of ignorant likes.
---
My head cannon is that you fail because you are trying to pick the flower without damaging it.
---
The other day I was in the barrens on the server noggenfogger and this mage comes up to me and says ‚Äúcan a nogger borrow a French fry‚Äù. Now this shit happens so often it didn‚Äôt even phase me that he said nogger I didn‚Äôt even notice. All I was thinking was like ‚Äúnow hows a nogger supposed to borrow a fry? Fogger is you gonna give it back?!!‚Äù 
---
Name change plox.
---
Did you even read my post? Compared to Retail the game is much easier mechanically. The person who practiced a lot and/or has past experience and puts in the most time si succeed. Time being the biggest factor by far.
---
Retail endgame requires more skill while Vanilla requires more preparation and time investment.
---
This. I made a weak aura that says "TRACK HERBS!" with glowy and text for my corpse run. Some-fucking-how I forget when I rez sometimes anyway.

"AoE grind won't be a thing once classic hits.."
---
In hindsight, how does it feel like, being so incredibly wrong?
---
Dont you mean demoralizing shout?
---
That cinematic is sooo good.
---
For a different perspective: When a server launches, there's 0 gold in the economy.
---
Vendoring leather brings silver into the economy, whereas the AH doesn't. (Reduces it due to fees, actually)
---
Yeah I really do get this. But at the same time you will never get the experience of level appropriate PvP skirmishes and the true launch experience again. For me I don't really mind getting that experience on razorgore then swapping back to firemaw. Though then that puts me in a position where I won't be raiding for a few weeks whilst everyone else is. Plus levelling two warriors to 60 doesn't sound quite as fun. I just wish there was a better solution I guess.
---
I mean it essentially isn‚Äôt a real job, you‚Äôre living off donations from people pathetic enough to give it to you and advertisements.
---
I just discovered /train and now everyone within a 10 yard radius wants to kill me
---
I believe he broke 350k viewers.
---
i feel this. i just got my first blue and was so happy about it, it felt so rewarding earning it. andddd got a weapon enchant on it so it looks real cool.
---
Or I have questionable birth control!
---
what is this?! a center for ANTS?!
---
I think the same could be said of OSRS and it's been around longer than WoW
---
Compared to the original game smart ass! All the original assets are there. It is so much easier to rebuild an existing product than to build it from scratch, but hey... what do I know?
---
This is how the Army of the Dead beat the armies of Mordor in Return of the King. They were in a different layer üòé
---

---
Honestly, its a challenge that isn't just spending time.
---
Retail is engaging in the sense of you get to watch some dialogue or you hop on a beast and it takes you for a ride to your next quest, but that isn't effort, that's just time. DPS rotations while questing are basically press two different buttons and wait until it dies, then get a self heal and move on. There is no challenge in that.
---
It‚Äôs a South Park reference
---
Being new to classic doesn't excuse you for being an asshole. Hunters do **NOT** use melee often, and the person isn't a dumbass for pointing out that hunters shouldn't be needing on a weapon when a warrior needs it more, since it was literally designed for his class.
---
Try Hillsbrad foothills if you haven't already, lotsa quests your level there

If you read your vw abilities it says it‚Äôs a chance. If the mob is higher level it‚Äôs harder to land a taunt. I found it‚Äôs pretty reliable to let your void hit first dot it and then wait before even wanding. You will almost always take agro for at least a second or two

Idk, he said he's going for epic mount tomorrow.

Fascinatingly, the Light is the same way. It doesn't require goodness, only extraordinary faith in yourself or cause. Hence the Light still serving the Scarlet Crusade for example.

Lynx Titan practically played OSRS 17h a day for like 4 years
---
Looks like a hunter weapon to me
---
that is pathetic
---
At the moment, the low pop servers are ironically *more* overpopulated in low level areas since that's where more new players are going, whereas the full servers are now a bit more spread out. But of course that's a temporary situation.
---
You aren't getting that weapon. Blizzardzard is not handling loot issues.

I did the same thing!

People aren't all living on a tight af budget. Charity and twitch don't have to be mutually exclusive.
---
Why do people give football players money?
---
Why do people give any athletes money for that matter?
---
They aren't directly benefiting a charity so everyone involved must be some sort of pathetic dribbling retard.
---
Its content, specifically entertainment. people like the content, people appreciate the content, people give money because they appreciated the content.
---
If you can't understand that I don't think you are in any position to be calling people "dumb".
---
I don't think it can compare to the development cost of the original game, but I'm happy to be proved wrong.
---
Just found out in 2 lvls I get aoe taunt, yay
---
If you can make enough money off of entertaining others by streaming, you got a real job. They're just not sitting around an office for 40 hours a week.

They pulled a 180 today, nothing but bitter praise.
---
I think that at some point this week, they realized they‚Äôre an actual business.  Not being a pissy teenaged attitudey group of elitist is best for business.
---
The bigger issue is Methods pace.  They keep talking about raids and shit within the week.  Last I check, only a few of them cracked 60.  Majority being in that 35-45 range which is barely halfway.
---
Idk if they planned a 2nd week in Vegas, but not chance Rag is down by Monday in my opinion.  They might not even have 20-30 level 60s by Monday.
---
Go look at all the previous stream titles. They all say race for 60.
---
Good times
---
Ceeeeelebration time comeon!
---
The levels were already stated to be far beyond what a vanilla server was capable of. They did increase them but high pop servers (Faerlina, Herod, Whitemane to name a few) all still have crazy queues during peak hours. Hell I hit a 9k queue today at 11am on Whitemane
---
I sort of disagree, Classic is full of instant gratifications.
---
Love people who request proof but do not provide any for their own claims
---
But lucky that no ones gives a shit about what you think
---
My point is the context in whicc someone does something matters.
---
Why host a super bowl when there's already a super bowl champion?
---
Why compete for first max level in BFA when someone already did it on beta?
---
Why compete for first 60 on classic, someone which no one has ever done before.
---
Some real low-effort shit
---
It really is. I'm about to quit and I'm only level 13.
---
There‚Äôs 40 of you; you‚Äôll be able to raid in pre dungeon gear still most of the time
---
That specific quest is though.
---
It's already started, I've already seen people asking for LFG to be added to the game.
---
It's like we learned nothing.
---
that's fine, but equating what exists and the exploration of it is irresponsible.
---
I don't even really consider it MTX tbh.
---
Normally the problem with MTX is that it is letting you use money to purchase something that you would normally earn by playing the game
---
But with something like that, you are already paying money to play the game, it is just a way for you to pay in game gold instead of real money. I honestly fail to see any downsides to something like that.

Have you sat down and actually tried to play the game? Is it challenging enough for you, and do you enjoy it. If you do, then keep playing. If you don't then shut it off from your life. 
---
In short, let people enjoy their thing however they like.
---
I feel your pain.
---
I‚Äôm out of town for work stuck in a hotel room with some serious FOMO. 
---
I was near the top of the pack in levels (excluding power levelers) and made some serious money selling the more difficult to acquire materials
---
I wont be home until 9 or 10 on Monday. I hate that I‚Äôm going to be so behind.
---
The game runs with updated graphocs and dx 12. 
---
Its basically retail wow with old textures and animations.
---
You would just spend the time getting all the top prof materials then cry into your vaults of gold. I'm sure he will be fine.
---
I don‚Äôt think professional athletics hold any water either, they are just as bad as the people donating to this guy.
---
When pulling multiple mobs its better to battle shout first as it generates threat for all of them
---
Queue times?
---
only triple?
---
1. Yes    
---
2. About 13 additional levels on top of your first free one long
---
double check you didnt make a new account (a lot of people make this mistake). Next to the 'version' dropdown menu there's an 'account' dropdown. you'll be able to tell if you don't have a sub because when you're on the normal wow page there will be a little icon telling you dont have a sub.
---
I hit my first gold yesterday and was the happiest ever lol
---
Prison is better than dead. To be clear, that's absolute shit you aren't allowed to evacuate, and I also recognize that it's only a risk of death not a for sure thing, and maybe that's worth the risk to you. I wouldn't take the chance myself.

He probably just mad that nobody is watching people go through the same raid on the fourth different difficulty or doing the same dungeon on the fourteenth different difficulty so they can open a benthic lootbox or get their weekly mythic plus lootbox, or do 4 mythic dungeons so they can get the weekly event lootbox.

&gt; Is a Druid a healer or dps?  
---
At high level play it's a healer almost always, tank rarely, and dps extremely rarely. Manage your expectations for this.  
---
&gt; How long does it take to get back up to lvl 14?  
---
This is very relative. If you're not familiar with leveling routes, there's no telling how long it'll take. There are people who can do it in 2-3 hours because they've done it a hundred times.

So edgy.

Still celebrating his record breaking time to 60 is pathetic when he exploits game mechanics which weren‚Äòt truly classic. It invalidates his achievement.
---
~~No~~ Path Found!
---
Play each class to 20 then decide. Theres no rush.
---
I‚Äôve heard it still counts as a starter account but I think you have mostly full access to classic. I don‚Äôt think you can invite people to groups. I don‚Äôt know what other restrictions you might face, if any. I also don‚Äôt know if this is intended behavior.
---
Because Classic, that's why.
---
You still accumulate rested XP when logged off outside of an inn; it's just much slower. I think you could do 1-60 in under a year if you only ever leveled with rest XP and didn't go overly far out of your way to get to inns.

I ragequit a pserver after taking that screenshot and then having someone kill it from me :/
---
Its not salt, you ever watched a speedrun? There is plenty of categories. Layering isnt gonna be around later, so it makes sense. The guy got WR layer, well done on that.
---
Method had staff abusing auto logout mechanics.
---
That seems more illegitimate then layering abuse.
---
Oof. Same here man. This is my first experience with WoW. Stuck with my queue going up while my friends are all leveling :(
---
Many guilds continue to farm lower raids for mats, legendaries, helping newer player catch up etc.
---
Just ask your guild leader how he plans to do things and if you have to step out for a bit at some point, how can you catch up etc.
---
It isn't retail. My battle acc says I have legion bought. But when I logged in it lord like maybe MOP at best, so I backed out. Went in and downloaded classic wow cause I missed that part, and when u logged in i found classic realms only. But it's a starter edition it says. No chat allowed.
---
Engineering allows you a lot of cool shit.
---
No problem! Feel free to message me with anymore questions I‚Äôll answer the best I can! I‚Äôm no pro hunter but I have played it (burning crusade/wotlk) and researched a lot for classic so I know the most of the hunter guides...also have her watch videos of ‚Äúhunter strafe kiting‚Äù  it‚Äôs super important to get good at it! If she‚Äôs gets good at that she will basically never take damage from and mobs

During BC, my brother was in a very high ranked guild that was was like struggling with the IC so I never really got the chance to raid because of my age, but my brother would ALWAYS Let me farm ores with his Epic Flyer, this was all me hahahahah.

how is that cheating, its a system within the game that he used to his advantage

If you make a Target of target macro, it's easy for dungeons to keep the tank buffed. Just attack the same thing and hit the key you bound it to.

MORNING TEA AND FAIRY TAIL
---
Transmog is great, but not without its cost. Just like the abundance of purples inflated the epic market, item appearance is meaningless when it's completely divorced from its function. One of those things people don't usually complain about in retail, but sticks out to me as a sore thumb as something people subconsciously feel makes the game worse.
---
Nothing makes you feel more unique than still being in the starter robe after 4 hours ^.^
---
Nah I absolutely agree. MMOs are too easy now. I hadn't died on WoW in 4 years. When I first died in classic I realized the sense of struggle is a large part of why I fell in love with MMOs in the first place.
---
I'm at month 32.
---
Send help. :(
---
I can‚Äôt stand him...he‚Äôs not even good...he uses his following to accomplish anything in game...
---
If I was going to stream 80 hours straight i sure as fuck wouldnt want a cam or mic because i would look and sound like shit
---
holy balls you really did
---
Not that I‚Äôm aware of. 
---
The BFA comment is something talking about retail version, just a troll.
---
Never played classic, let alone WoW. Would you recommend Mage or Warlock? Looking for something that gives a more varied gamepaly and less predictable
---
If you're new I guess it couldn't hurt but you WILL be broke AF doing so.
---
If you have an idea what kind of attack rotation you want you can hold off on non essentials
---
Where are you grinding may I ask . And I'm 19 trying to enjoy every minute and actually doing a lot of walking and collecting flight paths before I start questing.  Goals are to get my mount at 40 and hopefully dont have to farm to much by then
---
Not sure if un-ironic or not. But who gives a crap? Yall need to get some better priority's then a adult getting gold in a vido game
---
Grats to layering and providing a constant flow of mobs.
---
Depends on what you mean by support. I'd argue warlocks, paladins and druids give the most with their base kits without dealing damage or healing. Warlocks put on curses that amplify other peoples dps and therefore contributing more damage to the raid than any single other dps(but you only need a couple of warlocks in the entire raid), paladins give people incredibly strong buffs and druids can combat ress which is always good.
---
Yeah but was he filmed/recorded the entire time?
---
Judging from pservers:
---
Warrior most popular
---
Druid least popular
---
Leather Belt?!
---
I only re-upped my account during name reservations, so in the grand scheme of things I only wasted $7.50 for the two weeks that I can't use this product. Still, it's amazing how many people think this is OK
---
Idk about MORE you see. in classic We dont have Battle and Guardian elixirs. you just stack every potion known to mankind, THEN eat for a well fed boost and im probably missing some. I read on Shaman tanking and i saw like 3 pots just to help get aggro then dps ones after that. in retail we have. 1 potion. a big ol cooldown pot that last 25 secs (At least in legion. havent raided bfa) and food tables. and you dont need any to clear At Least Heroic raids, And maybe Mythic but i make no promises about Mythic. first boss maybe
---
and Ashes of Andorhal!
---
Don‚Äôt worry, Blizzard is the best in business at onboarding people. If read popup tutorials and quest texts you‚Äôll slide right in without a sweat.
---
Hahaha I actually legit took 3 full days off and I played like 30 hours.  And I‚Äôm level 26 lol
---
Just don't watch him.... Problem solved!
---
Ahhh gotta love people and how much of a prick they can be.
---
Hahahah that's awesome dude! I have a similar story but I'm from the states and ended rolling with an Aussie guild! In the end hitting 60 was the best achievement, &lt;3
---
Lol, told you so!
---
Shows at the top of the screen, cant seem to find out what it is called.
---
My tip is; get 4 other shamans in a party, and do the chain heal star! Looks pretty.
---
Hes a scrub that thinks his shit dont stink but we all know it does just like his upper lip stinks since he cant keep his trap shut.
---
They changed the stream title.
---
I'm completely new, so I have no idea, I've bought every spell and grimoire up to level 18. Is that bad? Only have 20 silver left
---
This has always been true. Holding threat via DPS is the best way to tank in Vanilla. 
---
The P-server meta (which had harder mechanics and numbers than Classic) was for Fury Warriors to be main tanks.
---
You were saying?

at least if they force you to name change you can spell it right this time with two g's

It's not. People are just mad and want to devalue what he did to make themselves feel better.
---
For me I had to update the bnet app first and then restart it.
---
who cares
---
Everyone knows it already. Vanilla was never hard, just time consuming and grindy/buggy. Yes you can die to a mob or two when levelling, usually because of resists/avoiding/missing, but that's about as bad as it gets.

I mean he has a point. Half these memes are really really bad. This sub was praised 4 months ago for not being like the WoW sub with cringe memes and ‚Äúlook what my GF made me‚Äù and now that‚Äôs at least half of what‚Äôs posted not counting que bitching
---
I swear you guys just need to post other content. If you hate Asmon so much just ignore him. you give him more content by making posts like these.
---
Oh yah it was too spectate other guilds and players which is why they only showed a leaderboard for their own players and gave periodic verbal updates on anyone else and went to commercial during the actual World first 60 ding
---
What a cope lmao
---
This - Also outing Ninjas in general chat is totally good and helpful, just don't cry wolf please.
---
Just found my first Silver mine today. Felt amazing getting those 4 silver ore.
---
Retail WoW isn't classic though. Classic had no layering and that's the "spirit" of the game. So I would say a "legit" speed run would be 1-60 without abusing mechanics that weren't in classic. I'm not saying he wasn't first, but what I'm saying is that if someone else matches his time without abusing mechanics they get the title of fastest classic run because we simply don't know how much time that saved him. However knowing speed runners they will just category it off as Layered/exploits, non-layered, etc. 
---
I totally agree that Method using someone to keep them logged in should get them a suspension. Flat out no exceptions, as a high profile guild they have even more of a duty to not abuse the rules. 
---
As for resetting instances, aren't they locked to 5 total? If so then I did this in classic. It's how I leveled my mage in maraudon before they nerfed the slimes. If they were exploiting that cap though then they need suspended.
---
Runescape/Guild Wars (1) player here. Playing WoW Classic is like how I felt when I played those games years and years ago
---
Where do I find the option to update the bnet app?
---
Off with the tin foil hat.
---
At the end of the day, there is always going to be someone that tries to invalidate someone elses hard work like you are now. If he didn't stream, people would just say he cheated and thats why he didn't stream. If he played on a PvE server, they'd just say well it isn't a PvP server, so his WF doesn't count. Didn't use a camera on stream, probably account shared. 
---
Like you said "don't stream". I can't imagine that Jokerd every though he would have 350k people watching his stream or would have so many players actively trying to ruin his chances at WF60. 
---
It is so backwards how much care people put into it. Like were you in the running for WF? Anyways, this WF wasn't ever going to be like the first time it happened in the original. When vanilla launched there were no quest helpers or quest guides, but I watched a bunch of people racing for WF use them. These guys had everything mapped out from the quest to the paths they would take. Hell, I'm pretty sure Journey's custom quest guide told him what to buy from where. 
---
Anyways, there is a difference between particpating in PvP and being ganked by people watching your stream who only have a single purpose and that is to kill you. By game logic, NONE of those players would have been anywhere near that zone without first checking out his stream because they were all too low of a level. 
---
But hey, if you feel like his WF shouldn't count, maybe you should start a [change.org](https://change.org) petition or something.
---
just because Ion did it and showed others how till do it, doesn't make it ok.
---
a part of the game was intentionally used in a way to gain an advantage in a way beyond that of the original intended recreation of the game.
---
just because Jos√© showed Mark what pills to take etc, that doesn't excuse the tarnishing of beating the home run record.
---
I've been using [this guide](https://youtu.be/IbRXBu1PSPA) while also running dungeons when I get burnt out, (joining /world helps find groups), it's constant exp, no need to fight for mobs and you can easily watch Netflix in the background.
---
Much salt, such anger, mega misery.
---
lmao, we did. We ended up speeding as fast as we could, just to see the Taragaman before shutdown. 2 of my friends have never really played wow much, let alone classic, so it was quite a bummer, but at least we had fun!
---
He hates having negative press. Honestly anything that points out his disgusting behavior to the wow community is appreciated.
---
Just make your own group and make sure you have a class that can resurrect for you. There so many healers, especially shadow priests, that would rather dps. even shaman once they get wind fury and want to just stare at the proc crits.
---
This. Any target switch causes you to lose combo points.
---
Did a run in WC last night and when the warrior chargednhe got stuck in some rocks. We had to aggro a mob to him so that he could taunt them, die, then get rezzed
---
That's too much to ask for most people. Nothing like making yourself angry all day by watching someone/something that you hate.
---
You could just have three accounts and confirm when all three are in a sep layer by standing next to each other.
---
Once you have sep layers on your accounts, no need to use random people.  Just add-on and anti afk the other two.
---
Obviously its distasteful because of the actions of who he is referring to. But let's get this straight its probably a joke. He'll probably have to change it too. Maybe not his name but the guild I think so because it's a clear reference. They're both fine in their own right isolated of course and his recruitment message isnt anything of master race speech. They are just words that translate to leader and my struggle. It's the historical association of it that bothers us and the fear of growing racism or whatever. First to bring people some clarity again, it's probably a joke and a cheap laugh if that's what he's going for. This was common in vanilla wow and all other games that you get teens and adults on and are usually fixed, to say give an instant 3 day ban is ridiculous. First you give warnings and remedy the problem, if the case is severe immediately you give a ban. If they dont stop after the warning then yes you give a suspension. Some of you are acting like hes a neo nazi sleeper cell recruiting in WoW. Stop being so sensitive and taking everything so seriously. There isn't a nazi growing epidemic. The only epidemic we have is we can't differentiate between real threats and problems and ones that are just punks making jokes. Some of you sound like you would lock up a teenager if he was trying to be edgy by doing a Hitler joke. People naturally joke about uncomfortable and serious things for a reason, especially ones in history and usually younger people.
---
ToS States that only a parent and child can share an account of the child is a minor.
---
Unless your friend advertises it in game then Blizzard won‚Äôt know. Only exception to that is if you two live pretty far apart.
---
He was quite stacked already, had over 400g collected.
---
 6 levels doesn't tell you that much except the "roleplay flavor" of the class or whatever to call it. Some classes takes a long while before they take off. For example a hunter gets his pet at 10, druid bear at 10 and cat at 20. Makes a huge difference.
---
 Can take myself as well as an example. Rolling lock for the first time I enjoyed it initially. After doing my first dungeon as a lock though, Deadmines at around level 18, I felt less enthusiastic.
---
 However once I hit level 20 and got rain of fire that single skill made it a lot more fun. Was the tool that was missing. Just enjoyed playing the class a lot more when I had an AoE option.
---
How early do you recommend? I'm Pacific time.
---
Get some fresh air once in awhile.
---
Because this dude‚Äôs done 1-60 like 50 times already. He doesn‚Äôt want to go slow.
---
so. much. soy.
---
You'll use a ton of other abilities to CC your opponents or to distance yourself from them or to shield yourself from damage, as well as using Presence of Mind+Pyroblast for your burst combo. Frostbolt is nice because it's quick and slows, but you'll definitely be using a ton of different abilities in pvp; especially if you go engineering. 
---
Pve is different and you'll mostly spam a single spell but that's pve in a nutshell in classic.
---
Yep I mean battle shout. Same concept as why healers generate threat without doing damage. If you help your teammates, you generate threat.
---
Beats another post about a streamer.
---
No I don‚Äôt. 
---
Remember how long we were jerking each other off over #nochanges?
---
This is a total slap in the face to that. I don‚Äôt care about speed leveling.  But we should all care about someone who‚Äôs leveraging a game mechanic for nothing but self interest.
---
Could someone tell me what chat addon he is using?
---
Only items in raidlocked instances, not in regular dungeons.
---
Friend making weak auras &gt; add ons.
---
I think you have no idea what an exploit actually is, nor can you adequately explain why layer hopping is, peace
---
I've been having a crazy hard time to reach 10. I think I've played 6h and I'm lvl 9. Any tips?
---
You're gonna need to actually link to some clips of him doing what you're accusing him of.
---
I see a good amount of hunters but definitely below priest mage warrior rogue. Warlocks i see the least by far though. Druids shamans and hunter are low but not too bad. This is just in the barrens and org though
---
on iThunes too? gees
---
Yeah I'm 17 right now and most of the fun has been grouping for every quest I can and farming mobs til everyone's done. Even if its slower, I get more cloth and gold and I get to chat with people who I usually end up adding.
---
It's no different than paying for a movie or music, it's all just entertainment.

He's just saying anyone that thinks he was account sharing should report it so that blizzard can investigate and that will prove he wasn't.
---
Who cares that we put a space station in orbit, it just took math, thats thousands of years old lmao.
---
Go get some sun my dude
---
Instead of attacking the add-on, Blizzard should just fix the damn trashy vanilla AH. Yes, #somechanges.  
---
Very simple easy fix : Searching by price should actually uses buyout price instead of bidding price. Then it would be just fine.
---
thankyou. i got the quest from the dwarf to go to loch modan ill try that

Go the way of oldschool runescape .
---
Everyone with an active sub thats over lvl 30 can vote on changes/updates to classic a vote needs 75% majority to pass the polls.
---
Has worked very well for runescape its still oldschool runescape bur they have added a huge ton of content from this voting systwm.
---
Ik think honestly thats the way to go runescape did it and added new content and the game is still like it was.
---
I got a quest to vitit LM just then so ill try make my way there. and then go back to westfall. ty.
---
cya
---
Did you freeze it so it didn't stink?
---
I don't even know why this is a thing that people keep saying. I'm pretty certain that player campfires never did damage, and the majority of doodad campfires do 3-4 damage every 3 seconds or something, which has a hard time killing even a level 1. It's only a couple of the bonfire's that do something like 10-12 damage every half second or some such and can potentially kill max level players.
---
These ppl never watch streams or anything either
---
Wow that's awesome!
---
I've tried that and still nothing :/
---
Maybe someone has reported it to steal it?
---
Kk thanks, appreciate the help
---
Yeah right, this doesn't make any sense lmao.
---
Exactly how it feels to me. I'm glad others see what I see. I like retail okayish enough to play, I want to try classic because I didn't start until BC and wanted to see what it was like in the such highly lauded olden times. I'm enjoying it but some people have on rose colored glasses still or something.
---
This is exactly how I feel. I may be a Warrior, and I may wear mail for now, but I'll be damned if I'm not going to throw on some common cloth shoulders I got as a drop. Team speak was LIT up with excitement at my first drop of shoulders. I love this game.
---
cya nerd
---
clearly you've nvr had a job either with a naive saying like shitting on things people are passionate about. 
---
as the world would call it, its time to wake up.
---
but hey i do give him creds, he achieved it and had the skill to do it.
---
So your upset about a 1 day suspension?
---
He said on teamspeak after that he just wanted to get it over with, as his competition had gone to bed anyway and wanted to save some hours so he could chill, thats why he started abusing it :D
---
But i mean all the instance farming players also kinda abuses stuff that wasnt in the game, using level 1's to reset instances so you end up at the entrance instead of spending 5 min running out?
---
But Ten Storms hasn't been made until Day 2.
---
It was actually one of the last 2 servers to be added.
---
Ahh, being willfully ignorant of facts that were presented to you. The bread and butter of the less intelligent
---
L0l sure if that means you play runescape!
---
Lmao you are a fucking asshat, free content for asmon
---
I srtsly enjoy how hard it is again, i talk with so many people trough the game cause i have to, i almost forgot on how much fun that is.
---
I also enjoy that i finally see people walking again cause there is no flying.
---
Hopefully blizzard will take notice and slightly change retail wow and make it more like classic.
---
yes, see this thread:

---
So I‚Äôm going to start playing in a few days. I‚Äôm waiting on my new computer to be delivered. Here‚Äôs a bit of my backstory:
---
Started playing when TBC first released and my main was a rogue. My other class was a warlock and played them both all the way through cataclysm and stopped playing. This will be my first time back and I‚Äôm super excited for the vanilla experience. 
---
Really don‚Äôt know what to go with this time around. I have tossed around the idea of playing a mage or priest but I just don‚Äôt know what to pick!
---
I‚Äôm afraid mage will be too squishy and priest will take forever to level. I‚Äôm also hesitant with priest because I‚Äôve never been in to healing. I‚Äôve always been dps. Endgame wise I‚Äôll be doing mostly pvp and might try raiding (would really love to but idk if I will have the time). 
---
What class will allow me to dps well, handle damage without melting in 2 seconds, and be desired for dungeons?
---
Bro what is that shield though???
---
This is 90% of management in a nutshell. The other 10% is to improve subordinate productivity.
---
get a fucking life
---
Is this alliance only?
---
Warrior is objectively superior to rogues in PvE as they bring everything a Rogue does (melee dps) and does it better. Infact, Rogues might be one of the weakest classes in PvE simply because they're so outshined by warriors. Atleast other classes bring buffs or something. Don't get me wrong, they still bring great dps, better than almost every other class but warrior, but there's just no reason to bring a Rogue over a Warrior. This won't be a problem in casual guilds where people just take the best they can get, but if you look at speedruns through raids by the best guilds in the world you'll see them bring very few Rogues and just take Warriors instead since they have the option to go for the best of the best.
---
PvP is very different however. Rogues have incredible damage without gear (you can google and see a lot of vanilla rogues killing people while being naked) and are therefore incredibly strong early game. They also have some of the best CC in the game. They're weaker than warriors in group situations but stronger solo early game. Warriors become the best PvP class endgame. Warriors are just insanely overpowered in Vanilla because they scale better with gear than anyone else.
---
I don't know, people on my post are saying it's not normalized right now
---
Wholesome and true
---
When you see a chest in a dense questing area.
---
I was there PogW
---
Why did they care about and falsely accuse jokerd of ‚Äúaccount sharing‚Äù if they weren‚Äôt participating in the race to 60? Don‚Äôt see why they would care about a solo bald gnome  if they were only going for rag and onyxia.
---
Wow. This was released?vanilla wow?  Noooooo... I can't....no.glad in broke. No wow. No.
---
Sure but that‚Äôs niche, just like VW. Better option almost always.
---
I haven't been part of the WoW community ever really since I stopped playing around Cata so I have no idea if this is a popular or unpopular opinion(nor do I know if Blizzard has said anything about doing this), but personally I would *love* it if once all the classic content has been released, they release TBC and WotLK for classic just as it was originally.
---
Even if it isn't "classic," I have never really heard a WoW player say they though those expansions were bad or made the game worse at all. It is entirely possible I have just been talking to the wrong people though. And even if that did happen I have no idea what they would do after that since my understanding is that Cata is when most people thought the game started going downhill.
---
Over the play button there is a drop down menu. Did you select Wow Classic there? From what you're describing it sounds like you played retail.
---
Except with better hardware üòÇ
---
Smithing*, I believe. But still.. Lol
---
I can agree, I want dungeon set now,  but it's hindered by time, TIME GATING!!!!!!
---
dAe AnTiFa ArE tHe ReAl NaZiS?!?!?!!!!1?!
---
Druid is a very strong leveler so it's a class you an level fast with. It is a bit slow initially though( like hunter until 10). Also I wouldn't worry about wasting time. The game is about having fun. Doesn't matter if you hit 60 a little later. It's equally a "waste of time" to play WoW doing 60 endgame raiding as it is playing WoW only doing 1-60 stuff, leveling alts, doing low level bgs etc.
---
 Personally I have already started to level up my alt for example. Not worried in the least it will set me back on my main. 
---
 I mean we are not going to play WoW for the rest of our lives. It's not like building a house. Eventually you will stop playing no matter if you have full naxx gear or no gear. The naxx gear will mean nothing to you at that point.
---
Shhhh let people enjoy things
---
Man I wish Paladins, Shamans and Druids were even close to TBC versions. The hybrid tax is more like a bend over free use tax in Vanilla.
---
I sell all my mats to vendor in the beginning. Need the gold early. Once I reach heavy leather, maybe medium depending on server, I'll start selling on AH. Not saying this is the right strategy it's just what I do.
---

---
BUT WHAT ABOUT THAT VANILLA EXPERIENCE?!?!?!   
---
Some people just looking for things to get upset about...
---
Dad?
---
Here I thought I was helping the cause just buffing people I walk by. This is a whole new level of awesome.
---
I've been stuck at 15 for the last two days because the Crossroads quests are scatterbrained nonsense and I keep getting distracted
---
People who were following the race to 60 knew to keep an eye on anyone who was getting records in recent private server races.
---
Insert ‚ÄúOne of us‚Äù gif here.
---
It's been an hour. So where is the proof?
---
Ask him on his stream :) He was the non-guildie so I'm not in contact.
---
OP is probably a fan, doing exactly what the streamer wanted.
---
In vanilla, when you saw a BoE you did not roll right away. You discussed in chat how everyone was going to roll need, and then all rolled need together.
---
Anything else is being naive, and exposing yourself to someone ninjaing an expensive BoE from you.
---
Not a word
---
DM is Deadmines. Don't @ me.
---
He was like 8 to 10 hours ahead of the second.
---
You are still on this foh weirdo
---
its almost as if context matters, at this point I think you're actually just trolling or extremely dumb, please stop posting
---
The best part for me is that I can hear him quietly losing it; "This charge hahaha, I gotta send you guys this clip." 
---
The fact that buddy made it over but the game it took one look at the Tauren and went "NOPE" has me in stitches. Thanks for sending *us* this clip!
---
He said then when he was going to play on a PvE server to avoid stream snipers and trolls.
---
But since he‚Äôs rolled on a PvP realm and has to deal with those negative parts of streaming he said fuck it and is going to use the positive perks too
---
Who the fuck cares lol
---
I genuinely expect a wave of free transfers will come in maybe a couple months when the population has somewhat stabilized. No point in offering them this early when it would turn low-pop servers into full servers from everyone trying to go somewhere less crowded.
---
For future reference you can copy paste. Also I think up arrow after hitting enter brings up the last thing you typed.
---
And then what?
---
No one answered you yet so I'll pop a guess, I know Pog stands for "Play of the Game" or "Player of the Game"
---
There might also be a streamer called Pog but I don't know for sure.
---
Twitch money? ( I have no idea who he is)
---
For 2 hours? You were above the number you started at after 2 hours? 
---
I‚Äôm on hour 2 of Incendius queue, and have gone down about 3k
---
Nostalgic feelings is definitely a huge factor. 
---
However, having my first capped character in MoP and me regarding MoP as the best experience and expansion of all time. 
---
I fucking Love classic. Its just so wild. theres so much to love. theres alot to hate too. I hate that all my killing is putting 1 dot on and Wanding. But i love giving folk Fortitude down the Road. But i also hate the extreme mana conflict. Sure working around mana is part of the experience like Downranking. But i want an experience where i can at least preform a solid rotation. like how TBC did with Shadow.
---
 I would kill for Classic to branch out and become a New product, Where Balance Druid is Viable! Or Paladin actually had an attack to help level! Or decrease a Warriors dependance of a healer to level comfortably! 40 man raids with alot more flavor!
---
Raiding does have a place for all classes but all classes only have 1 role unless youre real casual like. like locks arent allowed to deal DPS Dots mate!! But curses though...
---
And you're incapable of embracing the English language.
---
That's what happened to me on retail. I was named Orgrimmar for 3 years and then someone reported me, as soon as my name was changed there was a new Orgrimmar.
---
Clear teldrassil and a couple quests in darkshore for good measure. you can try asking a warlock in sw to summon
---
You look sick man ! Warrior goals
---
Thanks man. My wife is 7 months pregnant and hates my hugs right now. Pretty sure we bang more than hug lol
---
Fuck no, XIV is a fantastic game, it‚Äôs just a REALLY hard sell right now with the now-archaic A Realm Reborn questing. Thankfully it should be easier to get into come 5.3 when they ‚Äúcompact‚Äù the quests for 2.x. 
---
Shadowbringers otherwise is fucking fantastic right and 5.1 is looking even more hype (NIER RAID HYPE)
---
This makes me smile
---
I just spent about an hour or so grinding murlocs and spiders to get pearls and spider silk to make spidersilk boots.  Felt real fucking good clicking equip on my 22 priest.  She's wearing multiple pieces of self made gear, as my tailoring has remained competitive with my overall level for the first time ever.  
---
  
---
Making a new piece of level relevant gear feels fantastic.  Doubly so when it's a blue item.

If you‚Äôre not planning to dungeon grind or group quest as the healer, don‚Äôt torture yourself trying to level as resto.

Big Lenny, I was extremely confused and impressed when I saw Lenny on the stream
---
this is the only problem i have with it. if he wanted to take donos from the start and was up front about it then who gives a fuck, but before classic released he kept hyping up the grind and how excited he was to try to do it on his own. just feels sort of disingenuous i guess? i dont really give a shit though.

The goggles make this

which party/raid bars are those?

Namr a better duo

Was gonna go on grobulus before I saw the queue. Went to Deviate delight and there hasn't been a queue since day 1. No regrets.
---
What rules is he breaking exactly? you have yet to provide actual evidence like clips from is streams or screenshots. Also what do you mean by wintrading? What exactly was he doing to "break the rules?"

Warrior is what I recommend for what you've said you wanted out of a class, but if you don't wanna go the melee route, mages do fine.
---
If I were you, I wouldn't worry about those shitters.  Even if a twink item dropped, if I see the person immediately equip it, and it's class appropriate, it's 100% A-OK in my book, and I'd imagine the same for most rational people.
---
I haven't been able to get in at all. Just keep getting bumped from the queue. Once after four hours.

if you go to any capital like Orgrimmar ask a guard he will tell you where he is

Disney opened a new Star Wars area at Disney World yesterday.
---
If I'm not mistaken there are no official discords at all. 
---
Maybe a r/classicwow discord is official but all server discords are run by randoms who advertised them - nothing is endorsed by blizzard.
---
So I went from Nelf area till 8 then to Goldshire till 12 then loch Modan and then Westfall and also darkshore

Congrats - that's pretty badass

I never have enough time to deal more than like 50 damage ranged until I'm forced to melee...
---
This is very good info, thank you!!
---
Do you have any friends who have made significant progress on other servers?
---
Why do you guys keep forgetting divine spirit?
---
It's not though. It's hindered by *your* time but that's not what I'm talking about.
---
so edgy
---
So feral would be the best bet then? And how much is a respec? Is it no worry once you hit 60?
---
Shut the fuck up, Karen!
---
On the contrary, I'm assuming he has a shit healer, and probably shit DPS, because randoms usually are (at least 1-2 of your group). At that point, a shield is a huge upgrade, a matter of 4-20 damage per hit at low levels, when you could be taking all the hits for the entire group.   
---
Wearing the correct gear can increase your speed a ton at that level. Healer drinks less. Mobs die faster because you don't have to eat/drink every pull.  
---
I dunno, any shield upgrade can matter.
---
yes, both are excellent choixes.
---
"World first to level 60" was a clear banner on the bottom of the screen a couple days ago.
---
Ramen noodles in hotdog water?
---
Lol jesus you nerds settle down.
---
does it matter
---
I love it thanks for sharing
---
You won't have too bad of a time leveling with either class, hunters have great self-reliance in a pet that can tank for them, and mages have ways to kite around/freeze enemies. They're both pretty good for soloing during leveling in a game that can be suprisingly difficult to solo, but both pair well in groups as well. Both starting zones are good as well.
---
Oh nooo I'm so sorry. RS3 is the...special cousin of OSRS. Lol. I had an account get migrated to it so I inevitably have an RS3 account, but I still like OSRS much better in the same vein I'm playing Classic &gt; Retail.
---
How the fuck is someone playing csgo on thw TV
---
it happens IN game too :(
---
Green Jesus himself
---
xD are you dumb? One person getting to 60 means nothing. Method will still get the first rag kill.
---
I think my dad would rather move in with me for the good net to play Classic on.
---
All I find is a reference to [some idiot](http://www.reddit.com/u/Drmalcolm03).
---
This might be the best advice anyone could get here
---
Largely because it's a level 20 learned Skill as opposed to the others.
---
Really? I've seen a lot of people taking enchanting
---
He prob made well over 100k streaming in 4 Fay‚Äôs. Now do you know? Haha
---
People do speed runs all the time and waste their life playing video games anyway, he just knows how to play the game, obviously
---
There's like a 20 minute video on youtube about speed leveling and it really opened my eyes to the fun of it and adrenaline rush you can get. I wish i knew the video but I highly recommend it, it's super interesting even if you never want to speed level. Made it make much more sense in my mind cause I thought the same "wouldn't that get boring" thing too
---
so you're saying that in like 2 years of vanilla in a single layer, and progressing patches but essentially a similar game, nobody was ever able to beat 4 days 20 hours?
---
*wipes away a single tear*
---
Now that's how you close out a comic strip.  Well done, Mr. Watterson

if you count random fans pulled from world chat as friends, sure

Yeah but you answered like a dick.  
---
You could have just been like:. Nah man they aren't.
---
But no you were all:. That fake Pokemon shit is cancer.
---
See the difference?
---
You must be to close max range is 40 yards hunters are the easiest to leave due to ranged and also having a tank pet. It seems like you have skipped quests or something
---
Get a look at this fucking noob who decided to have a wife and kid instead of properly preparing for classic.

Humblebragging is still bragging. Enjoy your useless IP.
---
Just got my first ring tonight, The blue ring from the end of wailing caverns. This shit is amazing.
---
Official might be the wrong word. A popular, community-agreed upon discord I guess is more accurate.
---
it was always getting rag. being the first 60 means nothing
---
Old Ironforge definitely should be possible, though some of the wall clips from things like fear or blink may not work. Terrain things are 100% accurate as far as i'm aware (minus the fact GM Island doesn't exist in Classic)
---
The white keyboard on the the right is gorgeous, may i ask what make is it? is it the corsair k70?
---
Warriors and rogue can also use ranged weapons like bows, guns, throwing knives but poison can only be applied to melee weapons.
---
I fucking lost it at "is this World of HowsTheWeathercraft? "\\
---
I even tried restarting the launcher and game and I couldn‚Äôt find a queue
---
&gt;But i firmly believe it still has a lot of potential and I wish virtual worlds were still popular.
---
VR has kind of taken up the mantle for virtual worlds.  VRChat is relatively popular, I think.
---
Poisons have max number of possible charges. Once you use all 40 or so charges its gone.
---
 It's a difference of mindset. You want to progress and find that fun and that's ok. I am not worried about progress. I just play because I find the gameplay fun. Don't care about gear that much. That's also fine.
---
TRUE
---
No, they are in queue because the server population caps are too low.
---
You can make 15s a greater magic wand, even if you dont throw it on the AH. Always disenchant
---
I was 12, sitting on the fence about resubscribing 15 years later
---
Maybe I just have too much faith in them, but I don't think they would be stupid enough to release a cash shop in classic at any point. The target demographic of classic is people who hated most of what retail WoW had to offer, and the cash shop is a *huge* factor in that.
---
I don't see any way the money made on a cash shop would even close to make up for the number of lost subscriptions that would come from its introduction, and many that did stick around would also probably leave once they see what a detriment to the game it is.
---
Obviously there will still be people that stick around, but at this point they already have retail to appeal to the more casual fanbase that accepts those things, classic was made to appeal to the people that don't like those things. It would basically just kill off the classic playerbase completely, at that point they would all just leave and join a private server or something.
---
It's clearly a retadin weapon.
---
Professions won't give you an advantage with the exception of engineering. There's a few classes that have required professions, warlocks and mages best in slot until Naxx is the Bloodvine set which requires 300 tailoring for the set bonus. But priests don't have anything like that.
---
Engineering is different because it gives you access to a ton of different tools to use like a burst of massively increased movement speed, cc and damage. Most of them have the potential to backfire though, so be aware of the risks when using them.
---
So if you really want to optimize your character Engineering is a must. But you can get this at level 60 and just go with something else until then.
---
If you want to you could get two of the gathering professions before hitting 60 to get some gold. Those professions are: Skinning, Herbalism and Mining. I'd skip these though as they're kind of a waste of time. You'll get more gold by just getting to 60 as quickly as possible and start earning gold at max level more efficiently. But if you find it more fun to switch up the grind of leveling to do some professions that's totally cool.
---
Don't listen to people telling you to level tailoring to craft your gear; buying gear other people have crafted in the auctionhouse is cheaper and more efficient.
---
It‚Äôs a simple wood, but it‚Äôs worth doing.

If you don't like him why the fuck are you watching his content, get a life ffs.

Okay so I did some digging and figured it out!!
---
So, in patch 1.9 the *movement* speed of all pets were normalized so that certain pets like Bangladesh couldn't run down players on mounts. You could now only increase pet move speed by talents.
---
In patch 2.01, all pets had their **attack speeds** normalized. So, I do believe the attack speeds are still going on!

Yeah...15 years later, and I am still disapointed that my Tauren don't get a TOTEM TO HIT PEOPLE.

Click check for udpdates
---
Warriors are one of the best endgame classes, but in exchange they have one of the hardest times levelling out of all of the classes. They scale super hard off of gear. You'll notice when you get a big weapon upgrade, you'll be able to easily clear quests again for a few levels until the weapon falls off.
---
I'm not salty at all, I don't think I'll reach 60 for 3 or 4 months. and I played a lot 15 years ago. so I would prefer to go at a moderate pace
---
Can someone put the Green Hill zone theme behind this?

I Would for sure, But all my RL friends and long term (5+ years) online friends from WoW retail are on Faribanks... If server transfers existed I'd certaily be willing to transfer with them...

Wow that's so interesting dude. Thanks for oversharing this pointless story to us, strangers who don't know you or your wife, don't care about you and never will. I recommend you leave it on facebook next time.

Part 1
---
As my first classic dungeon this was a horrible experience. The worst part is, I won‚Äôt even know if Blizzard will even look into it. Therefore, I decided to write up this experience to share with the server as a warning of these people and their guild. 
---
Guild: exceptional
---
Members:
---
Grayballz
---
Obstruction
---
Kayvinh
---
Non-guild/other members:
---
Rickpickle
---
Thotsnprayrz
---
At ~12 am on Thursday, Aug 29 I was in Moonbrook finishing the Defias Messenger quest. I got asked if I wanted to go to Deadmines, I accepted the request from Kayvinh and joined the group. We still needed a healer, Kayvinh was posting to gen chat. After several minutes I see that the other 2 party members are both in Kalimdor so I asked: ‚ÄúWhy are 2 party members in another continent‚Äù? One of them(Grayballz) then replied with ‚ÄúWHO IS THIS FUCK‚Äù. At the time I thought he was talking about an NPC or a mob because it was so abrupt (later on I realized the 3 I was with are all in the same guild and this made more sense). Kayvinh said they would hearth here, I said oh, alright and then we proceeded. 
---
Grayballz was a druid and leader of the group. Obstruction was a warrior tank. Kayvinh was a mage DPS. I (Rickpickle) was a hunter DPS and Thotsnprayrz was our healer.
---
The first 2 bosses went fine and now Obstruction went afk, we proceeded. There was no CC needed or marking done on anything thus far, just take enemies down one by one. When we got to the Goblin Foundry, Grayballz said twice in all caps ‚ÄúWATCH THE AGGRO IN THIS ROOM‚Äù. I knew beforehand the troubles in this room(run Deadmines 50+ times) and had my bear on passive. On the second pull, Obstruction comes down the ramp with 3-5 mobs attacking him and brings them into us. Obstruction dies but the rest of us barely make it through the fight. The first thing Grayballz says is ‚ÄúI HATE THAT FUCKING BEAR‚Äù. I said ‚ÄúDid you not see Obstruction come down the ramp with all those pats? It was not the bear at all‚Äù. At this point, Thotsnprayrz whispered me ‚ÄúWhy are they so toxic? Anything more and I might leave‚Äù. We proceed through the Foundry as Grayballz kept spouting off. Eventually Thotsnprayrz openly asked Grayballz why he was so toxic. He then said ‚ÄúTHIS FUCKING GAME IS FOR ADULTS‚Äù and ‚ÄúYOU ATTACKED A SHEEP‚Äù. I then said, ‚ÄúThis entire time we have been using AOE, if you want to CC then mark the fucking mobs‚Äù.

Using a soup analogy to compare polls of maybe 5 thousand people and an entire country of 327million. Down right moronic comment.
---
lol stupid me
---
The problem was that the client wasn't automatically updating. I had to download the battle net app again and allow it to patch itself that way. Thanks for all the help everyone.
---
Pet attack had an error in the code, one extra ". It should work fine now.   
---
The follow one is just bugged. I haven't figured it out yet, but just delete the line and change it to "/followme" with no quotes and it should work fine. That will just remove the anti spam code.
---
Now I wish I reserved the name Supreme. Tailoring I'd make one of each item per month and that's it. And charge crazy prices.
---
He was never heard of again
---
Congratulations to a very fast 1-60 record.. what made it less special for me and other people too is that he was "abusing" the layering system for instant respawns. Other than that he deserves a break and then back on the horse for another class!
---
Don‚Äôt be so lazy

30 minutes and you get pushed to character screen, additional 30 minutes you get fully kicked. Use remote desktop program on phone to manually move through the phone to keep your login.

I saw that as well and was like wtf
---
Ret became viable during T5 in BC. As long as they had windfury they were respectable DPS and scaled well enough that by Brutallus it wasn't uncommon for a BIS blood elf ret paladin to be pulling 2k dps. They also buffed the damage of their group with sanctity aura.
---
Generally not worth taking more than one but I raided all of BC as ret up until Sunwell killed my guild.
---
For what I like to do in runescape, they are functionally the same game but rs3 looks better lol
---
whaat
---
That's what he said, yes.
---
So is the official stance that steam link is ok? I know they updated TOS to ban cloud gaming and game streaming activities, so I'm confused if it's good. I'm more interested in streaming to a shitty laptop but this would be good too...
---
You are so cool for not knowing or caring about this stuff. Thanks for letting us all know how much you don‚Äôt care.
---
even without ! - it does nothing. shift works fine, but not ctrl.
---
Doesn't grinding the same bosses for months get boring?  His dopamine hit is getting the next level instead of a new piece of loot.

Ikr. Plus no specific tag searching.

---
I was confused until I looked up and saw the character is supposed to be English.
---
Still love Urban tho.
---
Why though? I could be completely wrong, but weren't tokens just the item that let you buy subscription time with in-game gold?
---
The only possible downside to that is that since it can be traded, the person buying it is basically trading real money for gold. But if this wasn't an option, the person selling it would instead just be buying gold from a gold selling website anyway, so the only actual change is that when someone buys gold, someone else gets a wow subscription out of it.
---
My group policy as a rogue:
---
Step 1) Start group
---
Step 2) Do not under and circumstance invite a hunter or druid to the group
---
Step 3) Paladin tank, priest heals, 2 caster dps
---
Step 4) 2x cruel barb and defias chest uncontested
---
umad old man?
---
I mean just reroll then.
---
Part 2
---
We then get through the following caves but Obstruction goes AFK again mid-way. When we get to the pirate ship room, 2 fights before Mr. Smite, Obstruction goes AFK again. Thotsnprayrz asks if we‚Äôre going to continue and Grayballz says ‚ÄúNO HE WILL BE BACK WE WILL WAIT‚Äù. (I‚Äôm assuming he thought we were asking to look for a new member). Mid-ship the defies belt drops and I rolled need on it because it was better than what I had on at the moment and I knew Grayballz was going to roll need as he did on a majority of the gear so far(even though he was already wearing better items for the most part being level 22). After I win he says ‚ÄúYou dumb fuck what does a hunter need strength for‚Äù, then ‚ÄúCongrats but answer the fucking question‚Äù. I just said ‚Äúthx‚Äù and moved on. 
---
Obstruction comes back for the final fight and everything is going along fine and then I was kicked midway through the VC fight. The 3 members of exception stopped attacking the boss so that I would be teleported out before we finished. I ended up finishing the boss off with about 3 seconds left on the timer and tried to loot the body. I am still not sure what I could have received as I was now teleported away. My hearth was still set to Darkshore so I was teleported there. I registered a complaint and asked Thotsnprayrz to do the same. Thotsnprayrz offered to take me through the instance again if I needed.
---
Didn‚Äôt matter if it were new. It‚Äôs just an OEM pos.
---
There‚Äôs a separate action called ‚Äúshoot‚Äù which auto casts your wand on the current target until you take another action.
---
Yeah google remote is the way to go
---
30 days, you have an unlimited amount of time within that 30 days

Man for future reference dont use twitch emotes when you're not on a twitch... if you're talking to someone and you say pog and they don't know what you mean you can imagine how weird it is.

ahh goodpoint!

---
Haha! I'm in southern Georgia. Boss already called off work until at least Thursday due to Dorian. He said we'll revisit when Thursday comes and see if we work at all next week.
---
Ouch
---
no u
---
I've bought a wand for my priest on ah, worth all 10s
---
It's classic. STR = melee attack power, so rogues, DPS warriors and druids want it.
---
So it's not much worse than the normal autoattack retribution Paladin leveling? I can imagine swapping at lvl 32 just to have a different grinding experience + being much more capable to tank dungeons
---
How do you get honored?
---
Prot paladins weren't really sub optimal after they buffed their HP pool at the end of Karazhan. Paladin main tanks were viable all through BC after that change.
---
I'm sitting at almost 2g now at level 16 but I've been strategically not buying particular low-priority skills
---
you a marriage counselor?
---
U upset?
---
Server transfers weren‚Äôt a thing. Just re roll
---
Ask the guards
---
No one cares if you like him or not lol.
---
Cool feral druid.
---
Mage definitely. But that's just me lol. They're by bar the fastest leveler tho that's a fact
---
i sold a recipe for 2g as a level 13 i feel like bill gates
---
You'll be able to access it. Game has been out 4 days and they have updated the realms twice already they will become more and more stable after this weekend is over. By next weekend I think we will be in a pretty good place queue wise.
---
I think what you might be looking for is somewhere along the lines of a Druid, a Shaman, or a Paladin. All three have plenty of variety, and are able to adapt to all sorts of situations, especially in regards to PVP.
---
If we end up with a classic+ scenario my hope is that they rebalance the hybrid specs to be more viable. It's far and away my biggest gripe with classic, and Blizzard clearly agreed considering the overhauls the hybrid specs received in BC.
---
I've seen the piece you mean tonight. I suspect it was just a design oversight...
---
GET MAD
---
Till they do.
---
You will not feel a 60/40 ratio. If you do roll Alliance just make sure you meet people to group with
---
Of you find you aren't using some spells then yeah just don't buy them. The cost of them now will become trivial later on but spending say 50s on a skill will be a lot of money at the time
---
The positive perks are he is a millionaire.

---
You're right he likely is just edgy and thinking he's funny. The thing is though that nothing of value is lost by name changing this shit at least if not 3-day banning him. They did it in Vanilla and they should do it now. 
---
You talk about cheapening the value of what is hate but what about cheapening the significance of these historical events? Oh yeah the Holocaust and Hitler are just a joke. 12 million people killed by the "Fuhrer" and 70-85m people killed in the wars he started. By all means though lets just let 14 year old edgelords turn it into a cheap joke. 
---
There is a reason why the name Adolf has significantly dropped in popularity since WW2. Being named Adolf doesn't make you a Nazi but the name Adolf definitely brings to mind the most famous Adolf in history. Humans make connections subconsciously.

My last active month on retail was the month Legion came out. I hadn't played since end of WotLK. I was apparently bring in some holiday pay, because I spent $85, including subscription that month ü§¶
---
Don't worry about the split. You're in queue which means the server is relatively populated as is. Say 10000 people right. 40% of that is 4000 people. Starter activities have to be done by everyone and early on like this the normal distribution is going to be skewed with a large number of players pre level 20.
---
I'd say in our example you'll have 2000 other players around your level doing the same stuff as you. Play what you want and have fun.
---
You need to visit the weapons trainer in every capital and learn weapon skill from them, it costs 10 silver. Every city the trainer offers different weapons. You can ask a guard in any city for the weapons trainers location.
---
30 days from the day you bought it regardless if you play or not.
---
I respec entire characters multiple times a league. The amount it costs isn't cheap but it isn't expensive either. It costs less than I can make in an 8 hour session of playing. That's really not bad.
---
Leatherworking takes so many resources to level, you'll be broke. You'll also likely not be able to craft nice gear for yourself on the side, unless you invest extra time. Classic is kind of set up so that 1 crafter needs to be sustained by 2-3 gatherers or more.
---
I mean if the server is high pop or full, there will be plenty of players on both sides
---
You mean Nyhm, lol?
---
From my experience at level 20, the VW only holds aggro for about half of the mobs HP on average even with rank 2 torment, i dont have the VW talent yet so i dont know if that makes a difference

I've had zero problems and I'm not even hardwire from the router to the steam link. I can play any Steam game streamed with no lag to my high def two floors down. I miss couch gaming and this lets me do that and have my son watch me and get exited about games. Just finished Yooka-Laylee and he loved it

Lvl 28 on my priest. First time ever playing priest and it's a blast. Shadow priest is a ton of fun and can still heal the dungeons
---
This. Its just so annoying to do now, and some mobs are outright impossible to do it to. Its not *impossible,* its just frustrating.
---
It was obvious that he will beg for gold, he is too used to fan service at this point.

MALD BOOMER LULW
---
If living in the past is having a blast and bonding with my fianc√©e and housemates over a beloved game then I‚Äôm cool with it.
---
r/im14andthisisdeep wants you, though.
---
Okay I‚Äôll check those out
---
Oh man, 30 year old dad with two kids and Mrs plus house as well. When I looted that 6 slot bag I was so god damn happy. First thought was, "YES! I CAN BUY ABILITIES NOW!"
---
I've leveled an orc shaman to 15 and I'm not enjoying it very much (not a fan of totems), I'm thinking about swapping to an undead and playing a different class or changing factions entirely as I enjoy alliance zones more. I'd also love to be able to raid though I wouldn't consider myself very good at the game. Any suggestions?
---
Sadly, they're unlooted.
---
Had a queue did not like. Moved to low server... it filled, now queue there... moved again... queue there... so should I reroll a 4th time so when I get home at 7p it might not be full but maybe the it will? It‚Äôs a popular game at the moment but telling people JUST MOVE TO LOW POP when low pop become full servers in 2 days really isn‚Äôt an answer...
---
Thanks for this
---
If you enjoy healing you‚Äôll enjoy healing as a shaman
---
So unnecessary that you HAVE to do that to even have a chance to play, though.  I wish I know what the hell they were thinking.
---
Heck, even my server's #1 player was ahead of the method guys for the first 3 days until he took a proper sleep yesterday.

LOL Bitch I'm on Sulfuras, I'm in a 15minute queue right now.
---
Nothing is required but Engineering and First Aid will give you a slight advantage if you're min/maxing.
---
tee hee the holocaust is just childish bullshit
---
Even at 5am est its at least at medium during the week. I suspect this weekend for it to be high or close to full at that time though.
---
Is the white raptor mount already gone with the current patch?
---
Lol it‚Äôs pretty funny that people bitch about queues so much after they‚Äôve warned everyone...some things never change
---
I've tanked deadmines easy peasy as a paladin at 20 with relatively crappy gear. But you need consecration.
---
That might be why there's a wait list tho.... Afkers
---
Funny that you can actually see the ground, my experience was much different with people everywhere in the first 30 minutes of launch
---
If the sever you're looking to join is PvP then one important thing to keep in mind is the potential long term faction imbalance. It's not uncommon for the smaller faction to get annoyed with being ganked and kicked out of questing areas purely due to lack of numbers, resulting in people jumping ship to another server. This can mean that minor faction imbalances become major as time goes on. There have been server imbalances as bad as 70/30 in the past which can make the realm unplayable for the 30 side.
---
Unfortunately there's really no telling if that will happen. It's just complete luck if your server has people that are gank happy, can tough it out, or want to leave. If there's another server you can join that is closer to 50/50 then maybe try there. If it's a PvE realm then it should be safe. There will still be the struggle for farming materials in the world but you won't have to worry about getting ganked.
---
As for actually seeing people, you should be fine in that regard. The servers will slow down eventually as people finish farming the materials/gear they need and thus log in less, but Classic should be populated enough that every server will have healthy populations for a few years.
---
I was blessed by autocorrect. :(
---
I‚Äôm using team viewer. It‚Äôs a free app that allows you to take control of your pc through your phone remotely. I will say though. It won‚Äôt connect if your pc falls asleep. I‚Äôve had to turn my sleep timer off on mine so I can queue when I‚Äôm at work.
---
It‚Äôs the worlds first for classic wow.
---
I think that‚Äôs why..
---
He exploited the layering system the guy is a pos.
---
I can't complain since one of the guild members is a streamer (not super big but enough to do it full time) so they choose Faerlina knowing that (and they wanted epic pvp).       
---
        
---
Still I wish Blizzard made an even bigger effort to manage the queue times.
---
Second this. But turn the sleep function off of your pc. It won‚Äôt connect if it‚Äôs in sleep mode
---
Yes. By not giving proper context, you make it sound like his achievement was made by abusing game mechanics the whole way through, when in reality it was because people were actively trying to stop him.
---
playing without the GE? perish the thought ^^btw

"World first" Sure...

This.

Its not like he put on Godmode or something.
---
Most speedrunners are on the spectrum.

Because they are exploiting layering and this joker even streamed it he should be banned.
---
Played since vanilla. Got my first legendary in cataclysm, the rogue daggers from death-wing. I think MOP then introduced rings i believe that anyone could get, solo even? I was like WTF. Worked so hard for those daggers and had to have a raiding guild to do it.
---
Now everyone gets a orange!
---
The reality is just me not playing, to be honest. And they don't care, which just hammers home that I SHOULDN'T be playing anyway. Fucking depressing.
---
Nice
---
Consecration helps if your group sucks and doesn't know how to focus targets.
---
I'm talking low level shit like deadmines and sfk here.
---
I've never experienced more than a 20m queue .. if your complaining about anything less than a half hour then good luck. I'd quit for a few weeks till it dies down. 15-30m is nothing and has been here since vanilla for full servers.
---
Yeah my guild had a prot pally as MT in Black Temple.
---
I don't like saying that Retail is designed for casuals since it's really not, and Classic is actually a much better game for casuals imo.
---
Please let me know what server you‚Äôre on so that I may join your guild
---
No one I know is flocking to popular realms. My friends and I wouldn't care if we were the only people on a server. We just want to play together and, as we move to accommodate our friends joining , queues move as other people do the same thing.
---
WoW mom here too! I play during naps a d after bedtime. On Atiesh ally side. Maerianna
---
Our group got split because of the OCE server situation. A few friends jumped into the PvP server early, and a few of us missed the boat. Rather than wait in queues and complain, we jumped into the PvE server. Group has steadily grown, and looks to be a couple more joining us. I'll miss the world PvP, but there was no point sitting in queues for hours waiting to play. Still enjoying the shit out of it.
---
That was 3 months ago. I don‚Äôt want people to be manipulated or misinformed, but going on an ‚Äúonline-crusade‚Äù isn‚Äôt going help. They‚Äôll login 3 months later (this week) and see the nights aren‚Äôt as dark.

Why do you think you made a mistake on playing hunter?
---
I‚Äôve been really busy this week and was on the verge of posting something like this because I feel like I‚Äôm missing something. I haven‚Äôt hit a queue once on myrzael. Why did people glom onto certain servers? Is it a PVP or region based thing? Is it following the streamer ‚Äúcelebs‚Äù?
---
Get your friends and start over on a new server. It‚Äôs only been a few days.

Is /cancelform not a thing in classic?

Wut
---
Does layering actually crashes?
---
"World quests pop up temporarily on a staggered timer, such that you can only complete a select few at any given time.
---
Since WQs are required for rep, that's time-gating. I don't get how you don't see that." - Some guy on the WoW forums.
---
Let me rephrase it for you then, kind internet stranger.
---
Go fuck yourself!
---
It's also a lot easier to deviate from the cookie cutter build when most of the talents have fairly minimal impact and you have so many points to use, versus only 4 or so truly impactful talent choices that are basically must haves like in retail.
---
I thought that won't happen until phase 2?
---
Yeah, it's annoying.

Can someone give me a run down on why asmongold is so popular? I‚Äôve never actually watched his stream but see that he has both vapid fans and salty haters. I understand the haters because the guy must be laughing all the way to the bank, securing the bag by playing video games. I‚Äôm jealous of that bitch too. But why are his fans so die hard loyal? Is he like absolutely fucking hilarious on steam or something? What‚Äôs his content?
---
That's that retail mentality, man. It's silly to be try hards in early dungeons when folks only have 7-8 points into any of their specs. As if that 5% whatever really makes or breaks a class.
---
I was healing just fine and I'm enh shammy. I just saved all my mana for healing and was smacking mobs alongside the tank.

Yeah the player himself just played a video game for 4 days and likely made thousands in donations.

Oh no, not merging realms!!! Why would that be more of a negative than, say, a majority of their player base being unable to play with friends and/or having 6 hour queues to get onto the server they grinded levels on (that was low pop when they joined) the day before?
---
Blizzard even took steps to prevent this the guy is garbage.
---
It literally is, it's intended for things that are offtopic and/or doesn't contribute to discussion, the latter pretty much holds true for these posts.
---
Also, calling people a kiddo doesn't make you right.
---
Agreed. It has the most impact in DPS in the early stages until 21.

I had a felstriker and ganked in BRM for a long time. Was in the servers first MC raid. Ran dungeons.

Correct.

They'll then go onto the forums and complain that the nights aren't as dark as they used to be and need to be fixed. (This has already happened). It's better to just shut down bullshit before it spreads.

I seriously said this to my guild.

It's good even as a casual leveling guide. Though blindly stumbling around is it's own kind of fun.
---
No that's a different context and a different joke entirely. The content is race in this case. I dont think blackface is inherently racist either. Painting your face a skin color that isn't yours isnt racist. That's ridiculous. It depends what you do afterwards with your painted skin which can make it racist. So yes just walking around with blackface in a grocery store doesn't make me automatically assume that person is a racist. I won't even assume it's a joke. There's nothing funny about it. Its just odd. Its about the energy you put behind your actions and words. Try to at least create a scenario that is obvious racism if you want to dismiss me. I dont assume dumb shit because I'm try not to be hypersensitive like the majority of people today.
---
I've never understood how people can play with their interface like that. To each their own I guess.

Btw I noticed your name is shogglez and my toons name is shogwat.

I've restarted on three "new" lop-pop servers that have quickly filled and built sizable queues. How many times should people be expected to completely restart characters? Who plays that way?
---
you gotta remember as well, naxx was only out for a few months before TBC, so there wasn't much chance for people to try before it was gone from the game
---
Implying no other speed runner is doing the same? Everybody is doing it to some extent. "Getting corpse camped by two Horde can you invite me and layer me?"

He also only did this seriously for 58-60.

I am so glad I audibled onto Bigglesworth on launch day.
---
Thanks for WoW @Chris Metzen
---
He only layered for the last 2 hours. Saved him maybe half an hour. He still would have been world first and he still beat the current record legit.
---
And your hung up on "time gating" because it's trending that you don't realize it's not really timegating
---
So you are the guy that comes running to tag my quest mobs after I've cleared around them.
---
I agree in general, but I still don't like how INT works for casters in a vanilla - because AFAIK it only improves mana pool, not damage like you'd expect (or like most other RPGs).
---
Just did that today...let the forts fly.
---
This is a seriously stupid meme.  How many rogues to you figure somehow forget that they rolled on a normal realm?
---
get ur grand kids to put ur chinese cartoons on the tv ur getting cranky
---
Yep, classic meanwhile doesnt give a shit about you. The shaman quest in the mulgore starting area for example. You first have to track all the way to that stupid bristle cave thing. Then you go back and then you have to go there again to get these 2 salves.
---
Just googled shadowbolt mouse over macro.

Not a bug; working as intended.

Nobody said it was relationship ending and nobody is judging her, one dude just said it was weird because it is. Nobody even remotely said there was anything wrong with it or that they shouldn't be doing that. The guy was literally just saying that normally people discuss that kinda stuff and the fact that they don't is out of the ordinary (aka weird)   
---
Nobody in the entire thread said it was a bad thing they aren't talking about it, don't know why you were so quick to jump the gun on assuming he was judging her or criticizing her relationship.

I mean why do people watch football instead of playing themselves?  Stupid right?

I don‚Äôt play retail. Haven‚Äôt played since Wrath and only used recount.
---
I do realize that. I have three irl friends that I want to play with, and when I told one of them on the first night that the realm he chose was full, we both picked a new one together. Then when our third friend showed up and told us that server was full, we switched again for him. Because no one is past level 15 in the first few days, and we‚Äôre friends - that‚Äôs what friends do. Are your friends willing to leave you behind when you can‚Äôt play with them? If so... well, it should be obvious.
---
I feel personally attacked
---
It's my back up server. It's good. No queues and workd seems populated. Chat is always lively and people are always in the roads.
---
Yep. I never subbed until classic because retail is shit. Just been playing private servers and project 1999 everquest
---
Dude seems to have a lot of info for a guy who does not care .

It‚Äôs been like 3 days, lol

Created a new BNET account for the wife to play classic with me.  When I click the "Try for Free" button it doesn't give me the option for Classic, just World of Warcraft.  Any insight?
---
Why is taking a screenshot so important?
---
They're called Raidpants...
---
Alright, thanks guys. See you in azeroth :)
---
Capitol cities are probably the main reason they turned on layering.  To keep them stable.
---
Fuck yeah!
---
Every time I tried to make an interface I really liked, I ended up going back to default because there's always something about it that's off to me.
---
So yeah, especially when it's kinda all over the place.
---
What is this, Warhammer?
---
that's a fuckload
---
MY friends won't move so it's either leave them or deal with it. I choose to stay with them.
---
You probably need a running subscription for it to appear.
---
No, not really. Vanilla - Wotlk got right that feel of slowly gaining power while you level. It doesn't really get boring for us. Hell, until scaling I'd just do 1-cap on every class instead of playing endgame. They got the power progression system right, all the way until they didn't.
---
Deviant delight best server!
---
As I mentioned in prior comments (and as is common sense), those "new" lop-pop servers that have quickly filled and built sizable queues. Not to mention the hours of grinding that people are wasting when they have to restart over and over. I've restarted on three "new" lop-pop servers with friends, only to have them swell in pop and have to re-restart somewhere else so friends can join us. How many times should people be expected to completely restart characters? Maybe I'm crazy, but improving a character is sort of...the point of the game?
---
Weird how timegating suddenly becomes a word you like to use after just saying you were glad it wasn't a thing. 
---
Funny how that works
---
Don't tell them this -- we like having shorter queues on other servers!
---
They added 8+ new servers within 2 hours of launch. I'm on one that came out in the first batch, and haven't had a queue longer than 20 minutes since day 1. They already provided a solution.
---
Seconded
---
That's why the thing to do is to have the person who rolls 'need' on the BoE equip it right then and there, where we can inspect to confirm that it was done. That way, they can't go auction it. 
---
Simple as...

Personally I'm glad this guy is stuck in queue. Reading his responses is hilarious and he doesn't seem like the kind of person other players should be subjected to.

The Zoram Strand is a bloodbath for both horde and alliance! On the plus side for you, STM and east Ash are horde-dominated.

So lovely to see people this happy and with the people they care about. No matter what it is that brings us together.

I do care that it's being misrepresented, yes. because part of wow is that things are achievable by anybody. and it specifically rewards people that actually put the time into the game. like Grand Marshal and stuff. like you know that that person is dedicated based on their gear or level.
---
Dude seriously just fucking stop. This is pathetic at this point, go play some pvp before you talk about it. Jesus christ, you should be required to have a pvp rank before you can post advice here.

           yyy
---
Damage is normalized, but not speed.  So benefit to Broken Tooth is keeping aggro easier or messing with caster cast times better than other pets.
---
The problem then becomes that almost EVERY weapon basically becomes a Hunter weapon. That's where the whole meme comes from. So a Hunter would basically be allowed to roll need one almost all weapons. Leaving far less chance for others to get something they can use.
---
F

the pet battle thing was one step of the whole fuck up wow tho ^^

Yeah only because it keeps Warriors from getting rage so it can be abused

Can anyone explain to me why everyone hate BFA? And why are people calling me a "retail player" as an insult for being nooby?

Myzrael had an hour queue at 6pm the first couple days, no queue now that they upped the limits though. Herod is still a 6hr queue after work and clears up at like midnight...

Mainly useful because it lists all of the quests for each dungeon and where to pick them up.
---
The first few respecs cost almost nothing and you can heal (or tank!) just fine as feral pre-60.

yeah, i wouldn't believe it if i didn't see it for myself.
---
I remember being a handful of actively raiding ret paladins on my server during BC, and I remember like mathematically proving that a ret paladin was worth a spot in the melee group.
---
It was rough starting out but once I got a weapon, some PvP gear, and some dps plate from SSC/TK nobody was questioning the wisdom of bringing a ret paladin in my guild.
---
Still lvl 9...
---
(That is what the comment above yours means - he is paying $15 a month for a slot, he can afk jump all he wants. This is Blizzard's f-up, not the jumper's.)
---
Thats sad and why i want layering gone when the servers die down
---
So.....no one knows how to spell rogue anymore, or what?

Instead of insulting us like a spoiled child maybe you could have used your fucking brain and thought "hmm I'm a busy man and launch week is going to be rammed, why not wait a week or two before playing"

20k?!?!? No way, maybe on retail where everyone has tons of gold
---
Succubus does okay damage and isn't that squishy at least
---
It's making use of an untended side-effect of a game mechanic. Also known as an exploit.
---
Imagine being this bitter lmao
---
Definitely agree. Playing Warrior and the song calls to me.
---
That makes sense otherwise world pvp would be useless.
---
Hald the fun is planning massive battles and with layering its harder
---
It's not exploiting though? He's using the game mechanic the way people have been using it the entire beta. People do it in Retail WoW too.  If blizz saw this as an exploit they would have added a longer cooldown between layering to prevent this, or something. It's an inevitability with layering, not an exploit.
---
This post reads like a COPY PASTA!!!!!! GZZZZZZZ ON THE COPYPASTA WELL DESERVED!!!!
---
I mean...are you really surprised?
---
Its asmongold...cant be mad at a dude that's being true to his nature.
---
It's the nature of the game that encourages players to act this way too, which I hope all devs are taking note of!
---
That's hilarious. He used layering for the last hour and a half of an *80* hour run and you claim to be upset about misrepresentation. You literally just commented above saying he got to 60 by abusing layering implying that he cheated the whole way. The only person misrepresentating here is you. 
---
P.s. It is achievable by anyone.

P.s.s People congratulating him are *because* of time he put into the game.

if community is that much great. I might just take a look . ive had 2 month subs for wow before and the thing is game was rewarding instantly and i didnt knew what the hell i was trying to do . ppl around me was saying dont waste time on lower levels just power level and go full end game and i was like yeah sure but i like rpg elements and big raids , big groups aswell . if i dont get these im not haviing any fun. I like rewarding but not that much like you wont get a legendary mace by just harvesting crap that sorta thing. 
---
so the question for the playerbase (although this question is repeating itself every week over and over again) ; Is it worth playing / investing extra time ?
---
One of my original motivations for leveling a horde was to kill the stormwind orphans. Imagine my horror after taking the time to level all the way to 60 and running to stormwind only to find out that they're immortal...

---
Yeah but it costs like half my mana.. then I gotta drink... idk man I‚Äôm only exchanging buffs
---
And you might have to farm for repair bills :/
---
Half these speed runners abuse mechanics. They tag mobs and get a whole army to kill stuff for them. That is how so many have been able to claim realm firsts in new expansions for years.
---
Yeah, ok, if that makes you feel better.
---
Then fuck off out of the game already and take your toxicity and manbaby whinging with you so mentally stable and actually pleasant people can enjoy the game without your negative presence.

Don‚Äôt reroll, it doesn‚Äôt really matter.

Play well and you will secure a raid spot.

What's a layer and how do i manipulate it? Does the player inviting me into party have to be in the same zone/area or can invite me from anywhere and as soon as I join the mobs spawn?
---
Its from a drop on the last boss of WC he drops a gem, then you turn it in to ratchet and then a tauren on top of WC and you get the shoulders. I thought the shoulders you have on were those because they have the same model.

I've been getting mega lucky with loot so far I literally have 84 int at lvl 20

I just laughed so hard at this my face hurts. Thank you :)
---
As cliche a saying as it is, when it comes to wanting instant gratification, in or out of WoW, 'we think we do, but we don't.'
---
the return of investment of classic is laughably small compared to the profit to be made in the asian mobile market.
---
Don't delude yourself there is a reason classic is so rushed and wrong in many ways.
---
Until L30 you won't have much gold anyway, so don't sweat it!
---
Just keep on doing your thing, avoid reckless spending, and you'll see gold pile up soon enough on your way to 40.
---
Enchanting is a big gold sink though and tailoring won't make you any gold either, so don't look at those professions as a way of making gold.
---
I was a about 7 when i played , tryed an orc hunter loves having a pet and shooting stuff with a bow but never made it past the starting zone.

---
Hover over the stats in the char pane and it'll tell you what they do.
---
Agi is attack power, crit, dodge
---
Int is mana, spell crit(doesn't matter) and lets you learn weapon skills faster(insignificant)
---
Spirit is mana regen(also pretty insignificant because the vast majority of damage is auto attack and pet).
---
Stat priority is what you should focus on items. Agi is the most important, so an item with higher agi is almost always what you should equip over other stats. In odd circumstances, you might take an item with less; but it's just a rule of thumb
---
Ahhh. So that‚Äôs why he was getting all those invites.
---
This seems a bit like self-worship, "oh we're special no one is like us"
---
You are not the minority, the big draw for a lot of people is that the experience is actually rewarding and meaningful and the game is tailored to provide that specific experience. This is why people wanted classic, this is why people loved vanilla in the first place. You're not some minority swimming in a sea of nostalgia driven casuals.
---
Hello everyone. I am new to this game, never played it before. I decided to give it a try because of the Classic release and I started to play Rogue until lv 14. My friends that used to play WoW told me that Rogue is mainly for PVP and that people won‚Äôt take you in raids, because Rogues are only for PVP.
---
At the moment I am looking to explore the game and play PVE as much as possible (I‚Äôm not a PVP person anyway). I guess I have to start all over again, but I‚Äôm wondering which class is better for PVE and really wanted in raids?
---
Note: All my friends USED to play, now I‚Äôm on my own playing alone :frowning:
---
Thank you for reading and I hope you‚Äôll have a nice day!
---
Better yet, get professional counseling.  You're deranged.

Sure and people are allowed to collectively decide what is and isnt acceptable, that's how society works. No one is saying the guy cant go make that joke to his stupid friends who also think it's funny but blizzard doesn't have to allow him to do it in their space. Obviously some people think it's sinister or it wouldn't be posted here...
---
ehhhh ive been to lfr, im not sure thats correct
---
But hunters can't use maces...
---
Murlocs were my bane of existence in the human starting area. Honestly, I believe I've learned more from classic murlocs than I have learned in leveling from 1-100 in WoD.

The real Classic was the friends we made along the way

What no one seems to understand is that most of these players (like me) joined when the server was low pop or new. They played and leveled and built up their character...then got stuck in a six hour queue the next day. So they moved to another low pop server and it happened again. When you get home from work at 6:00, you simply do not have 6 hours to sit in a queue, then play. I don't fault people who use macros to stop from being kicked.
---
It‚Äôs not. My point being I‚Äôm making sure I get my money‚Äôs worth, and if I don‚Äôt I‚Äôm not gonna be a bitch and blame other players. Instead, I‚Äôll blame the company incompetence is the actual cause for the grief.  Also, what the does baby-back mean? I know it‚Äôs a type of rib, and I get it‚Äôs supposed to be an insult, but I‚Äôve never actually seen somebody try to use as anything other than a joke.

Wow u r special
---
nope.
---
most towns have butchers or fish sellers my guy
---
If this happened, layering would basically never go away.
---
My 7 year old wants to play but I'm not sure he'd be able to do it? It can be pretty challenging at times
---
I should get him an account anyway, I'm sure he'll just fish and stuff lol
---
Had same issue tonight. Run normal wow. And then exit. Classic shows up.

You can download it pretty quickly.

But as mentioned. You need a sub to play it.

Don't know if I should keep the greater essences or sell them, I've been leveling with strange dust

For better or worse Asmongold lives and breaths World of Warcraft, and for a lot of people who want to enjoy the game, but can't due to modern WoW's game design, they get to continue enjoying the game through him and his streams.

Haha true. I just see all these pics of fun looking world pvp battles going on and I really want to experience some crazy stuff like that but all those servers are full af

Would  a Warlock not be better? Hunter's play style in Classic is so boring. Serpent Sting and Arcane shot on CD.
---
20 minutes?! ROFL. That'd be nice!
---
Personally I think all boe should all roll need.  Cuts out that ninja at the end that would roll need on his own.  Most of these leveling items you will replace in a few levels.  If a boe has a potential high value, there should not be just one person that can dibs it.  This would lead to people being left out.  Running sfk?  I wouldn't add any rogues just in case assassins blade drops I would want to sell it later.  Happy to tank for anyone else though.  You go to the dungeon for quests and the boss loot.  If a boe drops it usually had much higher value than anything there because it can be sold and everyone should get a chance.  Imagine this... instead of assassins blade dropping, a bag of 100g drops but it instantly goes to a rogue if he's in your party... if no rogue everyone gets a chance at it.  I can buy a really nice equal upgrade by selling that dagger first but I don't get to because I'm not a rogue?  Don't think so.  Everyone should roll need on boe.

Every speedrun allows for exploits/glitches unless the category explicitly forbids it in it's rules. The default is that anything is allowed and then you start working on the ban list essentially.
---
Hey mate what is the frame addons you're using? Looks like x perl from back in the day
---
There is a bracket for every 10 levels. 10-19, 20-29, etc. A lvl 20 weapon will never be used by lvl 29 twinks. Besides, no one has much money to spend on blue BOE right now.
---
Thanks for posting this. This is how I feel about paladin, but people dumping on it 24/7 gets me doubting myself every now and then.
---
LLEEEEROOOYYYY
---
;)
---
Not exactly my point...I have zero problem with people using macros to keep themselves from being kicked. I have many problems with the way Blizzard handled/is handling this launch.
---
That‚Äôs true, but which is a bigger issue, people playing on separate servers or separate layers? If everyone is on the same server but different layers and a player enters an empty area on his layer you can just move him to another layer, and similarly if an area is too full you could open a new layer just for him.
---
Whereas if a server starts dying you just kinda have to reroll or Blizzard has to start merging servers.

Not really, they didn't do the same damage in WOTLK assassination was the top tier dps spec and very straightforward as far as gameplay goes, combat was harder to play but a good player could compete with assassination, and sub was a PVP spec. You are thinking of recent wow expansions, TBC and WOTLK are very reminiscent of Vanilla because they build upon it. WOTLK had the best balance by far.
---
I love how much players interact with each other in Classic. I just had a lot of fun doing  doing a bunch of quests with this gnome warrior in Dun Morogh. Cool guy, we talked about a lot of things like hobbies, etc. I added him to my friends list, hopefully my dwarf hunter and he run into each other again.
---
Ahh man, using the last C&amp;H ever!? How is this supposed to make me feel!?

Good for him. I hope he jumps for another 10.

Playing level 1-60 of WoW is so much less monotonous than hitting the same 11 exits on Super Mario World, and that doesn't stop me from banging out shameful sub 20 minute pbs.
---
That's your dream.
---
The reality is an unskinnable corpse because everybody has full bags and leave that chipped bear tooth in or people don't know about auto loot option so they cba clicking all the items to loot.
---
Stop with that pogchamp shit, its cringy.
---
Twitch culture should stay on twitch.

Cause assholes need to feel a false sense of superiority to get themselves off at night.
---
Why do you say "to each his own" as if you're understanding of different mindsets but then use a disparaging tone talking about those same people right afterwards?
---
dude, I only care as much as anybody should. it's like if you express any opinion you all of a sudden are 100% on that side and are a cry baby otherwise. that's  not the fucking case.  part of wow is that things are achievable by anybody. and it specifically rewards people that actually put the time into the game. like Grand Marshal and stuff. like you know that that person is dedicated based on their gear or level.
---
your most handy for levelling is mining/blacksmithing.
---
after 60, anything works

Because they're not like other girls

BfA kinda treats players like they're toddlers, being over encouraging and handing them stuff for free. If you come into Classic and you don't know about several systems, a portion of the playerbase will call you a "retail baby" because you've had it "easier" than them. That's my best explanation. But why? Science only explains rational phenomena
---
RIP all that nice gold :(
---
you're fine. Horde does just fine without dorfs
---
Like he said, it‚Äôs not bad that you did. You‚Äôre just poor now. There are certain spells/grimoires that you don‚Äôt need. Some people never use the imp after getting Voidwalker/Succubus so they ignore all the imp grimoires. 
---
There‚Äôs certain class specific spells as well that people will ignore until a higher level or entirely. I‚Äôm not sure what those would be for a Warlock though.
---
The biggest expense for a leveler is a mount. Which you don‚Äôt have to worry about because you get one for free. So while it‚Äôs very nice to not be poor, as long as you can train the spells that you want then you‚Äôre fine.
---
The real answer here is everyone is paying a subscription and has a right to use the game in accordance with the TOS. If some people had to wait 4 hours in a queue every time they wanted to play then those people might not be able to play at all if they didnt have at least 4 hours of time available.
---
I think the frustration lies in just that: we've all restarted many times on "low pop" servers, then the pop swells and we log in the next day to 6 hour queues (or a friend tries to join Bigglesworth 45 minutes after I got in with no queue and has 11,000 people ahead of him). How many times should we be expected to restart before we get annoyed? I stayed up the night after launch and got a great start...and had to throw it away. I'm now on my 4th start.
---
I don't know why you would jump to such a conclusion, I was just stating that I've already seen people asking for LFG to be added to the game, I was referring to in-game chat, not Reddit.
---
I don't think they're trolling either as I could understand where they're coming from, it's not like everyone that's playing classic fully understands why so many people prefer it to retail.
---
World Breaker was one of my favorite maces! Then Torch of the Damned, I blew my DKP for that one lol
---
Why would anybody care about this dumb stuff. 
---
*watches sportsball
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm being really careful and only buying the spells/weapon training I need. I realized I could  for example basically skip training Fist Weapons as a hunter for a long time If I recall, there are very few fist weapons and even fewer epic ones in the base game anyway, not that hunters should be in melee range anyway.
---
So is the PvP balance the same as actual Classic WoW? Because back in the day rogues could one-shot people, and paladins and druids were sad beyond belief.
---
thats a new world record, I don't count private servers... CONGRATS TO THIS LAD!
---
Well a lot of frost stuff is based on slows and area damage and that won‚Äôt often be valuable in a raid situation. But dealing fire damage is not an option since everything is immune to fire damage. Because you can‚Äôt use fire spells or aoe frost spells, you‚Äôre left with a pretty small kit for those raids
---
They needed/wanted a cash injection, and so held back content originally planned for the game and made us buy it (again?). Fuckers.
---
Everyone roll need or everyone roll greed imo.  Anyone can sell that boe and buy an equal upgrade for themselves... why should one class be favored for the most valuable item in a dungeon?  Personally all should need to avoid the one guy that accidentally needs or does it on purpose.  You're whole group did greed and that's fine, just make sure everyone does.  Upgrade or not that item can be traded into an upgrade for anyone... of their choice in any slot.  If you lose the roll oh well, it's leveling gear that you will replace in a few levels anyways.  Right now the economy isn't there to sell the items for a lot but I wouldn't be mad that someone else wants to hold it until the appropriate value to sell it. 
---
Side note:  people that get mad about off spec.  Was running sfk and the shield dropped from boss and the other warrior kinda paused and I knew what he was thinking.  I told him to roll need even though I was tanking.  Told him I would roll on 2h weapons so not going to be mad about it happening the other way... this was after the boss that could have dropped the 2h.  He was happy to roll, I won it still but fair is fair.... we're leveling and we would both use a shield or a 2h.  Im sure I'll run into someone that will get mad if I win a 2h while tanking though.... and that just means after that point I won't run with another warrior or pally...problem solved in a non social building way.
---
How upset are you?
---
yeah but what you said was
---
&gt; Vanilla **is** easier than retail.
---
God Streets 1 12 what a legend
---
I'm relieved that you both have houses.  I'd be concerned otherwise!
---
I think the reason games have become like this is because we as gamers indirectly think we want these things that give instant gratification. Like a Dungeon Finder sound great in practice, but it ends up sacrificing the community of the players doing the dungeons. I had a blast earlier today with a group of strangers not even really paying attention to the battle because I was to occupied with chatting (we didn't die once, so s'all good). Flying mounts, flying is cool, but you never meet anyone along the way and end up working together. 
---
We think we want things without thinking of how that may change the dynamics of the game itself. And with such neglect over time we get to where MMO's are today.
---
Good! Please continue and don't feel bad! This launch was comically mishandled. No one has time to wait in a 6- hour queue.
---
Was my reaction too. Hit me right in the feels as an Aussie
---
you think you dont but you do
---
There are bunch of talents to make your spells be less resisted so check your talents :D
---
It was legit man. I wish he didn't layer at the end too but it was not a defining factor. Everything else he did was 100% legit up to that point. And it was only in the last hour and a half of the push. He also had horde griefing him so I think he did it to get away from them. I think after playing for so insanely long over a few days he just wanted to be done with it. He has done it before in that time on private servers and he could have done that run back on the old servers too. It was a literal marathon. Don't know how anyone can do 1 thing for so long at a time. 78 hours in 3 sessions is pretty crazy.
---
Fucking retards. You think we do because we do! Go back to making mobile games for China. It‚Äôs so crazy how blizzard can kill a golden goose that‚Äôs literally constipated with so many eggs and they refuse to let it lay
---
Jesus... He really is green Jesus...
---
That's probably the most intelligent thing you've said
---
I mean those 40+ vs 40+ Battle For The Bridge of Nazj are pretty fucking epic ngl
---
Don't feel bad! It is not your fault that Blizzard mishandled this launch!
---
Does that really make a difference though?  Microtransactions don't have to be forced to ruin a game. Often the game is just designed in a way that coerces people to buy microtransactions.  This usually changes the nature of the game significantly.  For instance WoW retail now offers a free level boost with new expansions so you can skip that dull old content and get to the new stuff.  Want an alt but don't want to grind the poorly redesigned, bland, and tiresome leveling experience?  You can just cough up $60.  It's not forced... It's designing a less enjoyable game inorder to extract more money.  It's not even that some evil Mastermind at blizzard wanted it that way. It's just the natural progression of people and companies doing the least and wanting the most in return.  The realty is with an industry full of microtransactions developers are incentivised to make worse games.
---
He‚Äôs a speed runner that only cares about the 60 server first. He does this, then deletes his character. Has done it the past few times a private server launches as well. His route is planned and executed very well and even if there was no layering I have no doubt he‚Äôd be world first. 
---
In a few years time maybe a new route comes out that works better for a different class that can beat his time. This is how speed running works.
---
Weakauras + omnicc. Just install and it should work without any configuration.
---
Having a single layer is INCREDIBLY important for things like world bosses, wiping other raids while they get world buffs, devilsaur farming, etc. 
---
Blizzard screwed the pooch on this one, but it isn't by not increasing the server caps.
---
I can‚Äôt even play because my queue is five hours long
---
Right, those are rookie numbers
---
He said they're forced.
---
Havent been to stv yet, but i was questing in redridge and had to take a break because i literslly couldnt get any mob tags there were so many people. And my server doesnt have a queue that i know of(westfall). So idk why your layer is so dead, but it hasnt been the same for my experience. If anything my experience tells me playing would be hell with out it.
---
It does say "game of the year".
---
How bad could it be?
---
You can't not get hit. The trick is to space those hits out in your favour
---
Alright cool, I'll give that a shot. Thanks!

Pally tanking doesn't really work in Vanilla. Think of yourself as an armored healer. 
---
Pallys are amazing at single target healing.
---
I just like the partial afk nature of it on top of the direction it gives me. I can just sit and fish while I do something else on my other monitor or go do some quests or aim for some kind of achievement. All small things I can click on look away for a bit then click again. To me, they are the same thing for both games but rs3 looks nicer and also I get a few cute bonuses that help my QoL. But I would never play either without a sub so I just wait for those free prime subs I get every couple of months.
---
Weird, for me I almost see the same people ever time while lvling,.
---
Account sharing will get you banned is why
---
I love it. Gratz!
---
Chrome RD is the easiest to set up imo.
---
Steam actually lets you play from your phone but it's painful without a bluetooth keyboard and mouse
---
I bet potatoes would work great! Or tofu. =)
---
I‚Äôm guessing that you have a starter edition of retail. Are changing the game to Classic on the launcher? There is a dropdown by the launch buttong
---
It‚Äôs awesome!
---
I was chilling in Thunder Bluff as a level 10 warrior with a grey rusty axe as my weapon, some one opened trade and gave a nice new green axe with more damage and +1 stamina. It made my day! 
---
Since I was making health pots I found another random level 10 warrior and gave him a stack to pay it forward.
---
The starter edition with a sub is enough to play classic
---
Racist
---
I thought it was supposed to be Australian
---
I used to play my mage with every single bound spell hidden and the rest of the hud was set up as a horseshoe like this but cleaner. you kind of look through the hud after awhile, it might have been in my head but it seemed like had a lot better awareness of your surroundings.
---
people are weird
---
Those things blew my coworkers out of the water when I first bought one. The one for dabs is great as well. 
---
Unrelated, is My Morning Jacket actually good? I've never listened.
---
Or he had 2-3 guys playing and they cycled through it.
---
Not your number 1 key bro. The blue and red bars on your screen. Your auto attack timer.
---
Just feels pretty strange when a level 27 can run through the entirety of STV on a high pop server without a single gank :0
---
Same, I thought it was the addon I was using. LoL
---
Bs is very expensive to level and generally you won't be able to create gear better than drops/q rewards with it. For it to lucrative you really need a rare drop like Lionheart helm or Stronghold gauntlets to make money off of it. If you don't mind sitting in a city all day you can make decent returns on Mithril spurs and shield spikes. These are all rare drops.
---
You don't need to level them
---
If you think having strange video game tastes constitutes self worship that says more about you than me. Also, claiming that enjoying extreme grinds and looking for them is niche shouldn't be a controversial statement. Most people wont enjoy classic wow for a long period of time. Most people will see how incredibly grindy making progress in this game is and quit.
---
No matter how much value you think Classic has given to blue items, a casual player is just going to put the game down after their 10th consecutive DM East run without getting the drop they need when each run is taking the better part of an hour.
---
If it's an alt, it's a lot easier:
---
\- Feed him cloth to level first aid with. Having bandages ahead of your level makes healing up a breeze.
---
\- Make or send him a weapon every few levels, so he's doing good damage. A warrior with an outdated weapon is a sad thing.
---
\- Potions potions potions. Healing potions are great, but troll's blood potions are even better. Passive HP Regen? Me gusta.
---
I was far more exicited getting my first green in classic then I was about mythic gear. It‚Äôs crazy because of how long shit take in classic yet I love it despite feeling like the crazy power leveling with heirlooms is so fast yet feels like it takes forever.
---
 /r/woosh
---
Playing a paladin for the first time, I like being a support class and helping other people. I think I will hopefully enjoy healing in dungeons and raids once I get the hang of it. I try to buff all the warriors and rogues I see with BoM, and heal others if I see them struggling with enemies.
---
Elvui, bagnon, questie, details!
---
Yes, but Thorium ammo is also crafted and has a sell price. Vendor ammo cant even be sold back to the vendor, you have to delete it. And you cant mix arrows and bullets in the same quiver/pouch so swapping between a gun and a bow is essentially a full change over while leveling. It's minor compared to the skills, I've probably spent less than 20s on ammo.

and I wish that people would present that to me instead of not thinking it's important. And I see that as maybe being a community issue; things matter differently to some people.

Hey, I just got home from work. I take it you got the download?   Not sure about the buff section for druid, I'm using it on holy priest and it works fine with the exception of the count down number being stuck at 99.99
---
Oh that's a big boy hon
---
Yes but I can't use some chat features with starter edition..
---
I‚Äôve been having a blast as a complete WoW noob. Staying away from guides as much as possible and exclusively just figuring things out our asking around. The world is so alive, it‚Äôs an incredibly fun and unique experience.
---
Cool! It sounds like they accepted their defeat and have shifted their goals so that they don't get demoralized. Most organizations do that if they can't meat their original goals.   
---
This whole thing seems like people want Method to dissolve after failing once.
---
Unless Wowhead doesn't show it, it looks like the Special Chicken Feed you can buy off Saldean is tradeable.

So theoretically it could be put up on the Neutral AH of Booty Bay/Gadgetzan for Horde to do the quest.

I used a Gorehowl until the Sunwell badge vendor polearm. I never, EVER saw another 2h drop. No World Breaker, no Torch, no Soul Cleaver, no Jin'rohk, nada.

Complete pain in the ass lol. I was so close to just leveling blacksmithing for a Stormherald.
---
Starter edition doesnt exist for classic.

My lvl 14 druid rocks some loincloth with 3 str and 2  int so it's still there.  Cloth item.

Thats how mafia works

I would stick it out. I've been a resto druid in vanilla. It's completely doable. If a group (group leader) doesn't want you join the next one. It can't be too hard to get a group.

Is there a way to change layers? I‚Äôve had this same problem.

30 level 60s will be enough.

I stupidly went Master Swordsmith when I really should have gone for Macesmith LolHerald! But oh well.

You need to make the rules clear before starting.  BoEs are sometimes fair game, depending on group.
---
Just keep swinging it bro.. you just need to keep doin it
---
People on here keep up with all these platitudes about progress but that's not the case on my server. The AH is booming and tons of players are in the 30s-40s. I actually feel pretty far behind at level 27 having played since launch. STV is packed according to /who but I'm not seeing those players. I have a very good memory of vanilla and I also played on private servers with far far lower population than this server. 
---
Running through a giant, important questing zone that is literally community renowned for PvP and griefing and not seeing a single other player is never how vanilla was unless you were on a DEAD SERVER.

Yeah thanks. I really did destroy you quite a few times throughout this, didn't I? 
---
I guess that is the benefit to WoW timegating everything. More time to read and learn
---
Each level your weapon skills max goes up
---
My other char was a shaman but I only hit 60 near the end of vanilla so never raid with him.
---
But that shaman have been my main ever since TBC drop, yes I've been playing since launch and WoW is the only game I enjoy.
---
LFG isn't a great suggestion, but I think it's important to remember that classic isn't like the Platonic Ideal of a MMO or WoW. A lot of people quit vanilla and never came back, some quit and only came back for some expacs, some stayed for all of them and still prefer current expac or thought Y expac was best. In it's heydey people still relied on lots of outside resources and addons to do things. 
---
I assume there will always be a *no changes" server now, but moving forward there are definitely going to be legitimate ways to develop the classic design mentality while deciding how to add further content. Personally I think other oath to BC and Wrath only leads to retail in the end and would love to see a Classic+ advanced alongside retail. We have plenty of easy ways to do so and keep in canon lol
---
I know you're getting downvoted, but I wanted to post to let you know I completely agree.   It's messing up the game.
---
The max goes up 5 points per level. There's not much you can do to avoid missing at-level mobs if you don't have access to hit gear or hit talents.
---
It's the same as patch 1.12. Classic was very diverse: Some classes were OP one patch, UP the next. In patch 1.12 Warriors are the obvious kings of anything when properly geared. The best PvP class, the best DPS, the best tank. Paladins and Shamans are both great because of the unique things they bring to PvE. Bloodlust, totems and paladin buffs. Paladins are pretty great in PvP. I don't know much about Shaman PvP I'm afraid.
---
Rogues have amazing base damage and can oneshot low geared people naked, but they scale mediocrely and get less and less good with each phase released. They'll always be solid in PvP though because of the massive CC they bring. Even if they don't deal amazing damage compared to warriors they can still stun lock someone for a very long time.
---
It certainly does for me. Says I have the starter edition which restricts me from some features. I am for sure playing WoW Classic aswell since the logo is on the top left when I log in. My paypal payment has gone through as I got the notification. Any ideas?

He did. Get some critical thinking skills and you'd recognize that fact.

You do well in up coming bg's.

You also, funny enough, pair well with dwarf priests, which can be good in raids.

Put myself in queue after work because no access to a computer there and just closed it to eat dinner and watch a movie with my gf at 2 mins remaining.
---
It's called capitolism my friend. You slog through the mobs all day to earn a bit of gold to make your life better. Abs these trainers sit in major cities, drinking and partying until you come around. They give you a sheet with instructions on it and "that will be 40s friend".
---
Who determines the length of my ride on wow? The player. As a player, I‚Äôm going to play for as long as I want. Once again, I did everything in my power to chose a low pop server at launch. Blizzard chose to open basically enough server to only house the players they banned from private servers. They did something stupid, they ignored the player base, the made mistakes. I don‚Äôt know how else to explain this, but it is basically never the players fault. You don‚Äôt like somebody using a gun in an FPS? Don‚Äôt get pissed at the player for using something in the game. Don‚Äôt like waiting in que? Get mad at the company that‚Äôs bottlenecking you, not the players. And comparing a theme park to a game is really like comparing apples to oranges. An apartment sized facility could house several millions of players, for a theme park to house that many people on rides would take enough real estate as a small country. To run those servers housing those several millions of players would take less than a hundred employees, the theme park would take thousands of employees. I get what your trying to get at, but you really are aiming you anger at the wrong target.

Sorry man, if I dont remote desktop all of this week while at work, I do not get to play......had to do it

Retail has nowhere near the amount of players that were around during WotLK tho?

When is this cope gonna stop applying? Can we stop overstating how hard leveling is so scrubs can feel better about being scrubs? 5 days is plenty of time to be over level 20 even with casual play.

Nice! I just hit 15 on my character (Warrior as well, represent!) and I‚Äôm pretty dang pleased with myself too

You should be more proud of making it to 24 on Herod

Plan A.
---
Mission no.1 - Survive -&gt; don't die easily.
---
Mission no.2 - Level to 60.
---
Mission no.3 - Learn from every single fight or battle to max your knowledge of handling your warrior character.

PS: In my opinion - dun take too much information from the outside, they let you ez to play but take off your pleasure of gaming.

Plan B.

Watch all guide, and follow the instruction, work it.

Thanks for the tips! I am mostly trying to figure out if I can get away with rushing Seal of Command and Pursuit of justice, or if Consecration really is needed for low level. I am new to both classic and tanking, so trying to figure the mechanics of threat and what I need to perform.
---
Isn‚Äôt that only a 3 day?

Then what would they do with retail?
---
FUCK. They got us! D:
---
Yep. My friends chose a high pop server for our clan after we couldn't get on initial choice. Currently waiting one hour to get on to try and catch up to them. Sigh. The wait times are stupid. Open up servers already dammit.
---
Blizzard lost the base code for vanilla. So, iirc, they bought out the staff of the most popular vanilla private server, worked with them do undo any of the private server custom changes and make it as much like WoW Vanilla from Aug 2006.

It's weird how split the community seems to be on this. I guess we'll have to see what happens if and when they start collapsing the layers.

Thanks for the help. I decided to try tanking since I know it's in short supply, but man, the amount I miss is crazy. And the bad thing is that because I miss, I don't generate much rage, and since I don't generate that much rage I can't get the mobs off my friend (healer). Literally have mobs shread off of me constantly onto him and then can't get them back because I have no rage. I'll keep swinging away and hope it starts working out, but I've been leveling a lock when we aren't playing together and getting close to switching over.

actually speedrunning leveling 1-60 is his whole thing.  He doesnt do raids/endgame he grinds.  He will probably delete the character and do it again or go back to speedrunning other things

But people like him are the reason the queue takes as long in the first place. THere are hundreds of people doing that shit. If they all stopped pulling that crap the waiting times would go down by 1-2 hours easily.

Stick it out for two more levels, once you get to level 10 you will unlock your talents. When you do peruse through all three of your talent trees and closely look at every talent and imagine if you would enjoy playing with it at later levels. At the same time that you do that go to your major city and talk to a warrior trainer, have a look through the list of skills that you will get in the future read them absorb it and decide if it sounds like something you would enjoy playing all the way to 60.
---
You could also try watching some old YouTube videos of what Warriors do at top level PVP and such, and if after all that it doesn't look like the kind of gameplay that you're interested in then re roll.

I had my first kills today too!! Running through the barrens for a warlock quest the first horde I saw was a Druid! He stared for a few seconds I got nervous since he was 4 levels above me. Sure enough he turns red and hit me with a moon fire. After a handful of fears and dots I lol‚Äôed along after watching him helpless die while he ran around completely helpless. Shortly after fighting him I got jumped by a mage while I was fighting a mob, fear bombs away and kill 2 is on the board. I hit Ashenvale without any more issues then I came across a level 25 mage who gave me my first pvp death. He was camping my body when I texted but after 3 fears of him running into more and more mobs I got the kill and got out of there. Man do I love classic, and fear spams!!

The game only locks you out after 30-60 minutes. Going away for 20 minutes is no problem.

Ahh that makes sense...
---
That is unbelievably shitty, login 4 hours early? You can do that from your phone with chrome, GL
---
This is the strat a lot of power levelers use too.
---
Since you are level 8, hamstring the target, rend it, then joust it to death using heroic strike if you have lots of rage. It will be very similar to this until you get cleave (20) and if you are arms sweeping strikes (30) then finally mortal strike or bloodthirst (40) is your main attack.
---
Warrior leveling is rough until 30-40, then it gets abit easier/quicker with the additions to your kit in that level range.
---
I highly recommend getting a swing timer addon if you aren't using one also! Good luck have fun!
---
Doesn't seem like much of a puzzle to me. Holy increases the raw output, speed, and mana effeciency of heals, while Discipline adds some bells and whistles to smooth it out such as reduced threat generation, better bubble, and passives.
---
I'd focus on Holy and put the leftovers in Discipline.
---
Warrior is probably the most boring class to level in early wow, the lack of self heals and downtime between mobs but it pays off when you hit 60 get a pocket healer and some gear and faceroll everyone.
---
That being said it should feel like it picks up when you get mortal strike, try the hamstring kiting method to make it feel more engaging.
---
They also don't ban the people using autoclickers who prevent everyone else from playing

No, it sounds like something mature people say.

You dont just bounce around servers because the queue sucks and blizzard cant manage it.. wtf?
---
Earned it. Hell ya.
---
Wut? No you don't. If you queue in 4 hours before you get home and you are done with the queue after 5 hours. Then you got into the game well after you began playing. Compared to taking up space while not playing. While you are in the queue you are not taking up space on the server.
---
Goodness, druids can heal just fine, these people running around acting like you need to have the perfect group comp for a 5 man are massive chodes.

Has Autopilot not been incredibly buggy for you? I can't even use it

The layers will be removed before hks come in.  Annoying right now but makes the rest of the time you are not being ganked at least playable without a mosh pit around every spawn.  It's a necessary evil at the moment.  Its not going to ruin anything.  It's going to cause drama like this is all and people will complain that it's not the same.  If they made it the same we'd have 2500 player server caps, there would be close to 90 again and many would end up dead servers.  They are doing good by doing it this way.  It's better in the long run.
---
What addon is that for the bar on the top?
---
Lol dude you are only level 8 every class is going to feel basic at that level. Rogues for example don‚Äôt get duel wield until 10 and hunters don‚Äôt get their pets until that level either. Even at level 20 you‚Äôre just getting a taste for a class and not the full experience.
---
pservers aren‚Äôt accurate versions of WoW so I‚Äôd assume 2d17h isn‚Äôt accepted
---
Warrior is notoriously the most difficult/boring class to level in vanilla. But in late and endgame the equation flips around and they become *monsters*. Stick with it and you'll definitely be rewarded.
---
Thank you all!

This would imply the queue is not moving forward because there are people in front of you that are not actually there with the empty seats. This is not how it works though. Because everyone who is at the front of the queue is actually there and everyone who comes later, arrives well before they actually arrived at the front of the queue.
---
This is actually a system adapted more and more by everything that has queues. When I register my car, I can take a number and go get some food, do some other stuff and come back 2 hours later to take my spot. The only important thing in a queue is to be there the moment you arrive at the front.

More or less.  Rend is your big early dps ability.  I'm 15 and it's pretty much charge, rend and just let it tick.  I don't even heroic strike much bc I want to keep battle shout up for the improvement to auto attack and an occasional hamstring.
---
It'll get better.  I did this back in 2005 and it eventually got great.  (When I originally leveled I did it as full protection spec with shield all 60 levels.)  Though I don't honestly remember being so rage starved but it's been 14 years.

Hey I‚Äôm glad you said it because I did not know that.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Classic Wow. The play style is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the nuances in rotations will go over a typical players head. There's also your class trainers nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into their characterisation - their personal philosophy draws heavily from panderan literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Classic Wow truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in the murlocs existential catchphrase "Mrglrlrlrlrllr" which itself is a cryptic reference to Illidan's epic War of the Ancients. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Classic Wows genius unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools... how I pity them. üòÇ And yes by the way, I DO have a Classic Wow tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own.

---
that kind of outlines the problem blizzard faced in the last 6-8 years though. I think retail got to be the way it is because there is so much more content in retail these days spreading players out, and so fewer players doing low/mid level content. If retail was still like classic, most people would be leveling solo in empty zones. The answer was always ladder resets.
---
While the name and words itself may be innocent in a vacuum ("Not Racist"), I think I can guess why Blizzard took action here. Racism is a heavy, bloody subject and I'd quite imagine they don't want any player to run around with a name that, even by association, could bring distress to other players; Players that have experienced racism in their lives or otherwise.
---
Naming yourself Not Racist is the equivalent of randomly clapping your hands in front of a stranger's face and laughing when they flinch. You didn't hurt anyone, but you definitely disrupted their train of thought, their escapism into a fantasy world.

It's just where the over eager children gather to snort sugar salt and memes

Not surprised given how badly queuing and server restarts wrecked method at the start of the race. Also we have documentation of Method playing 100% legit (everyone slept and no one shared accounts), the same is not true of other racers.
---
I just hit 5g and feel like I should be looking into real estate.
---
Out of curiosity what do you enjoy about endgame?
---
Probably watched this 100 times in vanilla and still quote it sometimes
---
"lose myself in a detailed/difficult world" 
---
Agreed, and I'll also say, that is what made Star Wars Galaxies so good. That game was riddled with bugs and had terrible combat. However, your character was no one in that vast world. You would get so immersed in that world because it was actually the character, not you. It's very similar to Wow I think.
---
rule 1 no streamer drama..
---
think back to what the harder stuff to get was, the stuff that made good, desirable recipes and sell the staples for cheap. i dont hang on to medium leather, but hides and the like, ill bank
---
It's on the front page, and couple isn't strictly two. It's often used as 2-3.
---
It's not a real achievement,  this is old content. I'm sure blizzard gives no fucks.
---
Keep at it, adventurer! These stumbles and blunders are moments you'll look back upon fondly one day!
---
Female Tauren named Femaletauren, and female orc shaman named Oprahwindfury

Only if feral druid or tauren

Go scream into a pillow you'll feel better lol.
---
Skinning EVERYTHING and vendoring it, I only train  corruption, CoA, life tap, immolate and VW torment. Of course lvl 1 of stuff like SS, HS, Drain soul etc.
---
Yup, you summarized it perfectly.
---
It will be real interesting to see if Blizzard does WoW seasons: 
---
* Season 1 = Classic, 
---
* Season 2 = TBC, 
---
* Season 3 = WoTL, etc.
---
Make them last a year long so casuals don't have to worry about having a second job playing WoW.
---
As a lvl 15 warrior I can‚Äôt even begin to imagine what it‚Äôs like to have epic gear.. or shoulders.
---
Right, they're just now realizing that encouraging former players to come back by offering classic servers will make them more money than squeezing every dollar they can out of the current retail player base
---
Delete wtf and cache file thats what helped me after deleting perl
---
if you roll warrior and want to PvP(whatever PvP spec) and PvE tank do you just accept you will have to respec a bunch ?
---
His accent, not so much.
---
AH is a shit show on my server.
---
Almost every MAT I've tried to sell on the AH I could sell to the vendor for more.
---
Everyone's driven each other's prices to below the vendor.
---
everquest is still making money right now using that exact model. They release a fresh server every year with 1999 content, and then every 3 months they unlock an expansion sequentially.
---
All the more reason not to do it, then.
---
First thing I saw too lol. This is not a set up for a 12 hour LAN
---
I can‚Äôt even get a text back
---
Your a saint sir
---
Because VC is **unambiguous.**
---
Does DM mean _Dead Mines_ or _Dire Maul??_
---
Agreed, classic is huge and people are loving it =) I couldn't be happier!
---
In term of the game, it also requires the exploit to be a bug. This is not that case
---
Hol‚Äô up
---
It didn't get changed till end of wrath/early cataclysm. I use to use that method as well as many other people in getting around invisible walls for exploration. The culling of Stratholme was one of the dungeons it was used in to explore the forest.

Head west from Crossroads into Stonetalon Mountains. You'll see two tauren at the border offering quests. A bit easy for your level, but they'll do. Then, just a bit further into Stonetalon, there's a troll village also offering quests. And, even further up the road, is a Wanted sign with a quest and, eventually, a tauren settlement with a bunch of quests (including a super sneaky quest giver up in the western ledge overlooking the town).
---
From there, another good questing zone is Ashenvale, north of the Barrens (in particular, you'd want to head to the Zoram'gar Outpost on Ashenvale's west coast... A long run, but WORTH it). There's also Hillsbrad Foothills, south of Tirisfal Glades.
---
As a wotlk baby, I'm opting to not use questing add-ons. Trying to get a decent vanilla feeling. Working out pretty well so far.
---
That's rough. I'm thinking that free server transfers will be in the near future!
---
It's not racist. Brazil has white people, black people, indigenous peoples, and many mixtures of these... and they're all fucking terrible at WoW.
---
yeah me to bro. me too
---
*laughs in Darnassian
---
Actually. No. But nice try with the SJW  word play.
---
Please stahp i‚Äôm so jealous.. I quit smoking weed a few months back and with the launch of Classic was looking for some to game and smoke with.
---
I literally can‚Äôt find any weed and darkweb stuff was really low-Quality.. I love Australia but atm it suckkkks.
---
I thought hunters were the top dogs for leveling? Am I wrong or is this guy just insane?
---
Such a great game
---
That's quite an flex. But if he's got it good for him. 
---
What car did he get you?
---
do you think 
---
5 divine strength, 5 seal of righteousness, 1 consecrate, then currently got 3 in imp blessing of might and then tryna get the seal of command is good?
---
Seems like you tried to be edgy and caught the hammer. Ho-hum.

They all go wild and silly, but you run into those guys and they‚Äôre as likely to party for your quest and admit it‚Äôs light hearted banter. Don‚Äôt take the chat so seriously. Sure some of them will tag that raptor even though they saw you casting at. The diversity is great.
---
He switched layers to aoe grind the 2 last levels.
---
Yeah man I'm a priest, had over 3g and thought I was crushing it.
---
Literally down to 1g tonight after getting spells.
---
Ugh...
---
i mean, he was never really in the race to begin with, never came out like "ok guys im going for server/world first 60" and then took money to try to level faster. it seems more like he just doesnt want to spend the time actually playing the game that would be required to get to the "fun" content he wants.
---
If you want to say it's not cheating or be shouldn't be banned those are reasonable opinions. To say it's not a gltich or wasn't an unintended feature. Of course it wasn't intended for people to layer spam to farm mobs. It's absolutely blatant exploiting, there's nothing else you can reasonably call it
---
He only said that because he couldn't delete his character, he really has no interest in the end game.

Also belongs in noisygifs.

---
What the hell? I‚Äôm a lvl 15 warrior and the most I had so far was like 80s. 
---
Don‚Äôt mess with me buddy.
---
Ohhhh, I see now. Didn't even notice those with my brightness.
---
Eons
---
You reach the halfway waypoint at 40 in terms of leveling if that helps.
---
&gt; No drop rate changes!
---
Most drop rates seem alright. But the quests that require you to get one item that has like a 2% drop rate are hell. A quest like [The Tower of Althalaxx](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=970/the-tower-of-althalaxx#comments:0) thate takes some people 10 seconds and others 2+ hours is just pure evil. But hey, I got it after only ~45 minutes so I guess I was a bit lucky (or not unlucky enough).
---
Sulfuras!
---
I heard that he had other people playing for him in order to keep grinding while he took short breaks. Is this true? Not taking anything away from the guy just curious as to how this all went down.
---
Because VC is _guaranteed_ to be **unambiguous**
---
Does DM refer to _Dead Mines_ or _Dire Maul_ (when it gets added.)
---
Using video game writing and story as a way to make school works into a much more engaging and enjoyable task.
---
I have done this a few times in grueling school works and came out surprisingly well in results.
---
We love you green Jesus
---
Had the shortest queue I've seen, today, about 20 minutes. But that won't last, for the weekend at least. Those will be painful.
---
He only just found out about it then. He said if he had known at the start then he would have done it all in 2 days. I  forgot how toxic the gaming community can be. Yeeeesh. Just let the man have his victory. He won a race against a lot of people and dedicated to a brain numbing grind and half the people are trying to discredit him because he used a mechanic built into the game. Get off his back.
---
I think you're talking out of your ass. It's 8h average. Two days ago it was up to 15h que. They've always been in que except 00:00-08:00 during mid nights. Don't know what reef you're smoking.
---
Elvui is supposed to do it for me, time for a weak aura lol
---
I did Deadmines for the first time today. Someone picked me up and said "Hey, wanna DPS Deadmines?", which later turned into me ending uo as tank. Stumbled through, not knowing how to tank (Still don't really), not knowing about the patrols that pop up behind you, accidental pulls, and corpse runs galore. But all in all? I had a good time.
---
He must have absolutely no life (South Park reference, not actually hating).
---
"Fuck this Thistlefur Ursa in particular"
---
Idk there are only so many layers. I'm well ahead of the curve. I literally saw no one else mining all day. Once the average player gets into the 30s and 40s, I think you will layer hop and just hop to a new layer where someone else is farming. But we'll see.
---
Yeah I'm using elvui as well. I saw on their forum a minute ago they are working on adding it.
---
If you're not having fun, definitely roll a different class
---
Yes leveling is basically charge rend and heroic strike until level 20
---
In which case its still basically those things but you get more options (ie dual wielding) 
---
Warrior is one of the least fun classes to level
---
Actually yes. Your intellect, or lack there of stuns me.
---
No thanks, but I'm sorry that I offended you
---
Is your account less than 72h old? It can take that long after sub on a brand new account
---
I remember saving this post. Look how that turned out!
---
Wish he tweeted this to Blizzard right after 'you think you do' and during Most era.
---
I think the previous one (at least the one I saw) the other day, classic wow was in like 3rd place. So not a repost.
---
On eu Skullflame is no or very low que if you are thinking of switching server
---
End that supply of Adderall
---
I love this. It makes you feel like a renowned and famous adventurer in you faction! Everyone likes you!
---
I dont have a car and he just always picks me up on the weekend. Now that he wanted me to play after i get out of work. 
---
Its a Ford Fiesta. Im just happy he got me one. Nobody will do that for me
---
All I can think of is Monty Python where he‚Äôs running to the castle. Thanks for this friend :)
---
Ah ok ty, yeah just have trouble seeing the loot some times and need assistance with it is all.
---
True, and I‚Äôm probably 1/3 the way to 40, maybe a little less.
---
I guess about 5-6 weeks is a ballpark if I go by these estimates.
---
No need to buff Druids with it who are level 16+ :)
---
Every fight with a mob I've had so far
---
wiped you
---
Ok I get what you are saying. The fact remains though that he utilized their design. It‚Äôs not like a mob was stuck in a rock, or a hunter glitched his way to a high vantage point where no one could access him. The developers either didn‚Äôt see this possibility or didn‚Äôt care if they did see it.  One way or another it‚Äôs not worthy of a ban.
---
That's not true... I am.... A troll.... Hunter.... With... Oh shut the fuck up he's cute... And on the character screen he has grass in his mouth
---
You are already not getting to play with them. So you can either enjoy the game without them, or not get a chance to even play the game, and still be without them.
---
I see, it's my bad then. :)
---
wat
---
It already has it's own category. "First to level 60 in Classic wow"
---
He was the first, if you want to make up categories for "Fastest to level 60 in Classic wow", go for it.
---
:)
---
It is because the only character with a true taunt in classic is a warrior. Everything else has just increased aggro generation.
---
No excuses. I'm in my 40s and I know all of them. Just, because I'm in my 40s, I don't actually type them. It wouldn't be dignified (and it embarrasses the kids when they think the adults can understand them).
---
Yeah I bet. Everyone had uniformed opinions about each class back then. Which is why I'm surprised to see so many priest. They didnt get so good till about BC or wraith
---
Agreed, needs an asterisk
---
You lack the tegridy necessary for the forthright commission to oppose this distinction in this imagery.
---
Someone doesn‚Äôt have nightfall.
---
Yes. What is your point? That I should min/max and play a race I don't enjoy just for an advantage? No thanks :)
---
Stop learning useless spells
---
Grats to him but his chat is toxic as fuck
---
its better in silverpine for everyone doing the worg/bear heart quests next to the other blokes you can skin aswell. i ran around for like an hour just skinning
---
If you have the computer set to go to sleep it could be as low as 30mins.
---
Lol Method didn't get world first. Classic is turning out to be great so far.
---
No both were hard to find in vanilla because it was actually tough
---
Santa?
---
They are smaller but still require pre planning to play
---
She ain‚Äôt no Spice Girl.
---
Looks like WoW classic speed dating
---
Thank you!
---
Which server are you on?
---
Still huge ques
---
Yes but also no.
---
thats a genius meme lol
---
Lol I couldn‚Äôt remember why I needed to hold onto light feathers, just some deep instinct to hoard them.
---
Then 10 more every time you actually do it
---
Last I saw of them, they were jew friendly too
---
The Warrior uh, finds a way
---
vendor always. ah is flooded and people that actually using up leather are the ones skinning it/giving to friends so nobody is even buying it off the AH
---
Captain cities have been super crowded literally ever time I‚Äôve been in one...
---
I thought methods real race was world first Ragnaros and not world first 60.
---
I'm going the Battle for Hillsbrad questline at the moment and it absolutely feels like this.
---
Chat isn‚Äôt layered
---
Hah, the realm I joined last night which was quite slow is now very busy! no queues yet, but probably soon.
---
With or without layering, it can't be beat. He was the first to 60 and that's that.
---
Speed can and probably will be improved even without layering.
---
to make use of meanly or unfairly for one's own advantage exploiting migrant farm workers
---
This wasn‚Äôt unfair. It wasn‚Äôt malicious or untoward.  It was simply creative use of a rule structure that blizzard put in place.
---
Make a ally toon and come all the way to KILL HIM lol
---
It‚Äôs actually 1.0! I can confirm because I tamed him :)
---
if you want to find ANYTHING the guards will tell you and mark it on your map.
---
I'm not sure what level you are, but you can get a break down on highest DPS warlock rotations while leveling [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13c9QQuLNILhVIFvkal6ENvzva6hfyPTIUiNt0x_4KTk/preview#slide=id.g60e4420d7f_1_254). It's a pretty big guide made by some guys over on the Warlock discord. It's helped me out quite a bit with this stuff.
---
It‚Äôs only like that for about two hours. Just keep it extremely fed, once the loyalty level goes up you have to feed it maybe 5% as often.
---
I believe there was some rare npc that transforms into a bear. And a hunter can then tame him while he is a bear. And apparently you could even transform him into the human form. It may just be bullshittery htough.
---
There's no better feeling than knowing I earned what I have with effort.
---
BC was the only other time I felt this way. It's a good feeling for sure.
---
if old content were used in new expansions they wouldn't have to speed up the leveling.  they have mob scaling so it's possible an expansion player leveling being told to kill the same mobs a new alt/player is killing.  the new expansion player could be told to go to more areas too for a quest (it would suck but possible).
---
Do that shit through gnomer lmao
---
My gnome mage has an inferiority complex he‚Äôs taking out on everyone.
---
Lol. Enjoy it while you can.
---
Crossroads inn is full of this on Herod. Not quite as blatant but I'm talking 30+ people not moving for 10 minutes and jumping once.
---
I've been bandaging strangers. Its pretty fun
---
Shut the fuck up, who cares. He's a popular streamer, plus, I bet he barely gets to loot anything since half the shit he wants to tag gets tagged before him. or all the nodes around him get taken. So its not like he can get any money of professions. Just don't watch or play on streamer servers and you'll be fine.
---
Oh great I was wondering what to do with the 8000 runecloth in my bank.
---
You can't fly there from there...
---
uhhh. alts
---
An IRL friend of mine just mailed me my first helmet, a [Slayer's Skullcap](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14753/slayers-skullcap), which is pretty amazingly itemized too!
---
just check everything you kill. it'll sparkle slightly.  you'll get use to it now that you know it isn't a huge beam of light!
---
And Peaky Blinders
---
Wands out damage drain life until the 30s, so I haven't bothered getting it yet. Once I start getting closer I will be picking it up and using it instead of wanding.
---
Lol someone trolling panties got wadded up. Want some pampers instead hun?
---
Thank you so much.  I bought this with a   " life time update "  and he would not honor it for classic. I bought it like back in pre 2010 or so.    Felt scammed and you now saved me.
---
i would actually kill for a game like WOW. Such a chill premise. Go online with your friends and roleplay/grind. Most i get these days is the occasional friend in call of duty. Jesus christ take me back to when i had more online friends than irl friends smh. Such a better experience
---
Proof?
---
They have changed it to reflect actual numbers currently on the server instead of ammount of characters created. Full means there's a que right now
---
WoW will pretty much run on a potato
---
xxx's address is faster to type in so...
---
It's not exactly achievable by *anyone*.   You need a team of people to help you.
---
this isn't the place for streamer drama (rule 1).
---
And ur giving the laptop to your son?
---
Remote in and queue at noon so it pops when you get home instead of taking up a slot all night to 6PM then.
---
*Cough* EA made loot boxes, not Asia.
---
*Cough* Souls franchise has no micro transactions.
---
You can be invited from anywhere, as long as they aren't on your layer you'll be transferred.
---
God damn you are stupid
---
My mans has his priorities. I respect it.
---
just report it as rule 1 for streamer drama. it'll be auto removed if it gets enough of them. that's all i'm doing.
---
Thanks, this was driving me insane lol.
---
I had 3 and a half gold when I hit 20.
---
Teleported to Moonglade.
---
Left with 71s.
---
Feelsbad
---
There's no cocaine in wow classic already? Could have fooled me
---
Don't you guys have ques?
---
I need the zest for work after quest lol
---
thank god we went to all this trouble to get WoW classic and now we are celebrating people speed running it. congrats, not
---
WoW went 3 years with most people never clearing naxx hence its release in WotLK. Even if we rush 1 year and clear naxx and fully gear. theres 8 classes. Thats 8 yesrs of HARD play learning new ways of doing shit.
---
And PVP.
---
Automation is against TOS.
---
No, you're breathtaking!
---
he's right you know
---
Oh that's good.
---
Cute! I met my wife in Stormwind Park back during Burning Crusade, so it's definitely nostalgic to have that place back again.
---
I'm sorry but I don't quite understand what you mean. Do you intend to say that the queue times are because people are creating alts? Because people can only queue for one server at a time, alts shouldn't have any effect on queue times or server population.
---
? But healing is easy.
---
Playing a priest, definitely harder to level.
---
I put a shout out for a group to do a quest and played all night with one of them and a few hours with the others. I am only new to WoW retail and remember nothing from the release as I only played it a short time and that was long ago. I can see how some people would prefer this version. Things like having to actually read the quests makes a huge difference, no being led around by the nose. The combat is more challenging due to Mana shortages but that makes it exciting, and infuriating due to the many deaths. I wouldn't mind a donkey with a limp at this point but it's not that bad. Watching chat makes the time go by and there's always lots of mobs to fight, xp is xp and those coppers add up.
---
It would have taken less time to send out some messages and get new names on a different server than one wait in some queues. But if spending time in the queue was worth it because some things took a tiny bit of effort and you may not get the exact name you want, that's your choice.
---
we dont care. rule 1 no streamer drama.
---
I do a little bit of speedrunning the OG God Of War. Shit takes skill and loads of practice.
---
He wasn't even first which was disappointing
---
I had a list in vanilla and I have a list today. Positive members of the Horde, list of players I will never group with ever. Then a very small list of alliance that are honorable and safe from instant death, and in red... my kill on sight no mercy. I suggest you add some names to yours LOL.
---
I'm on a very high populated realm. 5 Hour queues today. I've seen tons of people everywhere in the level 6 area.
---
Don‚Äôt waste money on the grimores except for the voidwalker taunt, when you hit max level you can buy only the last one instead of all of them. There are also a lot of spells that are kind of useless while leveling but you‚Äôll eventually buy them anyways. And as a lock you don‚Äôt have to drop all the gold on the mount so you‚Äôre only going to hurt yourself with not having gold to buy tailoring gear.
---
My internet crashes for weird periods of time multiple times a week, but it's not wow exclusive. I have charter.
---
I also had my first PvP experience in classic wow today, I was questing and this lvl 23 hunter (i'm 22 mage) Comes and kills me when I have 100hp left fighting a couple of mobs. So I come back heal engage him and proceed to teach him a lesson about fighting a frost mage and the hunter dead zone, poor fella had no chance and because his kill against me was dishonourable I camp and killed him 4 or 5 more times and then let him go. God I missed my vanilla mage PvP so much.
---
I'm aware. I mean I find people in trade chat I want to trade with, then I can't find them physically.
---
They were definitely aiming for both with different parts of the team. Method mage was on EU but I believe the stream group is on US servers
---
Do they have an addon where i can swipe left or right on people for groups
---
Can confirm, am a level 32 Warrior with ~22g right now.  I've been vendoring all my leather and have skipped out on training a ton of skills.
---
battle pets was in cata or something like that.
---
this right here
---
Need before greed mode changes that but then you cant roll at all on boe drops.
---
Way to be. Do you bro.
---
Did you just say...
---
If all of the current servers are thriving in 2-3 months, then it was a huge success.
---
If half the current servers are dead in 2-3 months, then it was a failure
---
Plot twist: none of it was looted first
---
Once invincible....Now the armor's wearing thin
---
Hunter lvl 24 and have never had an issue finding groups.
---
Noticeable difference in group effectiveness due to the tanks experience. 
---
If the tank can't pull properly its very difficult

What the fuck are you trying to say there? You were clearly wrong, had nothing to do with moral.
---
&gt; At least they stated that they seem interested to steer back in the old direction regarding strict specc/tree separation for 9.0.
---
uhh what
---
Double header or once a week?
---
Boo fucking hoo...
---
Yes you could and would not be too bad for leveling since most of your xp from questing comes from the mobs you grind anyways. Grinding dungeons is a VERY solid strategy and is what a lot of ppl do anyways.
---
Try downloading questie addon though. It takes all the work out of classic questing. Shows you where quests, objectives, and turn ins are. You really dont have to read 90% of quests with it.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt level prot, I would level arms or fury and Respec into prot for end tier doungeons
---
Solidarity among the peon class!
---
You send imp in, then once you pull agro you send imp at the next target. You're always fighting 2-3 mobs with this tactic in a chain system where you pull the next mob while the first one is dying from your dots.
---
Wand
---
And then you can also see enemy autos
---
Take two gathering professions while leveling. A good pair are mining and skinning. Replace skinning with what you want later when you are high level and have a better idea of the game in general.
---
You're supposed to pick the pet you want at your level.  WHEREVER it spawns
---
Not needed when the content is a theme park that doesn't challenge the base at all.
---
Fuck your it won‚Äôt last. 
---
This game has a way if bringing people together, and it did for YEARS. don‚Äôt just attest it to leveling. You make so many friends at 60 it‚Äôs ridiculous.
---
t h e m i s s u s
---
thanks! got it now.
---
Even if I never ever solo? 100% tanking dungeons
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone sits in a 10k long queue on ‚Äúhype‚Äù, but I suppose we‚Äôll see best when MC is regularly cleared, I expect that will represent the long-term stable population
---
Imo classic is much easier for a newcomer to the game than retail is.
---
 Despite Blizzard trying very hard to make the game easy for new players, retail WoW is kind of a giant Frankenstein's monster of 15 years worth of expansions and updates. There are a lot of things that were relevant when they were released &amp; are obsolete now, like WoD garrisons and Legion artifacts. It's difficult to know where to go &amp; what to do as a low-level player, because stat changes and level scaling changed how fast you progress through starter zones. It's difficult to follow the story, because  basically each continent exists in a completely different timeline. And lord help you when you're looking for help in one of the original zones and you don't know if you're looking at pre-cata or post-cata advice...  
---
Vs Classic - the game was originally released for an audience that had no experience with World of Warcraft. It is a seamless, complete experience. Yes it can be slow and grindy at times, and it's missing some quality of life things, but overall, the game is much simpler. Also, the community is the cornerstone of classic - it's a very social game (vs retail where LFG and other "QoL updates" removed most of the social aspects), and people are excited to be here &amp; will happily help a newcomer out.   
---
I recommend you just make an account and try it out! There are tutorials and things to ease you into using the UI. You can definitely enjoy the game as a casual player &amp; play at your own pace, no need to dedicate 80 hours a week.
---
How is it supposed to look like?
---
I really feel like the second (and appropriately skewed) x'ed out Lazlos image really reinforces your cold dismissal of Lazloz. I say good riddance.   
---
Quality work.
---
Only thing I could think of is either make a macro for like your pet attack and taunt ability. Or just manually click the taunt button for your pet.
---
Because I don't like any other options.
---
I didnt get serious about WOW until mid BC. I floated around many classes prior to settling on Pally
---
I have always tanked nothing else.
---
Is it Viable in vanilla? I dont remember seeing many.
---
GNOMEGALULMED
---
I used to be with it, but then they changed what it was. Now what I'm with isn't it, and what's it seems weird and scary to me, *and it'll happen to you, too.*
---
Stuff like this makes me never want to play Wow ever again. I was a beta tester but to see it's gone so far like this  and people become so obsessed and weird about it makes me feel like never ever ever associating myself with this kind of bizarre crap. And here comes the but but but. No buts. It's too much.
---
 But to each their own.
---
Is that bugged or is that how it's supposed to be?
---
A lot of the streamers will be wanting to get to the end game faster. You've always been able to cheese some dungeons, but most people either don't know or wont be coordinated enough, so its very unlikely you'll join a pug that wants to take that route.
---
I personally have no problem with the sped up vanilla experience. My problem lies in the fact that I am too strong at all times. When retail would level me up at 10 times the speed so I can reach max level within a few days I have no problems with it. 
---
But I want to die when I pull three enemies.
---
Remove all skills except growl from autouse (right-click) and activate those skills with the programmed keybinds or ones of your making. 
---
Also keep your pet in passive, you'll have full control. I know it's added micromanagement but with practice it will go smooth and the long term gain will pay off.
---
Yeah i made the switch if i try that que i get in by bed time and all day is spent for no play at all
---
Except for the fact that windows sets a flag when you use a program to send input. It's trivially detectable
---
Plenty of realms w no queue times. No worries. Come on in, the water‚Äôs fine.
---
I'm on Atiesh, one of the original servers, and I only had a queue the second day.  Been a great experience.
---
I can only play about an hour amd a half at a time on the lowesr settings in every category before my laptop goes into emergency shutdown from overheating.
---
So exploiting a system added to alleviate server stress that never existed in the original game isn't cheating? what is it to you? A clever use of mechanics?  
---
Ok either way he still sucks compared to anyone who made 60 in vanilla at all because everyone who hit 60 in vanilla did it without layering and 300k streamers to invite you constantly to reset the layers.  
---
This is basically Athene and a half level bullshittery. No one ever actually earns this and works hard for it, they get carried by the community.   
---
I would never bother with a world first because I don't have thousands of followers to exploit and carry me nor do I feel the need to cheat to 'feel like the best'. What a sad life these streamers must have to need to be validated by thousands of strangers online so badly that you would do anything for that validation, cheating included. anybody with any critical thought can see its a farce at best.  
---
To me the true world first is the first person who does it without outside assistance or promotion or explotation. Not "Joke-rd"
---
You don't have to do it every level.
---
A talent every 2 levels would work just fine.
---
I don't get it.
---
Yes yes yes...aw shit.
---
As a hunter, polearm training will be worth it in the long run!
---
I mean it seems like the people on the other layer are just not in the same raid group, right? What's the issue here?
---
Yes the 100 people are ruining the 10k ques
---
2h arms tanking is better while leveling you will do more damage and hold threat easier and plow through dungeons
---
Was this on Grobb?
---
If so I was on the Horde, we had a great time fighting you guys. It kinda sucks the guards were getting in the way though.
---
ty, i was so confused what he was talking about
---
How about we all realize there is more to life than reaching level 60 like a South Park stereotype?
---
Anyone (DoctroSix) saying "Pally tanking doesn't really work in Vanilla" is wrong. What is true is that "a paladin will never be the main tank in a 40 man raid guild." There is a huge gap between those two things.
---
The fastest way to kill stuff as a paladin is to play them like mages. IE gather everything up and aoe them down. Eat/drink repeat. Shield spike and reckoning are your best friends. A paladin tank wants a taunt, but shouldn't *need* a taunt. Their threat is extremely high. A good paladin tank knows when *NOT* to use consecration, and when to downrank it.
---
I personally don't like this guy's technique but here is a [pally tanking example.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acM3bN0H3Rc) Good general strategy, wrong technique. Note that pally is in a level appropriate dungeon fighting yellow mobs.
---
Where a [pally shines is survivability. Even solo. Here is [hogger at lvl 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DymPtTBzB4) without tricks. Where they excel is the number of tricks in their toolbag. I remember solo'ing the elite giant in Booty Bay when the giant was orange using tricks. In original wow I could solo pull 90% of Gnomer in a single pull and aoe it down at lvl 60. Without any raid gear. *On dial up.*
---
[Is this it?](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/perl-classic-unit-frames) There's a download option for Classic at the bottom of the "recent files" pane.
---
That's literally the default blizzard UI. You can make it raid frames instead of party frames.
---
Depends on the time of day. If you queue at 11 PM PST there are often no queue's. (was at least true on Herod last night) If you queue in the morning things are short at least around 9-10 AM PST (only about 30-45 minutes). If you queue at 5 PM PST, expect not to play until 11 PM PST. This data only applies to weekdays, no one has yet to see weekends, it stands to reason queues might be LONG throughout.
---
Meanwhile I have a total of 2hrs spent so far, god help me in the times of queue
---
The most useless race/class combo for anything other than leveling tho.
---
First aide and cooking. Also cross your fingers lol I'm leveling a warrior and it's hard but I'm having a good time.
---
which is helpful very rarely. 
---
VW is the safe bet and the anti-ganking bet.
---
Imp and Succ are the damage high risk faster leveling choice.
---
I had 3 gold and some change last night. Then I hit level 20 and went to my trainer and realized I never went and got my training for 18. 
---
DX
---
Classicwow.live has a free 1-60 for alliance and horde :)
---
There is a middle ground where he spends a month getting a ton of catch-up artifact power.
---
I dont think I've ever even seen that shield before
---
If you're only level 33 by now you won't be getting access to resources like that uncontested. I'm level 49 and not even in top 20 on my server
---
Yeah looks like manually clicking is my best bet, sucks because this doesn't happen in private servers.
---
[The mob chased it all the way to stormwind.](https://i.gyazo.com/031b3fc2dd0aa75236686208f9c57050.jpg). Nobody around was higher than 30 so it was a pretty great fight.
---
Hello ! So I want to dive in WOW Classic with a good DPS class. I have a hard time picking a class and I need your feedback on picking the right one. In TBC I played a Ret Paladin and it was a beast. Well, in classic the situation is not so pretty for this class. How are Fury Warriors, or maybe Druids ? Also what ranged DPS class is the easiest to handle ?
---
If you maybe give me your thoughs I would be very happy.
---
You can tank most dungeons but the lack of an actual taunt ability in vanilla makes it more or less impossible to tank raids with (there‚Äôs a lot of tank swap abilities that require taunting).
---
Did it really take that long though? I only have my bc rememberance, but level 15 for dm was reached within 1-2 days easily and then people could dungeon drag you. Especially in scarlet thingy you would reach level 30-40 within a day no prob.
---
So if you got actual support from max level friends you'd be at max level within maybe 2-3 weeks depending on how much you play.
---
I've looked this up quite some time ago since my plan was also the same to go shockadin once I get enough gear, but kind of forgot about it. Look up the dungeon 2 set, soulforge set, I'm not sure in what phase the quests will be available, and its not easy, but that set is basically the perfect shockadin gear before T2 judgement set. 
---
As for weapon, definitely 1 handed with SoR since its spell damage. This is where you gotta get funny and take a very fast attack speed spell damage weapon from under a mage's nose haha
---
I guess you'll resist an extra 1 fear out of 100, maybe?
---
Blizzard warned everyone with several blue posts about queue times and to pick the newest servers available.
---
no, not really. They don't really have any ways to hold threat, they don't even have a taunt if i remember right. When it comes to tanking in vanilla it's warrior or bust for raiding. Not sure about dungeons, it might be viable but i really don't know.
---
Cya nerd
---
I have questie but I only use the tracker for quest pick ups and turn ins. That way I know where to get a quest, but still have to figure out where to go to complete it. If there was any doubt in my mind that even that was too easy mode, there isn‚Äôt anymore after the deadmines quests. Before doing any dungeon you obviously want to get all quests associated with it. Well for Deadmines there are 3 quests for it in storm wind. One random gnome outside in Dwarven district, and two from a random dwarf in an inn in the same district. How in the hell am I just going to wander into those npcs. There‚Äôs no reason I‚Äôd be in Dwarven district. Every few levels do you just scour every square foot of the entire world on the off chance some random dude in some random place has a relevant quest for your upcoming dungeon? The fuck.
---
Yeah, this is pretty much me as well... What I have found that usually works for me though is to just pick one. I will always bounce around between what class I want to play, but damnit I just gotta pick one. For the first 20 hours or sometimes more I may think "Man, I do like this other class though and might be missing out on it..." but nope, don't fall for it! Because eventually, even if it takes me getting to level 30 or so, I will finally accept the decision I have done (mainly because of sunk time) and start loving it.
---
This might not work for you or OP, but it usually works for me. In fact I am only level 17 right now but have been leveling up my professions and getting absorbed into my class (warlock) and am already happy with my choice. Would I have enjoyed another class more? Perhaps... but do you know what I for sure enjoy more? Actually playing the game rather than sitting at character select/creation trying to decide what to play. That's good enough for me.
---
It was on Grob! I had a blast as well. Was just showing a friend the ropes, questing in a group together for the first time when we see dozens of Horde start to trickle in. We get the word out and before we know it it's a huge epic battle.
---
Our friend has never played an MMO before - he says this may have been is favorite gaming moment to date. Thanks for providing that &lt;3
---
Start another toon. Never bad to have a few in different servers.
---
Which is dope tbh makes everything feel valuable
---
Just dinged 10 for the 4th time, I swear I'm not an altoholic, I can stop anytime I want!
---
never been a heavy raider. I dont mind slipping into a lesser position in the off chance I do raid.
---
The benefit is being the first to sell the higher level herbs etc since you're the one who levelled a profession. Its basically if you think the money you can earn is worth the levelling time you lose.
---
I was already playing with a passive pet and i think it's easier to just growl manually when my threat gets high.
---
Gotta get those RP juices flowing!
---
/deleted ???
---
This behavior is consistent with the reference client.
---
like i posted elsewhere i've been selling 20 stacs of light leather for 18s on AH.. like, lots of them, like 30-40 stacks so far. dunno why people say ah sucks lol
---
Ganondorf dat you?
---
Don't want to be that guy buuuut, I totally will anyway.
---
&gt;Nobody will do that for me
---
That's because most people buy their own cars.
---
uh mai waife
---
Ideally I'd want to go the same route Old School RuneScape did with a diverging timeline. (bonus points for community polling within reason).
---
Enjoyed your illustrations of both the horde and alliance's pilgrimages leading up to release.   
---
Enjoyed playing a shaman myself in 2004.   
---
Looking forward to you capturing more dramatic moments in the future!
---
Awesome! Glad to hear it. Let me know if you run into any more trouble. I'm happy to help.
---
Probably the best answer here
---
Took the scenic route.
---
That would be like saying you hate natives isn't racist because they have Cherokee, blackfoot and 400 other tribes in north America
---
Wow they seriously expected to beat speedrunners who have practiced this for years..?
---
I ran Scholo way back when with master loot on. Ancient Bone Bow dropped. Warrior won the roll but I gave it to the hunter. I felt a little bad, but pull damage is just stupid
---
Durids are for fite!!
---
What's the fix?
---
To an absolute T. And I feel like I know their personalities solely based on this photo and knowing people who look the exact same.
---
Top 20 isn't 99% percent of the population. I think we can agree most players aren't above 30 yet. Break that down to who is even in your layer and the competition is pretty low.
---
Why do you keep using a diminutive term to refer to him? You don't know how old he is. It's clear you feel superior and more mature than someone you don't even know. That kind of patronizing attitude is very untoward. No one cares if you care. That's just the internet, friend.
---
Really? World first classic wow was 15 years ago? Interesting since classic wow just came out
---
no no no, im gonna leave 1 more reply here lol. I've sold 30-40 stacks of light leather for 18s on ah so far. List at 1c  starting bid with 18s buyout and push out other 20 stacks from first page of lowest bid so yours are the only visible. Its money, trust. Takes a little effort and sometimes you have to cancel your auctions and relist but the margin is so huge that it doesnt matter at all the cost of listing.
---
Strike of the hydra. I just got mine. And it literally doubled my damage. Im ready to double pull again!!
---
bit of an old post so hopefully you have decided, but this is what I just commented to someone else and hope it could help.
---
Yeah, this is pretty much me as well... What I have found that usually works for me though is to just pick one. I will always bounce around between what class I want to play, but damnit I just gotta pick one. Random if need be, or usually just pick whatever one seems ever so tiniest bit more interesting the very second you make a character.
---
For the first 20 hours or sometimes waaaay longer I will think "Man, I do like this other class though and might be missing out on it..." but nope, don't fall for it! Because eventually, even if it takes me getting to level 30 or so, I will finally accept the decision I have done (mainly because of sunk time) and start loving it.

---
Unless the wiki formula is wrong, in PvP if your target is 3+ levels above you, the resist chance is 13% + (level difference - 3)*7% capped at 99%.   
---
With a 10 level gap, you've got about a 40% chance to land a spell, (which is enough to reliably cc someone if you spam it on them).  
---
With 16+ levels it's 1%, and there's no hope.
---
level 30 would require over 30 hours of gameplay for your avarage person. I'm 24 hours in and level 26 and I'd say I'm pretty fast for a warrior. Since most classic players also have a job it's a little bit early to complain that 30+ zones are unpopulated, most people simply do not play  8 hours a day. And I also imagine that most people have switched servers. I started out on Gehennas playing on a Warlock for 15 hours getting to level 18 before switching to Gandling because queues were 8 hours long.
---
I'm pretty sure there is a general agreement of that... 
---
It's an achievement, in a video game, on a video game subreddit. Not sure what the problem is.
---
That'll help the queues!
---
Didn't realize this was a presentation at first.  Wow, that's high quality stuff.
---
Lol fuk nochanges. Times change, deal with it.
---
They do have that. ClassicCodex/Questie. 
---
Leveling in Classic is the most fun experience I've had on WoW in years, Classic REALLY is *just* that fun.
---
Opinion.
---
Kinda like modern Pikes Peak.
---
It‚Äôs amazing that they‚Äôre still running the event but it will never be the same as the dirt course.
---
Generally true for the trash and small pulls. But on bosses you better get your shield out otherwise Verdan the Everliving will send you on a quick trip to the graveyard. But I suppose it also depends on whether you‚Äôre on the lower or higher end of the dungeon‚Äôs range as well as your gear.
---
Does anybody know what the horde actually have to type to say that?
---
Did you intend for your character names to make perfect 90's horror movie themes? Haha, thanks for not censoring them :D
---
What is everyone's thoughts on taking screenshots with their phones instead of using the numerous tools provided to them by the computer they were sitting at?
---
LOL geez why not go to diff realm.
---
I would definitely not want to stay at classic until the end of time.
---
I personally want to level up to 60, experience the open world pvp, do the donation stuff for the AQ opening, raid MC, see blackrock for the first time in all its glory, etc. I'm not set on doing Nax or Cthun. My goal is to at most kill one or two AQ bosses.
---
And then I want to start out in TBC. Where I want to get into Hyjal.
---
I was too young to experience the raids back then. And my computer was too bad. I only started to play in TBC and the only raid I've seen was gruul. And in Wotlk I joined a raiding focussed guild but we only laid Kel before the guild split.
---
I want to experience how these raids truly where back then. How these epic giant dungeons were, etc. I've just never seen all this and it excites me.
---
Yeah do all manually it's better. I thought you always taunted mobs. If you control everything your problem disappear. I don't know for hunter but on my warlock the pets comes with the ctrl+number keybinds, not even need to set them up.
---
Blink 182 also just came out with a new album (but no Tom), we‚Äôre definitely back in the early 2000‚Äôs.
---
Without a wife / kids. Friends nor family to tend to. I mean I get that having vacation is cool and all but having vacation WITHOUT having no other responsibility is  next level. Like level 60 next level
---
Phase 2 at the earliest.
---
No it doesn't have to be a bug and most exploits have absolutely nothing to do with bugs.
---
There was Guzu, I liked watching him very much. I admit that spamming dungeons is not super entertaining
---
That's so proletariat I wipe with only the finest of silk produced from extremely rare imported spiders that I keep in my private animal sanctuary. Every day my workers harvest this silk and weave into the finest of toiletries. It goes through rigorous testing to ensure the finest wipe in the world. Only the most superior roll of every hundred produced make it to the extravagant waterfall where I do my business, the rest go straight to the Incenerator as not to allow any to escape into lower class hands *spits*.
---
Just did the same but cat form is sooo worth it
---
Friends list is your friend. Remember a lot of people you group with early you will eventually see agaon.
---
I think the first green shield you can get is from the first kill chain in loch modan with those troggs.
---
Or do what I did, Dwarven Kite Shield at level 3 from a quest in coldridge valley and never look at a 2 hander ever again haha
---
Watch that language, pal!
---
Obligatory comment about charging your phone
---
Which server?
---
Feels the same as levelling in wotlk for me as well. This time there is no going to Outland at 59.
---
Ahhh.
---
Well I've seen a lot of people recommending some sort of remote desktop app that allows you to log in earlier remotely to get in the queue earlier. Might be worth a try.
---
Had this same thing happen to me today. Jumped from one ledge downward into another while I had aggro in this exact cave (Talondeep) and was crazy surprised when they didn‚Äôt follow me around/pull the whole instance.
---
Those are rookie numbers. Ask anyone here lol
---
My Warrior‚Äôs first 5 talent points were into Cruelty in the fury tree. I just recently hit 24 and finally got tactical mastery 5/5 and feel like a real tank now. It‚Äôs super helpful to charge in where possible and swap over to defensive to get a quick sunder off. Also immensely helpful to swap to battle stance and have the rage available for mocking blow when taunt is resisted.
---
Lol, it is way more civilized now than the ghetto crack rock slinging vanilla we came from
---
2 months at earliest
---
Those realms had dynamic respawns so once you were ahead, especially aoe grinding as a mage, you skyrocketed.
---
Layer swapping. What now?
---
Everyone's making fun of my reserved names.. Well let me tell you, you wont be laughing when Hotel, my lvl 60 mage, comes out of the snowbanks and frost bolts your ass back to retail WoW
---
I disagree, it escalates pretty quickly from there
---
It starts to slow down significantly especially at higher levels.
---
source: tanked Uldaman at 42 today
---
He can undelete it at any time.
---
And then there is the other group that doesn't understand how modern server architecture is designed...
---
If your 100% doing dungeons than of course be prot. Also you would be surprised how strong a prot warrior can solo elites. I leveled 1-60 as prot in classic. Yea it's slower but if your a dungeon crawler you'll make friends
---
Which is why you wuldnt pre-hot your tank unless he has rave already built up so he can drop a thunderclap/swipe immediately.

considering private servers boasted over 750k accounts, why did Blizzard ever think it'd be less than that????

only reason i can think of is they're completely out of touch of the playerbase. and this pretty much proves it.

What‚Äôs layering and what‚Äôs resetting a layer?

Get it working?

awesome! :)

99% of PoE players dont understand how to build a character and just look for build guides, doing so in WoW would be dumb as hell.

They definitely need a better system but that many talents isn't neccessary
---
How exactly is method a world famous guild when two complete randoms beat them to level 60?
---
But that's what an exploit is...

It's an unintended abuse of a feature of gltich that they either didn't see or didn't care about. If they didn't care that's one thing. But if they didn't see it, then what your describing is literally exploiting lol

I've been logging in every day to my server noggenfogger at 0500 with zero queue for the past 3 days in a row. I've also been able to log out and back in instantly as late as midday.

bestiality is illegal in most areas.

I feel like the entire thing could be made lore pretty easily by defining the player characters as some kind of divine being spawned into the world.

tfw most of reddit also plays solo like you
---
Second place is the first loser.
---
WoW!
---
Maybe? Probably? Either that or people just stopped complaining since it's been so long.
---
What is there to discuss?
---
You group up with shamans or mages with instant cast spells, skip the quest, or switch to a server where this isn't an issue. 
---
I recommend option 3.
---
No
---
Also it will drain the imp‚Äôs mana if you keep it on auto and not firebolt.

It's the pent up nostalgia oozing out.  It'll be iver soon.

Definitely.

What if you move your auto cast abilities on pet‚Äôs bar?

Lua is a programming language and it's used to create addOns. Do you have addOns installed? If so, they're likely the culprit.

---
I‚Äôve been playing since launch(?) and have only had issues that first day. But then I‚Äôm playing when most people are at work, and I‚Äôm on a medium-full server.
---
This is what I think https://youtu.be/L52dVwMJTEc
---
The issue isn't damage, it's threat. As soon as you start dealing damage you're going to potentially be drawing aggro away from your voidwalker, especially if you're not waiting a few seconds for the voidwalker to build up a bit of threat first. If you open up with immolate you allow the voidwalker to get a slight headstart whereas CoA into corruption is going to get threat ticking up instantly. And if you get aggro, you lose health and if you lose health, you need to spend time regenerating between pulls.
---
I'm not saying it's necessarily best to open up with immolate but with the voidwalker's issues keeping threat, immolate into CoA is probably the most efficient way to grind mobs even if you're technically losing some DPS on each individual enemy.
---
When I see somebody running from a mob I automatically target them and heal them, cuz they are usually about to die. I don't wish that corpse walk upon anybody.
---
please tell me they were grouping up so 5 could get credit at once?
---
or even try a 10-40 group (i know raids usually dont give credit but checking once might be good).

I didn't even know this bit of info the other day, once you've learnt a profession and you've collected some resources for it you have to go to your spell book and click the profession too open up the menu too craft stuff lol I had all this leather from skinning but I didn't actually no how to use it with leather working
---
It's not WoW itself but your internet connection not being stable enough.  When it comes to an MMO the demand for network bandwidth is much higher and with an unstable connection it can certainly hit that tipping point.  When was the last time you rebooted your router/modem?
---
Bruh I read this with his fucking accent in my head.

Brazilian isn't a race....
---
But someone can wait till the other 4 people have greeded then ninja need it. The best way is to ask if anyone needs it to equip and if nobody says yes then everyone needs.
---
Ur my hero
---
To me it's a simple question of math: Is it worth waiting for a mob to spawn to complete a quest giving me 1000 xp or should I kill 7 mobs in the same time giving me the same amount of xp? Usually there's no actual reason to do most quests
---
poor mans also got kicked on the first day for like 4-5 hours
---
No he was answering the question of what to do when naxx was cleared and all classic content is released. I like that you went deep with it though.
---
Switching server isn't a great option when you've already invested time into a character, besides that I've already rolled on a server thats not full to begin with and rarely has queues.
---
I guess inviting all the mages and shammies to the group is one option to cheese it.
---
Who's got time for porn? I've got queues to sit in all day.

LOL WHAT WAS HIS IGN? THIS MAY HAVE BEEN ME
---
Dont worry the assholes are out there. They are just keeping to themselves for now. I had a mage trying to sneak past me constantly to ninja all the quest items and the chest I was going after if he pulled a job on accident he would bring it over to me in hopes that I would aggro it. He wouldn't even pull a single mob on purpose to leave the cave. He was so smug about it and because of all the nice players I wanted this one gnome mager to burn in hell. So just a heads up, they are there...
---
The Wheel weaves as the wheel wills.

i coincidentally had a bag gifted to me 2 hours before i started playing for the first time ever tonight.  Gota say it makes the grind way more fun üòä

Awesome, thanks!

What a Chad

Making my level 13 warrior look like hot garbage
---
I'm in the same boat except I did play pretty hardcore in vanilla (killed c'thun, quit as we were starting naxx). Classic has been fun but I was never one who was really fighting for it so maybe I'm just not the target audience. As someone who played it at what I would consider a high level, it's not that great of a game. Server Community was fantastic, and that is the biggest thing retail has lost, but otherwise it was a horrible slog. But, like I said I am enjoying it so far. I wouldn't be opposed to some small QoL changes, though.
---
Greens can only do so much. Still need to drink after every pull and any mistake can easily kill you. A single warrior charging you and hamstringing you will likely kill you. A stun = death.
---
if you haven't fixed it with a router/modem reboot, i'd definitely call your ISP and complain.
---
That's what the zepplins are for :)  (or boats)
---
Ah, might need to get a wand then.
---
You give a shit or you don't mate, end of.
---
It also saved him from ganks the whole way through though. 
---
On a normal classic server without layering, you expect to run into enemy players frequently. He might as well have been playing on a PVE server.
---
Yeah if you are use to hunters past wotlk I could see vanilla hunter not being for you.  It‚Äôs WAY more about the little things and pet management than later versions.
---
You‚Äôre actually a beauty tbh lol
---
But he is first Hunter, and yes no fair even in world of Warcraft.

Spirit tap?

Yeeeeeaaaaaa..... All of us playing classic want to continue playing classic

BRILLIANT!

thank you!

Are mages really best dps pvp? Is that only because of AOEs?

That's not really fair to Retail. It doesn't have a community.

As an avid /new browser while in queue I would say there have been hundreds of queue threads.  Almost none have put in even the barest of effort into being conducive of conversation.
---
Screenshots of queues just aren't the least bit interesting to anyone else and there's nothing to discuss.  There were literally hundreds of threads like that the first 3 days.
---
A lot of the queue related threads appear to actually be deleted by their OPs when they discover they aren't easy karma farms.
---
It is a cool summary, but they dont have to add fake information to shill their other guides. Joker wont farm pre-raid bis or do proffesions
---
Perhaps different people value different things. Crazy thought, I know. The world does adhere to your opinion, after all.

Pretty sick character man!

10 silver, man that's a lot. Even at level 29 that's substantial

On my server it auctions for 1 copper above vendor price, just not worth.
---
The very same!
---
Great tips in here so far. In addition to these, try to get a throwing weapon or ranged weapon of some sort so you can pull mobs to you. This can be really helpful when in an area that has the mobs close together. When you first start out, pulling 1-2 extra mobs can mean certain death. 
---
You will probably need to visit a weapon master to learn how to use a ranged weapon.
---
What's the trick?

it's a little different than it was in vanilla. but friendly to eachother &gt; toxic

Omfg that's what level I was and where I was at the end of the stress test!!!

I LOVE it when i see ¬´mismatched¬ª characters, coolest thing there is, gogogo
---
Honestly it seems over 20% of people I see waling around in the game are priests. I also rolled one and it took me over an hour to find a RFC group.
---
It's only like that so people don't troll with it.      
---
PWS rank 1 on a lvl50 priest "could you please not do that?"      
---
(2 hours later, still doing it, following them everywhere so they can never PWS themselves)      
---
PWS on warrior who just wants to generate rage from being hit. etc   
---
Not much reason the other classes wouldn't want it on them though, no matter the rank.
---
Very sweet!

‚ÄúI play horde because they‚Äôre more mature‚Äù cit.

Solo hunter play using a guide of his own construction. Minimal grinding and mostly relied on quests.

He'll be releasing it once it is fine-tuned (for free, I believe).

Metzen is defo on an rp server
---
Hey guys. Me and my friend are starting together and we want to PvP and level together. I already rolled a rogue and he'll be starting tomorrow. We are choosing between warrior, druid and rogue for him. We feel that warrior is kind of dull and we'd prefer his character to have stealth. Neither of us played druid, how is it in PvP compared to rogue? He already played rogue and loved it in retail, but we don't want to compete for loot (although that'd happen with druid as well I guess if he'd go feral?)
---
Quest elsewhere. Go to the barrens

Go run rfc. Level up in that. Where are you questing at?

7yo is old enough. I beat warcraft 1 at 7. I learned to read at 5 so I could navigate MSDOS and not have to wait for my dad to get back from work to start up games for me.

Let your son join you.
---
That's a tough stage for most players. You might want to try and find another place to level, perhaps one that is slightly below your current level (12 or 13) that you can quest or grind in for a level or two to help you over that hump. 
---
Either that, or, find some people to group with!

He did alternate with someone else while he slept

yup! you got him :). The name changes automatically to the pet family. You can change the name once (but never again) to whatever you'd like.

I did play retail, the first time in. Then I backed out and got into the proper ones. I jist think I'm in a 24hr starter modem

Thank you all for your responses! Sorry for the late reply, been hurricane prepping for the wek :(.
---
No, YOU‚ÄôRE the gift of the universe that gave us classic :)
---
i put a box on my keyboard to make my  character run in circles but it still boots me for being afk
---
What, you wanted nuanced discussion? This is Reddit!
---
Nope, weapon is just a stat stick.
---
This actually turned out to be my favorite part of rolling healer shaman. I never played classic before btw. I've come across many people (warriors) just inches away from death before I heal them so they can finish the fight. Also I find many dead people in the Barrens and I ALWAYS rez people. I didn't think it was a big deal till I died and had to run like 5 mins back to my corpse. I like to do nice things as a healer.
---
For feral, no. your weapon is just a stat stick. For other classes, yes.
---
Personally I'd stick it out on a larger server. In a few weeks queues will die down and then several months from now you will probably be on a healthy server for population which will be important if you want to get 40 man raid groups together, while a server that's low pop now might eventually just be outright dead later on.
---
 If you're more into solo content or want to be on a low pop realm for farming rares etc. then go for the low pop realms.
---
I gotta say, it‚Äôs crazy to me that there are people who are unknowingly playing classic with Metzen. Like this was the guy in terms of guiding WoW‚Äôs story for so long and now he‚Äôs just another dude playing the game with everyone else. And I would assume that a lot of people at this point don‚Äôt even know who he is.
---
And some don't.  The leather belt sells for like 38c and costs 62c in mats
---
I think it depends on the quest and how quest dependent your class is (meaning how quickly your class kills stuff. Some classes like paladins kill stuff slowly and mages and warlocks kill stuff with great efficiency) so it's difficult to give a correct answer. I quit questing on my warlock and got one level from just killing stuff at level 17 in 45 minutes, while I quested on my warrior because she couldn't kill stuff very efficiently at that level so would take twice the amount of time just killing stuff and was better off doing quests.
---
Questing in general is very overrated in my opinion. 
---
Sometimes you might miss out on an important quest. Some classes are very weapon dependant (rogue, warrior) and missing out on a quest chain that would reward you with a great weapon would be a huge loss, but otherwise I wouldn't worry about missing a quest or anything. Just killing stuff is almost always faster than questing without a good route.
---
poor guy ran all the way to if all pumped and no one was there

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwowplus/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwowplus/)
---
I feel exactly the same.  Had more than my share of PVP from vanilla through wrath, went for a PVE server this time.  I guess it's a shame that we're carebears who are missing out on the entire game, but honestly I've been having so much fun that I hadn't really noticed that.
---
Just had my first PvP encounter in Ashenvale. I see an undead rogue. Try to run past him. He looks me up and down and stealths.
---
Shit is about to go down. I pop Perception just as he pops the opener. It was too late. 
---
We exchange blows, I get garroted. I'm pumping Seals and Judgements into him, he tries to restealth, I holy light. He then blinds me and bandages. The blind breaks, and I greet him with a Hammer of Justice. 
---
Another exchange of frantic DPS cooldowns, we both hit 25%, Lay on Hands has 30 seconds CD on it.  It wont be up  in time. What can I use? I remember my alchemist friend sent me potions. I look down at my bars, the big red one. The one that says "From Haney, use in emergency." I got it bud. I chugged it down, and the rogue chugs a potion down as well. I slam him with more auto attacks and judgements,  I get a crit and kill him. 
---
I go to type /laugh, but he already released.
---
Ahh..pure world pvp. 10 seconds after running into my first PvP zone.
---
I don‚Äôt understand how it‚Äôs 15 years later and I‚Äôm still grinding in The Barrens to the sounds of Tool. This has become a very weird moment in my life.
---
First time playing WoW and the community is amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
You do sound salty af man.
---
Oh no a redditor doesn't use dark mode better shit on them.  Wait he downvoted a spam of the same content?  Crucify him how dare he choose to downvote an overly spammed discussion.
---
I really don't see why OP has to be "salty" and "angry" because he chose to utilize downvotes and point out the massive spam of posts.  But you can stay salty and angry over it I guess.
---
Who cares
---
I made the mistake of trying to level my professions with me instead of just taking skinning... always broke.
---
Same joy as a heroin addict
---
Back in the day it was all about tribal knowledge and discovery. You'd likely miss many quests the first go around and it wouldn't be until way later that you'd find them and be blown away. That knowledge could be used on a second character or to help others doing it for the first time.
---
That being said I've been using questie in the same way and feels like a good compromise to me. We can't turn back the clock on everything after all.
---
I mean obviously not everyone on Classic is a ray of sunshine.
---
I don't plan to speed run but everytime I make a new character I try to level it as fast as I possibly can. During content draughts I'll make a new warrior and see how much more efficient I've become. Watching myself improve is a huge rush. I usually end up deleting those characters too.
---
Rested xp caps at like 3 levels I think. But yeah your idea is right tho, like just take big breaks and do massive chunks
---
I like this better the the Jaina one tbh.
---
Is there a clip of the beginning ? That'd be the most crucial part of the run imo, getting ahead of the gigantic wave of players to get some early quests in. Unless he mob bashed from 1 onwards ?

You've probably done Silverpine then, so I guess you should head to stonetalon. Or do SFK and WC.

So is Chinese a race?

There are 44 dominant ethnic groups in China I guess that is also not a race

THIS IS MORTAL ONLINE'S PICTURE LOL, I played the shit outta that MMO. Currently it only has like 30-50 concurrent players. RiP StarVault x Mortal Online
---
Most people do that so that they can be miserable and go to work. He played WoW and likely made more money from donations. It's definitely not bad.
---
he was joining random groups to join their layer, spawning fresh mobs, aoeing them down, rinse repeat. Basically zero downtime besides when you have to drink
---
people just ask in world chat for invite to new layer.
---
What profession should I choose for mage?
---
At least you can boost to 110 or whatever level it was first though.
---
Means the damage portion doesn't do anything for you, but the +Stam / +Dex / +Str does
---
It defaults use shift right click to get all.  But you can change it to right click onky
---
Nobody has money and everyone has a gathering profession. High supply and low demand means cheap prices. Then the few engineers and swipe all the mats up funding it by selling leather to vendors.
---
I gotta go to bed. This got me bad. Congrats at 14+ and I wish you all the best!
---
also want a link of this pls
---
Blaze it
---
When you hit 150 in your professions and see how much it is for expert
---
And his bank accoun
---
Just leave it on the default. You have to know the people you are with or have a very good reason to move it off the default. A good reason is if you want to stay grouped up with someone but you are no longer playing together for a time, then it makes sense to go to free for all so you don't have to run over to loot each other's corpses. 
---
You can ABSOLUTELY roll on items that you cannot equip, and frankly, you should, because it's silly to think "oh, I am level 29, this level 30 blue item is not for me. You are the person who will get the most out of it, as you can use it for the entirety of it's useful life. 
---
Level is not a consideration on who should get an item. How significant an upgrade is. For example, in super low levels, alliance melee wants to roll on caster rings, because otherwise it's an empty slot. but frankly, I would be perfectly fine with a mage murdering you if you roll need on lavishly jeweled ring. It's not "just" "is this an upgrade. There's also a bit of common sense.
---
But not a huge amount.
---
Dog you also have friends inviting you to different layers to instant spawb mobs?
---
It's just the name of a section of mountains in the IF area. It looks like vanilla ice cream. I'll go see if I can get there and I'll message you with some pictures of it. Might be a bit though.
---
washing? pfft amateurs...
---
Anyone knows where he is from?
---
Also did he do it purely solo AoE farming with no quest, or some dungeon farming too?
---
Moneybags over here
---
Gloom weed*
---
Must hear and obey.
---
Except if everyone rolls need, you can reduce the chance of a ninja looter taking the item.
---
Example:
---
The 2h sword drops and the warrior would like to equip it.
---
There is a ninja rogue in the party,
---
Scenario 1: everyone rolls need. There is a 4/5 chance the warrior gets to equip the item if those who truly don't need it give it up.
---
Scenario 2: a couple of people roll "greed" and the rogue rolls need, attempting to take the item from the warrior and sell it. You now have a 3/5 or 2/5 chance that the warrior gets the item.
---
In a public group, everyone rolling need will *always* be better, even if the group is in agreeance that the person who will equip gets priority.
---
Well flight paths are awesome, so i feel ya.
---
Haha...yeah.  I forgot how rough it could be.  For the first little while you need to feed your pet all the time.  His happiness level will drop often, especially if he dies or is dismissed.  Once he reaches loyalty rank 3 its more manageable...you can get there in a night.  Rank 4 and up you pretty much need to neglect it for it for it to run away.
---
layering will literally be gone by the time phase 2 rolls out. the devs have mentioned this many times.

Well think of it this way - if you have a dude with a chick, that's 50% dude, so 50% gay. But if it's a futa with a chick, the futa's only like half dude at most themselves. So it's only like 25% gay. So really it's gayer to watch straight porn than to look at futa x female.

Futa x male though...yeah that's much gayer haha.

Current raids are FAR harder. If you released an MC equivalent tier it would be a joke, tiers below emerald nightmare for difficulty.
---

It's a lvl 20 blue, useless to any Twink.

WoW mom here! My kids are 16 and 18,neither want to play :(  but my husband and I are having a blast on the Alliance side of Bloodsail Buccaneers. Happy loots to all!

Bellular has a video about wow shift to 'services'. He cited Ion with sources. WOW makes money from services now, what do you think the allied races actually are? They are incentives to race change. It has been pretty obvious for a while now actually.
---
I want to see it too!

Better for your feet anyhow
---
I'm with /u/iljune, it's gotta be the trainer you're using.  Low level trainers don't really get better themselves, and you'll overtake their capabilities very quickly.
---
I say that every time i join a group as heal. The question was more about if it's ok if i still have to wait for some level to use it.
---
Damn it‚Äôs gonna suck when you find out about the history of slavery in the United States
---
I laughed really hard at this.
---
I mean a wand in your ranged slot. Wands are very overpowered in the early lvls of vanilla. No spell pushback and and you save mana. And move to a zone for your lvl. Barrens is Nice, tho it is alot of running.
---
[the world is gone mad...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCGjdI__uPU)
---
Rank 1 Amplify (lvl 18) costs 150 mana, gives +30 healing. [Rank 2 Renew](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=6074/renew) (lvl 14) has a spell coefficient of 0.155 per tick. Amplify should increase it from 20 per tick to 24.65 per tick (don't know how it gets rounded). If Renew has a 50% uptime during the 10 minutes' duration of Amplify, that's an extra 465 healing, equivalent to an extra 302 mana for the priest. If Renew's uptime is greater than 50% or the priest uses other spells as well, there's even more benefit.
---
So it's effective even if a group is never close to wiping due to healers being out of mana. The time it takes the mage to recover 150 mana is less than for priest to recover 300.
---
Thanks
---
Don't worry about talents for healing early game, they only become relevant after you've amassed 30 or so of them so about level 40. Any class with enough armor and threat can tank early game and any class with a heal can heal early game.
---
I'd pick whatever those guides say for leveling. Wand specialization especially is fantastic.
---
Scouting guild recruits you and gets a feel for you and if they like you they invite you to the actual big guild.
---
Nah I &gt;!make love.!&lt; Classic tho. Classic fucks. It fucks us all. And it do us right, too. Aint nobody do me like classic.
---
Thanks a lot! I'll give it a try tomorrow after 3-5 hours in the queue.
---
Smh
---
Lmao, this is the fucking best.
---
Oh, never found one actually. I assume I should get that?
---
So what? You can‚Äôt assume that and once he has it it‚Äôs his to do with whatever he wants. The point is that he‚Äôs the only one who can conceivably use the item as a gear upgrade and has priority in receiving it. Otherwise, like others have pointed out, you can expand the concept of need to mean whatever you want and then no one would ever roll greed ever.
---
I heard he had friends help to abuse layering, getting invited to layers with fresh mobs to aoe grind. Not a cheat, but I've seen people get banned for similar "clever use of game mechanic" scenarios.
---
Yeh absolute short end of the stick for that guy
---
I just logged out, but about an hour ago someone in general said they were 12.
---
I was older than 12 the first time around. I've been legally able to drive for all of WoW's existence.
---
Still part of the game and should be IMO. Just wait until the other player aggro the mob then take the chest yourself.
---
All my friends bailed because I picked a pvp server :(
---
But sooo worth when you are one of the early ones to have it to rake in allll the shiny golds
---
No he won't. Journey isn't even close considering how much faster a mage does 40-60.

It's a nice little income yeah. I think Skinning is a bit more lucrative than Herbalism but it's dependent on your realm.

Nah level doesn‚Äôt matter. You stated you were rolling enhance, they took you. You helped clear the content you are entitled to its rewards
---
this is the only correct spelling of that
---
I sold a lvl 19 dagger for 15g
---
People have been banned for exploiting Blizzards mechanics plenty of times.
---
A bit more than 60 mana
---
That had a droprate of over 50% for me. It's nothing compared to westfall stew IMHO.
---
I got ~40g at level 31, and it's all thanks to grinding mobs instead of questing. Around level 25 you start getting 1-2g every time you vendor everything you loot, and if you go tail/skinning you make even more from crafting and selling bags. The beautiful part is that grinding in most cases also is a faster way to level than questing, so it's a win-win.
---
and then they turn around and kill you.
---
See this Horde Mage about to die to the quest mob on Ranazjar Isle, so I help him nuke the boss. Once the mob respawned I started fighting it and a Frostbolt hits me in the back. Fuck you Zonas, should have let you die
---
Hahahahahahaha
---
Now we all want to see this
---
I see! You should be getting a wand quest soon. But if you have some Silver to spare i would buy Greater Magic Wand of the AH. Should be around 20s. This wand is very strong for its req lvl(13), and Will last you for 10 levels.
---
Yes
---
Logic has nothing to do with what Blizzard decides is bannable. We cannot predict them.
---
who cares?
---
Thanks, I didn't try out healing or tanking until like MoP or WoD so it's kinda new to me.
---
I spent 15 hours on a character day 1 then switched to a new server day 2. It was a great decision. No queues and barely any competition for quests. And when there is competition its easy to group up and make friends.
---
No just keep classic and next year launch TBC servers
---
I love flying. I also loved parachute jumps from my dragon and shooting people off their mounts.

Or dive bombing into a cluster of baddies with a superhero landing.

There were paratrooper reps in BC that were screaming at me to upgrade from the engineer cloak, so yea...me and buddies were paratrooping in wow.
---
I don't shadow bolt unless I have a sneaky suspicion about nightfall procing. I usually run around dotting other things up. When I hit 30 and got siphon life then I really went ham multi pulling. Basically multi for 4 things go oom life tap health stone drain soul vw target, drain life next target, and if you get procs shadow bolt a dotted up target.
---
Alright I‚Äôll go buy that. Thanks for the help
---
You do understand he's playing it up right? He doesn't actually believe it's anything worth celebrating beyond the fact he's just happy to have a mount.
---
His entire shtick is to trigger people like you and /u/WeedCondaforever and you fall for it.
---
Druid is hardest pvp class or least casual friendly to be good at.

Level 8, questing in Tristfall, "Deaths in the Family" (kill 3 named undead, last name Agamand), go into the "Agamand Family Crypt", find level 11-13 mobs, die multiple times, get to the end, turns out to be the wrong area.
---
Level 11, have actual quest to go into the "Agamand Family Crypt", find level 8s doing the same thing I did, rez them, tell them they are in the wrong area and point them in the right direction, feel like I genuinely helped people.
---
The 40-60 level bracket is the most depressing thing cause you gotta buy spells but also save for mount.
---
Not that I really care but he only did it for the last 2 levels apparently. And then again, it's in the game, why not abuse it? We can all do it if we want
---
depends on how quickly you level. It's a big investment at very low levels (to pay the fees to mail stuff around), and when that becomes irrelevant around level 20, it still will be impractical to actually find buyers for about another month, I would guess. but after that, things pick up very quickly. 
---
If you are level 30 once people are level 60, the key stuff like wild steelbloom are likely to be very valuable, and it's not unreasonable on a mature server for wild steelbloom to be worth 40+ silver, each. 
---
the question is just how quickly we will transition from the first state to the latter. 
---
also, herbalism is a bit punishing because some herbs are much more important than others, so that can mislead you. For example, kingsblood and wild steelbloom are about the same skill to harvest. One is very cheap, one is incredibly expensive. You might waste all your time picking kingsblood and not enough time going out of your way to check steelbloom spawns, and figure out the paths to get to them (steelboom spawns often in hilly areas and the nodes often must be accessed from a specific side as they are on the edge of an unclimbable cliff).
---
What the fuck is skyzone
---
Someone was literally singing my praises in /1 because I solo healed a 4 man group through deadmines up to VC and then waited about 45 minutes for them to find a tank to beat VC and it felt great.
---
I had the same issue, thanks!
---
ya same here, when did you make you account out of curiosity?
---
I'd normally argue that the healer should be first in line for shoulders or robes depending on which drops, and especially if it's a guild run and you'll most likely be running with that healer again at some point. Keep good relations and all.
---
But on the actual topic which is if the shoulders are okay for a shaman or not I'd say it's fair. Normally agility shoulders would be your go-to but those are limited at this level range. There's not a single stat on those shoulders a shaman won't make full use of. So it's fair.
---
You say that but it's the same for horde on my sever once you go 1v1 by the time the fights over you have 6 or 7  horde on you!

I'm legit surprised nobody did that. Just have like 3 classic pro speed runners take turns in 8 hour shifts.

Warrs get more abilities that aren't auto attacks, don't worry. And if you tank, people will practically give free bjs to get you in their dungeon groups. It's totally worth it speaking as someone who has played warr since day one 15 years ago

You shouldn't be, ranged is literally only a stat stick for you

I played original release and didnt realise that either lol. Was told it's a tbc thing
---
There is probably like a psychological reason for this. I have a theory that Alliance players in general are more passive and don‚Äôt really like aggression. My image of the Alliance is that it wants to retain order and do what is best for Azeroth. While the Horde is much more aggresive and wants rapid expansion.

I think who you identify the most with is the faction you will pick.

Nobody‚Äôs gonna get banned for trying to stay logged into a game. I‚Äôve seem at least a hundred people doing something similar. It‚Äôs not the players fault or responsibility to allow other people to login.

Yep same... needy little shits

I was in the same boat as a priest. I just did the Pyrewood quests with a group of 5 and farmed mobs for the low drop rate shackles for a little while. Once that was done I did RFC twice in a row and that really helped push me over that lvl hump.

I'm also very confused

It's not a race, it's a nationality... Do you literally not know what countries are?

Where did I say that I believed that the Nazis didn‚Äôt use gas chambers? Do have any idea of what I am trying to say? I reread my comment twice to try and see how you think that I believe that the Nazis didn‚Äôt use gas... where? what sentence? I‚Äôm doing my best to see this from your perspective but I can‚Äôt see it, please help me understand. Did you have a similar interaction with someone that believed that nazis were not so bad? Is it the ‚Äústarvation factually happened‚Äù part? Do you think no one starved or that I think starvation was the only means of killing?

druids are able to use 1h mace/offhand/ staves/ 2h maces iirc. mostly focus on getting good stat 2h staves or maces

Some crazy tracking. I had a multi shot today fire and hit a target behind me.

Raid times pretty much. The latency difference typically isn‚Äôt enough to matter. Unless your internet is absolute shit or the route it‚Äôs taking to get to the server on the west coast is shit.

World pvp in classic is one of its best features - i hated when they ruined it the first time round, i hope they dont do it again.
---
please share an original class/race combo you retard
---
I don't fight because I don't really care about pvp. To me, it's more a waste of time when I can just run somewhere else and continue whatever I'm doing. 
---
Even if I did feel like fighting, it feels rude to sneak up on someone and attack them. They're probably questing or gathering and maybe they don't want to fight.
---
That was the whole point of layering so that the server could handle any number of players. If they can‚Äôt dynamic create those based on demand then something isn‚Äôt working on blizzard end.
---
I find it funny how most people ITT think it's impossible to play for like 4 days and don't rest much.

Ok the answer wasn't as matter of fact as I remembered it but this is what was said:
---
&gt;Q: Will PAID transfers also be a thing should a server drop heavily in population and a player wishes to move to find more activity or reconvene with friends on another server?
---
&gt;A: We‚Äôre considering integrating a character transfer service once players have reached higher levels. This was available in the original WoW. We‚Äôll look at the rules we imposed at that time and also discuss the implications of players moving to a new realm. We believe realm identity is an important aspect of Classic so any guidelines around transfers should support this belief.

I happened to be in the middle of a vacation from work when this released. From it's release to today I was able to put in 48 hours on my character and have only made it to level 22 and a half. You have to realize that the people who are super high level already likely sacrificed things like professions and stuff in order to be efficient, or are streamers not only being paid to play basically, but also whose fans supply them with stuff to keep them going. Take your time and enjoy the adventure, youre doing well for only having the game out for a few days
---
Fine. Negative doot
---
I think that still might cause you to miss out on that discovery element. I accidentally found that random dwarf for the deadmines quest, and it felt so awesome. Afterward I remembered having done that in vanilla, but I had completely forgotten about it so it felt like a fresh discovery. And to this day I'll never forget this amazing quest I found way back in vanilla. I was randomly running in the dagger hills above Moonbrook as a level 30 or 40 something. There was a quest there for my level range to my surprise. It sent me all around the world collecting key items, and I got a trinket for a reward that makes you breathe fire and do damage! People asked about it constantly when I popped it in fights.  I felt so epic for finding that by accident!

Okay, its going to take much longer than I thought to get there as I am playing a warrior and not a mage and it seems I will need to be a mage/engineer for this. SO! Here is a really old video of a person going to [Icecream Valley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hrmm6UgzQmo)

That's fair enough. Since the Wii I've exclusively only purchased Nintendo consoles for their exclusive IPs. Though for me that's infinitely worth it. I personally thought Odyssey and BotW were some of the highest quality games Nintendo's released in a good while.

It‚Äôs real mob health! I believe, I am using, still having issues.

The only addons ill probably get is a threat meter (so i wont die) a dps meter (so i can stroke my epeen) and gatherer because i love gatherer. Not just because i want a classic experience, but also because i wont want a bunch of clinky addons.
---
You can level perfectly fine as fire, although frost is easier. You still need to kite some though. Start pulling with frostbolt rank 1, and weave some frostbolts in between your fireballs - elementalist kite king.
---
You need to get the hit talent in frost, and you need to bind frost nova, blink and probably water to quite accessible keybinds. Mostly though, youre gonna burn those dumb mobs down fast as hell, and be dps king in groups until you reach the instances in blackrock mountain.
---
I leveled a mage alt as fire back in late vanilla, and went crazy with dreamweave chest, gloves and head. The 40+ experience was great. Killed Whitemane in SM Cath before she could res Mograine, when I did it with another fire mage and a lock (died to dots and ignite after sleeping us).
---
If you respec to frost though, you will have an easier time, with slow, freezing mobs in their tracks, and shattering their faces with beefed up frostbolt crits. That's also fun, and a lot easier as a first time mage. You'll also be in the right spec for starting the gear grind at 55+.
---
You're entitled to your opinion of whether or not you like them but saying either of those games is beta quality is objectively false.

I didn‚Äôt see it mentioned but repair your gear.

Literally a chair right behind him too
---
To be fair, the AH in SW in retail isn‚Äôt in the same location it as it was in vanilla. It‚Äôs right around the corner.
---
Not wanting to sacrifice the communal reliance of the game by bringing LFG, etc. may be one view point, and for that reason I'm willing to suffer through it all over again. But having to take a 40 minute journey to run some dungeons being a lot of fun? I would wager you're a minority.

I think a more viable strategy is to hold mats until the gold supply plateaus. This is basically how you become rich in wallstreets.

Yesterday, I did almost everything right. Started to queue around lunch, came into character select in the late afternoon.

This game has been so refreshing
---
Omg..... plz stop. I see this post almost 3 times a day everyday since launch
---
Fully talented VW holds threat fine for me. I send VW in first, start casting shadow bolt and spam a couple then wand the last hit or two. Things die ultra fast, I never go oom, and consume shadows after every handful of mobs. Simple, fast, easy. No dots, no drain tanking. Just VW, shadowbolt, wand.
---
You are, sir
---
I literally give away all the greens I find that I can't use. I run around inspecting people and just trade it to them.
---
Hey man, that worked! Kinda. I get the maps and everything, but I still get an error message o when logging in.  I‚Äôm ignoring it for now, since the maps work, but do you have any ideas?
---
Or.. you know.. adding more servers? :)
---
Sure if you write your own filter driver. Warden monitors commonly used drivers.
---
It's nice that the guys dedication payed of, but i really don't care about these kind of things.
---
i hate when that happens.
---
The melee damage is a pretty big upgrade over my weapon ;)
---
Gimmick fun. Flying mounts are more harm than good
---
No, your breathtaking!
---
I always make sure to go out of my way to craft up a healthstones for my warrior buddies. Doin God's work, they are.
---
Im lvl 33 and the only talents i have in resto are for feral buffs. I feel confident i could have healed anything ive done if i wasnt tanking.
---
Like others said, as you get more ranks of your spells you can play around with them and cast pretty comfortably. Regen when you need to and make smart choices of ranks to cast and youll be fine. If you are on discord with your tank friend talk about whats happening and you should be golden. If you need to drink, drink.
---
I wouldnt be discouraged, just keep playing and as you level itll become clearer how/what to do. Make sure your war friend isnt afraid of using pots yall find, and everyone should level and first aid i dont care who you are. Itll cutdown dramatically on down time
---
Tldr: los range pull.
---
Some people are just entitled, they think they're smart for making a macro/script for keeping them from being booted. It is just unfair to the 8000+ people staring at a screen waiting on their 300+ minute timer. I take the time to report every single AFK dodger I see, hope they all get bans
---
Don‚Äôt sell it now. Let that shit fester in your bank for 1+ yrs so you can reap the reward. Staff of Jordan‚Äôs a long con.
---
Are good... as healers. Even the only one of them who isn't favored doing PvP while on a healing build (30/0/21 ele shaman) is still on healing/cleansing duty for most of the time. 
---
Pallies are pushed towards holy 24/7 and druid... well, they're pushed towards max survivability and that means a resto-ish variant most of the time (the only sort of exception being the 29/11/11 "balance" druid, with HotW and swiftmend/feral charge builds being quite more common).
---
Because if you find 1 horde you find 5. LITERALLY horde majority on every PvP server.
---
And yes, Alliance most likely only fight when they have the advantage. Because them having the advantage is so damn rare they deserve it.
---
And this is coming from someone who spent the last 15 years on Horde side.
---
Not always. The worst feeling is sitting there waiting for that quest mob solo only to have a group of 3 friends roll past ignore you, manage to tag the mob and piss off.  
---
There's a particular top pserver guild on our realm that are the worst attitude wise.
---
are you honestly stupid enough to believe that one faction is more cowardly than the other?  this is ALL world pvp regardless of faction
---
I love posts like these. I‚Äôd personally love for them to squish everything down a bit. When your white damage  is in the hundreds of thousands or whatever and you crit for over a million, it makes the game seem less relatable. If they squished it down so TBC, Wotlk, Legion, WoD were all in that 60-90 level, and then have BFA be 90-100 (or something like that), and reduced the dmg and attack numbers a bit, I think they‚Äôd feel more ‚Äúreal‚Äù somehow.
---
This was hilarious btw
---
Well ya, but this is free infinite rage potions!
---
How do you even do this while playing live?
---
i learned that one the hard way back in DAoC as a healer.  i kept running until i died.. then wondered why they didn't help me.  apparently melee can't attack at ranged; who would have thought.
---
Here I was, pretty happy to reach 20. That changed now, lol.
---
This - i have some on the ah for good price;)
---
How often does it work, 5 out of 10? My FD+Trap only works about half the time. Really annoying in AOE pulls with Explosive Trap.
---
Rage potions are the shit.  You should buy some from me!
---
How do you explain the Alliance being more passive?  They fight just as much, but they never do it in an even match up.  My point is I only ever see alliance fight when they have the upper hand and never when a fair fight presents itself.  I am NOT complaining about getting ghanked by gangs, that just happens and should be expected on a pvp server.
---
How do these get to gold shire ? Rare spawn?
---
This is condescending but are you the type of person to have a stance in the console war between playstation and xbox?
---
That's lame. I can't imagine playing on a PVE server. World PVP is such a huge part of the game.
---
Funny thing is that if you said that in Cataclysm when the talent system was gutted out, you were downvoted to hell.
---
2 things you needs to know about this guy. 1: he tried to delete the toon to show it didn't matter to him but couldn't because people keep sending him mail. 2: he didn't do it alone he had a friend take over every 12 hours to help which is against the rules. He cheated doesn't count.
---
I roll with wisdom up, Run up to a mob, seal of the crusader up, then hit my macro 
---
/cast judgement
---
/cast seal of righteousness
---
Auto attack to death. 
---
Judgement doesn‚Äôt trigger a global so it does both at once unless you are in a GCD, it which it will just refresh the seal. This macro can def be improved but it works for now, and I‚Äôm not sure how to use modifiers
---
* That would be too confusing and our developers wouldn‚Äôt understand. (Translated)

---
Bruh I literally had all of this happen to me today. It's been my first time playing WoW and I wanted Classic to be my first experience. I was 2 when the game originally came out so I didn't exactly have a chance to get the good experience the first time.
---
I really like this game.
---
Technically speaking there are no "rules" here.  The only rules are what exist mechanically and that is the ability to roll need or greed.  Obviously if you roll need on something you don't actually need, that's a dick move.  Rolling need on something that you *do* need is not a dick move, regardless of what some weirdos tell you.
---
If you win then it makes sense to equip the item immediately.  If someone said this to me I'd ignore them, plain and simple.
---

The one thing that I really enjoy about this flight is that it‚Äôs actually really beautiful and you get a mix of coast line and lots of zones. I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôd be the perfect time to smoke a bowl, out settings on high and enjoy the views. Or take a break haha
---
That's... actually how PvP worked back in 2005. Except the people running after you weren't 15-25 levels lower than you. Sometimes they were 15-25 levels higher than you.
---
You spent over half your time in every zone PvP'ing. That's what the whole PvP experience was about. That's why you rolled on PvP servers.
---
Leveling in the plaguelands on a PvP server should be a constant battle between both players and mobs. Spending much of your time dead. Some days barely getting any exp in at all.
---
Why did he bother rolling on a PvP server if he didn't want any of this?
---
This is what has kept me from resubbing. I feel like the nostalgia is gonna wear off pretty fast. The top guilds will probably get worlds firsts almost immediately, its not like there are any new strats to learn. Not to mention the strats are way easier than newer expansions.
---
When you got a 3-5 person group quest and there aren't a ton of people in the area to help and its way too hard to solo you're just going to end up frustrated.
---
I'd like to know, and they may have released information I haven't read yet, what blizzard plans to do going forward. What's the timeline?
---
Ok cool so naxx and aq?
---
They ignore health and mana, gogogo... to cemetery
---
No, I have a preference based on exclusives I like. But I never fanboy'ed one side.
---
posture of peace
---
The BiS one? Should have waited a bit for the first twinks, then that thing sells for 100++ - but I understand those 15g help a lot at the beginning :)
---
Couldn't be more true.
---
Who are you and why are you having my thoughts?
---
Except I‚Äôm in darkshore. No one give a shit there lol
---
It was in terms of solo-herbing and PvP, when it comes to being invited to a group and as such enemies respawn when switching layers there's little they can do I'm afraid.
---
Shut up, im killing boars here!!
---
The zone stories of BFA are great, the only really bright part actually. The war campagin on the other hand is garbage.
---
I do too but I think it has to be viewed as a mistake in retrospect. I actually think talent trees are my absolute favorite part of any RPG. I love planning my advancement and looking at what things I can achieve and combine. It gives me something real to micro manage and make my character feel utterly unique.
---
Just like in hearthstone where many play net decks, I‚Äôm always trying to come with some mad, fun and successful deck that no one else has thought of. I liked to do this with talents too, until they took them away. I‚Äôve always found the new system inherently unsatisfying... boring even, as the talents are grouped into generic categories so your choice is illusory. You pick a movement talent in the movement section etc and you end up with a generic character at the end of it. What if I want to sacrifice movement for brutal burst? I want to be allowed to do that, even if it means I die more than usual. That‚Äôs what talent trees allowed for. They allowed real genuine choices between play styles even within classes. Some talents were crap but so what? Some cards are crap in hearthstone. Doesn‚Äôt stop me trying to make them work and having fun with it.
---
I'll be honest, I'm not very fond of building social connections.
---
I only joined WoW after BC when they had the dungeon finder and I loved that thing. No matter my schedule or how slowly or quickly I leveled, I could use it to find a group of people to play with.
---
With naturally found groups you always have to worry about under leveling or out leveling them and needing to seek out a whole new social circle. I had a few friends who started characters with me but I ended up getting left way behind due to work commitments and I know that's just going to keep happening.
---
oh shit that makes sense
---
Must be a bug, because ElvUI shows me my buff durations, but the enemies debuffs is just a static bar. I made Weak Auras 2 bars to compensate.
---
damn, did not know that
---
It‚Äôs not a good pet. It doesn‚Äôt do ant DPS and it can‚Äôt hold aggro. Succubus is the best.
---
What server?
---
You're in the wrong capital
---
I though so, apparently the lava in the 2nd boss room doesn‚Äôt do any damage. You do have to fall off the ‚Äúshortcut‚Äù to get into it though.
---
... Questie doesn't read the quest text for me. It just puts on the map where all the quests are, so I can easily find all the exclamation marks whether they show up for me or not. Questie has helped me make sure I get to read all the text.
---
This is the same guy that came in 2nd back in Joana's 4d20h run!  He was playing a warlock, though.
---
I swap from Shazzrah to Firemaw and then to Mograine, I've played 30ish hours and found a really good guild, not swapping again. I know there's a really long q on the evening so either I try to q before I leave or just don't play at all. But I do understand both your opinion and those who complain. 
---
Just chill and hope that it gets better next week or the next after that, it always does. I played bfa launch on Draenor and there were qs as well for over a week
---
I mean, you're completely wrong about every piece of gear being purple when you start an expac.
---
Also, purple means epic, not rare. Rare is blue.
---
Do you really think people are going to want to go through vanilla-esque level grinds every couple of years or so? I don't. It's fine once, but given the complaints about the leveling changes in the BfA prepatch, people don't like long leveling.
---
I did think about not getting mounts until half way to the level cap. I think it's dumb, and you had better believe that people will think Blizz did it just to slow people down and force them to sub for longer.
---
If you don't think people flamed low DPS people, tanks, or healers in classic, I have a bridge to sell you. This may be exacerbated by random dungeon groupings, but it definitely isn't caused by it.
---
Wasn't planning on it , but i am a lvl 15 mage, and still match all your criteria

/cast !autoshoot
---
Perhaps, but they didn't do all of them at the same time. I suspect that given how little lore is surrounding the mastery quests (even though they are my favorite in the game), and how they ALL come from the same place at the same time, Someone just said "stranglethorn's looking sparse. We need 9 more quests there, stat". 
---
And so someone said "okay, 3 kill quest lines, 3 stages each, kill 10 mobs each time, good enough"? 
---
And someone else said "well, it's not the defias messenger quest, but it's what we have time for right now".
---
I‚Äôve downloaded ‚ÄúMonkey Quest‚Äù and that seems to be bugged as well. 
---
First thing I try to do ‚ÄúRight click here to open MonkeyBuddy so you can configure MonkeyQuest‚Äù of course nothing happens when I right click so I don‚Äôt even know what I could configure in this addon. Doesn‚Äôt seem to be what I would like anyway with no map icons.
---
I'm pretty sure your cities aren't literally paved in it, but ok.
---
Cheers
---
Instructions clear, user inadequate.
---
What addon do you use from item sell price
---
Yeah haha sure. 
---
I dont. I never said it is and I haven't done that either. I think calling everything racist doesn't help either. But if you want to be honest with yourself, everyone is a 'racist' in some shape or form. I use racist loosely here since that's a label of a person in your context where I'm more concerned about specific cases then trying to understand the world through a binary of racists and non racists because people are far more complex than that and so is race. You're probably just more sensitive and anxious about racists because of the current cultural environment. Why live in fear or hate?

It really isn't

Thia formatting is prob going to be bad, but your ironman rules are weak.

OH MY GOD I POSTED TO THE WRONG SUBREDDIT I'M SORRY
---
A lot of the magic has been lost over the years and replaced with content that focuses on maximizing daily logins. It‚Äôs been a breath of fresh air, but also sad to see the overall fantasy experience has been lost in retail in favor of farming gear/rep/gold/etc. 
---
Turns out we wanted it after all blizzcon guy.
---
Don't fix what ain't broken (looking at you awesome game mechanics and difficulty)
---
They restored that bug?!
---
Hahaha awesome!
---
Did she bring hot pockets?
---
The image doesnt really suit the message.

Shoes
---
I've left guilds in the middle of raids when stuff like that happens.
---
You don't need nameplates for this. Go into options and there's a tab called names, might be in interface - you should turn names on for all players/npcs.
---
We had one computer for two people, she played bfa I played private servers. After some time where it felt like we were playing in shifts I decided to buy a second computer.
---
I got her hyped along with some friends of mine. She is a casual mount collector/achievement hunter on retail and I'm semi hardcore with a hardcore mentality.
---
I say "You can level up with my or your friends and we will meet at 60 so we can play together."
---
Since Monday she has logged three times, only once she actually leveled, she's 12 lvl, me and my friends are complaining cause she doesn't play and she complains cause she doesnt have anyone to play with anymore.
---
Classic is all about community and groups, but you do have to socialize and be willing to make those friends. I‚Äôve had no issues at all finding groups for dm by just posting in general, world, or trade chat.
---
This is beautiful. I will honestly pay for a print of this. Please let me know!
---
Work work!
---
Agreed but if you read through this post you can see some ppl who are clearly way more upset about it than they should allow themselves to be. Idk if that's why it was posted here. I know reddit is basically an SJW haven but I just like the memes for this game.
---
Absolutely! She asks questions about the material, and then has a visual representation of the goal / purpose of the text, and makes guesses about the conclusion.
---
I've seen other things, like people trying to incite other's to report players who have names they don't like, even when those players seem perfectly reasonable. Some people just like to ruin the fun for others.
---
How did you manage to get hand of ragnaros as a paladin.
---
Not fireball? That is my main casting spell when leveling, lvl 18 currently
---
I get what you're saying; I think it made more sense at the time for people coming in from Diablo 2 (a huge number of people, I presume), since Energy there also didn't improve the damage of your spells.
---
r/suddenlyporn
---
Yeah if they don‚Äôt meet your needs for grouping. Classic WoW is a grind. Just reading some of your other responses makes me think that this just isn‚Äôt for you.
---
My first blue was that excellent staff from Deadmines when I was level 19. Still using it at level 24.
---
We took a screenshot on nearly the same frame https://i.imgur.com/R50kQsT.png
---
Anecdotal math, and bad math at that. Just because more horde exist does not mean they will always group up and go target alliance groups with fewer members.  If anything Horde players want a challenge and want a more fair fight.    
---
Alliance players stay grouped and go out of their way to attack solo players but always run from an even encounter.  Also, your math is truly terrible.  A 10% balance difference does not come close to equaling even 70% chance. Try closer to a 55%-60% chance.
---
I have a hard time believing anyone developing WoW after WotLK actually gave a fuck about the game itself. All of the design choices indicate they were just turning it into a cash cow.
---
Different times, different mores. I doesn't have to go on like that.
---
He got escape artist for when the honeys tryna trap him with rings.
---
As a Warlock, same.
---
Do you think retail is going to be vindicated and Classic shown as a failure at this point? If nothing else we have demonstrated that a call back to an older blizzard design philosophy garners more interest than the latest expansion ever did.
---
Nameplates toggle is control  + V if I recall correctly.
---
Gotta be alliancd in Classic or you're doing it wrong. 
---
FOR THE ALLIANCE.
---
Yea I'm getting that impression as well. I wanted to keep trying to enjoy this game since I did pay for the sub. 
---
I'm hoping someone manages to convince me that it's worth playing but I'm not really sure that's possible.
---
Unfortunately all my quests don‚Äôt show up. I would say almost all of the quests are there, but I‚Äôm only lvl 33 and I‚Äôve ran by quite a few that either have no exclamation or question mark on the map. Also the icons showing where spawn locations are is often not accurate. 
---
I‚Äôve had quest chains that simply don‚Äôt update from the previous quest telling me that I still need to talk to the person that I just saw. 
---
What bugs me is I don‚Äôt hear many other people with this problem. So I‚Äôve began to wonder is it some version that I‚Äôm using, or is everyone using something very similar but just better.
---
No joke, I tried getting into PoE once a few years back, reached level 2, opened up the passive tree, and promptly quit the game.  
---
I came back to it when a few friends of mine promised to teach me how to make sense of the game and now I love it, but that first look at the passive tree is pretty damn shocking.
---
What is dead may never die.
---
&gt;  not damage like you'd expect (or like most other RPGs),
---
Having spell damage be dependent only on the spell itself was actually a pretty common trope for RPGs and derived games, like Diablo 2.
---
It's also the case with D&amp;D, and crpgs based on D&amp;D were still quite popular at the time.
---
But yeah, feels a bit weird nowadays, but it is still quite useful as it is.
---
Getting to 60 without dying just means you're going to have to play very safe and boring. Zzzz
---
It's like the "girls always play support" stereotype. It is a stereotype because women in general are more empathic and caring than men. It's just biology
---
Health lol
---
No need to be toxic in your answer
---
Just saying all these guides for optimizations are killing the sense of creativity in the character you're building
---
Playing in pvp realms resume to
---
Alliance : dwarves and gnomes
---
Horde : undeads and orcs

I almost forgot to post his weekly pic ~~in between Stockades runs~~ with my busy schedule...

Classic Dascold

Grats to him! Still impressive
---
Heh. Truth is, we don't really like grinding for the sake of it either; see Korean MMORPGs if you doubt that.
---
There need to be a balance between gratification and grinding, and quite frankly no game has ever approached that balanced as perfectly as WoW Classic.
---
Yes. I need this aswell. Having 6 sets of gear combos is hard to manage
---
Thanks I‚Äôll check that out
---
Bombs should be nice for aggro / a stun in a pinch, then there's various trinkets and a [shield](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18168). BS doesn't have any BoP goodies, so go mining / engi and find a BS to make the stuff you need with your mats.
---
I don't care about layering at all.

Now kiss.

This post chain highlights how cool this community is. I will be logging in for the first time tomorrow as I was away all week. 
---
Can't wait.
---
I got you tomorrow
---
Im just saying you cant put as many restrictions as you want. Just dont be surprised when things go sideways
---
Thanks a lot! I'm very happy to hear that üëç I've recently releases it on the Twitch app as well - whenever I make an update you'll have the chance to update the addon right away, with 1 click. You can also leave feedback and open issues on bugs.
---
I find that I really change then way I play my priest, even my hunter, any comments on that? Thanks üôÇ
---
Agreed about the second point. I dont view wow chat as anything close as serious to a work place or even a public place maybe that has to do with my perception of online chat  in a videogame  vs a real public space vs like twitter or whatever but I view wow chat as a blend of many things,  we're given online aliases, a pseudo anonymity, where there is serious conversation, banter, comedy, trolling, barter etc you get the picture. Maybe if this was in barrens chat people would be less offended. Idk.
---
I've noticed a couple situations like you're describing. Where an exclamation stayed on my map after I'd already taken the quest. I abandoned the quest and took it again and it solved that one. I noticed another at the same time on the same map but that's about it. There were other problems like not seeing exclamation markers, but some of those were solved by going into the settings and changing the level range for quests I see. I turned off the minimum completely.
---
I really doubt this is doable in classic xD
---
They weren't kidding about the tauren hitboxes xD 
---
Its literally the first bullet point on the list: "Tauren‚Äôs hitboxes and their melee reach is slightly larger than other races." lol
---
i installed azeroth autopilot when I tried classic.  It seemed to work pretty well for everything.  The issue is though that it really wants you to do it in a certain order, but it did show shit for every quest I had not just the one it was telling me to do first.  I
---
I've said it on the normal wow sub and got shit on for it, but the problem isn't even that BFA is an ARPG now, it's that it's not even a good one. Legion was also wildly different than classic, but aside from a few missteps Legion was still a good game.
---
Why you gotta be homophobic
---
Wha what? Do you have the video somewhere on an ofsite backup backup? I'd like to see it.
---
omg. if this works I fucking love you. I will remove the /startattack and that should stop it trying to meele if in rangeand the error message?
---
Had this happen with foror‚Äôs compendium of dragon slaying... me and warrior had been farming forever, finally drops, warrior needs, everyone passes, then thr rougue is like ‚Äútoo valuable not to need‚Äù and gets it. I am still upset to this day.
---
I waited with my vacation, it's starting today for the next 9 days. Cya at 60 guys.
---
I don‚Äôt play wow but is reaching level 60 a big deal?
---
Thank you Chris. Thank you community.
---
Gotta admit, this game has already been a major nostalgia trip.
---
Thought you only joined after BC? Yea really just seeming like it isn‚Äôt for you. Sorry man
---
I agree, I‚Äòm all for no changes but things like Paladins not having a taunt is just stupid
---
One of us? Sir, that's Metzen, we're one of him.
---
üò≠
---
I've seen things....in the vale.
---
Same boat, spent my off days playing the shit out of a paladin only to realize I kinda want to tank. Now I'm back at work and its gonna take a lot longer to get back to where my paladin was, atleast I have a few gold and bigger bags this time i guess though.
---
Then it wouldn't be vanilla.
---
People would fly off the rail if they changed class balance from what it was in vanilla.
---
nope, still using it in notepad
---
The world quest system in general is just trash
---
Not really. Holding on to inventory to maximize future profits rather than liquidate it now and reinvest that gold into other ventures is a poor plan. 
---
say you hold on to all the leather you skin to sell later at lets say 5 times what it costs now. Sure you are getting a larger return on your leather but you get your mount later which means you get leather slower. It means you likely level slower since you can't put that gold into gear upgrades (smart ones don't go buy every green you see) So you get to the higher level leathers slower.
---
we'll see won't we bud? gonna get stomped by a pserver guild
---
We took over their world... Canthey even afford to pay all those people?
---
But them accusing joker of acc sharing without proof is something different than people making a lil fun about a milliom dollar company? They will be fine i guess lel
---
Shadow priest in BG is pretty fun, really nasty sometimes. If you like healing then you're pretty much set with the druid and pally,
---
Blizzard's said they intend Classic to be a faithful recreation of 1.12 as much as practically possible, so I don't see them making any changes to classes.
---
They opened 4 more servers today. 2 EU and 2 NA
---
But on launch servers you got ganked in every single zone? Ganking zergs weren't uncommon at all. The plaguelands were a battlefield. But so were a lot of lower level zones.
---
Damn I run dungeons and get a stack of 20 like, man we‚Äôre in WC I need more than that.
---
Stop trying to justify your ninja rolling. If everyone rolls need you have less opportunity to identify the ninjas and call them out.
---
You are welcome
---
I never argued against your point.  Your point happens.  MY point is that Alliance refuse to fight if the odds are EVEN.  I don't mind dying, that is why I rolled on a pvp server, for pvp.  That means I get steam rolled by gank squads sometimes, comes with the territory.
---
My point is I would love some even pvp, more fun when skill decides IMO. But whenever a situation occurs where i face off in a 1v1 or a 2v2, the Alliance players turn tail and run away.
---
I mean we all strongly disagree with him on classic.  But tasteless hack really?..
---
He added so much to the gaming community.  Even WoW back in the day.  What have you added?
---
Is it called medical just for the show?  
---
Because it definitely feels like it, when every mention it it is people anticipating how they will get high and not medicated\relieved of their illness symptoms.

My mom used to bring me meatloaf when playing wow. Yesterday I took a day off and played wow the whole day and my wife made me meatloaf!

You think you do.
---
Don't blame the guy using a bot for using a bot? why would we not blame the man for violating the ToS of the game?
---
I think everyone needing is just the most fair, and *most importantly* removes any opportunity for anyone to ninja.
---
People argue that your reputation will be ruined if you ninja anyway, but to get a bad reputation you need to be fucking notorious. You aren't blacklisted from every group in the game just because you took a boe.
---
Even worse than this whole discussion are groups that are determined that "everyone greed" on boes. It's just setting yourself up for problems.
---
If you actually want to use the boe, just buy it like everyone else. If you get it as a drop, you pay that price anyway when you equip it (opportunity cost).
---
I get that it can be hard to even find these things now, but you will level fine without it, and before long all this stuff will be available for gold anyway.
---
People liked being overpowered. There's a reason you are gonna see mostly mages/rogues PvP at the start.
---
I swear in half a year everyone will have mage/rogue as an alt just to have advantages in PvP.

If there is enough interest I'll be making an Ironman guild on an OCE PvE server. It'll have to be an honor system as there is no way to check if people have died in Classic without an armoury or /deaths command.

warrior vs +1 lvl npc. hope you have cooldowns!

The problem is that skill floor in Classic was much higher than it is in modern. The skill ceiling in modern WoW is leagues beyond where it was in Classic. The thing is not everyone is trying to test themselves against the top 1% of player, but there being a challenge in what you are doing is necessary to feeling invested in doing it. In modern WoW, the challenge is reserved exclusively for the best players (mythic raiding and high level keys). 
---
Otherwise, the content is literally group it all up AOE it down check for a titan forge with sockets move on. This means that unless you are pushing the top 1% of players there is no difficulty to your experience and hence no meaning in accomplishing it. LFR and even normal raids are just free loot that feel as worthless as the encounters that lead to acquiring them. 
---
In Classic, getting through many quests without dying is a feat in itself, and, as such, even minor side quests or small loot drops have meaning. Things are tuned to be achievable but challenging for most people and that feels good. This point can not be stressed enough. Grinding time gates dailies and world quests for random epics feels bad. Clawing your way through quests tuned to be challenging to get a grey shoulder after dying over and over feels good. 
---
I doubt retail learns a lesson from this, but lets hope they have the sense to let classic be its own thing. Even BC with its flying mounts pushes in the direction of lowering the skill floor while raising the ceiling creating an ever bigger gap between the top tier players and the general players experience of the game. Please try and understand what it is the Classic finds find fault in retail for. It is not the top tier content played by the most skilled. It is the questing, heroics, and overall simplification at the skill floor.
---
Wow yeah that sucks.  Those people are also losing money by using the auction house because of the 5% cut.
---
He was both the first, and the fastest.  No one has ever had a faster 0-60 time on an official server, in a pre-TBC patch.
---
No. You all knew who would be under powered and who fit niches ect. That said only a few specs of the hybrids were truly underpowered. Everyone had a role.
---
I'm having problems with mine too. I run into random NPCs with quests that aren't shown on the map and I don't want to miss anything. Let me know if QuestCodex works out better for you.
---
Your face would also melt between those jugs.
---
It is balanced. Sure your toon cant do everything at once. Your shaman is a shitty tank compared to warrior but warrior is a shitty healer compared to shaman.
---
I love how I get downvoted for this ... people from retail are kinda salty these days
---
&gt;. I never have a core group of gaming friends because I get super adhd and don‚Äôt like sticking to a playing schedule,

it's a custom addon we made last week and are still working on, not sure what Recount you're referring to though

They aren't going to change things. The whole point of this is to give us an authentic vanilla experience. The bad class balance is part of that, whether you like it or not.

Torn between Shaman and Warrior. 
---
I feel like leveling as a warrior sucks solo as I‚Äôve been getting wrecked a ton and im only lvl 17. I feel like that will eventually pay off though. 
---
I wanted to roll a shaman cuz I love the spells and especially Windfury, but someone told me its been nerfed heavily and not as great as 1.11 or the patches previous to 1.12. 
---
I‚Äôll mainly be pvping, but yeah just curious.
---
Brazil is a drastically different country to the rest of  south america. Like in North America there is Mexico, Canada, America and none of these countries are even remotely similar
---
I don‚Äôt think free server transfers are necessarily. #1. It‚Äôs blizzard, they want their money. #2. Paid transfers were in classic. They shouldn‚Äôt add em too soon, but as more phases progress they definitely should make a power move and introduce the ability to transfer

What video? Got a link?

We can't really compare the current version to anything we had before, there are changes but you are right.

Still I'm sure that the time will get beaten, maybe by Jokerd himself even.

Pretty decent actually. Thought he had less sleep.
---
31h ON - 4.5h OFF - repeat
---
Average ofc. I guess first "day" he went 40+ hours until sleep.
---
So if i'm understanding correctly, if you have multiple paladins, one of which is tanking it doesn't matter who is using retribution aura as long as one of them is?
---
Sure thank you!

---
someone like him could only do it. only a streamer can really do it; because you need a vast number of random people on different layers to invite you into their group. and that would be impossible as a non streamer because people that are within a guild share the same layer. 
---
so no, not *anybody* can do it
---
How much would you pay?
---
They can create those dynamically. The reason they are hesitant (they already did increase the cap) is because it makes it harder to remove layering later before phase 2.

I would say druid is actually great for PvP. But its not easy, a big part is switching to normal form and throwing some heals around then switching back. It's difficult, but honestly druids are good in PvP. They can also tank and heal for leveling. No one really wants them for end game raiding. But before that, they can be really useful.
---
A couple have mentioned and it's something I did in days of yore; head to the other starting areas and get some easy questing done to get a few levels in n hand, then go back. Durotar an Mulgore have small quest hubs to do and will be a nice change of scenery.

It‚Äôs why I Main Druid.

---
This is an assumption, not entirely baseless.  But I absolutely can see a world where there were people who wanted to make sure Classic actually survived before they bothered with it, which could absolutely bring a continuous influx of players over time.  The truth is no on knows what the future holds for Classic.
---
oh hahahah wow.  
---
the sound of the "WHHHHOOOOOSSSSHHHHHHH"   that went over my head for that nearly broke every single speed and sound record in the world.
---
(in my defense, when i wrote that i was incredibly tired, like beyond needing sleep lol)
---
Everyone seems to be confusing my main point.  Ghank squads happen.  That is not what I have an issue with. YOu find yourself in a ghank squad or being attacked by a ghank squad, well, thems the chips.
---
My point is that I never see Alliance fight when the odds are EVEN. They always run away when they encounter a match of 1v1/2v2/3v3/etc.
---
I literally do not care about the unfair matchups, those happen and it is part of the journey.  I just want the next time I see an alliance, 1v1, we both full hp and within a level of eachother, that they would face off instead of running off.  That is why they are cowards, they are scared of a fair fight when it occurs naturally.
---
heheh yes, is too bright. I love tirisfal and silverpine forest :3
---
It continues to amaze me multi million dollar companies can't keep records of original sources of games yet can sell a server blade from an orginal server for $$$.

I'm giving them away to random people I inspect who could use an upgrade.

It's insane. They just want to grief. I can't group with people, whisper, invite togroups, join groups. I'm effectively ignored

Except, he's a warrior
---
Tonight I'm finally going back home and I'm gonna be able to play classic for the first time since it has launched. Wish me luck guys, future lock/warrior here.
---
It‚Äôs been 4 days.  Classic hasn‚Äôt proven anything yet other than every other expansion cycle where people play it a lot.
---
and it only costs 40 gold!
---
Anybody can do it, even without layering.
---
With layering you can ask your guildmates to invite you to another layers. You don't need 300k people for that. I'd say at most you need like 5 if the areas aren't crowded by another players at that point.
---
what server?

I plan to roll on Mograine when I start playing tonight.

People were doing this during BETA. Look up "the oogagang"
---
100 people LMAO i saw about that many doing it in the croassroads inn on my server alone
---
I prefer the balance through imbalance model. Otherwise you just end up with the homogenized mess that Retail currently is where one ability can make or break you.
---
I'm pretty sure the accent thing is intentional. I still don't like it either but not a deal breaker.
---
All names even slightly offensive normally get reported. I couldn't even have frostitute.
---
-4 training points. Nice.
---
This is probably the #1 thing that separates Classic from Retail... so accurate and true!
---
The game is an adventure again, rather than a spreadsheet simulator
---
Makes no sense. The last minute gank and jokerd was level 40? He was one mob from lvl 60 dude...
---
Hahaha believe me the beta started mad broken. Like hunters without working autoshot broken
---
I mean if they are stupid enough to risk a ban for afk 20mins when you already have a server reservation for 60 mins they deserv the ban
---

---
I REALLY want to experience classic (I‚Äôm a human mage on it), but with the constant queuing... I think I‚Äôll wait a couple weeks and see.
---
For sure, if he started a new toon right now and did it again he would almost certainly beat it, the first several hours of launch were absolutely brutal, that cost him a ton of time for sure.  
---
Chances are good he will beat it, I wouldn't count on anyone else doing it though.  This is his third first 60 in 3 major launches (two were private servers), and all three of them were records for the fastest ever at the time.  No one else can do it quite like him.  Especially without rested XP.  There might be someone who beats him in /played time, while taking a few weeks real time.  But I doubt anyone else beats him in /played while doing it in under four days real time.
---
He was one mob from 60. Or do you mean the horde people?
---
You really have to
---
I agree but some people are overreacting. I think people who think you have to hate nazi ideology with a burning passion are secret racists trying to cope with their inner biases and racism by being as loud as possible about how much they dismiss a notoriously race supremacist ideology and hate it and usually anyone who doesn't think and feel exactly like them. Looking at the trend of upvotes and downvotes this thread (and reddit in general) obviously has an online SJW cultural trend and find my theory to be true. I dont think this classic wow reddit needs to highlight every political thing someone says or does that is questionable as a joke or serious. I think we can leave politics out of a gaming forum. Give it to the GMs and move on would be better. No need to stoke the fires of these people who want to assume the worst of the world.
---
If population reaches unsustainable levels for a community, servers will be merged.  The nature of the world in classic is not retail where every zone is essentially an instance where players are dynamically loaded in, versus the more static nature of classic.  Humans feels like NPCs in retail, there is content that will require cooperation in classic no matter if its an alt.
---
I love the yells in that screen shot. Is this on a rp server or were these dudes just hyped seeing a dragon?
---
Perfect. THis game is the essence of education. Growing your mind, to the point it is energized to activity. THis is an extremely important self actualization tool! Thank you so much for sharing this!!
---
no shit?
---
Not from a tailor
---
No competition so meh.
---
On retail, leveling has been simplified to encourage altoholicism. I‚Äôve fallen to that bug so many times. Yes the class design has improved a lot over the years (peaking in Mists imo), but you don‚Äôt feel as connected with your main character as you did before.
---
Yes I am a Mage first in bfa. I love my mage and I will always main it in retail. But I am also a Paladin, Warrior, Hunter, Death Knight, and Warlock. At some points I forget that I am a mage first and I feel it makes me lose some identity in the game.
---
I dont get what you are saying. But you just get buffs as high as people have skilled not depending on my lvl
---
My question was whether holy or retribution is better for leveling duo with a druid which will be either feral or balance.
---
Blizzard has the tools now to just let multiple people have the same name anyways. And yeah, people are little bitches and so is Blizzard, for not doing mergers for that reason. What a dumb reason to fuck the game up so badly. This is why we have such big queues right now, people refuse to switch to a lower pop server because most people have experienced just how god awful a dead server is to play on.
---
God damnit. I've been clean for years. I can't resub, but seeing (amazing) shit like this is really testing me lol.

I got temp banned for afking alterac valley back in the day. I where playibg ps3 and just sat next to my keyboard and kept myself not going afk.

It was the last 2 levels he switched layers to AoE

I have just hit 10g for the first time and I just hit level 30. I'm scared to talk to my trainer.

I think one buff I could live with is to ret/prot pally specs. I know that won‚Äôt happen tho so keep it ‚Äònilla.
---
That‚Äôs one long boi

That is also very true. Going only for the faster /played time is far more easier since you don't have to race the real life clock.
---
I mean if a level 60 mage AI's a level 10 with his max rank AI i thought it would error "Target is too low level" and youd have to manually choose the rank he can have.

Load the bowl and kill it before landing game. 4/20
---
Im dreading the day i have to change specs, because thst cost goes up real fast. I will eventually, but the idea of changing it because a dungeon group is just odd, unless you really like this guys and decided to go tank or healing for them. A few misplaced spec points dont mean much. In the early levels, people should expect everyone to spec into survivability more. At level 19 that's even more crazy, you have 9 talent points, it wont effect things all that much. Hell, from what i remember from privite servers, arms warriors tanked just fine. Not the best, but they have all the tools, and its crazy to expect someone to be leveling as prot.

Yeah they made my friend change adolfcritler

So when you zoom out with Questie, it shows all your available quests (pick up, turn in, and spawns) Codex does not do this until you focus in on an area, and then gives you what looks like a much better tracker. 
---
In your quest log, questie does nothing. But Codex adds a Show, Hide, Reset option for each quest. With all the info it shows on the mini map, it‚Äôs great to see an option to hide some of those.
---
It really does look like a superior option, however I will give questie credit on its simplicity and how well it looks and feels like it‚Äôs a part of the game.
---
no you can't. by design if someone is also in a guild with you they'll spawn in other layers. so without a coordinated effort with non guild alts pming the toon it's not possible within a guild. that is exploiting; you're not taking advantage of a game mechanic (like playing in the auction house or even grinding dungeons), you're taking advantage of a realm or  server mechanic.
---
When BGs release in 6 months. 
---
If BGs release and are unplayable for the majority of players because queues are either insane, or only populated by overgeared private server premade freak teams. Classic is in trouble.
---
When you have too many players on one realm, it can be taxing for the server to handle so many users at one time. So blizzard made layers to separate the users and to put less load on the servers. The pro is that now more people can play on a server at the same time, but the con is that sometimes you won‚Äôt be able to interact with others if they exist on a different layer, like the OP in this post.
---
All countries are different. But we have a lot in common, specially near the borders. I'm from Argentina and I feel like I have a lot in common with Brazilians, and like 200x more to other countries like US or in Europe

Question from a WoW noob:

I know there's raids and PvP in the end game for the current WoW. Does classic WoW have that as well?

Yes, I don't see a problem there. You might be right with the guild mechanic but he did get help from he's retail guildmates.

Point being you only need handful of people. You don't need to be a streamer.

a head full of extremely lucky people that all spawn in different layers? when each layer is thousands of people?

I read an article the other day saying that Classic was basically Blizzard admitting that retail sucked, and that they were going to permanently fracture the community.
---
The article itself was asinine, clearly written by someone who wants Classic to fail because they don't personally like it. But I have to imagine that was the attitude with at least some devs at Blizzard. "If people like a 15 year old game more than they like the current game then wtf have we been doing this whole time?"
---
What indeed, Blizz. What indeed. Or, you know, different people like different things. And if you offer both, you'll have twice as many subscribers.
---
Maybe I‚Äôm wrong, but back in the day, the speed levelers did this with a support group to push the exp gain.
---
"The finest bags from **Westeros**!"
---
Battlegrounds are not in until a later phase I think, so right now it's just world pvp in contested zones.

You'd be surprised what happens. Let them make mistakes and then show them out to avoid those mistakes. Soon they will be reminding you of your own lessons.
---
That's why night elf is the objectively superior warrior race.
---
This. OP should know this when decided to create that name
---
I'd still play it. Fun class design, great lore, amazing PvP, raids, Northrend and so on. Sure, Wrath was the first expansion that started to be little bit more casual friendly, but I think to this day Wrath had the perfect balance between casual and hardcore playstyle. 
---
And to be fair LFG isn't the end of the world for me, as someone who's been playing retail since TBC until Classic came out I can tell you I hate LFR more than anything.

Fuck off helmie

I'd rather the quality of life for some things though...there's definitely a balance.
---
BFA is too far one way, but Classic is definitely too far the other.
---
that's being serious about the meta and the real world, but not wow.
---
like I've seen some streamers mention they likely have non streaming alts for personal use; and at least that makes sense.
---
Lakeshire necklace quest was a magical time
---
I can safely say from watching him that he actually had no idea how layering worked until he was told at lvl 58 - he never used it while aoe grinding pirates for 10 lvls in Tanaris or skeletons in WPL before going to Hearthglen where he finished. 
---
No matter which category you put it in, the layering he used saved him 1-3 hours at best. So it most likely can be beaten by someone who gets a better start.
---
Need a hug my dude?   
---
You seem rather stressed, why not log out for a moment and experience life? maybe you'll find a new hobby? or maybe better find a girlfriend?  
---
My point being, stop waste your precious time QQ-ing about streamers and take control over your own life!  
---
\#justrelaxmydudeskiandeverythingwillbeokay
---
How so?
---
This is what always bothered me. That leveling was an obstacle in the way of the experience rather than part of the experience. Maybe it was just the people I played with, but why is the growth of your character in this vast world made to be boring?
---
I've had great experiences on Grobulus so far.
---
This is cute.
---
The last 2 levels of AoE grinding, he switched to.
---
What server is this?
---
Silly question... What's phase 2?
---
That‚Äôs true it does but it isn‚Äôt efficient. You spend more time drinking than leveling is how people see it, BUT you do you. It‚Äôs your character. You do what you enjoy. Fireball it all to the ground.
---
Nope. They grow from the corpses of my humanoid enemies that drop cloth.
---
alt-tabb and then forget i was playing and then realize it's been 30 minutes and my character is logged out the instance group i was in to heal is probably super pissed at me
---
Ret paladins held back by mana as well.
---
1k at 60 is basically impossible (yes yes I'm sure some people can do it). Most people at vanilla would farm for epic mount for a long time.
---
 It started with free2play games who had to earn in some way. Few years down the road shit hits the fan and every payed game has some kind of money drain
---
You‚Äôre doing nothing wrong, you‚Äôre just exceptionally low level for Ashenvale and rogues don‚Äôt really come online for PvP until you‚Äôre able to spec deep in to sub, or take PvP talents such as imp. Sprint etc. A good mage will always trash you, anyway. 
---
Most leveling guides/routes will have you in Ashenvale proper about 25-30.
---
i have the same issue with healbot and pws/renew it was working (showing the active buff) then i went to the priest trainer and learnt the next rank and it stopped working. I have been unsuccessful at trying to get it to show again (tried relogging, re-assigning spells in healbot, etc).... I also had an issue with the 'time remaining' text now showing, then it worked, then it didn't.. seems like something weird is going on
---
I'd love that too, they already do it with numbers and ilvl some expansions (I'm not sure if they did it in all of them) and honestly seeing hits like "2345" or "1531" is way better for the eyes than seeing "125253" or "75249". You still get used to it but I don't know, I prefer lower numbers. 
---
Same with expansions. Will we be level 170 in some years? What if they decide to start adding more than 10 levels? Will we be level 235 someday? I wouldn't like to see that either, I prefer easy to read and understand levels.
---
This is just personal preference tho and I actually don't really mind if it's like that, but I'd prefer numbers to be lower.
---
*deep breath* 
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Arugal.
---
Go figure :)
---
Not being able to mount til half way through level cap doesn't just slow you getting to the level cap. It slows you during levelling. Even if someone is the kind of person that wants to enjoy leveling and doesn't want to rush to cap, that doesn't mean they like running everywhere instead of being able to use the mount they paid for or grinded for.
---
The order that blizz is releasing certain content that came out in Vanilla over its patch cycle, 
---
Phase 1 (Classic Launch):¬†Molten Core, Onyxia, Maraudon
---
Phase 2:¬†Dire Maul, Azuregos, Kazzak
---
Phase 3:¬†Blackwing Lair, Darkmoon Faire, Darkmoon deck drops begin
---
Phase 4:¬†Zul'Gurub, Green Dragons
---
Phase 5:¬†Ahn‚ÄôQiraj War Effort begins, Ahn‚ÄôQiraj raids open when the war effort dictates, Dungeon loot reconfiguration (Tier 0.5 Dungeon gear, Relics, drop rates and location changes)
---
Phase 6:¬†Naxxramas, Scourge Invasion
---
Careful, it‚Äôs a west coast (US) server, so unless that‚Äôs where you are from, your ping will be pretty high. I rolled a character there last night so I could try alliance out (horde main), and I am on east coast, and was consistently between 80-100ms which at certain point was unplayable because pressing the fireball skill and not seeing it actually start casting until 2 seconds later every single time got frustrating!
---
Aw you prefer your entertainment-penis attached to a muscle-y man. Much less gay.
---
Bought a stack of crystal vials instead of empty vials right before I hit 20 ama
---
Lilslut is a female gnome warrior on Stallag.  I appreciate it.
---
Gathermate won‚Äòt work for me, probably because of other addons. 
---
Used gatherlite for a day but had problems with the map display, again probably because of other addons. 
---
I now try to get the classic version of gatherer to work ( not on twitch but downloadable ), but so far no real progress.
---
I need to level my enchanting somehow.
---
Relatable
---
*Cries in druid*.
---
I can't not buy the spells. I need them all.
---
I mean if it's a community of grown up gamers, it's probably gonna lost.
---
And then he was on another layer
---
Not vanilla, but wrath. I realized that uncovering the map gave a decent chunk of exp and also having your map filled-in is nice, so I ran around trying to level up through exploration. Took a nice looking boat out of Stormwind, let's go explore some new areas! Wow that rhino's level is a skull, I bet it would be really strong to tame it. 
---

What are those peaks?
---
I‚Äôm already 40 and so are my bros, we Griggas in the trees mfker.
---
I can hear this picture
---
I think the community is fostered because every little bit counts. If someone buffs you, it‚Äôs actually helpful and it matters. It‚Äôs so easy to die, being healed actually feels significant. I‚Äôve already been saved countless times by random people who just happened to notice the three murlocs chasing me. I‚Äôm leveling slow as hell and having a ton of fun with it!
---
Need more wine.
---
That was for PvE content, as in raids and dungeons, as for PvP
---
Phase 1 (Classic Launch):¬†You can PvP one another in the world, but there is no tracking, and no formal rewards for doing so.
---
Phase 2:¬†Honor System (including Dishonorable Kills), PvP Rank Rewards
---
Phase 3:¬†Alterac Valley (version 1.12), Warsong Gulch
---
Phase 4:¬†Arathi Basin
---
Phase 6:¬†World PvP objectives in Silithus and Eastern Plaguelands
---
Oh wow, he's predicted it a million times on this subreddit! It must be true
---
It feels like you just doubled my DPS, I must have been cancelling so many auto shots, after moving, jumping, etc haha. thanks again a million &lt;3
---
I am not talking about cooperation, I am talking about the positive attitude. This wont last much past the honeymoon phase.
---
Actually been doing the same. It worked out for me as one guy ran away, said thanks, realized he had something I could use, and came back to give it to me. Awesome interaction.
---
My wizard cleave team is getting 40-50kph
---
Pretty sure sor procs effects.
---
Thankfully not, I'll edit in a little album of some before/after he arrived when it's uploaded.
---
Yes, exactly! In retail I found that every week was about getting gear that might make me better than everyone else. I felt elititist over people with lesser ilvl/io because they couldnt help me accomplish my own goals. But to what end? I didnt want to do mythic raiding...so eventually I thought why even try? Then I realized it was the friendly adventure I was lookjng for. You cant get that in retail...Its a competition. But in classic we are all in the shit together and its so much fun.
---
Well, all the people I fought were about my level (20-22) anyway, they weren't higher. But thank you for the advice. It sucks that I can't pvp yet, I was looking forward to that :/
---
Oce full one arugal? (sorry can‚Äôt remember the name properly)
---
Gold medal for the 100m sprint goes to Colinthetank of Kalimdor!! He is the first Tauren to receive a gold medal in such a race mostly conquered by the night elves the last 15 years, a truly historic day this is folks
---
Rrrriiiiigggghhhhtttttt
---
Classic is not demanding hardware wise, if you can pay the sub, you can enjoy classic
---
I support this thought process. Those playing classic right now seem to be questing for a good experience, not just good gear. The best of times I had in wow were when I enjoyed my company, not when my pants dropped. 
---
...that came out right.
---
My OCD compels me to get them all, also pokemon, can't help it sorry
---
*Who?*
---
Dont sweat reddit, people see a single downvote and just jump on board
---
Give it about a month from release and AH will start to stabilize
---
Part of the benefit is that people bring mats to you, making it easier to level the profession. Plus sometimes you make some tip money.
---
What realm? I got a secret for you.
---
i don't want to admit it, but it gave me chills xD
---
This is what I wonder! Were there lines like this on all layers, or did people somehow coordinate so they would be on the same layer as him?
---
In a time where "fast travel" meant teleporting from A to B it was pretty new in games that you could actually watch the "bird" ACTUALLY take you there. Instead of an immersion breaking loading screen you stay in the game.
---
Haha for sure. Horde all the way, but the alliance did get one thing right: dwarves
---
Not the guy you were talking to, and I'm not saying you have to follow this, but if you want to min/max your leveling experience, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wi-7oKvOM4c) might be of interest to you.  It goes over optimal specs, rotations, wand progression, etc.
---
Have you considered staying on more inclusive retail WoW?
---
Wait till we hit stranglethron en masse
---
Hunter or Mage probably
---
It's not a difference of opinion, it's a fact. 
---
Nobody broke the rules, FACT.
---
Moon = Sheep 
---
Let it be written

I was there I've got a video of us all charging. Managed to get to the right layer eventually!

---
Do people actually enjoy doing quests? I always thought they were just this painful thing you had to do if you wanted raid content.
---
The writing in them isn't great, they don't tend to have a long term story either.
---
The actual question mechanics almost always boil down to "Kill X of Y".
---
The running to and from the quest NPC and the quest area is generally done while not paying attention.
---
What about questing do you actually like?
---
A lot of the alchemy training is specific to only one capital. Darnassus for alliance, I think it's undercity for horde. Not sure, but I suspect that may include the healing potion.
---
Some guy who was the first to hit 60 on classic  is my guess
---
Download festival tee
---
Only thing I don't like is people who are still in retail mentality when they jump over to Classic.
---
lol seriously I laughed way too hard at both
---
Happy Cake Day :)
---
Except back then you couldn't see the ground from up there
---
Sometimes there is a version for classic under "files" so check that and don't got the download button mindlessly
---
I think its time to rewatch this episode of south park üòÅ
---
I've seen a lot of players calling BfA BoA for some reason. This guy had a hardcore gamimg pc 5 years ago, so not a baby bloomer for gaming lol
---
Alliance side we just do ‚ÄúDM or VC‚Äù over and over.
---
You could use
---
/cast !Auto Shot
---
Much simpler. Sorry if anybody already posted this.
---
All I need is to be able to ACTUALLY LOG IN
---
Not an endgamer he‚Äôs simply a speed runner
---
Been saved a good few times by fandoms simply dropping a head on me, them basic buffs are helpful as well.  Had a guy give me a sword worth 2g on the market place after we were just killing some mobs (he was waiting for a friend to come back, I was simply grinding listening to music). Missed this type of interaction.
---
This could make the best post in r/roastme of all time.
---
TBC had plenty of world pvp. Questers without mounts, daily quest zones, farming areas, instance entrances. Same as classic, people just like to jerk off about how flying mounts ruined everything but it's not the case. I've been on retail TBC and private servers and there's plenty of pvp to be had. Now, WOTLK and the port-to-the-instance groupfinder, different thing.
---
you do know what an anti-hero is, right? An anti-hero is a good guy who fights for the right thing, but uses the same tricks as the villain. It's a hero who fights dirty.
---
Just hit 20 gold on my warlock, I can sleep soundly knowing that mount is as good as mine.
---
So maybe it's simple common knowledge and I just lucked out... Nobody ever seems to check the cost of vendoring items that are sought after on the AH. Greater Magic Wand = Greater Magic Essence + Simple Wood (38c). Vendors for 15.35 Silver. Based on people undercutting on AH I was able to make like 80 wands yesterday and actually make about 1 gold. Check AH for Greater / Lesser Magic Essences.
---
Or make a Frost mage eat their own spells, especially handy as a warrior
---
&gt;a bunch of garbage
---
Just stop talking. You're just here to bitch and whine about imaginary problems.
---
same thing, but mage
---
Two things though:
---
I‚Äôd consider streaming a real job. My buddy does it and makes 3x more than me and I‚Äôm in tech sales 
---
Second, I have 18 hours played an I‚Äôm level 18... I‚Äôll log another 20 days+ of game time before I‚Äôm 60. I have no idea how long it‚Äôll take
---
Ahhh, I thought maybe BoA was an mmo I wasn't aware of, I'm not so hip to gaming either. The only mmorpg I've played is WoW.
---
Priest is a godly duo with warlock.
---
If there is 3 of you, I would recommend warrior/paladin/Druid so you guys can form groups at a whim with only needing 2 DPS. If no one wants to play a tank capable roll, mage would be an awesome set up with those, so much utility in a group having soulstone, res, heals, rot/dot, slows, CC, sheep, fear, ports, free water/food. Rogue would also pair well with lock/priest as a peeler, CC, and burst.
---
Hunter/mage. Other classes like rogue/warlock/druid/priest come on pretty good by 40-45.
---
Ah yes that's the spirit, if I don't like constant sexist jokes I should fuck off elsewhere. I haven't played retail since the start of Legion so I'll pass on that and keep making classic a nicer, more inclusive place. Thanks for the suggestion though!
---
He guy with the omen. What spec is it? How does it handle wow? I‚Äôve been looking at getting one...
---
It's crazy how this game makes you 14 years old again. Laughed my ass off to the sound and also the rough name of the guild.
---
Try Mage. It is real fun to play. The greatest DPS in classic as for me.
---
hehe, guilty
---
They said no DX12 in an interview
---
One of my favorite spots in the game
---
The problem is new games vs. established games where the vast majority of players is already at max level and playing for endgame while you are stuck somehow scraping horrible EXP parties together to be able to play with your friends.

---
Keep doing it, coz I keep forgetting how short breath is in classic so i have to rush back when I hear my character yelling  
---
Moveanything is not out yet, so I cant move and increase the damn bar's size
---
I was thinking that last one as the best option, but it does run that risk of spreading the playerbase too thin. Alternatively, they could figure out some tech to basically have an NPC where you sign up for "stop leveling/content at current expansion" but still put the expansions on the classic server. So people that wanted to go to BC could, others would stay in vanilla.
---
Unless he has actual brain damage he's already set for life easily at this point.
---
You need to feed him and make your pet happy.
---
am glad. gnome ded.
---
Level 20 spells are 54s a piece with the faction discount
---
Look where we're heading because of the new mentality. I'm not saying ignore everything or turn a blind eye. Like I said report it. Learn to discern what's worth your time and energy. When an insult deserves your words back. Balance between saying too much (right now) vs doing and saying nothing at all. And if you really want a wow board to be politicized go create one for people who are coming there to discuss current political issues within the landscape of wow classic
---
I thought attack speed only matters for PvP due to spell pushback?  Is there a reason for a fast pet in dungeons/raids?
---
I don‚Äôt get it. Who is that?
---
As someone that's new to playing paladin in classic and wants to tank I appreciate the advice, if you have any other tips to share please let me know.

It is the future, you are "playing" om a Mac?

Oh awesome, thank you!
---
Battle of Azeroth
---
because the plans are shite
---
Very nice!
---
Spend some time to figure out what you don't like about the hunter.  You don't want to reroll and then realise that the new class has the same problem.
---
because there wasn't a rule to break. because a user can manipulate which layer they are on intentionally in order to have an advantage over other players who don't got through the coordinated effort required to also do so.
---
and specifically people that are able to communicate their location over multiple layers to thousands of non guild random people have an advantage. because that's exactly what you need in order to switch layers advantageously.
---
Album was a total rehash of old ideas, with small good parts, was total meh imo,  Wow classic is awesome though.
---
So you're confirming that if someone doesn't value things that you value, they are stupid?
---
Got my verigan's last night at level 22. Had great fun doing it, I feel like a god, and love this thing more than any epic I've gotten in retail!
---
I did WC yesterday. We had a mage who suggested we roll for the chest behind one of the druids of the fang. Sure we thought. Kill the npc, mage immidiately runs up to chest and grabs it. We question him about it and he proceeds to be a general jerk the rest of the dungeon until he finally leaves and we finish it as 4. 
---
I mean... Yeah it feels like classic. But I'm a little jealous of the wholesome moments you all are experiencing.
---
Worth it for sure. We did 2 arms, 2 cath, did not hit instance cap even once.
---
Heh. Such a funny 2004 way of thinking. And everyone disagreeing with you must be a 2019 snowflake. Just that you don't even understand why you are wrong.
---
You remember me? Wow, humbled
---
I would assume they are all on the same lan that is connected to the wan
---
People like you keep the game interesting,  just wish I could've been there to see it.
---
It was a lot back the yes, but I image the economy will be very different this time, since so many people know all the gold faring ways now.
---
That happened at lest with Shadow of the Colossus remake, where they went and created the secret that didn't exist before but everyone was trying to solve for years.
---
It's interesting that you can Run around questing for hours gaining 1-2 levels feeling good about the progression and of you Look at your greens and blues nothing change. And apperently you get an upgrade with only 1int or spirit more and still feel epic about it, that's the classic wow feeling.
---
You did.  That's the magic that WoW has been missing.  So excited everyone is getting to experience it now.
---
Can't argue with that weapon speed tho
---
7 people on my personal blacklist so far, smaller realm so mich more likely you see the same people farming dungeons. Already had 1 guy kicked, because he was on my list.
---
The best part is bandaging them with linen bandage for like 20HP so that they can‚Äôt bandage again properly for 1 minute.
---
i know, it is always happy
---
It‚Äôs fantastic. The world feels massive again without flying mounts and teleports everywhere. People are helpful to each other and courteous. It‚Äôs crazy.
---
if it was classic people would have gotten gametime for shitty servers. also the hole bot/anti afk is blizzards fault for sure. shitty game company when it comes to launchs
---
Well the other big change is that modern WoW if two ungrouped people attack the same target they both get the loot.  That and almost all quests are possible to solo.  In classic there were many quests that were impossible to solo, and first to hit a mob gets the loot, encouraging grouping.
---
Agreed , the record was made in classic wow, so it shouldn‚Äôt even be compared to a completely separate record today.
---
Just download guidelime on twitch and then download tugs leveling guide for it. It will literally hold your hand step for step 1-60 with extreme efficiency all the way down to when to stop and train your skills, when and where to set your hearth and juggles quests between zones. It has an arrow with distance marker that will even point you in the direction of your next objective.
---
Damn wow I can't wait
---
My client has currently a happiness indicator bug. It always shows green. 
---
I don‚Äôt know if addons are causing this ...
---
But it happened twice before that my pet just ran away.

I even buff hunter companions

---
you need to feed him, and go grind. Get him to loyalty 2-3 than your fine.
---
Google Jame‚Äôs guides, there are both horde and alliance versions.
---
Hold assets, wait for inflation, sell assets, realize working class has no money to buy assets anymore, economy collapses, eat the rich
---
Idk man I played Alliance my whole life and have had Horde do the same things. It's not faction specific.
---
Ain‚Äôt nobody got the mana for flash heal at lvl 20 anyway lol
---
I was so sad when cata came out. auberdine was one of my favorite places to level. Glad it's back to normal.
---
Youre not, but if playing retail wow all day is your job why would you play an older version in the few hours you have left?
---
Don't warlocks get a free mount?
---
Well now I know my next alts name.
---
And before people mention having 3 cloth wearers in a group and having to share loot...
---
Don‚Äôt think of gear upgrades as a solo effort. Every gear upgrade benefits the entire group. If one person only gets the staff with additional spirit/int - it isn‚Äôt going to make or break their individual play or contribution, they are just slow and incremental benefits to the entirety of the group.
---
Besides, if you‚Äôre not the tank controlling the group dynamics, people just take whatever class they can get for DPS/healer.
---
Also, a lot of high quality gear upgrades while leveling come from dungeon quests anyway (I‚Äôm looking at you Crescent Staff and Gravestone Scepter).
---
To me it means not having pets, and its great. Its Warcraft, not Pok√©mon.
---
So you want BfA???
---
Serious? 
---
It‚Äôs Snoop dog. 
---
He is very high.
---
Thanks for making me feel better about choosing a PvE realm this time around.
---
Idk why I didn‚Äôt expect circles around a tree but I‚Äôm glad this is what I got.
---
Yes I‚Äôm serious. Thanks for the info.
---
okay try that ty
---
More lumber is required.
---
We use us when we click into wow. 5700 in queue now
---
There won't. He's faster than most, additionally he's abusing layering.
---
It's a nice story, but I don't see why a warlock needs any water when they can more easily cut themselves and drink the blood. I mean, Life Tap. I meant Life Tap. Warlocks can Life Tap. 
---
Would make sense if he wanted food though, since healthstones are lackluster and drain health at low levels is trash. (if only health funnel went both ways!)
---
Me too must be a classic issue
---
Got it last night!
---
Ya it was justified as an anti troll thing but it was always just bs. All other cc works
---
I say stick it out with the warrior. Even better - find some shaman friends and group with them for +++ more fun, and you get windfury anyway once they 32+!
---
Succubus is best dmg without talented imp and she doesn't really use mana so she's perfect for Dark Pact drain tanking
---
Raiding, however, was something done and accomplished  by a little over 10% of the player base during vanilla wow. 
---
The majority of players enjoyed the leveling experience. And did not think that raid content was the end all be all of the game. Otherwise, classic right now would not be as popular as it is. 
---
Raiding is the end game content for a character that has essentially exhausted everything there is to do on that class in regard to dungeons and questing.
---
That's pretty much what he did, just aoe  farmed same mobs for hours and hours.
---
Later on when he reached level 50+ he started to 'use' the layering system to quickly manually re spawn the mobs instead of waiting the 5 minutes for packs to re spawn.
---
I mean, honestly, it's still impressive in my opinion, it requires dedication to just sit and farm the same mobs with aoe over and over, I couldn't do that for more than 1 hour.
---
And now that more and more people are reaching higher levels doing that kind of farm will be harder as those spots will be grinded.
---
Well you will get your first mount for free aswell, right?
---
Harpies in Charred Veil in STM. An absolute Godless abomination of an area that should be avoided at all costs. All mobs pat around so fast and are in groups. 0 chance getting the quests done without dying.
---
Retail raiders won't know challenge until they get 40 people into a raid to spam 2 buttons at bosses until they die
---
Westfall, the hidden treasure map questchain. Killed so many murlocks that I just gave up after 2h...
---
Mangler is the most recent one, I think they're actually still on Kunark but might be moving onto the next one soon if you're interested. The progression servers (what those are called) need a subscription, though. The populations of the servers hold out really well generally for the first 5 or so expansions then start to dwindle. I was playing it not all that long ago, though, and the zones are almost too populated.
---
I'm missing Atlas with it's maps and the pluggin AtlasQuests.

Kreenig Snarlsnout in the Barrens. A quillboar chieftain whose corpse was so heavily camped I gave up even though I completed the rest of the objectives. Its like.. you make it through the queue and then theres another 40 min queue for a named mob which cheeky Shamans or Druids might even ninja with their insta-cast skills. Warrior has a hard time winning those standoffs.
---
Remove curse could have helped
---
Bandage
---
Apparently you were too close because you were getting hit. Extra range on attacks while moving
---
Blink uses so much mana. If you play modern WoW, you probably have bad habits.
---
Trying to eat during combat suggests too much PvP, not enough PvE, since the rules for dropping combat are different.
---
Rogue was at full health. Even if there was no risk of death, should have stayed away from mobs and let rogue kill them. (Dagger rogues always appreciate being able to use backstab.) A mage and someone who plays with a mage should understand rules for when mobs switch targets, which is to say they will when rooted.
---
Doesn't look like you use Rank 1 Frostbolt.
---
Instant Arcane Explosion for everyone gives mages bad habits. It should go to a 0.5 or 1 sec cast! (Not really serious because \#nochanges until at least the sixth content release; but I am old enough to have played when it was 1.5 sec cast without talents and, therefore, hard to use when being hit by multiple mobs.)
---
thats jokes, my mum came into my room and said is that all you do is running????
---
And she kept asking where is everyone going???
---
Lol, its kinda true though all running is a big part of the game so xD
---
yeah prob half the time that happens. But like I said, it keeps things interesting either way!
---
That chair is actually really nice, I think it costs like $700. It's supposed to make you have really good posture.
---
you can make a pvp spec that maximizes your stealth  stun and poison abilities etc , but that would mean you would be less effective against npcs.
---
and make sure you train all available poisons, they are essential for pvp.  you also have to switch poisons in preparation for an opponent if you have time and knowledge about the next fight )
---
Open your log, go to my actions then feed him. Keep feeding him until one of the procs goes to single digits. It should then go to about 0. Thats max happiness. then grind. It'll stop going away. Unless you die alot, or forget to feed him like one an hour.
---
There will always be assholes no matter what. Nice thing with Classic if if that guy continues to be an asshole, people will remember on your realm and he‚Äôll be blacklisted.
---
I saw a guy called Adolfcritler, gave me a laugh
---
But that is not the point. Enjoyment isn't an objectively measurable term. If joker enjoys speedrunning then it doesn't matter what "the point of classic" is. 
---
This guy played the game like the rest of us a long time ago. If he decides he doesn't like/want that anymore who are you to judge him that he is playing the game wrong or missing the point of it?
---
Swine?
---
Pwnhub. Mage. Ended up grouping with him for 4 hours in loch modan for name alone.
---
Which one?
---
I'll be honest, I've played a lot of games in my life...the only two that have ever had this supportive community environment are Vanilla WoW and Warframe.
---
Well its shown in media and music:
---
Justin Timberlake Jr will get less people interested(even if he sings better and better songs) than Justin Timberlake?
---
Thats why when a new Band is formed is better to keep one band member that was general liked to boost people to give a try.
---
Why? Because people like what they already know, even if its bad for them.
---
I still need to convince people to switch from windows xp to 7. And thats mandatory and they still cry a bunch.
---
Likewise as a warrior i've saved so many people one hit away from death with Charge + Mocking Blow. Nothing in WoW has made me feel like a hero more than those moments.
---
Let's hype him and bring him in the news and break the internet
---
Bitcoin is great
---
Tanks, 
---
Please mana check.
---
Yours sincerely, healers.
---
By comparison, what would like t1 BoE gear have been going for after MC was being full cleared by 10+ guilds?
---
Or some other comparison I can use to know what 1,000 gold is actually worth.
---
If these features were in a different game it would be laughed at. It's only passable because of expectations set back in 2004.
---
Eh, he tried to delete the char anyways
---
Out of those 3 and your constraints, I say pick Druid. They are actually good levelers, have the massive benefit of getting stealth and tracking humanoids which is great as a casual if something pops up (need to help the kids or something), they can heal adequately while leveling, even in feral spec (just have some int gear in another set stored in the bank or something), and they are godly in BGs, lots of fun flag running and defending AB nodes.
---
Just level up in feral, and with your intellect set you can heal. You also get the benefit of being able to tank, which makes getting groups much faster if you‚Äôre on a tight timeframe.
---
I feel you.  I started playing WoW at the beginning of TBC and I played a Blood Elf Paladin.  Can't even be in the same faction anymore if I want to play the same class again.
---
But I am still enjoying Classic despite that.  And it sounds like there is a good chance they'll make TBC servers if this continues to go well.
---

I assume it's this.
---
I can‚Äôt see that far across the pond sorry
---
Why does this exact same joke get reposted every day?
---
I accidentally wrote "WTF stacks of linen cloth" instead of "WTS" in trade chat,  and instead of facing unending ridicule I was told silk or mage mageweave would be softer. 
---
So thoughtful.
---
I sell bows or weapons with good stats. Im 33 and the greens we find vendor for a lot so unless theyre something that specifically makes me think "i would want this" i vendor it. Sold a few 8str polearms from redridge and a 7 int/spirit staff but most of it is junk.
---
The difficulty just from mob to mob between classic in BFA is immense, not even to touch on the fact that they purposefully made the ‚Äòleveling game‚Äô a solo endeavor with the Cataclysm changes and removing all group quest design. 
---
The game is quite literally tailored to play solo in ‚Äòretail‚Äô whereas vanilla WoW was one of the last of the old school MMOs that focused on the massively multiplayer aspect of MMORPGs.
---
I always thought the same about flying. I mean its a Great Option but the nearly unlimited access is bad for the. Would be a much better Mechanic if you could fly 30sec just to dodge some things as a Little QoL and After the flight you get a 4-5 min CD.
---
‚ÄúI am a Dinosaur Rawrr‚Äù
---
I heard it will be bad but realistically we are not rushing to advance very quickly as a friend will join us soon. 
---
What class would you recommend for him to make the live a bit easier for us all? (Or a better comp for the 3 of us with only one warrior)
---
There‚Äôs a bunch of mats we have to get to be able to do it. 
---
The level 60 mount took me almost a month of farming to get all the stuff for.
---
Pretty cool feeling. There's a small amount of actual world drop epics too, though immensely rare and high level. In actual vanilla I had 4x lvl 60s and only ever got I think 2 world drop epics. Otherwise the epics come from the raid content except for a few rare pieces. Like in UBRS one of the bosses can drop an epic dagger but otherwise that whole place drops blues.
---
I remember way back years ago when I pulled extra mobs I would try to kite them around the room, usually just inadvertently picking up more mobs, and causing a wipe while the tank was just trying to chase me to pull the one mob off of me.
---
I've since learned that if my multistrike picks something up that wasn't fully engaged by the tank yet, I just walk forward to the tank and let it beat on me while continuing to dps the main target, and eventually the tank will pick it up. Hopefully.
---
I just can't wait until I have Feign Death again.
---
People were saying it was about $20/g yesterday, which seemed a bit high, but gives you some context
---
It does when you spread misinformation
---
Perfect time to farm gold for epic mount
---
When I'm running a dungeon for the 6th time that day I don't give a shit about feeling the world, I want to get in and get it done. Not saying you're wrong, that feeling is great to have but this implementation of it is outdated.
---
You got beat by a bald gnome mate
---
I lol'd out loud
---
Right!? I love my child free life
---
You won't be getting any item with a primary stat that's 3 numbers long in classic though.
---
Absolutely not.
---
Shhh you are breaking his argument by saying he  didnt play retail.
---
To be honest i feel people left in wotlk and just skipped mmorpg altogether and now they return to something they know.
---
Probably they dont know how heirlooms work or the fact you can make heirlooms look different.
---
instead of getting angry, maybe make a counter argument instead
---
I just consider "world first level 60" to be a misnomer for this achievement.  I've given my reasons, you don't agree.  Maybe give your reasoning too instead of just spamming me with replies?
---
My wife has been a trooper. Logging me in about an hour and half before I leave work. Dealing with my cheers and curses on discord with my guild. Making sure I have food and beer. Reminding me that family time is important while the kids are swimming in my parents pool after she got them from school and I'm grilling on their fire pit, all the while I'm complaining that I could be playing WoW (this happened today). Real trooper.... Some background, my wife and I were both paladins on wrath. She was the smashy kind and I was the healy kind. Well, driving home from my parents today, she asked if her laptop could run classic. I don't see why not, her laptop was my old one I used during legion. Should be fine on medium settings I say, then I ask why. Well, she wants to try classic. Sure, just need to resub her account. I do that when home and the tired kids (swimming is a great way to wear out kids) are all in bed. She makes an undead mage to play with my undead priest and gets to level 7 (I'm currently at level 15). Very excited to heal her and very excited to have my own personal food/water dispenser and intellect buffer. She says she doesn't know if she'll have much time to play while home and watching a 2 y/o, while the other kids are in school. I tell her it's fine, I'm in no rush, we can have fun together. Just very excited classic is bringing my wife back to WoW, she quit at the end of Mists. :)
---
Ha! I don‚Äôt. I heard he‚Äôs a bit of a prick irl.

Pretty sure it‚Äôs Battle for Azeroth :)

Also read the comic because its fucking amazing too. So glad they got Karl Urban to be Billy the Butcher.
---
Have at them boyyyyyyys!
---
Can confirm. Lots of speedrunners love gold splits because it means they've gotten better at a particular part of the game. Now new levels of PB improvement are possible.
---
Noggas in Paris on Noggenfogger-EU, made me lmao
---

---
Wand spec is how you level. Period.
---
STap and Wand Spec means never having to stop to eat or drink ever which means zero downtime.
---
Hey Isnt mail between characters 1 hour? What do you mean by click the return button on that character can‚Äôt find what you are referring to .
---
I had a piptip in original vanilla
---
But now I am druid :(
---
He was the strongest PVPer in the entire PVP academy
---
News flash, nobody care about gearscore during the leveling up dungeons, only end game content and only ones that are hard at the time, like heroics when first max lvl in WoTLK before they became trivial.  And there's built in checks with attonement in vanilla.
---
Yea the leveling definitely takes you all over the place! Some class specific quests take you on even more of an adventure.
---
Last night a massive upgrade dropped for me in DM. I need and so does the warlock who can't even use the weapon. He said he did it by mistake. I could have cried, it over doubled the + stats on my weapon and a 50% increase in dps.
---
That‚Äôd still be like 2000+ gold. 
---
The thing is most servers didn‚Äôt have 10+ guilds clearly molten core. Mc was easy as fuck but rangling together 40 people that aren‚Äôt fucking idiots is harder then it seems. I‚Äôve seen so many guilds wipe on that first double molten giant pull. It makes no sense. 
---
Also most guilds didn‚Äôt have anywhere near that many raiding guilds. High/full pop maybe. But medium and lower had about 5 tops per faction. The rest of the server and overwhelming majority sat their in t0 t0.5 and random blues and ZG gear for the entirety of vanilla.
---
Oh trust me, it's 100% personal since they camp you for 5 hours
---
But as i remember from WotlK, heirlooms were not that easy to get.
---
is this addon allowed , the guidelime
---
But then you can't afk
---
Yep your right, sorry about that
---
Yes.
---
I mean, shouldnt you come enjoy yhe honeymoon period?  Even if it wears off, Im having a whole lot of fun right now.
---
I think that's just the new general chat troll. I can't imagine people actually being invested in the acronym used for a dungeon. It's a days long argument when it comes up. Half the people are just fanning the flames for the insuing hilarity, the other half are confused on why anyone would care.
---
How is the faction balance ?
---
YA you kind of have to keybind his attack, follow/passive, and stay. Good luck.
---
What have they been doing the entire time? 
---
For good or ill (mostly ill, let us be honest), *listening to the vocal minority playerbase(s)*
---
Did you know you had to finish a zone before getting flying mounts?
---
He doesn't have proof with screenshots is probably why.
---
EU got the fix too
---
As someone who is brand new to WoW and could not possibly have more experience as a hunter, 
---
This has to be a troll. Nobody is this dumb.
---
Badlands - Searing Gorge right?
---
Levelinv was great in wotlk. It was just the end game that wasnt up to snuff
---
ive read most guides i get linked to by "mods" but im still stuck, Mage or warlock, i tend to play solo a lot, and i want a chill and fun experience. with little downtime, as downtime triggers my ADhd pretty bad and i get bored,   
---
I love pvp but i also wanna do some PVE . all help\\tips\\advice welcome !
---
Thats coincidence! My toons name is Shoggle, never had anybody close to it haha.
---
True but to be honest adding heirlooms and lfg wouldn't completely ruin classic it'd just make it worse. Wotlk still had a lot of stuff that only tbc and vanilla had. After wotlk they kept making more and more mistakes making the game worse. Wotlk was at just the beginning stages and still a fun game. Just not as fun as it could have been had they not added those things.
---
Maybe so, but if this is the case then why does the gameplay focus on making you repeat tasks to such extremes? Traveling through and experiencing the world for the first time (or just the first time in a long time is great) but waiting for 35 minutes for my tank to travel from Stonetalon to SFK on my 4th run of the afternoon feels much worse than any waiting screen.
---
He does. He will do video donations where people pay him to watch video clips and comment on them. He has done it for 8+ hours before with people paying him the entire time.
---
Dodge stitches every time because it spawns non stop.
---
Again, race change is a one-time operation. Noone would spend $100/month every month on race changes.
---
There's a priest on my realm named Obamacare
---
A lot of people doing that. Watched Venrukis stream with Ziqo, they swapped layers constantly. It's currently part of the game, why not use it?
---
hmm, was looking for my name because horde invaded the same spot at almost the same time on Sulfuras lol (we fought them off as well)
---
I straight up quit silverpine and went to Barrens during that Worg heart quest because I was still at 1/5 after like 30 kills
---
I don't think so jokerd was not abusing layering till last 2 levels, He still get decent exp with those scarecrows without using layering probably take him 2-3 hours more which is not that much..
---
I do remember reading a post where Blizz said they were going to fix some outliers that were abusing bugs not known in Vanilla. DM hunter + mage farming were two mentioned.
---
Interestingly, one of the big reasons why WoW massively eclipsed Everquest was because it was way more casual friendly and you could actually level totally solo.
---
Why make trillions when we could make \*queue dramatic zoom and sound effect\*... billions?

It's called the ***barrens***

Wrath without the LFG tool (or at least the auto-teleport part) was damn good.  The integration of the story to the questing was fantastic.  Dungeons had already started to get a bit AOE spammy though.

Lol I got it straight away dude. Wife is feeling the same way bless her.
---
I know the quest well... too well...
---
I got lucky and grouped with a mage who did that floor fire aoe. He knew a lot about the quest, kreenig apparently spawns only every 7 minutes, so if we missed him, we set a timer and had a little adventure.
---
Also a warrior, rage isnt the friendliest quick first hit resource :(
---
Im sat here at level 18, but man what an achievement. I heard he tried to delete the character after but people kept filling his mailbox.
---
And this is my point entirely. Us players are only reacting to variables effecting us. The queues are the problem that causes us to have to plan accordingly, wether it be remote connecting to your PC an hour before you get home, or connecting 3 hours before and using an oscillating fan to push your space bar, it's the result of not great business.
---
As far as I'm concerned the only ones at fault are the CEOs at Blizzard for failing to see the potential the base game still has 15 years later to provide the same spark. Everyone can be angry as hell at the players doing what they have to, but we all know who really should be getting the anger
---
A lot of people in Classic are tolerating that feature, which is easier to do at low levels/play time. I gaurentee you by DM run #8 most players are going to be over the whole "wait for every party member to run to the instance" thing.
---
Retail is systematic and doesn't make players wait. For some games that's the right call, and that style works really well in retail.
---
Why don't you like it? :(
---
Make a

"/petattack

/petfollow"

macro and thats it. When you start attacking a target just press this macro

You missed out by skipping Legion, it was pretty phenomenal. Shame it had to be sandwiched between two shitshows.

I don't think this should be any surprise. Retail raids are about beating the boss, not getting the loot. Transmog also plays a role, but I'm much more proud of killing heroic Azshara than I am any classic boss, and I doubt even classic raid bosses will change that from what I've heard of them.

you think 50 warlocks will just sit around at dungeons waiting to be paid 10s a summon?

Elsewhere someone said it was cross-realm and lfg that killed what made wow great, since it was community and needing to work together that made it shine. Got me thinking how as humans we seem to do better in smaller tribes and all this metropolitan urban sprawl is leaving us disconnected and unhappy.
---
Now you're talking about "ladder resets" and I'm over here having an existential crisis like, what if in life we're all just grinding it out to get to end game content, and we're clinging to out QOL upgrades but we're terribly unhappy. Like, what if humanity needs a ladder reset to be happy? That shits scary. Damn classic wow, you're messing with my head.

I add to that that the amount of content doesn't matter much. The problem lies in the way the leveling is adressed. Now in BFA it's a bit better that the level is sync, it means there could technically be challenge everywhere. But no, ennemies are all trash. Order kill does 60% on 6s cool down. Star surge moonkin is a one shot. Firemage instant fire Boulder is a one shot. All of cata content is just easy. Fun things starts at outer lands, I picked up an old thief from mop that utterly destroyed everything (all quest done in all zones of outerland lvl 70 blocked but the Illidan zone) and I can't do the elite golem quest.
---
And yes what I speak of is characters without that crappy legacy stuff. This is insanely easy still.

This sound great , one more question.

Perl Classic is bugged and shows Hunter pets at 100% happiness at all times. This is likely what is happening with the original poster.

You know it's a bug, because newly tamed pets start off in the red with happiness. Yet the addon shows them green from the start.

yeah, classic wow was heavily influenced by EQ, a game where (unless you are like 4 classes out of 14) soloing is completely impossible, and exp quests dont exist. Over the years they abandoned that model and made it more and more like ESO. Now look, I had a lot of fun with ESO, and more power to everyone who enjoys that game, but it aint an EQ style MMO the way classic wow is.
---
When I alt tab out of classic, and then tab back in, my game freezes for like 1 minute. Anyone know of a fix?
---
I have a shaman alt with leatherwork + enchanting, makes leather armor then DEs it. Bit of profit on enchanting mats but even that's getting flooded, however I think those mats will be worth more in future and you get to level leatherworking at the same time
---
Today I was lost in the undercity. Asked in chat about the way to some npc i had quest with. Immediately some guy came and said "follow" and soon I was with my npc. Helpful community indeed!

Because not everybody plays on the same server. Last I've heard there are more than one.

true, but then *SPOILERS*  he threw down with Optimus &amp; got rekt leaving him helpless in Starscream's hands who toss'd him in to space, to be founded by Unicron, have an (Azshara&amp;N'zoth) conversation, return as Galvitron to kill starcream, guess he finally learned his lesson to Kill the traitorous bastard in Transformers the movie.

well - sitting around earning money - as there is always a group needing to go to a dungeon. 3 people - well - yea forgot you need 2 people to summon the wardrobe (priest) - so 3 people per dungeon, up the price - and it should be alright - besides - you can just lollygag around and just talk shenanigans on raid chat when theres 'no clients'
---
Yes. It‚Äôs broke up in sections such as 1-9, 9-15, 15-20 and so on. It is a really awesome add on and I know a lot of people frown upon these types of quest helpers because it ‚Äúruins‚Äù the classic experience but man is it such a QoL improvement especially for people like me who really don‚Äôt care about story lines or lore what so ever.

So then they can play retail? It's not like we're talking about 2 different games here, Retail is just WoW with all of the convienience, if players want that they have access to it.

Basically SEO in wow

It feels different to pay to get access for the opportunity than to just pay to receive.  If you told me I'd pay $15 a month to add cosmetics to my loot table (with a reasonable drop rate), I'd do it even if it meant I'd never necessarily get what I want.
---
And this is coming from someone who has dropped thousands on cosmetics and cash shops.  PoE just doesn't do it right, at least for me.  Clearly they are meeting their metric of success.
---
Man, i had one quest there. I went in hoping everything would be dead and i could loot in peace, but they weren't. A party invited me and i said that i only wanted the tools and i was going to bed because it was like 3 am and i wanted that shield in the quest reward. We fought through, i got my count, and one of the mobs dropped a mail chest peice that was a massive upgrade for my grey chest piece. I needed and won. We wiped right after that, i got my gear and ran back ready to help, but everyone had moved on. I felt bad, i joined, killed a few troggs, won a chest peice and left because i was done. I just hope the other warrior who rolled need didnt hold a grudge.
---
4 days, not 5.

Oof

I made an analogy post about it for this exact reason. I don't understand why most retail players feel like shitting on Classic.

Just an observation but almost ever LAN party post I've seen here folks got curved monitors. I haven't had a chance to use them. I'm afraid they'll feel so foreign I won't like them.
---
Are they the new hype as far as monitors go?
---
Hmm, I played Vanilla; I just have a shit-memory (IE: still had to look up where Mankirk's wife was). I was on Sargeras and felt like we were one of 10 clearing all the way through BWL. Sargeras was huge though.

True discrimination is exceptionally rare but as are the 'snowflakes' who complain about seeing it everywhere.
---
These people do so for attention because the demand to complain outstrips the supply of the actual problem their complaining about. Thus the OP falls into the same camp, an attention seeker.
---
The best way to handle these cases is to ignore them.
---
Can't. Layers are for the entire game world, it's not phasing.
---
If capital cities got exempted from the layering system, you could run out of the city alongside someone, and they'd just vanish when you crossed the line.
---
Chill out snowflake

Yeah, looks like NRG vs Astralis on Nuke.

it could be ironed out :D im just throwing an socialized idea of 'meeting stone summons' :D a lil smalltalk for the summons would be fun
---
Had taskmaster axe drop last night and the warlock in our party rolls need and says he clicked it by mistake. I was so pissed off. Had to give him the benefit of the doubt though, but he's on my ignore list now after the dungeon.
---
Dont sell it for 70g like that other idiot on herod did. 
---
Keep it for when people actually start hitting 60. It's a step down from pre raid BiS and I betcha there will be people willing to spend 2-400g on it in 3 weeks to a month
---
They will complain about this ,yes , but a lot of these people start crying when they stuck somewhere and have to search where should they level up. I think you can also follow the lore with this addon cuz u still do a lot of the quests.

yeah we did, we went from 22k queues to 13k ;) still unqueueable of you wanna play same day ;p

Hi fellow brits!

And scat has better ap scaling with str

Noone played when he went to sleep. Also, he only used the layers the last level.
---
Yep in my current levelling zone all the mobs are already grey/green for skinning because my skinning level is so high.

Just spam the whisper text for guild recruitment

It‚Äôs not working for that guy lol

That's some dedication I couldn't do that

Square Enix said the same thing about Final Fantasy 8 but they're releasing a remaster of it in a week or so. 
---
Not sure what they exactly changed between that statement and the announcement.
---
Is it? For some reason I thought there was a quest chain before that.

Congratulations!!!
---
The problem is that most players aren't going to put up with the inconvenience long term. I'm not saying classic would be better with summoning stones but...classic would be better with summoning stones.
---
Getting back into WoW Classic after a good few years hiatus. Not really interested in the retail version anymore.
---
Thinking of getting my Undead Mage back!
---
Do you think they'll introduce any other of the popular expansions in the future (BC WOTLK)
---
Let them lose their minds. The classic experience will be better for the community if admins make it clear that they take botting seriously.

It‚Äôs becoming increasingly interesting to me that we‚Äôve all been assuming (myself included) that the population will drop over time.  If the game retains a higher than expected proportion of those that were there at launch, and if streamers continue to promote the game/make money playing it, the population very well may go up over time, as folks who never played vanilla WoW (mostly because they were too young) start to get curious and join.
---
Definitely free, but for a $37 mandatory donation.
---
Sometimes u just gotta speed run it
---
vanilla and classic times are totally different, layering is a huge advantage
---
I like.

I agree. A webcam should be required for these type of deals.

So no rules were broken, it wasn't against t&amp;c, so I bring you back now, full circle....
---
Why do YOU care?
---
How does Metzen not have a clue checkmark?!
---
a lot of the things they intended to be QOL upgrades aren't, they were fundamental changes to the nature of how the game is played. It's just enough time had passed, and newer MMOs had changed enough to where they lost sight of that.
---
but yeah I think if you want to make 15 year old content interesting for a multiplayer game the best way is ladder resets, everybody starts over from level 1. Its not that you have to grind again that's exciting, its that *everyone* does, so it feels fresh the way it did when the game was first released.

What realm you on?

---
Thank you very much
---
there is no way that was easier
---
It's not about having pvp. It's about having players passing each other on roads, struggling towards that same boss at the back of the camp, racing for the chest through mobs etc. because you can't just pass all those obstacles with flying. Flying removes all this interaction from the game and it started to show in TBC when people got flying. It's subjective whether you value that kind of interaction and sense of a living breathing world but for many it's one of the most precious and enjoyable aspects in an MMO.
---
Stitches no like midgets
---
Everyone in this subreddit (including myself, if I'm honest) loves to shit all over retail as if it's absolute irredeemable garbage.  Really though, I think the truth is that it's just a very different kind of game at this point and many don't like the new direction.  I'm not gonna say I know it's perfect for you or anything, but mechanically it is still WoW and I don't think you'd experience the same social frustrations you're venting about here with Classic.  You already have a sub and probably a free boost, so it wouldn't hurt anything to just try it out.  When the hype is done, there will probably be more people who enjoy retail than Classic.
---
What were you posting? Like post your recruitment text here. Is there anything offensive in it?

thanks! this is even better lol :D

---
Thank you, Maslt :)
---
But you don‚Äôt die. Warrior hits like a noodle and can die very quickly. 
---
But vanilla paladin is too boring for me. All that auto attaching makes me Zzz.
---
Save it. Personally I was a collector back in the day and farmed them all my self. But whelplings cost big gold. Escpecially that damn black whelp. Save all big things like this in your bank for 6-12 months until people have gold. 
---
That thing can sell for +100g or more. No one has that yet. 
---
Personally I‚Äôve been buying recipes for alchemy and cooking because people are selling rare as fuck recipes stupidly for 10 silver.
---
Got hit with problems and depression for the past week, I can barely make myself launch the game.
---
It's more about me not knowing the demographic of this subreddit and simply thinking that by now people may have forgotten
---
Can we have a moment of silence? ... For every veteran who badgered and badgered Blizzard to do this, so that the newer generation of gamer can experience what a 'true MMORPG' is like. \[Salutes\]
---
your link doesn't work
---
Put the bongs down for a week and use that money to buy a desk.. could also cut back on pizza deliveries as well.
---
Fuck I hope the devs are reading all this shit, and if they are I hope they're smart enough to realize that we do know what we want
---
Do you know anything about Malta?
---
&gt; Who is on about a world first race?
---
I mean, you did literally say
---
&gt; Having a player press a space bar during a world first race to avoid being put in 5-10 hour Q was not really in mind.
---
 I red ilvl stopped reading. I guess you have no clue about both expansions
---
Idk if you take Venezuelans for example they are the most right wing ethnic group in America, they along with Brazilians and Cubans roll hard right wing in america in stark contrast to the norm for every other Hispanic ethnic group
---
I would say paladin is easier than warrior as you never die. Damage of both classes is equally bad while levelling.
---
Maybe, but like I said the sweet spot will be different for everyone, I don't think Classic is perfect but I'd rather have classic unchanged than potentially have a slippery slope where we end up damaging the community aspects of the game in the name of convenience.
---
That's not to say I don't think they'll need to add stuff to classic eventually, but I'm extremely wary of convenience now that we know what it can lead to, remember retail is ultimately the result of conveniences that players asked for.
---
The statistics from the big survey
---
And FFXI kept that level cap at 75 for roughly five years and within that time frame had three expansions that released new endgame activities that didn't obsolete the prior ones.

Oh look at this guy. Mister bigshot. Waltzing around azeroth with their DiSpOsAbLe InCoME. Moneybags here needs to be taught a lesson. The rest of us are out here living quest reward to quest reward. Doing regrettable things at the lions pride just to be able to learn fireball rank 3.  Selling the armor off our backs for conjured water and dalaran sharp. You 1%ers really get my goat. You go up one tax bracket and you just start walking all over the little guy. Mister "I think I'll take the griffon today" or "perhaps I'll train a new weapon skill." You make me sick you bourgeois jerk. 
---
...will you buy me an 8 slot bag?
---
That‚Äôs kind of cheap.

I mean running away is perfectly normal, but using the game mechanic like this is cheap.

Hahah

&gt; TLDR: Great group let me tank WC with a hunter pet. no wipes and quick easy run. spread the love and the experimentation!
---
I've raided as a hunter tank, I can tell you they can get quite high on the raiding content ladder. check out the [Off Meta Discord](https://discord.gg/CJxxfcR) it has a few hunter raid tanks.
---
I got 6 cats, a wife and a 5 month old baby üòÖ I can relate.
---
I work in the industry. Blizzard is going to be happy to have Classic because now it gives them an opportunity to funnel players toward retail WoW, watch the marketing for the next xpac. While Classic is hype right now I don't see it being able to sustain itself long term. Content is King for any game as a service and Classic has a shelf life even with the phased content roll out.
---
Classic has a $15 per month pricetag and the economics are entirely different for a pserver vs classic.
---
So many things in retail WoW are designed to increase retention as long as possible until the next content release which has unfortunately led to some poor choices but what you have to understand is there's a sweet spot for Blizzard where they're okay losing some subs for higher value players that buy tokens, cash shop, services, every expac, and stay subbed forever.
---
This makes me proud to be horde
---
The absolute stupidity of the default AH UI sorting by lowest bid is why i immediately installed auctionator before i really intended to fully use it. The amount of 1c bid items right now are stupid and just screw with actually being able to find the lowest price without addons.
---
That is the Can Do attitude of Classic.
---
Retail WoW just bitches "No path found." while Classic makes its own path.
---
I never have more than 50ms.
---
Do yourself a favor and run RFC with some slightly over-levelled players. You can easily get a whole levels worth of xp from it.
---
My method actually makes ninja rolling less likely, and I am trying to prevent ninja looting, not justify it at all. Try again and read slowly next time.
---
Before wednesday?? Will they do it in greens?
---
Do I fundamentally not understand fishing? How did you get all that stuff catching fish?
---
This update was initiated by a cunning Microsoft employee hoping to get into Classic himself.
---
Also the thousands and thousands of dollars he makes doing this.
---
Maybe what Blizzard should have done is never raise the level cap. If they created new content meant to fit with old content then the game wouldn't have gotten so stretched. It might've made it less marketable but having new zones patch up weak parts of the leveling experience rather than tacking on new bits on top of it would've contributed to the long term health of the game. Have hellfire peninsula be a STV or Barrens alternative and have Shadowmoon Valley be mostly for atunment quests and world bosses, like how argus was on retail. 
---
As long as level caps kept being added previous content would need to be sped up, once they were sped up they became less like worlds to explore and more like chores.
---
u realize traps cant be used in combat and disengage is just a threat remover that doesnt launch you backwards, right...?
---
Because you haven't gotten to the spreadsheet part yet.
---
Seems broken
---
AWW DUDE
---
Some dude was selling feat of the lynx on Skullflame for 7g, I have no idea if it sold but I wish I had the spare 7g at the time.
---
Not to be that guy, but wasn't Metzen more or less in charge for much longer than just Vanilla? Under his supervision they brought in LFG in Wrath and so on, so...
---
This is so amazing and true. If the whole world would be like that, we've already worldpeace:)
---
Wow has that strength that all leveling are nothing alike. I rerolled tons of char and you can just change route and level there. Or there. Change faction and voil√†.
---
I probably should have picked up what you meant by context. I can understand how you would make that mistake.
---
Just don't waste your time competing for assassin quests, skip them all together and keep on grinding as much as possible.
---
I though to use the summoned mount there is not skill needed but for other mounts they have to buy it?
---
no one cares
---
Barrens chat is in full swing. It's... Something.
---
no you're in a queue because blizzard can't be bothered to give us enough servers
---
if I log out it's 8h queue, thats more than double the time I have available, so I can't log out ever

I work in the industry there's a ton of signals wow has shifted a bit. Whales can buy tokens and there's more and more expensive mounts to buy from npcs since they've come out. Allied races are another big money maker. Mythic+s are literally designed to encourage high skilled players to carry players weekly for gold which helps with retention. Mythic+ also has the benefit of just keeping more dedicated players subbed longer because it's likely gambling every week between chest opening and titanforging.

As a level 28, this got me - laughed audibly.

I did not laugh audibly when I visited my trainer yesterday.

I use to wait 6 hrs.  Now I log in at 3am
---
But all of that is in original it's just improved and less annoying. Not to mention that sense of community is garbage for classic now. Most times when I lfg for a quest someone starts it when a person is missing and whoever was left out has to wait for another group. Nobody waits now. That "community" isn't there anymore.

If you install the add on called 'prat' you can disable all the buttons.

Prat is a chat add on that is really great. Just have a look and see I would say üòä
---
He makes his money playing the game. So, at the end of the day, no matter what happens in the game, he's winning. Even on a day where he gets constantly sniped and griefed, he's getting paid for it. A lot.
---
Is there any way you guys found to swap layers?
---
Lol. Im level 32. I guess i was beaten yeah. Like everyone else
---
When it saves your ass because you resisted that one last shadowbolt that would have killed you before you killed the npc. Then you'll be praising that ring and never vendoring it.
---
I get your point but to me this implementation is more enjoyable.

Not for everyone lol. Some people don‚Äôt care at all for lore or story lines and just enjoy killing shit and getting loot.

Don't listen to this guy...

Give it to me instead!

I jumped over a small ledge on my Hunter today in Wailing Caverns. I didn't dismiss my pet first. Oops.
---
It's a lot different when people have a dungeon carry, gold for twink gear, bags, and skills
---
Like you said there's no reason to implement tastefully done mtx unless that's your niche to market your game which not everyone can do because then it fails to be a decent way to market your game.

Hey all. I'm pretty new to WoW and thinking about starting a druid. Not super into PvP and will just be playing casually. I've always been interested in how the druid works with the form changes and the multi purpose nature of it. My question is, would anyone recommend that class for a relative newbie? I hear it's not great but willing to give it a go. Thanks (:
---
You blacks out the invite yet you left it visible in chat.
---
I think you mean duskwood?
---
You have never worked a proper day of your life have you?
---
Fast pacing is exactly one of the main culprits why you don't bother to talk to random players. 5 seconds of typing is alot in retail, while in classic that 5 seconds is not much but could save you multiple minutes in doing whatever quest you're trying to do next.
---
Is this a copypasta?
---
Oh wow, this is touching man. Wish you guys have a long and happy life together.
---
Use MoveAnything. Bring up the Blizzard frame finder, there's a button for it at the top. Hover over the voice icon and the frame finder should tell you what the frame's name is. When you get the name of the frame, use /move VoiceFrameName to do a custom move or hide on that frame.  
---
Obviously VoiceFrameName is not the name of the frame, but you get the idea.
---
If I had any clue how to get the voice icon to appear, I'd find the frame name for you.
---
Children can be so cruel.
---
Wait, is this a screenshot of official classic or LH?
---
If classic, on what server are you guys. I kinda didnt manage to login the last 2 months.
---
Right?  All the comments here are either "Who cares" or "He used an exploit", why is this on main feed?  Does anybody know who was the first max level in Borderlands 2, Guild Wars 2, etc?  Let's cheer on more useless uninspired actions so we can influence more useless uninspired actions.
---

---
Is this a Tribute run? Hunter soloing DM North in original WoW. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtdik-lF1ik
---
I probably only went to Dire Maul North a couple of times and don't really remember what a Tribute run meant.
---
Sad.
---
&gt; I love slow inconvenient grindy games and I always have. But most people don't and once the novelty wears off a lot of people are going to find that's what their left with. Classic can't fix any of those problems because it's not allowed to iterate and it's drawing players away from retail which CAN iterate. Happy to be proven wrong, but I never once believed wow might die until it started to look like it's future would be Classic wow.
---
I'm totally fine with those players leaving to play Retail instead, the fact is that the two games appeal to two different types of players, if classic tries to appeal to everyone it's just going to end up like Retail.
---
Again, I'm not against Classic getting new content but I think both we and the developers should be wary when we consider what to add, thinking about how it can affect the game in the long term and not just in the most obvious sense.
---
E.g adding LFG has the obvious benefit of making it easier to form groups for dungeons without clogging up the chat channels with people spamming "lfg dm" however if we just implement it like it is in retail then it's going to have the unintended side effect of taking away a lot of WoW's community aspects.
---
I've seen someone say "just add lfg and the people that want to use it will and those that don't won't" which is naive as people are naturally going to take the path of least resistance. If instead of running all the way from TB to Org to get a flight path we could just teleport there how many people do you think would actually run?
---
Bro you got it made.  She's hooked, roll with it son!
---
It‚Äôs not always on DPS though. I‚Äôve had times where threat was a tad spotty, the healer was getting gangbanged and the only way to keep the heals alive was for me to hammer my frostbolt spam on the guys hitting the healer and hope for the best. *Sometimes DPS even know what it‚Äôs like to tank or heal... imagine that*
---

Well that's not free at all :(

Had a lady in New Orleans wrap a bracelet around my wrist and say "donation?" And take the bracelet back when I didn't give any money. I don't think she understood the word. &gt;:(

This could also be right! Can anyone confirm?

Elvui does it
---
Yep Classic alright. 
---
My emberstone staff got ninja‚Äôd by a rogue.

Ooo I like that. That might be a way to get rid of the all roll need jerks.

And never forget, give Blessing of Wisdom to your casters, especially your priest.

Keep LFG only server wide and it'll help a lot. It's still people you'd see.

Welcome too classic WOW haha

Ima delete my comment now for not being able to read lmfao. My b bro

Everyone says this. That he's playing a part. It's all an act. He's a troll, etc. Now I've never seen his streams, but he sounds like a piece of shit. I don't care if you're just pretending to be a douche bag or if it's genuine, you're still a fucking douche. 
---
Also, I'm sick of his stupid fucking face in my Youtube feed constantly just because I watch some WoW content on there. Fuck his fucking face.
---
Yesterday a level 22 shaman helped me for 40 mins try and tame a wind serpent in WC caves, he had nothing to gain and we both died a few times, but it didn‚Äôt matter. Such a great community makes me feel the need to be more helpful
---
One is RPG and second one is Action RPG.
---
Ecactly!
---
&gt;never warrior questing
---
Heed the warning!
---
Hmm well that's right. But what do you mean with "will be out 3 years"? Will they close the servers after 3 years or what?
---
\*citation needed
---
Layering is to allow more ppl in without having 500 people waiting to pick up each box. 
---
It's not like they are on a different server so the stress is the same.
---
But if you had 2k people on each quest hub game would be unplayable.
---
So layering is the solution.
---
It's not just the taunt. There's a lot of minor things that Paladins don't get from their class abilities or talent tree that Warriors do that make Warriors able to tank.
---
They just don't have the buttons, of which taunt is one. But Shield Block for pushing two crushing blows or crits off the attack table, Shield Wall and Last Stand for mechanics/oh shit moments, and the raw single-target aggro generation Warriors have access to are all things Paladins just don't have in Vanilla.
---
You don't see a big deal that he played for over 8p hours straight killing instant respawning mobs when us normal adults have maybe 4 hours tops a day and kill mobs with 2-10 minute respawns???
---
In bed
---
It's not the community, it didn't change. The game changed; it's the game that was the problem.
---
Battle shout or Demoralizing Shout to get some nice threat at the start, then just tab target while applying sunder armor.
---
You can also spam Battle Shout or Demoralizing Shout throughout the entire pull to keep aggro.
---
well yeah, but you don't have to be in shadow form when you are healing a dungeon...
---
*Happy Vanish noises*
---
Is there any option to just completely disable battle.net integration? For me it's mostly just a distraction.
---
Troll named Ling (trolling) made me  chuckle
---
it sucks but we need it for now, the servers would be full 24/7 without it
---
I haven't seen many good ones in game during classic. Vanilla though here is some I remember:
---
ShamWow - Shaman
---
CritneySpears - Rogue
---
WillFeral - Druid
---
Soon to the the red hills of Stranglethorn.
---
Probably the biggest pogchamp moment of the 60 hit.
---
Its not the title - realms arent merged and there is no groupfinder.
---
If you behave like an asshole it will be very hard to get into groups or guilds. This is the wow where most of the content cannot be solo'd so you better behave
---
Most discoverable locations on the map require going off the road a bit and into the world.
---
It definitwly wad worth it for me. Im having blast. Ita easily the most fun time ive had playing a game this year.
---
I mean i get a rogue quest to kill a Level 23 Elite. How am i supposed to do that alone. I have to as strangers to help me. And there are many examples like this which just aren‚Äòt there anymore in retail. 
---
Also thinking about the best Path to Hand in quests. These are small differences and on paper it sounds anoying. But that‚Äòs what an adventure is about. Planning ahead. Not mindlessly slaying away.
---
This episode is what sold me on the game back when it first aired. Then I just had to convince my parents..
---
Charles from RDR2 would be proud.
---
It is worth it if you‚Äôre into the type of game it is. If you need more info on what classic is vs other games, or mmo categories in general, go browse the content people post about it. It‚Äôs grindy, but it‚Äôs so rewarding. Consider looking at the sunny side of classic. We welcome you :)
---
layers allows you to play the game without a 10 hour wait
---
Wait what? She sent assassin's? The fuck happened after I quit in early cata? I know she became war chief, but why send assassin's after thrall? Worried he would try to take over?

Damn Gz m8. Could also be a world record i mean usually it takes weeks of /played time!

What's your opinion of WoD?
---
I've been playing WoW on every expansion from TBC until WoD came out which I thought was awful.
---
Faster... Can you read??? Not all of us can play 18 hours a day..  18 is the highest a real adult would be realistically because my guild is full of adults with real jobs and that's our highest level...
---
2 gold vender price, you'll be rich!
---
there is a camera setting for follow. like smart, on, off, I instantly turned it off
---
No I typed it wrong. I meant to say classic will probably be relevant for 3 years as they'll be releasing new content for it in phases. 
---
You're actually better off playing classic servers than retail because as far as I know there are no plans to ever close down the classic servers. They'll from what I hear most likely give the option to create a copy of your character on a tbc  sever I'd they ever release them.
---
Pretty sure back in TBC I rolled warlock 2nd character because I learnt it was something like 75s to learn to ride with the quest like or something like that cheap and cheerful
---
Nah, I am not even a mage.
---
Also i only buy the spells I need while leveling. 
---
No need to buy everything just yet, gotta get thst epic mount.

Skull Rock Insignia for the green pickle suffered my first death there. and me 2nd.3rd. all way to like 13ish.
---
sigh
---
I mean ... it depends?  Do you like the idea of playing in a massive immersive world in the warcraft universe? 
---
It‚Äôs more than nostalgia bringing people to play, it is a great game.  But its not for everyone.  It wasn‚Äôt even for everyone in 2004.  But it jad and continues to have a pretty broad appeal for what is something of a niche genre. 
---
Maybe grab the free starter and see what you think of the first few levels?
---
The addon author wasn't lying. You can move anything.
---
I believe the VW ability Torment actually mentions the word Taunt.
---
Yup, I already set that to never. It still follows my character.
---
Very well said
---
Cat's Eye Emerald in NE tip of Barrens... On my Warlock it was the first time I died, (Level 17) and I actually died twice. The run is from Crossroads ... I took the res sickness both times and hearthed to Org to clean up inventory, etc. Then ran out the side entrance because it's half the distance than from XR.
---
Taking grandma's trash to the curb hardly counts.
---
It's not irrelevant, though. He makes money playing WoW. Anything bad that happens in the game pales in comparison to that fact. You can't tell me that you wouldn't piss your pants in joy to be able to be corpse camped for 8 hours and make a few grand doing it. It's a job. Jobs are sometimes shitty. His job is far better than most and he makes really good money doing it.
---
I don't care what he does in game. He could get an army of fans to carry him though Naxx and get him BIS gear tomorrow and it wouldn't affect me. I'm not on his server and I'm not competing with him. I really don't care. I am just pointing out that all the negatives will never outweigh the financial positives.
---
Yes. And ban Rogues too, for blatant abuse of mechanics. How dare they use stealth mechanic to gank people!
---
Until you see the person who stole "your name" on the other fraction, then it gets personal.
---
just like most of the expansions lately
---
No it‚Äôs not. People expect every spec to be viable in raiding. That‚Äôs not how the game was designed. E.g. Hunters melee spec is essentially useless. 
---
The problem is a lot of people want to play tanks/dps for what essentially are healers classes in raiding.
---
Not really. Ret paladins only turned on *very* late in the expansion due to the raw stat requirements for the spec to be good. Before then, the stats just didn't exist on the gear available. So no matter how hard you tried, playing ret was just holding your group back because the dps was just too low.
---
They were great for pvp, though. Not quite Wrath good, but still incredible.
---
its different time now, people have been speedrunning in private servers.
---
I still have all my high school notes.
---
Ah, bummer.
---
It‚Äôs a game, why should we care?
---
Was you chasing world first? Otherwise it doesnt really effect you does it ?
---
Ah alright. Yeah well I like classic more too. It has that great oldschool mmorpg feeling :) alright thank you for the help!
---
Isn¬¥t  this bypassing the language filter? And thus could result in a ban?
---
Thanks you all who completely loots beasts, you are the real MVP!
---
Yea that's disgusting!
---
Set a and d to strafe instead of turn in keybinds
---
You cannot just say you did something world first without proper proof. Video is required.
---
I rolled pala so i could heal and tank some dungeons on the way to 60. Worst thing is judging an enemy doesn't tag an enemy. So many times when questing I judge a mob to pull it away from others and to start rotation, but just before i can get a hit on it some ranged attack comes in and the mob goes grey :(
---
Such language doesn't belong on a wholesome WoW server!
---
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
---
For leveling imp is useless
---
It‚Äôs nice having that organic interaction with other players again, so many games today not just Wow brush of that social aspect that I forgot what it felt like.
---
I'm just staying up all night. It is too good.
---
Omegalul
---
And you're buying it all out this the easy profit while also driving up the price?
---
Holy shit it is.
---
*blademaster ptsd*
---
What can ret do to anyone in pvp? They lack the on-demand burst of warriors or mages, they lack comboable cc, the only thing they really bring is Hammer of Justice. Which holy or prot bring just as well.
---
In fact, prot is a much better pvp spec in vanilla than ret, even after the reckoning hotfix. The only thing good for pvp in ret is Repentance, but 31 mediocre talents to get one good one isn't worth it by any stretch.
---
I think people want to play dps only on hybrid classes. People who want to play dps are better off rolling one of the 4 dps classes.
---
Best stream I‚Äôve ever watched.
---
Don‚Äôt take his run as a litmus test for how to level. Optimizing a game has become so increasingly niche that it‚Äôs hard to imagine a faster way - and it may be discovered. Don‚Äôt be discouraged. With layering, we can all play together with the more than full servers. It‚Äôs not ideal but it‚Äôs working more often than not. Leveling how you want is viable, and it will be for a long time. Banning a player for exploiting available mechanics is not the answer to this frustration.
---
Damn straight. Focus on mobs 2 levels lower, keep up to date with replacing weapons. Keep a sword and shield in bag. Ez.
---
I just missed Barren chat...
---
Wait do you want to hold right-click and want only your character to move, not the camera?
---
Thx
---
beathing lol what an idiot
---
Update: As others here mentioned it was apparently a temporary thing for new subscriptions. It's gone now, in what I believe was no longer than 24 hours.
---
omg he just ran in
---
Its not :)
---
True, but boring
---
I wish I could but unfortunately the drinks I had made my eyes a little too tired. I have been playing for a VERY long time today lol
---
All things considering he did great when his audience hit 350k.
---
If you use or want to get the Twitch client, you can get classic addons there.
---
Just go to mods &gt; wow-- you should see a drop down menu that points to your retail install. Click there and select your classic install to manage your classic mods instead.
---
Curious if they even have a concrete way to check if the person is using a legitimate method or not. But I guess if that's the logic then by accounts we should report multiboxers and let Blizzard sort it out then?
---
Lmao, that‚Äôs just brutal
---
If you can afford it, I‚Äôd definitely try it for a month to see if you like it. If you don‚Äôt like it, hey it was about the price of a movie ticket and maybe a small popcorn. If you do enjoy it and play it a lot, then your getting a very good amount of entertainment value for your purchase.
---
Get a friend or 2nd account to invite your character to a group and you will be ported to their layer
---
Boring
---
Now I kind of want to roll priest and start running up on people, obviously targeting them, and then self-casting fort before running away. That sounds hilarious. Lol
---
No, if you want to sell it you roll greed. 
---
If your logic was true no-one would actually be buying the boes so you wouldn't be able to sell them.
---
As a shadow priest I will deactivate shadow form and do what do too.
---
It's indisputable that the vast majority of people playing Classic dislike dungeons in modern WoW. Do you think they'd like them if it was a pre-LFG, WotLK-style, Gearscore-gated culture?
---
I think people who have played MMOs a lot have a tendency to think only the "endgame" is important. But it's called endgame because, for a lot of people, the game is leveling, not doing things at the level cap. Long waits to kill bosses again are obviously a way to keep players subscribed once they have done content that took the majority of development time (in early MMOs; in modern WoW raids might take more development time).
---
I thought this was a nice video: [The Deadmines - A WoW Classic Retrospective PART 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtWoXWUkCSI) Among other things, it talks about the quests involved. You're asked to talk to a rogue in Redridge, etc. Quests outside the instance connecting to ones inside of it. I understand that modern WoW doesn't do this anymore (haven't played it). Not all instances have such involved questlines, especially for things like quests for Alliance for instances in the Barrens (Wailing Caverns, RFC and RFK). But the quests are there.
---
If I played modern WoW, I doubt I would enjoy the quests. People say the writing is terrible.
---
Anyway, though, if people don't even read quests, they likely wouldn't say they enjoy them because then it literally is just "kill X of Y" or "go to Z". Perhaps that's one reason people do not praise quests in modern WoW, since the minimap arrows or whatever mean they don't have to read the quests.
---
Speaking more broadly and theoretically though, quests give people alternate goals, besides the ones you might imagine when you think of an RPG like "gain more levels, get better items". It's like the debate, if there is one, over whether to race to 60 as quickly as possible or to enjoy the experience. The value of alternat[iv]e goals in training people to think in a different way is detailed here, if you care to read it: http://pastebin.com/Q86Zhgs9

KEK

&gt; This is a basic concept in comp sci

Somebody add Sonic theme song
---
I‚Äôm not on his server either, I live in Australia and play on Arugal. This is the first time in ages that I‚Äôve even watched his streams cuz he‚Äôs usually streaming near midnight here.
---
But to think that the money he makes streaming can justify people going out of their way to attack him in game is a joke. Again, if he was still a 2k streamer with no sub button making barely a tenth of he gets now would it be okay for him to ask his viewers to give him gold or for snipers to snipe him? Streamer size is irrelevant because actions don‚Äôt change in game just because of what he gets irl.
---
I agree.
---
I agree with you. Crossplay was more of a symptom of a problem, not the cause. All cross realms did was magnify the problem. The ease of the game is the true issue. Why bother when the content is easy enough without them. But even those that do bother now have less power. Even if half the server bothered, the player still has countless of servers he can join in with and be none the wiser. 
---
Removing cross realm from that equation then let‚Äôs us see other solutions because it‚Äôs now contained the issue.
---
Nice y50
---
Lost count of how many assholes I've encountered so far. Retail kids struggling hard and over compensating with vulgarity. It's weirding me out.
---
Pfft, I hit lvl 60 *years* ago üòã
---
And people actually take the time to thank u when u buff them its so awesome!
---
You sir, are a fucking legend.
---
How about you do you and let everyone play how they want? There is room for all types of players thats why the game is so good
---
Thank you for posting this.
---
And have fun finding the fucking dead dude over at the dark iron hideout. Don‚Äôt go near the house - he‚Äôs on a hill on the outskirts
---
Yep me too! My three year old likes to try to spot whatever we are questing for. Never got to play original and loving the vibe of everyone just having fun. Any mums on Yojamba would love to friend - we can AFK while running after kids together üòÇ
---
YEAH
---
Stupid alliance with your druid trainer in moonglade :O
---
Get some help hey. Call someone, just speak with someone.  Are you drinking or smoking or anything? This just comes across as a sheer drunk rant. Hang in there.
---
Have you met in person yet?
---
Why does this bother you? Hes cheating, you know he is cheating so why care? It's not authentic or natural progression - It doesnt affect you in anyway.
---
We're playing a post-hotfix patch, Reckoning is capped at 4 charges now. You won't see more than 4 hits in a row, and you have to be crit to build charges.
---
You're so cool
---
Are they default fonts on shadowed uf?
---
I understand that it was common for new players without heirlooms to be kicked when they joined leveling dungeons because they made the runs slower.
---
This was before heirlooms were nerfed in a stat squish. The same mentality as gearscore.
---
You seem awfully mad.
---
You cannot enjoy Classic for what it is, eh?
---
Or it is a bad troll.
---
have sex
---
Look at all of you sjws gang up on people.
---
He tried to :d
---
Too clean, too polite everything, thats not a real LAN, your image looks like lan fake advertising!
---
I was so tired when looked at this, I didn't understand why they were out of running lol.
---
It is?
---
&gt;it's a feature beyond in-game mechanics
---
So what is it?
---
&gt;only a streamer can really do it; because you need a vast number of random people on different layers to invite you into their group
---
And he only needed to do it because he was streaming and people were streamsniping. Have you read the thread?
---
I just prefer the girls I look at to not have penises.
---
Tbh i'm pretty impressed how well their servers have been running considering the amount of attention.
---
They have some good potatoes.
---
What server is this? Stuff like that never happens on the server I'm playing on.
---
Daggers is great, specially if you are questing with someone else. I specced into 95% crit ambush and randomly met with a druid doing the Insane Druids quest in Ashenvale. While in the cave, I was basically one shooting everything in sight while the druid was tanking. Thanks to the fast respawn rate we were killing mobs non-stop for a solid hour. Made almost a lvl worth of xp at 30. It was great.
---
Can you properly use punctuation?

It‚Äôs like discord meet animal crossing where you get to shoot lasers at dragons, zombies, rock giants and elves / orcs. What more can you want.
---
Took me hours to get to level 8, I died constantly. It was the best first 8 lvls in a MMO ever. Being hard and the fact that I had to pay attention to quests kept me focused enough so I don‚Äôt enter that ‚Äúzombie questing‚Äù state.
---
yes and no, only you can know that
---
I hate these stupid common places that build over the years. Everyone speaks as if horde/alliance players (depending what you play) are from a different planet than the ones from the other faction. Truth is it's always 50/50 , there is no such thing as horde better than this and that sometimes u win others lose.
---
I once met a monk you ‚Äúgave‚Äù me a book for free and took it back when I didn‚Äôt donate. I think some religions don‚Äôt allow selling things for profit, so they rely on mutual donations.
---
Today, I was selling bags in brill for 3s each. A player asks if he gives me 6 linen, can I make him a linen bag.
---
‚ÄúOf course!‚Äù I say.
---
He then goes on to say he‚Äôs got 4 linen left, but can give me some money to cover the other two linens. I tell him ‚Äú4 is fine, pass it over‚Äù. I make him his bag and return it.
---
He says ‚ÄúI really appreciate that, here is a token of good will‚Äù and trades me a tailoring pattern for a robe I had not yet learnt.
---
There‚Äôs something special about these little exchanges in the community. The whole experience felt great and now I‚Äôm making sure to ‚Äúpay it forward‚Äù.
---
I started STV(ietnam) yesterday, and it‚Äôs just as brutal as you fear
---
So you just messed around in game.
---
But you made it sound like you worked actively "i only reached lvl 60 by playing a full year".
---
Actually better phrased is :"i didnt care for level or end game so by messing around for 1 year i reached lvl 60".
---
Because otherwise it sounds like "it was soooo hard to reach lvl 60".
---
If you do it 2 3 times you wont so it the same. And  most people i play in retail have like 2-3 alts.
---
Especially now since there is a story for horde and alliance.
---
We pulled too much and had to retreat. Instead of following us they surrounded us and kept aggroing more just forming rows around the rock. Was finally saved by another group.
---
Not surprised at all. This is exactly the type of scum that's hiding behin anonymity and pretending there's nothing wrong with having neo-nazi guild names.
---
I was also thinking this. But with the episode where Cartman closes an amusement park for himself, and then reopens it later - sending his profits soaring.
---
Are you seriously complaining about someone being able to advance quickly in a game because they have more time to play it? That sounds like jealousy to me, man.
---
To answer your question - No. I don't think it's a big deal.
---
That sounds crazy. You went to the tailor right around the corner right?
---
I assume you did. Talked to them night elf?
---
What route did you take
---
screw you guys i'm going home
---
Have heard of the game, but never played. I have no knowledge of this reference.
---
You need to learn apprentice tailoring from a the tailoring vendor possibly in stormeind it should be under the development skills tab
---
What's it from?
---
Haha np.  I had the same issue when i tried classic.  I changed those keybinds so many years ago on retail that it took me forever to think of what it was.
---
Hunter or mage
---
General reposti...
---
Yessir!
---
It‚Äôs because you‚Äôve capped your tailoring and you need to find the next level of tailor. If you talk to the other tailors like the expert one, one of those should allow you to get rid of the cap
---
The level 24 chad and the level 120 virgin.
---
Exactly. It's less that I like the hobo look (I wish Blizz designed basic gear to be more coherent) , and more that for me, loot just doesn't 'click' with me unless it has a tangibility or physicality so to speak. I need to it be identifiable, unique and some of the more powerful stuff- SCARCE . I.e. like vanilla. That loot was the true sense of pride, accomplishment and envy of players and friends alike.
---
If you cant see the difference between hating and making jokes about someone because they made themself a meme you cant be helped.
---
Ret just doesn't exist in classic. If you're paying attention to the responses, Reckoning is a deep Protection talent - deep enough that you can't grab a 31-point talent and Reckoning. My favorite one suggests going 31/10/10 and calling that abomination ret, when in actuality it's 2h Holy. Make no mistake, it can and will stomp in pvp, but it's not ret by any metric.
---
That said, ret shows up mid-BC, but doesn't become competitive until late, and I'm pretty sure that's also Horde side only due to Seal of Blood. You won't get to the top end of the pve damage charts pretty much ever until Sunwell.
---
In pvp, ret is pretty damn good from the moment you get access to crusader strike, and becomes disgusting in 3.0 until they patch away the like 3 cancerous things that ret gained access to. I'm talking "Pop bubble and 100-0 three people before it goes away" levels.
---
He's a speedrunner. To him, the game isn't about playing at 60, but getting to it as fast as possible.
---
Yea only really see in chat in some Norwegian, very little Spanish.
---
I see he‚Äôs literally playing the crap out of that Queue-craft lmao
---
What?
---
Yes, and it slaps bro
---
If you mean larsons clothiers then yes I talked to everyone in there and wasnt able to do anything.
---
The current implementation isn't great, but there's use to have that kind of system. Having it be just a bunch of rehashes of leveling quests barfed everywhere sucks, but there are a few that are fun or make sense to be repeatable. I think a better system would be world quests to build up something so over time you can be done with them and have something to show for it besides the patch/expac currency or whatever.
---
The mere existence of an achievement does not automatically make it a fair competition. Organising fair competitions is hard and is entitely different from just playing the game. These achievements don‚Äôt care about fairness, they‚Äôre just there for anyone to take in whatever fashion they want, including destroying their health, job and whatever else.
---
I dont understand all the people complaining about layering.
---
Yes stuff like this is annoying and its not like the original wow classic but you know whats way more annoying?
---
Having que's that are 4 times longer as of now or servers that are dead after 2months.
---
You left out the dreading part at the end where it should say...  
---
**[Your inventory is full.]**
---
there‚Äôs no such thing as a ‚Äúunivesal‚Äù build, pvp and pve have different talent requirements.
---
Didnt know about that pally quest! I'm even lvl 22! Going to do that quest now!
---
i have learned apprentice tailoring, thats the first one... right? but i cant learn the next one I need
---
I like stance dancing and wish they'd bribg a version of it back to modern wow but holy crap is warrior kinda clunky and slow with how rage starved you are all the time.
---
Well druids have no out of combat res.
---
didn't know that. in instances should i not shield warriors?
---
There's no way the teams didn't try to think of ways the QoL changes would change things for the worse. They simply failed to grasp what they were removing... and so did we at the time. We have a rare opportunity to restart and return to the values we love, not only that, but if we ever decide to move forward... we KNOW what the mistakes were made and can push against it now.
---
Oh nice
---
Because most people have never heard of him before, probably.
---
So basically fable 2?
---
Wrong
---
&gt; World first should be whoever has the fastest /played after let's say... The first 2 month... 
---
No, dummy.  World First means first in the world.  That's it.  Only one person/group can ever do it.  You want to speedrun Classic?  Have at it.  Nothing is stopping you from getting a spectacular /played two months or two years from now and showing it off for the world to praise.
---
&gt; That gives us non losers with jobs the ability to compete when we have kids.
---
No, your entire post is exactly how losers talk.
---
With that attitude you'll drive a VW Polo for your whole life. Your Choice
---
My favorite part of that chat wasn‚Äôt the tunics but the one random guy asking ‚Äúdo I gotta wait for the dude to write out the whole quest every time?‚Äù Lmao I‚Äôm just imagining how frustrating that is with that slow ass quest text turned on hahaha
---
What the fuck dude, 2000 gold? 1000 for staff of jordan? You played on dead server it seems.
---
Meanwhile my level 19 night elf hunter looks like a homeless man
---
&gt;World first should be whoever has the fastest /played after let's say... The first 2 month... That gives us non losers with jobs the ability to compete when we have kids.
---
That defeats the purpose of a world first. You can still have the world record tho. Just not world first
---
We got a cloth ninja over here
---
Larsons is the expert one to my knowledge, is there somewhere else I can go?
---
20g at lvl 30? Are you even buying skills?
---
I second Mage, unless she identifies with healing. Then priest or paladin.
---
I breathed heavily out of my nose once. Have a upvote.
---
cheers mate it worked, I had a friend invite me now i can farm in peace. I didn't mind sharing the spot, but the other mage got tilted because he couldnt do it without dying 90% of the time, so decided to grief instead rofl.
---
I bet he was so happy he finally got to use his chat macro
---
Seems weird, I never even considered them being able to hit 60 first, but the Molten core race is going to be fun to watch
---
Not it's the flight from my dick to your mom dude
---
Don't forget those random gear drops mattering and copper and silver having a play to part in the earlygame and even up to late tbh.
---
How did he cheat?
---
This is the main point. I would fly to sentinel hill if I needed to quickly make food or something.
---
World first supports unhealthy gaming AND life habits (sleep deprivation, unemployment). Blizzard has the opportunity to stand up against kids ruining their lives while letting us with real lives have a chance at winning.
---
They did fix it, it‚Äôs called retail, Vanilla is full of these ‚Äòissues‚Äô and that‚Äôs great, real life is the same !
---
We also have &lt;Ariana Grandes Feet&gt;.  Join fairbanks it's great.
---
&gt; You also scale much worse than Warriors/Rogues/Hunters with gear.
---
I actually have an issue with this one. Debatably, you scale much better, because you use damn-near every stat far more efficiently than they do. 
---
The problem, of course, is that you need so much of all of them to be good that you just can't get what you need with the item budgets available on Vanilla gear.
---
Choochooooo!
---
I personally (and I know many agree) think that logic is flawed. The fairest think *really* would be that the group could sell it and split the profits (and then if one of them really wanted it they could buy out the others). That's what would happen in any real life situation where a group of people came across something of value. But that's obviously never going to happen in a game like WoW.
---
Think of it this way, if 5 people IRL won a house worth a large amount of money. 4 of the people already owned homes and didn't need it, whereas the 5th didn't. The four people who already owned them wouldn't just shrug and say "Ok, you just take it since you need it more than us". Because although they won't all use it, it has the exact same monetary worth for all five. You're not going to give up on a few hundred grand because someone else needs the item a little bit more.
---
Finding an item like Krol Blade can mean a huge amount to *any* player. It can be seen like a huge discount on your epic mount. You can sell it and buy items that are BiS for *you*. Just because a rogue is going to equip it until he finds a better weapon a short while later, doesn't mean he gets it for free. And I say this as a rogue.
---
Nah. 90% of the time world pvp is either ganking someone while they're low hp or fighting a mob and camping them, 1v1ing someone and whoever wins camps the other guy, or raiding the other factions town/city. 
---
You can still raid a city/town in a PvE realm and have plenty of people who will flag themselves by attacking you to fight, except you don't have to worry about getting camped by a bored rogue for an hour while questing in STV after a long day of work/school.
---
He should also be banned for practicing on private servers (illegal) but thats another thread.
---
Pet Training is in the General tab of you spellbook. That'll allow you to train the abilities you've been learning.
---
I've seen a priest called Donaldjtrump and a warrior named Mikepence. Reported them both because it's on an RP realm.
---
Blizz, accept the fact that you made a mistake. And sack the new stuff and give us an expansion based on the aspects in classic which we came to love.
---
I suppose that if there is a point of the haters being that salty makes his fans just that more diehard. Say if you like something but everyone else around you says that it is rubbish and you shouldn't like it, when that happens you seem to be more and more a diehard fan of that thing you like. Besides that if you can see past his persona of acting like he is the best player in the world he has some good insight in what people want from WoW and has some interesting ideas now and then. But I think most of the "diehard fans" are caused by the vast amount of haters.
---
That‚Äôs nothing new. That‚Äôs just the way it goes. I almost expect it to happen when I go to loot one.
---
I think a problem with that analogy is that asmongold doesn‚Äôt get paid to play WoW in the same way Lebron gets paid to play basketball.
---
Asmongold gets paid to stream but it‚Äôs shown that the game doesn‚Äôt matter what game it is.
---
his DS and Bloodborne streams were just as if not more popular then any wow content pre classic and when he streams a game he doesn‚Äôt enjoying he stops.
---
Lebron has to play basketball because that‚Äôs the game he‚Äôs good at.
---
Asmongold plays wow because he loves it and gets paid because people enjoy him regardless of the game.
---
Hey!
---
So, onto your question... I think that it‚Äôs doable.
---
I work full time as a waiter (6 days a week, morning and the evenings) and I‚Äôm able to play 2 hours a day.
---
Obviously the progress is slow (I just hit level 11 after three days of playing), but in my opinion if the journey to 60 matters to you (and not reaching 60 itself) you won‚Äôt regret playing the game.
---
Thats why, its not authentic or natural. It's bad for the community when the majority of us are aging gamers with real jobs and kids and we can't spend 90 hours a week leveling on world of warcraft and neglecting our responsibilities
---
 Chonka comin
---
Is german your first language? I ask because "Dunkle Drachenwacht" looks german.
---
he abused layering its in the OP... are you illiterate?
---
I'm gonna do that on my shaman tank alt. Unfortunately I don't get to play her a lot since she's my solo alt, but I'm gonna try to just hover around barrens and nab skins. Was gonna try to get it done earlier, when kodo bags were worth more, but at least I can craft my own set.
---
Nah. The smart herbivores have figure out layering and are grazing where the carnivores aren't.
---
wait can mages send people to capitals of different cities or can they only send themselves? it says "creates a portal for the caster"

Yes but no
---
Have you ever watched the dude? He loves this negative press, every time it happens he shouts something about Twitch prime and gets a lot of money. Sorry to say but if you really don't like him then don't post anything because that will run him out of at least some content.
---
Blizzard is a multi billion dollar game studio I think they could find a way to make health competition... lol?
---
Yeah. If you're in no rush to progress asap and start raiding or something, you can absolutely enjoy, teaming up with strangers to tackle way too difficult quests\* and explore the world for all sorts of weird places.
---
\*it's a very neat albeit probably unintended (since they "fixed" it later) effect of there being not quite enough quests to level - you end up doing quests above your level, which both presents challenge and creates common ground to team up with other players.
---
That aside, I salute you for posting that battletag with a straigh face =P

Hi, /u/L33tSpeed

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cxu1ru/runpopularopinion_i_would_be_okay_if_they_updated/). 
---
Agreed. I actually enjoy sitting in a group of 3 or 4 people, waiting for the leader to find the 5th. Either head to the dungeon, or wrap up a quest you‚Äôre working on. Or just shoot the shit and chat with the new friends you‚Äôre going to be coordinating the dungeon with shortly. Get to know them. Once you find your 5th, everybody head that way. But the banter still continues as people make their way to the swirling entrance. A couple hop on flight paths. But within a couple minutes, everyone is there and it‚Äôs Go time.
---
It feels fucking incredible.
---
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs actually able to kill our admins‚Äù*
---
I‚Äôm calling them die hard because I‚Äôve never seen people so vapidly defend and support a streamer. I‚Äôm assuming he‚Äôs providing some sort of value and entertainment in doing so. Otherwise it‚Äôd just be embarrassing. Hence my question. I haven‚Äôt watched him. So idk. Nothing against him personally. The only streamers I watch are game grumps and oney plays. Mostly because I watch for the show they put on. Not neccesarily the games.
---
I honestly believe it's a form of nostalgic Stockholm Syndrome that will wear off pretty quickly. I'm fine with Classic remaining Classic, and am not suggesting the game being changed. But since thinking out loud only costs downvotes, I definitley have logged off only having gotten  3 or 4 levels done and thought "holy shit, half my play time was just walking between quests."
---
Looks like Yeti meat is on the menu today!
---
So don't praise world first? denounce it, ban them, delete their characters, roll back their character to a more reasonable level? I don't see why blizzard has to support this?
---
GOTTA GO FAST
---
Yep, me too. The economy is too shit right now for selling on the ah, it's not worth stockpiling random low level greens for months, and they sell for pennies to the vendor. May as well donate them.
---
What an awesome post, thank you for this!
---
I thought classic was patch 1.13
---
#1 Play what you want!
---
#2 no Matter what class, in group its always easier
---
#3 you both will always roll in same gear. Thats a bottleneck, if you reroll and want to do then go for leather or cloth.
---
I Duo Level warrior/shaman.
---
Its insane After Level 30.
---
WF Totem, Sweaping strikes.
---
Just Pull 3-5 Mobs and go ham.
---
(Shaman has to heal the warrior)
---
Last but not least:
---
Warrior is fkn cool:)
---
I got these 3 quests shared. Someone asked for help for the quests outside of deadmines. I asked if he can share then I‚Äôll join. So you don‚Äôt need to run everywhere. 
---
Also actually it was common to share all quests related to a dungeon before entering them.
---
Still though, could just level an alt to learn BS on to learn the plans, then never use the alt again?
---
Imagine being salty that some random guy on the internet gets gold from another random guy on the internet. Like why do you care? What do you get out of caring that someone would want attention?
---
Don't play on a pvp server if you cant handle the heat?
---
both
---
He needs to put the bongs down lmao they‚Äôre just guitars.
---
It's German, as the whole interface is.
---
Alchemy/eng and have a gathering alt: herb / mine
---
I like feeling frustration, rage, sense of meaning and joy at the same time. Don't tear it from me blizzard pls.
---
It‚Äôs more healbot than offtnak. A very rewarding class though and are wanted in raids due to all the utility.
---
We should let them have it, they mean well.
---
(Multiple hearthstones though Hello)
---
How is that cheating? Did he use a 3rd party software for that? Please show me where layer hopping is again the blizz terms of service. I beg you.
---
This is from an old old ventrillo hacker that would record conversations of him fucking around with people in vent. 
---
He would record and playback what they said and chop it up. Use sound boards change pitch etc. ventrillo harassment.
---
https://youtu.be/bIVTT4fgPQI
---
Actually he said on stream several times that he's "learning" because a lot of the mobs weren't like on classic servers.
---
This was so epic to see live
---
Oh shit, I forgot about bloodlust not being in classic (alliance player, yay). Rogues still do have great base damage even post nerf, though.
---
No, I'm gonna top dps whether you like it or not so deal with it, noob
---
hey man it's all good, just play if you feel like it
---
This came out around the time Leroy Jenkins did and I always found it funnier for whatever reason. It got pretty popular but was definitely overshadowed by Leroy. Thanks for bringing it back lol
---
Not at the start of fights or when the tank isnt geared. Some1 may correct  me
---
i did. I think I have to find a development trainer for tailoring in stormwind, any idea where that person is?
---
Who the fuck cares
---
Yes perhaps you should fuck off. Instead of crying around classic and reddit looking for things to be offended about.
---
*laughs in summon charger*
---
It sounds like you have zero experience with world pvp prior to it being bumfucked by flying mounts and sharding
---
My name Harry portal and guild chilli con carnage
---
Clever use of game mechanics. Method can go back to their 50 split runs to get world first in retail.
---
So you think it's fair that people can copy a strat to reduce the pull count as they dont have to learn from mistakes or bad pulls from unlucky RNG that other guilds dont get lol ...idiot. 24 hours behind and STILL method get the clear
---
Then why are you saying he layer hopped for 80h?
---
lmao, talk about being in the minority
---
It's the same whine people pulled when vanilla was new, the sense of entitlement that led to welfare epics and retail "everybody wins" attitude. You're not special, most people have jobs. I can't wait until these guys are getting two shotted in BGs by people with full raid gear. The forums really WILL be 2004 again.
---
As the guy that is always summoning everyone in retail I don't see a difference
---
It's unintended game mechanic abuse. Do you think blizzard wanted him to swap servers?
---
Why do you think blizzard has banned realm hopping on real wow?
---
this is exactly the reason why Overwatch is toxic and blizzard's inaction in dealing with it is very disheartening
---
Everyone over the age of 14
---
If your void walker loses %80 of its life in a single battle there might be 2 reasons 
---
- Combat is taking too long because you are not dishing out enough dmg 
---
- You are attacking mobs 3-4 or more higher levels 
---
And especially you are saying you are specced into improved vw as well. There should be no problem actually, warlock really is a solid class which can deal with 3 mobs at the same time without even slightest problem (while leveling) if played properly. I am not saying you don‚Äôt know how to play, but it seems something is wrong. Maybe your rotation, maybe you are initially spamming shadowbolts I don‚Äôt know 
---
Write down please how you engage combat
---
I had a generic Mulgore cat, and saw The Rake and immediately abandoned my original cat. I named him Mittens and now he's become an awesome tank, I've gotten a few extra skills taught to him like Bite from the stonetalon spiders, it's amazing!
---
Ok thanks figured it out now, damn feel so clueless, been so long since I played.
---
Side note: it cant be cast over thorns
---
Lol, you got a chuckle out of me
---
Well not pre-hotting is easy enough I meant more for if the tank just pulled the next group with a HOT still active.
---
Even if you want to dps as warrior in pve and play dps in pvp you need to respec as warrior. Atleast if you want to max your performance
---
In retail for the past two expansions, flying has only been added in after quite a while after launch, and only after completing achievements that force you out into the world to complete tons of content while grounded. I personally think this is a good middle ground between no flying at all and just buying it off a vendor, since by the time you finally unlock it you've gone through the whole leveling process and then a bunch more content before unlocking it.
---
All these comments have great advice, the only thing i can add is check out Madseasonshow on youtube he has a lot of Wow Classic prep on his channel
---
I still have doubts about how the situation would be without accountsharing and layerhopping.
---
JA! german is my first language :)
---
&gt;but went with rogue because of leveling horror stories.
---
Wat
---
No changes !
---
Even using questie and it‚Äôs inefficiencies make me feel like I‚Äôm still exploring. It tells me I need Thai general area often. But sometimes, it isn‚Äôt quite right so I have to correct myself and figure things out just that little bit more.
---
So watching a "normal" dude playing a game is not wachting GAMEPLAY?
---
When are the locks getting their summons?
---
Ideally you'll just pick up two gathering professions at the start and sell the stuff to others. Leveling up crafting really eats up the cash as well.
---
What the hell is with this cult making out classic to be perfect.
---
Fixing the respawn timers would hardly affect the classic experience. It's just frustrating to not be able to finish a quest.
---
No Twitch channel? Jesus Christ how can I donate?
---
It was the same for me as an UD Durotar. I just hate the UD starting zone, it's so bleak and ugly imo, that's why whenever I make an UD I immediately run to Durotar and start leveling there. Got a lot of comments on launch day, though I think it's much more common for UDs to quest in the Orc starting zone than the other way around.
---
My personal favorite is seeing where clusters of herbs spawn. I‚Äôm leveling a Tauren and I‚Äôm at level 17, I‚Äôve had to fly back to TB multiple times for quests and I find myself walking back to gather plants I saw from the sky.
---
Broken in a negative way in Classic I meant as in not really fun to play because just Buff bots. Yeah TBC they were about the best Tanks and singletarget healers you could get if I remember correctly. But not all patches tho.
---
3000ish beta players. Lets say 100 nah lets hyperbole 300!! Streamers... still 90% not streamers .... but nice whine want some cheese with that.
---
Unless you've played a similar mmo, probably not. It takes awhile to get the feel of the game. You probably gonna drop it pretty quick. If you want to get into wow either join a private server with higher rates or play retail.
---
Classic is superior to retail but much slower
---
kek
---
The drive by buffs are my favorite.  I was confused at first then excited when i figured out that was a thing.  Never ever played WoW before, and aside from enjoying the game in general, the community aspect (even though I'm very much a loner) has made me fall in love with the game.
---
hey guys i have a girlfriend just letting you all know
---
Don‚Äôt forget he pulled in 350k viewers and made well over $10k in 4 days time. How much did you make at your non-loser job? I guess still enough that your sloppy wife won‚Äôt leave you so it‚Äôs something.
---
Blizzard has never in the past banned people for this unless you used it to say racial slurs pretty much. Basically the only time I've heard of any repercussions of doing this is when Horde players would go " N l G G A" (L t A A F).
---
And if you don‚Äôt it‚Äôs all good. It is just a game
---
If it works this way on blizzard servers, it‚Äôs meant to work that way! It‚Äôs not a bug but a feature!
---
Between characters - other players and when you first send items to your alt - it‚Äôs 1 hour. 
---
If you send something to your alt, once it arrives you can return it instantly. The return button will show up then.
---
While I did make that mistake early on! I did eventually work that out, so I have rank 3 at the moment, which typically hits 53 with no critical, but my wand attacks twice in the same time, hitting 35
---
Also, sorry to keep asking questions, do I stick with shadow bolt or also use the fire spell you get around lvl 18? 
---
ITS NOT WORTH IT
---
I AM STILL AWAKE
---
GONNA HIT 30 BEFORE I SLEEP
---
SEND HELP
---
this is just too obvious bait, I can't believe all these people falling for it
---
32 warrior tank here, normally this is how I do it, say there's 3-4 mobs infront.
---
Charge in &gt; defensive stance &gt; demo shout &gt; taunt mob the dps attacks straight away &gt; now tab target sunder with revenge quite regularly 
---
If you're keeping aggro pretty well, try reserve some rage or pool it. It allows you some breathing room if a mob gets pulled onto someone else, as you can use your abilities to get him back if taunt misses/resists.
---
Did you never go to Winterspring or quest in Felwood?
---
It's all coming together.
---
Well if you do the simple math I've been playing/raiding since 2005, so I'd say I have plenty of experience.
---
That's a bit rich mate.
---
3 days 7 hours played isn't promoting "sleep deprivation, unemployment" it's pretty doable with a few dayoffs.
---
Is it spellbatching or just lag? Ferals OP
---
From all of us leveling a weapon skill thank you.
---
Drives me crazy that people don't give warriors int buff.
---
No I kiss yours
---
How do you kite those mobs that far. Do elites not loose aggro or something or is there a trick.
---
Can‚Äôt learn if you don‚Äôt try!
---
I'm using questie cuz it's not like even back in vanilla people didnt look shit up on alakhazam or thotbot
---
Yeah but mine is female. You didn't expect that, huh?
---
Thanks for this detailed answer, that‚Äôs quite shocking to hear how bad it has become. 
---
I know what you mean about the difficulty, classic des perfectly balanced in that you have to pay attention but it‚Äôs neither too hard or too easy to be boring. 
---
It‚Äôs sad to hear that retail has ended up this way.
---
Laying made a huge difference. He was pulling something like 165k exp/hour with the help of layering. Pull 25 mobs, kill them all, layer, pull 25 more, kill them all... rinse repeat for hours on end.

---
I‚Äôm absolutely shocked at the celebration of a guy exploiting a lazy workaround to launch proper servers be rewarded like this by the community. 
---
Of course I‚Äôm also shocked at the amount of people who watch other people play games and pay them money for it.
---
I was shocked when my laptop which barely runs Heartstone with awful lags runs WoW Classic so smooth. Like wtf??
---
That's awesome. Do you mind sharing the story?
---
So there were no assholes in vanilla and no ninja looters hmmm
---
Durotar-barrens-stranglethorn-duskwood-elwynn
---
Throughout my levelling I constantly see warriors dying and at low health in crowded hostile mob areas. It can be hard to only pull one mob, especially without ranged.
---
big oof
---
As long as you don‚Äôt automate it you aren‚Äôt violating TOS.
---
That's not the damage I'd expect from a druid.
---
"The Real Treasure Was The Friends We Made Along The Way"
---
I have the same point of view. I prefer choosing to start a war in a locality than wasting time getting ganked. It was hard 15 years ago but I think people will have much troubles with the crazy 2019 savage pvp that will occur in some days/weeks.
---
Anyways, I don‚Äôt have that much time nowadays and prefer enjoying the WoW exp√©rience on a PVE server.
---
Are you cooked? Its world first he did not cheat it‚Äôs apart of the game who cares about previous world first vanilla back then Joanna still no 1 this is now shits changed .
---
Seems an awful lot of people on reddit and in-game decided to base their whole playing experience on shitting on retail WoW, instead of just enjoying Classic.
---
Jokerd - 3 days and 7 hours /played -60
---
Me -   4 days and 2 hours /queued -22
---
Heck im willing to spend 2g right now!
---
cringe
---
I was messing around with a priest in the Barrens, talking shit about Orcs with him. He said he was gonna go to Org and check out the AH cause he was out of stuff to do in the Barrens and didn‚Äôt want to get too far ahead of his friends.
---
I paid him to be my pocket healer for a couple hours. We just wandered around killing shit and questing while we /moo‚Äôed at all those disgusting green pigmen.
---
This doesn‚Äôt solve the problem or make it go away.  Can‚Äôt ignore the nazis in real life when they come knocking.... this shit needs to be called out.
---
Look in iron forge for expert tailoring
---
I enjoy PvP servers for the thrill and organic interactions that come up, but it does suck when you get ganked while taking on two mobs.. which has already happened to me twice. Some people have no honor
---
No stool holds such power.
---
Wich add-on are you using for the class colors in chat?
---
Fuck the slavery that is work
---
Rogue in WC: have you tanked before?
---
Warrior: do you have a threat meter?
---
These are not children, these are grown men who believe these things hiding behind an edge lord persona to recruit new at risk individuals.
---
Yes. 
---
 Between portal, Anal, Dirge, Thunderfury, guild etc spam you occasionally can occasionally get trade content. 
---
Also don‚Äôt expect to go into WoW and not get whatever the latest TV show spoiled, it‚Äôs as bad or worse than going on Reddit or social media.

---
They should write a rule and make an example of him is what im saying
---
Hopefully the release of classic will reinvigorate them in a way that will allow the to crate more meaningful content for wow retail
---
It was at this moment that he knew...
---
He fucked up.
---
Ah, the great outdoors!
---
You can kite any mob as long as you keep attacking them
---
Gotta gank someone 4 levels beneath you to assert dominance
---
I just made a macro to target him and use Fire Blast but I was a way lower level than the elite so it resisted
---
This has been a real thrill so far. Of course, something terrible happened: I rolled horde on a server with one group of friends and then another group of friends rolled alliance on the same server. Is there anything I can do to play with both?
---
I play the game, thoroughly enjoy my time with it and have absolutely no investment in some dude getting World First. It makes absolutely no difference to my life.
---
There was a priest and warr duo tagging my mobs so I buffed int on the warr
---
Sorry mate but if you are 18 at this point, it has nothing to do with being an adult. You take your time, and that's great, but even with a job you should be able to be around 28-30.
---
My friends and I have been taking our dayoffs this week and we are perfectly normal adults with mortgages, cars and families. It's just a question of priorities.
---
I'm sad that you feel this pressure, just relax and fo it in your own pace.
---
Proud of a gank or proud of someone willing to depopulate the game he likes in order to make it less playable ?
---
Yes, layer hopping is kind of cheesy. With that said, it is part of the games mechanics and therefore is not cheating. Honestly, I'm not even sure why you care. I personally still find Joanas record more impressive as he hadn't had 20+ runs prior. That, in no way, takes away from what this guy did. Layer hopping or not, it was quite impressive.
---
Imagine giving this much of a shit
---
Did you call her mom?
---
I know right
---
Me too brother!
---
Yep. I‚Äôm a hunter. Been playing since 2005 and played a hunter through Wrath. Since then, up until Legion, I‚Äôve mained a different class every expansion, but usually gone back to my hunter towards the end of every expansion until the next one.
---
Nothing just clicks for me except hunter. Not sure why. We catch so much shit, especially in vanilla, for being stupid (mostly due to poor pet ai/pathing issues), for being the laziest class, the easiest to level, all the while having the least bag space due to ammo, having to restock on ammo very often, having to manage our pets behavior, skills, feeding it, healing it, etc.
---
But what really gets me about being a hunter is never really being alone. When I‚Äôm solo leveling or questing or exploring, I‚Äôve always got a pet with me. Warlocks do to, but an animal Is a little more relatable obviously than a demon.
---
I‚Äôm glad you found that one class that clicks with you. Idk how my friends change to fotm classes every other patch it seems.
---
So two people rolled 100, how does it determine who gets it then?
---
The reason I can't play Horde is because I just love the Alliance cities more.
---
/console SET chatClassColorOverride "0" -- turn on class colours
---
Type that in chat
---
Valid, but...monkey see, monkey do. When I saw streamers plugging away to level cap the fastest way possible, I wondered about the rest of the system. Not gonna put a number on it, but, a lot of people in the beta probably weren't that familiar with vanilla. Hell, I played it like a job back then, and I'm still blown away by how basic it actually was. 
---
A point OP was trying to make, that I agree with, is that there are a lot of minor bugs that had been worked out by 1.12. Beta and alpha testing should be used to find and fix those bugs, and not conquering a temporary realm.
---
So your major problem is with layering, and he should be banned. By that logic everyone on retail that does this for rare camping and  collecting herbs/ores should be banned aswell? Or just focus on your own game as this effects you in no way possible, if your where pushing for world first you might have a case. But your just salty for the sake of it.
---
Someone in elwynn on the westfall server said they were the zamboni of the forest, cleaning up all the corpses haha
---
@OP Hi I'm with the grobbulus gazette (www.thegrobbulusgazette.com) and would love to cover this story in our meta section - would you mind if I wrote about this in our paper? 
---
And if you wouldn't mind that, then would you want to give us a brief interview (we know you guys are busy with leveling probably, it really would be brief) on our discord or just a few questions sent through Reddit? Thanks either way! It's a great story! :)
---
Exactly that! You can be popular, have friends to quest, run dungeons, pvp, raids and have fun, or you can be a toxic scumbag who slowly digs his/her way into lonelyness. Maybe even forcing an internal intervention and become a beter person. 
---
Also a fun fact. I learned a great deal of my writing in english by playing vanilla in my childhood. I was talking to everyone and the comunity was great. In bfa and several prequels, it felt weird to "bother people" with a question. Also, you do nothing realy together as you do in here. All for yourself and be gone before saying bye to the group and before the last boss hits te ground. (Talking about bfa) In vanilla we say thanks, give some loot if you felt "to lucky" away and put people in friendlists to run some later again.
---
I have a full time job too in a big enterprise (IT department), demanding job with often overtime, so I can only play Classic as a casual.
---
It is absolutely very enjoyable, since it's a game designed to be played at your own pace, there are no forced dailies nor time gated stuff so you won't miss out on anything by not doing stuff every single day, you'll just progress slower, but that's fine.
---
As long as you don't mind not being able to raid or to play PVP competitively, you'll have a blast, there's lot of stuff to do even if you don't raid and the community is amazing.
---
Not according to Blizzard's rules on naming. Especially on an RP realm.
---
Is blacklisting just adding them to your ignore list? So far I haven't touched any addons, and I'd rather not start with one for dealing with annoying people.
---
Dude this is not Vanilla. No one can take the fastest lvler title in Vanilla away from Joana. But this is classic wow with layering, it is what it is man. 
---
And you don't think he could have practiced his lvling route in his sparetime? Why do you asume he have taken a month off work to do so?
---
This guy has years of experience from private servers, getting server first 60 on Elysium and lights hope (i believe it was). And yes the human buddy can stay awake for 80hours hours, but this guy even slept.
---
And who the fuck do you think you are, saying this guy is ruining his life doing this? He can choose to live his life as he chooses. Get off your high horse
---
[So you say](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/428/075/30a.jpeg)---You'd be surprised how low people will go when they've got a chip on their shoulder and an axe to grind---Especially when it's something that most people won't put a second thought into.
---
it has no impact on the game? look at reddit lol
---
Happy cake day!
---
ü§î
---
Hf with two costs then xd
---
World first (west) or world first (east)?
---
Hell I‚Äôd like to be able to log in
---
the only one butthurt is you over ppl afk macroing, i have no problems getting in your just sugarcoating your own way of bypassing the system
---
Now this is how I always done it and how both me as warrior and priest I perfer to do it, you milage may vary;
---
Trash mobs that are heavy cced or low damge don't shield just heal.
---
Trash mobs that hit hard cast two heals then start to shielding.
---
Normal bosses one heal then shield.
---
Hard bosses shield before pull.
---
Yeah I wanted to provide a possible explenation. But don't really have one. Guess entertainment is different for everyone though so what you and me don't find entertaining might be the best thing ever for someone else.
---
changing to full affliction helped me. just go succ as pet and dot things up fear it and wand.
---
I ducked up my talents and had to Respec fuck me
---
Ahh, okay I will prepare myself for that kind o reaction then :) One more question; any class that is *easier* than others for the begginner?
---
Official, I'm on Whitemane.
---
Shamen and priests make a good Comp with warriors
---
Yes, In the battle net launcher, the two games are separate.
---
It was impossible on launch anyway
---
I think it's the fact that it takes people off the ground to somewhere they're not interacting with the world and people as much. It's not as bad as dungeon finder but it's a step away from being a community.
---
I got told "to go fuck myself." For not auto joining a spam guild invite.
---
Lol dude needs to get a grip
---
How has a guy you'll never play with doing something that you were never going to do impacted your experience playing the game?
---
SLURM\* !!
---
I assume you're joking, but if not: Congrats, nobody is ever going to want to play with you
---
125+
---
Level 10 is a terrible representation of a warrior and warlock. 
---
Sadly paladin plays the same til 60. Buff then judgement then autoattack til dead. Heal as needed.
---
Same. But with professions, and a commission to a tailor for bags, I left Stormwind with exactly 7 copper.
---
He gave you all his trash lol
---
The way a mage aoe levels like that, you just need to land a single gouge or something and they will die to all the mobs.
---
no it isnt when the game is less than week old he played for 80 hours in 1 sitting.
---
thats pretty accurate to me!
---
Yeah, the game is a lot more relaxing when I know I can go to an area to do quests without having to constantly look over my shoulder or worry about roaming horde parties gang banging me. I should have made the switch years ago.
---
No thanks bro, 9/10 "Modern" games suck big balls
---
Any quest that has proven not worth the XP I‚Äôve dropped and moved on. However, the quest for harpies in I don‚Äôt even remember with so little sleep made me so mad that I wanted to rage. I want that mad since pre nerf muru.
---
you're a moron
---
Don‚Äôt Worry Mate, I can tell you where to find Nat Pagle, on second thought I'll leave you on your little isle.

This, gotta love ppl dissing ppl who dont want to get ganked at 5% health cuz its "thrilling"

hop on my stream im running  sm 10 man atm i can give you info on tanking if u want
---
Don't worry /u/beefthathasredmiddle, I know you're a loser with no friends but you don't have to make posts like this crying on reddit about it
---
Second place is first loser.
---
I can‚Äôt even take full credit for this one, my friend who loves futurama suggested it
---
ok so why are you in a thread about world first, clearly the community cares about it when they shouldn't.
---
Not even to you.
---
Why didn't the warrior cross the road?
---
No path available.
---
Don't be silly.  Most of method is still crawling their way up around level 40.  At this point, I think even I have them too much credit.
---
Oh shit, you're right. Well played blizzard, well played.
---
he used it. Who cares about anything else. You don't know he didnt layer swap before 58 you didn't watch.
---
Ahhh blind. Too bad the creator only made this one video
---
I heard they were going to re-roll BC back in as long as the popularity was there, and I think it will be there. Most likely we just have to hope that the streamers continue to stream it with biggish numbers and the core group remains playing. Then I think we'll be set to see at least BC rolled back in.
---
I, uh, don't think you linked the right subreddit there buddy
---
This was a thing that would happen literally [every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRcEa1sIHEw) [single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg-t87xX5rY) [time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zj9cdpQOU2Q) during some TBC patch. I think 2.3 or 2.4.
---
He account shared with his brother off stream while he was sleeping. Pure hard work so proud &lt;3
---
I personally choose to reroll to a server I can play on without queues. Sure, there is a risk it could be dead eventually, but at least I get to play when I want to and I‚Äôm not staring at a queue. 
---
I suspect Blizzard will either do realm merges or allow transfers if it gets bad.
---
Winning the lottery doesn't make you smart.
---
If you‚Äôre scared it going to die, or just want a more pop realm. Just switch. I don‚Äôt understand these questions. It‚Äôs an mmo. It‚Äôs not a race or anything. Play with friends and have fun.
---
Melee 2h hunters are a thing. If you check surv spec you get some crazy crit chance on an instant 2h cast.
---
I agree I would actually be down for letting a character have two specs they can change between, maybe with like an hour cooldown, just so I dont have to decide if i want this character to pvp or pve.
---
went judgement :)) I figure when blizz adds free transfers there gonna be a lot of people here too
---
til then its ez leveling Im not fighting anyone over mobs
---
My man uwu
---
*‚ÄùWORLDS FIRST LEVEL 60‚Äù*
---
Uhh ..
---
Any news on Joanna?
---
what is layering?  you can switch servers to respawn a camp or something?
---
Don't call him "2nd world first",
---
just call him "world second" ;)
---
Let me tell you as a beta player.... what you saw on your streams while yelling kappa and peggers with the other short bus riders was not the beta. Its ppl playing for content on a beta server... its a warped incorrect view...sure we participated in some streamer events. But there were reasons beta was dead at the end for the most of us it was a test
---
Your context comes from a small minority wich pull all the light... but your opinion about streamer beta or play not test is wrong and rather offending because of it towards the 2700ish ppl of wich all summited bugs and reports
---
Also trust me most if not almost all played vanilla except maby some streamers.but thats free marketing
---
Flying killed the last bit of world pvp though. I wouldn‚Äôt mind them adding tbc, but not flying.
---
Ideally they keep the level cap at 60, but have the tbc raids provide new spells (lifebloom comes to mind) 
---
The quest reward gear should be on par with mc/bwl gear. That way none of the pre-tbc raids are rendered completely useless, but there is a catch up mechanic. + they could fix some of the issues with the itemization (boomkin, ret pally, survival hunter, etc)
---
They could also add talents, and have quest chains and dungeon bosses provide the talent points.
---
I looked for one briefly yesterday and couldn‚Äôt find one. So, I‚Äôm interested in this too.
---
OwO
---
You've been taking days off, to play wow, and you're level 28... Exactly my point. You could have taken those days off to take care of your kids or take your family on vacation but instead you wasted it on world of warcraft.... which is exactly my point.... lol
---
Private servers are illegal that has been known forever you moron.
---
Joana still hold the title of fastest vanilla 1-60. Jokerd has the title for WoW Classic run. You need to calm the fuck down. This is a mechanic blizz implemented. You can scold people for using everything to their advantage. It happened on every world first max level run. Grow up
---
lol wtf gives you that impression?
---
the idea is fucking retarded and unviable, it has nothing to do with "work: reward" lol
---
but go ahead and make assumptions about me IRL lol...
---
Met a handful of great people because of this today, thanks to my guild
---
Well they tell the stuff we get for like 4x higher price.
---
What is over? I don't get it.
---
You have to remember that loot will usually cause discourse in groups as well, I mean even when watching people play in groups online there's always the occassional clash because of everyone needing the same piece. Definitely something to keep in mind.
---
Our guild moved off Herod after the first day and we're so happy we did.
---
I can't believe people still wait in q to play lol
---
Clearly it matters to you or you wouldn't click a thread about it you lying idiot.
---
Make a bank alt.
---
I've been playing with classic graphics (the only external thing that I turn up is af for sharpness and clarity) but damn does it still hold up quite well I was shocked
---
Especially when you up the Digital Vibrance option in the Nvidia cards, it looks fantastic
---
Yeah but you have to trade your soul for a mount..
---
Well deserved.  Not sure how you considered that to be a name anyway.
---
Yes they should be banned and they have been banned before.
---
I agree it's not *that* much harder than other classes. However, 1-17 is hardly indicative of how easy or hard any classes are to level.
---
Im all over the professor plums
---
Today I reached level 10 on my first classic character on Herod, Tauren warrior named Thiccnorris. I have more fun leveling to 10 just for the simple fact that I grouped up with 1-3 people about 4 times for quests that we were all on, we all killed stuff together and gave each other a good ‚Äúthanks bro‚Äù after and parted ways. This is the old WoW, not 100% because of the gameplay, but because of the community of people helping each other out and relying on each other. Classic is love
---
I know right? If only everyone was on the same side but there was real open PVP. But blizzard knows the player base is too casual for that so they had to make people choose a team to be on.
---
I don't want to insult them , but they must enjoy the punishment.
---
Literally having the most fun hating my life right now.
---
Oh man, I love these kind of bugs. I remember during... BC I think? I was on my Alliance alt and somehow, I fell through the world and landed on top of a building in OGRIMMAR of all places, and I didn't die. I was so shocked, I wish I had kept the screencaps I took.
---
Bagnon and Quartz are both working. Installed using the Twitch client from curseforge.
---
The population is already dropping and Blizzard correctly predicted this which is why we have inauthentic layering.
---
I thought he was Australian and that they had everyone on the show calling him British as a joke.
---
well, when you post something on the anniversary of the day you made your reddit account, a cake icon is placed neext to your account name on your post. So cake day is like your reddit birthday, I guess.
---
I'm pretty sure I'm world first to die cause I was distracted watching Forged in Fire
---
I don't assume he took a month off, I know he did look at his stream history before just lying. You should not be 20 years old living with your parents, let alone not having a job so you can play world of warcraft for 80 hours (still impossible without drugs) straight.
---
look in your WTF folder and find 'saved variables'
---
delete any mods in that folder that you dont use..or just delete the whole folder and when you relaunch the game will create a new folder. You'll lose all you're settings for addons though it should fix your problem
---
Didnt the 1.12 version still lasted for hours (instead of days)?  Not exactly current version of speedy AV I thought
---
And if you absolutely have to at least wait for the target to get to me so I can even try to gen threat, so many groups I've been in whenever I try to pull from afar go absolutely bonkers before the enemy even gets into my melee range. Almost makes me regret trying to pull from afar sometimes. Also please for the love of god don't run ahead and pull. I try to be understanding because some people may just not know better but wow it's a bit stressful trying to compete with heals and dps over who gets to tank, lmao.
---
Doesn't look like he abused layers OR shared the account.
---
He should be considered the real world first.
---
Congratulations!
---
Absolutely. The game itself isn‚Äôt actually great but the fact that it forces player interaction due to the lack of convenience that retail has creates the environment for those who want social interactions in the game.
---
9 hours of sleep in four days ..
---
For someone who account shared and never went offline in 4 days, his final time is quite slow.
---
I like the implication that Sneed himself isn't a commander, no no, his _shredder_ is a commander.
---
Never even played an MMORPG before, but I‚Äôm loving it!
---
I believe you spent 15% more good by training from the cenarion circle. The same with warlock trainers in Barrens
---
Just because it's part of the game doesn't make it not cheating moron.
---
You are the gift of Classic
---
Oof. Clicker detected.
---
the Troll /dance video
---
AW DUDE. 4 STR 4 STAM LEATHER BELT AAHHHHH OUHHHHH
---
It is cheating. You can cheat within the limits of the game. If I'm playing checkers and I push your pieces off the board randomly thats cheating, but its possible within the limits of the game you moron.
---
They're from cenarion circle, means you don't get the reputation discount.
---
Ok, thanks for the advice, i think my first character will be a night elf druid or an undead demo
---
I personally still see it all the time. You don't get a lot of random buffs anymore because they took most of them out, but if they added them back it would still happen. Even to this day, I don't think I've ever passed by a random priest without getting Fortitude. 
---
Same with random heals. Not a lot of reasons to play a healer while you're out and about, but back in Legion when you pretty much had to do all your content in your main spec, healers would always do drive-by heals. Even when I'm Retribution, if I see someone low on health I'll throw a Flash of Light on them.
---
Classic is different because a lot of the content relied on people working together, but I don't think it's really fair to say that it's gone from the game. Its still there when it counts.
---
you know some people take vacations for that?
---
Why is everyone here pretending that they weren't part of the problem. I'd bet good money a lot of the people here praising classic are the same people who helped turn retail's community into a pile of toxic shit. Retail didnt make you all toxic jerk offs incapable of being polite or helpful. The majority of you did that yourselves. Retail didn't make you snub the fuck out of everyone with Raider.IO, that shit is you, you know who you are out there. I'm giving it 2 months before a ton of people are 60 and turn back into the same assholes they were on retail.
---
If you feed them and then wait for the feeding buff to go away before feeding again, it should only take 4-5 pieces to get max happiness.
---
Hmm ill have to look again. I didn't see that option but someone else told me about it as well. Thanks
---
The graphics ARE upgraded from original Vanilla

Not the triple dot...

Yeah, I love this! Only once have I been screamed at for asking noob questions, "Go back to retail!" they scream
---
No, they shouldnt. If you get some, you get a bunch. Each and every one of them moves closer to retail. And each and every one or them moves closer to affecting the game.
---
This is what Blizzard for years didnt get and its what people still dont get. It isnt 1 thing. It is the collection of things that make the game what it is.
---
If you add 2 qol mechanic you end up with a bunch. Now that is a big change and who draws the line and when?

You don't know anything about me retard.

Sneaking in a mind blast to snag a killing blow is essential for dungeon healing!
---
I mean they aren't mutually exclusive.

I guess that is how it is for hybrid classes like druid as well! but that doesnt mean you can only play dungeons, they are very useful outside of dungeons and if you dont mind being 2nd or 3rd dmg then I guess it wouldnt bother ya

Isn't it load from blizzard servers? Because I removed whole WTF and my keybindigs were still there.

My favourite way to level warlocks is deep affli, using my imp after level 40. Just keep the imp in phase shift, and use him as a mana battery. Tank everything yourself using drain life. You can pull multiple mobs, DoT them all up, drain life them down, pretty much constantly keeping your HP full, and use Dark Pact to get mana back. Found it to be a lot of fun and extremely efficient. Even against 3 mobs my health would stay full with Drain Life and Siphon Life on every mob.

---
Top kek. (=
---
Only having played shaman in my classic days (got to lvl 53 grinding (dying) mobs in plaguelands, playing a priest feels so right. I always throw up renews and heals and fortitude and I have received SO much appreciation. I really love this game and the people playing it.
---
Thank you for this explanation
---
I was planning to run my NElf hunter alt down to the Troll island off of Durotar to tame a tiger.
---
How fucked will I be?
---
Thanks so much for this - just found it off google and wanted to say tks.
---
I meant the ones that say something like ‚Äòoh, I‚Äôve heard about you! You‚Äôre that savior of the blah blah etc.‚Äô which definitely happens in winterspring and maybe Desolace that I can think of off the top of my head.

You probably just looked like a Catalan nationalist.

r/HiddenMemes
---
Just showed this one to a friend the other night
---
Its both awesome to do, and to be the recipient.üòÅ
---
I just hang back and drink for mana when that happens. If you die it's your own fault.
---
Die and resurrect? ...
---
I cant believe I believed people when they told me tailoring would be good money in classic, here I am making free bags and shit..
---
Yeah I'm leaning on either lock or warrior
---
Mage: Mana. Constantly drinking
---
pro: I make my own water
---
Ok and? If he wasn't a loser in his parents house he could have taken a vacation with his family using that time... my point still stands.
---
Your choice of words was fucked up
---
What a god awful take.
---
I play a ne druid myself so I'm kinda bias. They are a lot of fun but you can't go wrong with anything undead for pvp.
---
And?
---
Has not been updated yet. Developer said he‚Äôs working on it
---
People really only RP in the cities. Also, according to the rules set by Blizzard, you don't even have to engage in RP on an RP realm, you just have to not disturb those that are. Pretty much all interactions outside of /s and /y are going to be OOC.
---
I also have the same feeling when you're a Hunter just trying to stay at a range where you can use ranged abilities, then that other dps gets aggro and decides to run to you instead of letting tank take it back. Thanks mate, I always wanted to spam Raptor Strike or keep trying to predict the direction you're gonna panic run it to.
---
Oh well, plenty of girls out there, but there's just 1 Classic.
---
How are they abusing layering?
---
But they're irrelevant regardless, lol. The only thing you can do is kill each other, and there's nothing on the line there. They don't drop; you don't lose yours, you can really only inconvenience each other and waste each other's time. So why bother?
---
I know that you‚Äôre a toxic moron who reproduced with a fat whale and the apple never falls far from the tree.
---
Then what? It's too far to dismiss and you can't call it to you, you can only run away and hope it dismisses itself, but you'd need to get pretty far away.
---
Lock is significantly easier to level. Both perform well endgame.
---
What if I thought the comic was shit?
---
that one stamina though
---
I made a friend on the flight back to TB after we both got bear form at the same time. Hey there fatfreemilk if you see this!
---
Being popular, and knowing the animations from a specific unit of a specific race are not the same (imo).
---
I don't know if I'd call it obscure but it's definitely not common knowledge.
---
For now yes you are right.
---
But many people find it appealing to be on a ultra full server just to have all the options possible.
---
Noice.
---
F, and noice.
---
Not a bug. How are you so thick you can't understand that? Go back to retail you fucking reject
---
First an anvil (I think if this was the only thing added it would be okay but how could it be?), then quest icons. Now you dont need to look around for quests. Next we got a quest helper so you no longer need a mod, and all the people playing without one now dont explore. 
---
Next we add mount tabs. Then similiar. Now your bag space is free. Its no longer sacred. Getting bigger bags is no longer an achievement and an accomplishment. Is it that important? No but its one of many things that makes classic what it is. Because now bag space isnt crucial and youre no longer juggling it so this part of the game is removed.
---
Next Transmog is added. Why not? It doesnt change any mechanics it simply makes cosmetic changes. Now theres no reason to get the rest of a set staring you in the face at all times.
---
Next comes portals. Great, now we dont have to travel between cities manually! Quality of life improved.
---
Whoops now we got flying mounts. Now we just fly our mounts everywhere.
---
"Shit, theyve just announced the first expansion for Classic, were moving straight into Battle for Azeroth. How did this game get so unfun?"
---
Regardless, the idea isnt to make classic as easy and polished as it can be. It is to replay the game exactly as it was in legend. And that is it.
---
Yeah I find that only very secure people have to tell strangers on the internet how successful they are.
---
Grob? Saw a human warrior about this level same name tonight!
---
When I can I try to charge in -&gt; blood rage -&gt; thunderclap then switch stance to defensive and start tab sundering.
---
Keep demo shout up also helps.
---
You'll never be able to change pet ever again
---
cool projecting sorry your life sucks loser this post was calling our Jokerd but maybe it should include you in the title too loser hahahhaa
---
Oh noes a typo,better correct peoples gramma. 
---
I totally do, if i was 20 years of age living at home i would be playing 20 hours a day aswell
---
Noob detected. Back to retail
---
Yet here you are...
---
NEVER EAT SHREDDED WHEAT
---
The game design of retail does make you anti-social. I could write a damn paper about why that is but I don't think you'd be interested in reading it. But from a game designer's perspective, the way an MMO is designed will actually "mold" the way players interact, and while it won't affect everyone to the same degree, overall it has a noticeable psychological impact.
---
Guy walked passed me in gold shire and gave me my first green for my warrior and just walked off
---
What addon are you using that allows you to see his total health points and percentage?
---
Hah, the irony is that in PoE, the most powerful builds probably look like crap without mtx because rares are optimal, not uniques like in WoW.
---
So the loot system itself doesn't work for favouring a cosmetic game.
---
The Ninja looting offsets the cost but thanks for your concern &gt;!noob!&lt;
---
Ok?
---
I use it with a swing timer for my hunter. It turns on automatically on new characters unless you turn it off.
---
No need to call me an idiot mate, we're all friends here
---
I got my brother in law in, and he‚Äôs hooked now.  He‚Äôs always too busy to do anything, but this week, ever since the first night, he‚Äôs texting me every night right at my kids‚Äô bedtime, ‚ÄúWhen are you getting on?‚Äù
---
What‚Äôs making that even more fun for me, I‚Äôve never leveled an undead, a priest, or a warrior, so we‚Äôre both learning everything about that stuff together, while I can teach him some of the basics.  He‚Äôs the warrior, and we‚Äôve just hit level 7, so soon I‚Äôll have to sit him down and teach him multi-target tanking.
---
And I‚Äôm able to confirm ... threat is definitely dps‚Äô responsibility to manage.  You break it; you bought it.
---
Who talks about the stream title? If anyone would have invested a little efford to watch their preparation, they would know that MC was their plan and 60 would be just a bonus. 
---
"Twitch stream tittle is my source" hope those people aren't invested in science or journalism.
---
Dude wtf normal people who have jobs and family wont be at lvl 30 by now when they dont get off of work lol.
---
Its more like the average people are in between lvl 15-20 atm.
---
Just chill down and get off the game a few days and you may see stv packed with people like you want it.
---
I believe it can be done in Brill
---
I understand that. I simply find it more appealing to play when I have time to play. 
---
What do you find more appealing?
---
I am secure. It proves my point. Meanwhile you have a little bedroom you've lived in your entire life, single, probably unemployed or working a retail job, pathetic... You should honestly be barred from talking to me u slime
---
For extra context. We had to pick up a random for BFD since it was getting late and some dps friends were getting off. Grabbed a warrior that talked about smoking a doobie, AFK'd for the run in, and had another dps on follow. Then he repeatedly went afk mid fight for 70% of the dungeon. He later blamed it on his computer lagging, and then his mouse.
---
This repeated for many more fights so I finally kicked him and then he blamed it on his son and called us sweats.
---
I like being sneaky. I like to sneak up on mobs and horde players and take them by surprise. I like to be able to bypass crowds to get to things I want, like ores or chests. I like to enter dungeons and pick all the mobs' pockets to earn money, pick locks in doors, etc. 
---
I also love the fast pace of dungeon combat. I'm more used to playing ranged DPS (mainly warlock and mage), and now playing as a rogue it's so much more fun. Having to actually move around, running from mob to mob, chasing down runners, etc. As a caster you just stand completely still pressing one button.
---
What I don't like so much is that I feel a pressure to roll as human. I have gone gnome this time, but I'm constantly feeling like perhaps I'm gimping myself when it comes to pve. Which is ridiculous because I'm not going to be a hardcore raider, so most guilds I'm looking to play with would probably have no issues with recruiting a gnome.
---
He kills a bunch of mobs, gets invited to a new layer which still has the mobs alive, rinse and repeat, so he doesn‚Äôt have to wait for respawns
---
Really it's an advantage only a streamer with fans can manage
---
I don't remeber how the deep the lava is there, but can't you drown?
---
My first character in vanilla was a hunter.  I got him to level 14 (no, really).  Then I made a warrior, and in retrospect I somehow did a damn fine job of twinking him at 29 for bgs.  I'm like 3 months in to the game at this point, and decide to move on in levels.  Got 30, got berserker stance, and immediately just kinda got over it.  
---
Made another hunter, got him to 40 or so.  Now I'm 4 or 5 months in.  It was fine, but I still didn't really know if it was what I wanted.  
---
So then I rolled a druid.  It was the worst experience of the three until level 20.  After getting cat form, however, the game was forever changed for me.  Stuck with the class for 6 years.  Druid is fucking awesome in vanilla and TBC.  Leveling is cake.  I can't even describe how good it feels going from dps to offtank to offheals to dps all in one big messy disaster of a pull.  The innervate, growl, rebirth, or tranquility that keeps the group from wiping...  It's good, man.  
---
Not everyone should play a druid, but everyone should try a druid.  4 or 5 days is  nothing, and level 14 is nothing.  I don't necessarily reccomend you take 8 months to level, but I do think you should try everything until you find the class that fits.  I promise one of them does.
---
I heard that if u log out in dungeon u will not have queve .. so maybe those are logging in 
---
And then there are some dissconnect waves and and u have 10min to log back on
---
pathetic thats what you aspire to.. wow no wonder I get downvoted when the average redditor envys a jobless stay at home loser.
---
Increases can occur due to disconnected players reconnecting within the grace period, but that big of a jump seems strange.
---
I use Prat3 for a chat addon. It will color the player names based in class. It has a ton of other tweaks too.
---
BING BONG BING BONG BING BONG
---
This. *This* is why I play.
---
You are what makes classic great.
---
It's a bug. Do you think blizzard wants people to swap to respawn mobs? No.
---
IF they did why isn't there a button on my screen to do it whenever I want?
---
I really have to know, is doing this/getting into airfield/wetlands farm/behind stormwind a bannable offense? I can't remember if that's something blizz punished for anymore and while I'd like to try again the thought kinda worries me
---
Teleport spells teleport you.

Portal spells make a portal for your party or raid to use.

People don't want to watch their favorite streamers run SM over and over for 48 hrs straight.

That‚Äôs fuckin hilarious

not only interested because the import but also because gatherlite doesn't add the node to your tracklist unless you can gather it :(

Uh, it's actually nothing like PvP on release because he was 10 levels higher than ANYONE else, the only reason he got ganked at all was because people deliberately snipes him right before 60. I don't think he encountered any meaningful PvP at all outside of people realising he's about to be 60
---
So what you do is stack players (or beg your stream viewers) to go to a area and join then leave a party with them. What this does is pull you into another layer in a way not intended or designed so that you now have all the mobs again. This allows you to farm much more mobs than designed by the developers. 
---
Layering was added because Blizzard knows a large size of the hype launch will die out leaving many low populated servers. This mechanic allows them to pack many more players into each server, the layers are dynamic with server load.
---
Haha dude gtfo. You get downvotes because you are a stuck-up little bitch crying on reddit
---
"new" games get a lot of views, BFA had a lot of people watching at the start, the longer the game is out less people will be watching
---
Troll detected, back to the playground with the other 10 year olds.

some of us are just very emotional and need alot of support to function. that is the way of life.

Damn it was bound to happen. Get spam asdon anyone mentions layering will be muted.

Maybe different on other servers but Light Leather on Shazzrah EU has been selling on the AH for just a few copper over vendor price, so you actually lose money by selling on AH due to the 5% tax.

Plus i think honeymoon period is over, people had their fill and just stopped watching, same as queues, even if servers capacity haven't increased queue would be shorter.

lvl 29 here still spaming lesser healing. I hope they got time on their hand, because I aint pulling out the big heals for the first hit.

The game doesn't turn people into an asshole though... you can be anti social without being a huge prick. Raider.IO for example gave people an excuse to treat others like total garbage, and they reveled in that shit. Yet here they are playing classic acting like 2 weeks ago they weren't the assholes they claim ruined the community...

Did you ever stop to ask why instead of assuming that people just want to get high? I assume not from your tone. Not every problem can be seen on the outside. Be a little more open minded.
---
Not. A. Bug. It works as intended, people are just abusing it. Fucking Moron get off my screen.
---
So why is it wrong to use it to avoid streamsnipers who want to ruin his day?
---
40 mount is a quest that just sends you to ghe barrens to talk to a guy (alliance) dont know for hordes but guess similar
---
Sounds like Blizzard needs to open new servers instead of more layers
---
Your acceptance of graphics is interesting. Watching streams, I paid a lot of attention to terrain reflections. I (sort of) remember when I started playing WoW on a new computer and there were reflections from ice that I hadn't seen on my old computer, and it looked so much better.
---
As to whether a game with "bad graphics" can become popular, I guess we should have remembered Minecraft.

Especially later on I think. You don't wanna be the guy infamous for ninja looting in raids or scamming people

When I started visited the internet in 1995 I was 6 years old.
---
Removal of world elites is kind of an affirmative action for low pop servers where in some zones and at some times you can hardly find anybody around. If those mobs remain elite, low level players can never complete the quests by their own. However, lv 60 elites like those in Winterspring and Blasted Land are fine. No problem with those when you're already geared and most other people are already lv60.
---
Ah OK thank you :D
---
hype going down to normal
---
Where do you store all that leather?
---
yeah i think queues are ruining for alot of players.
---
Maybe some helpful advice: Use BindPad (it's ported for classic) and set up a bunch of macros for your Numpadkeys since they're not used for anything else. You can do this just normal macros if you'd rather not use an addon, but it'll eat up a lot of your available slots.
---
    /run DoEmote(SecureCmdOptionParse"[mod:alt]BYE;HELLO")
---
I keep this on NumPadZero. Hitting it greets people. Hitting Alt+it waves goodbye. It's nice because while WASD moving around you can hit alt and quickly tap Zero with your mouse hand thumb to wave goodbye. I have all the other numpad keys using similar Main/Alt macros with all the different emotes (laugh/cry, point/beckon, yes/no, whistle/kiss, helpme/flee, cheer/rude, etc).
---
A friend of mine alwas saig, that he really would like to try WoW biut its too big and advanced. But if he ever get the chance to play from the root he would try it. Guess who's playing now!

I honestly thought it was fun. I never watch azmon for his "content" but for him.

Thank you, where can I get this?

I think the respawn system is fantastic.

I was going to commend you for providing proof but man, you just had to follow it up with veiled insults didn't you

ahh yeah makes sense. tobad thought was fun to see it hit 1 million views. first game i've ever seen to go that high

The more you pay, the more uncomfortable is the trip
---
let's hope it stays at a decent level =)
---
I'm sure someone would give you a spare weapon to earn some copper if you ask, I've been given random bits of loot out of the blue a few times now.
---
Beat me to it. Jesus
---
The condescending tone was intentional. I commend your attempt, but if you think it's going to do anything then it's nothing more than childish naivety. "Insults" as used above have been turned into memes over extensive use on websites such as 4chan and reddit, which obviously share a very large portion of their community with gaming as well. It's commonly understood that they're not meant as a way to spread hatred against handicapped people when used in this context. Used in real life and behind a screen makes a big difference as well.
---
As well as, considering we're on the classic wow subreddit... Wow has had a very (in)famous video called "Onyxia Raid Wipe." While it's an extreme example, it's not uncommon for you to encounter insults in this game. Or, gaming in general. The most popular games of the past few years such as Overwatch and LoL are notorious for their toxic community.
---
If you gasped at "retard" and "autist" then the shit you encounter on your journey in Classic WoW will give you nightmares for weeks. Online gaming communities are not for those that can't handle a little bit of abusive language every now and again.
---
Either get used to it, or this just isn't the place for you. And I say this with utmost sincerity. It sucks that it's like this... But there really isn't any realistic way you can deal with it other than realizing they're nothing but words on a screen said by some 12 year old somewhere across the world, and moving on with your life.
---
How much time spent on cooking preparing meals?
---
I love getting randomly buffed
---
I actually like that idea. To keep it from being too much of a Tower in the Clouds to new players wanting to hit the "last raid" you could have an attunement of sorts for the TBC raids, and it gives a rank of Lifebloom for example that is 1 below max. So you have it by doing 5 mana, but you can't just buy the max rank off the AH like you could AQ tomes, you have to kill the bosses.
---
This would make me homicidal.
---
I play tauren because warstomp and horde because I dislike the alliance aesthetic, however purely based on race+zone+class flavour I would always roll night elf druid
---
Guess people forgot about that one time blizzard killed classic.
---
Priest !
---
Don‚Äôt both the class mounts cost a boat load in mats and a long ass quest chain though?
---
Then don't pick a server with a filthy streamer.
---
Or you can run to the nearest body of water and swim away.

We need free character transfer immediately. People need to get off Shazzrah and Firemaw. Well 5k queues before noon, above 12k evenings

I've never (properly) played WoW before and Classic is one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had.

 You should. Just because there wasn't penetration doesn't mean you aren't a prostitute now.

You started with the word ‚Äúcasual.‚Äù  First rule of casual, play what you want.  Play what you like to play.  Play what you will want to play.
---
That being said, obviously adding some heals to the mix will make things easier.  But healing is a ... I don‚Äôt know how to say it ... a calling? a chore? ... takes the right person to not hate being the healer.  If someone is forced into that role, and doesn‚Äôt like it, but feels obligated for friendship reasons, then they don‚Äôt want to play, and that defeats the purpose of the group.  Same can be said for always being the tank.
---
Casual = play what will keep you playing.
---
Yeah having a pet and spells ungeared is way easier than running around in white and a few green as warrior to level. Unless you have friends to carry you

It was tempting

But you can get a ban for this. So I wouldn't recommend it.
---
I‚Äôm on a full PVP realm and on weekdays there hasn‚Äôt been a queue between 1am and 1pm. Then at 1pm it starts at about 10 minutes and goes up to nearly 6 hours by 8 or 9pm before coming back down to zero queue by 1am. Mostly from people dropping out I guess.
---
This.  I decided to level a warrior again, and Christ killing things is playing the dodge/parry lottery.  That and being rage starved.  I don‚Äôt remember it being this damn punishing though to be fair he was started in vanilla and finished in TBC so it may have been tweaked by then.
---
How to do this? You saying doing quests is inefficient way of leveling?
---
People generally RP in /s and not global channels, they will ban for a name/harrasing players but I don't think they enforce anything else
---
And skills?

Is there a smart route to get the flightpath? Or the smartest thing I can do is uninstall?

Oh, so you ARE retarded then. Nah, you just can't back down now that you've doubled down so you keep doing this shit instead. You're not a complete retard, you know you fucked up and that I'm right.
---
It's awesome 95% of the time
---
Holy fuck this brought back so many memories
---
Warlock isnt about burst dps, but slowly damaging over time. This means you kill 1 mob slower than a mage, but if you use your voidwalker and fear, you can damage 2-3 mobs at the same time. Use life tap to regain mana and you hardly have downtime. So your immediate damage is low, but you are able to kill multiple mobs much faster and clear areas much faster than other classes. Hope this helps. If you prefer doing a lot of damage, you can see if you prefer the destruction tree, or reroll as a mage.
---
Medium is borderline not worth it anymore, but heavy leather is like 15s each on my realm

Open world pvp is also pretty pointless at this point other than just making other peoples days harder. You don‚Äôt get any of the usual benefit which if honor which in turn allows you to buy armor to help you pvp.
---
If we are talking about players-to-$ (ARPU) values, tokens are just $20 sub (one player paying the sub for someone else, but that is irrelevant for ARPU)
---
Dragging subs also make the initial claim I was replying to claim that "Classic can pull 3x the subs of retail and will still be making 1/3 the profit though." more true

Read about the classes first. Once you decide on a class then look at gearing up though most stuff won't have stats during the starting levels anyways. Don't rule out a druid as a dungeon healer. They can manage fine as well.

But now it works great

what is the addon at the top ?

My best advice to you, and you have multiple options, is to check the spells they can learn on classicdb or something. The spells pretty much describe themselves and you can decide which sounds coolest to you. Alternatively level each to level 10 or 20 to get a feel for how they play.

For the ultimate wpvp ganking potential, druid + rogue.  Rogue opens, and just when the opponent thinks they‚Äôre about to swing the fight in their favor, druid comes out of the shadows, puts the rogue back to full health and starts using balance and then feral to finish the fight.

If you're talking about crossrealm BGs, then unfortunately, that one is a MUST to minimize the negative impact of wintrading, premades and long queuing time. Without this feature, you'll certainly see one or two premade groups steamrolling pugs. If you go in there alone, chances are you'll be camped by such a group at graveyard from beginning to the end, and over time nobody will bother to play BG anymore.
---
I‚Äôm personally on Yojamba because I couldn‚Äôt stand the queue times, I actually wanted to play the game, besides, blizzard could actually release realm swapping eventually to help the playerbases

I want the authentic Vanilla experience. That means botters and gold sellers.

In a time where people streaming classic wow should showcasing all it has to offer and putting its best foot forward, they shouldn't just stream the same fucking dungeon for 4 days straight.  They're purposefully made their own content boring.  Like, I like esfand, but holy shit.  People are too caught up in it being a "dungeon grind meta" when it doesn't have to be.

Pros: Life Tap for mana, demons to help dps/tank, Healthstones, and great damage. All this combine to make me have little downtime compared to other classes and solo well.
---
Cons: Very squishy clothie, if shit goes down I quite likely won't make it. Our buffs aren't that great, imo; we only got Demon Skin/Armor, Unending Breath, Fire Shield, and Detect Invisibility. The worst though is fucking Soul Shards taking up my precious inventory space.
---
Oof.
---
Yes and they‚Äôre the games players are leaving Classic for already to go back to. Especially after people see the layering exploit that will gradually be exploited by more and more leaving those playing fairly wondering why they‚Äôre behind.

Also nice to remember the multi boxers, I wonder how many quit after getting hit with 5 synchronized fire bolts :D

There are people like that because of the queue. It‚Äôs a evil circle.
---
Play BFA if you want tokens. Buying gold is against ToS and with modern architecture, it‚Äôs very easy to tell when a player receives a large sum of gold from a random level 1 character. They‚Äôll get banned, word will spread, and gold sellers won‚Äôt have a market and fall off. Don‚Äôt cheapen the classic experience because you‚Äôre lazy and can‚Äôt /ignore people.

Join groups with someone in a different layer. If you're in Duskwood and search */who z-"Duskwood"* it shows just people in your layer but if you search */who Duskwood* it shows everyone on the server.

Exactly. People are going to buy gold regardless. It's just a bunch of greedy ass plebs here who refuse to support the developers / company who produced classic.

None of it makes much sense to me though, since he was on a PvP server.
---
Do you know why players didn't actively go after him the entire way? Back in the day the highest level players would get griefed if they went it solo on a PvP server. Even if they went in groups, they'd still have a big target on their head. You had groups just going after them and camping them. At worst stopping them, at best slowing them down the entire way.
---
It was a huge part of the leveling up experience on brand new PvP servers.
---
So usually you couldn't really do multiple pulls unless you were on PvE.
---
Did just no one go after him, even though he was doing multiple pulls? Making him super weak to being ganked, even by lower level players?
---
/uninstall ...obviously
---
Dangerous medical experiments should be good for that.

---
This is the only game i've ever played where i see a tagged rare mob and run in to help the person dying who aggro'd it. In every single other game, i watch them die and laugh, then take it myself.
---
The reason for this is pretty obvious when you think about it - people act differently, very differently, to those they will see again. I will never ever see a person i saw on retail, more than once or twice. 
---
In vanilla, in this week alone, i've saw the same people a good few dozen times. I saw them in Teldrassil at lvl one. I saw them in Darnassus, i saw them in Darkshore. I went to Stormwind and saw them there. I saw them outside Deadmines. I saw them in Redridge. I even saw a few of them join my guild.
---
I recognise them because they're more human. We haven't spoken at all, literally the only interaction we've had together is buffing. Yet that shit is head and shoulders above anything in retail. I can do an entire m+ dungeon with someone and then never ever see them again. Literally never. Thats kind of sad.
---
Another thing that makes this game just objectively better imo is leveling. Ask yourself why leveling is so fun in classic. Often you're not even doing anything - just auto attacking. Often you're just running on auto run. Why is it better then? Its really easy when you think about it - gear.
---
That moment when you realise not a single dungeon drop, not a single quest reward, not a single world epic or blue, matters, even slightly, in retail.
---
In vanilla wow, you kill a boss, he drops his axe and you lose your shit. That is going to be your axe for at least 2-3 levels, which is about 6 hours game time for most people, if not more. It improves your character and changes how your character looks.
---
In retail WoW, a boss drops his axe and you don't even have the choice of needing or passing on it. It goes straight into someones inventory. They immediately either vendor it on their mammoth or delete it. disenchanting it is worthless. The money from selling it is worthless. It is a DPS loss to their heirloom axe. 
---
Every piece of gear, 1-119 in retail, is literally just bag space clutter. Blue items are equivalent to vendor grays. Even if you sell literally every single piece of gear you get 1-119, you will get about 15,000g.
---
You need 200,000g for a WoW token. You need 2,000g for an enchant. You need 5,000,000g for the auction house mount.
---
Vanilla WoW is just objectively better. Retail may have better combat in your opinion, but no one can deny that half the systems in retail literally don't matter. Gold doesn't matter. gear doesn't matter 1-119. Leveling doesn't matter. An RPG where leveling up and gearing up doesn't matter.

---
One of the worst things about modern WoW is how its system is built to encourage toxic behavior such as griefing, freeloading, and being an ass. Because random queues and lack of community erodes a major source of accountability in an online game.
---
Only in some countries.
---
And that‚Äôs probably why you PVE you only think about the benefit of it. You don‚Äôt think about the mentality it puts you in or how it makes the world feel immersive since the there‚Äôs that much more amount of danger. With PvP you have the opportunity to contest objectives such as mining nodes herbs and skinning. How dull the game must be when the only thing that will kill you in environment. Opposite faction plays such a big part of the game &amp; immersion
---
Would I do /castsequence after the /petattack? I want to make sure that my Void Walker tanks for me.
---
I dropped mining around 18-19 because I was sick of fighting my group for ores. picked up herbalism which I HATE so only at like 75 for that haven‚Äôt sold any of that either
---
And your wife is german too? Wish we had niederlandische servers so i could meet a dutch wife on wow :)

It was originally stated on the largest software forums to be so, but I think most multiboxers moved to other servers to avoid queue - especially since 1 unlucky DC, client crash, or whatever else could potentially result in another queue, and that is 5x more likely (yes, dc protection, but nobody REALLY trusts that...)
---
Also, most multiboxers try to stay out of the way of people now, and with classic questing, almost all of us are hiding in instances instead of dealing with quests that would require 100+ kills for 5 characters to complete.
---
Im so glad thst i get my lvl40 pala mount for free im broke all the time
---
&gt; It can also be tough to make pulls, as unlike a rogue, you can't just throw a knife at one mob and walk at a second. 
---
You can use a bow but not 10 extra rage, I love charging btw, it's so addicting. Are you talking about Arms btw? if yes then do you recommend it over Fury if I don't want to running away every hit? or it can also be effective?
---
"You think you want it, but you don't."
---
Whomever said that should be fired, let's be honest.
---
Actually, if Blizzard could just step away from Activision, that'd be great.
---
It‚Äôs not even so much the phasing. You get a quest and 5 feet away in a contained area are the 10 mobs you need. Turn it in and get an automatic update to kill 1 named in front of you.
---
These mobs are placed specifically there for that quest. They create these small patches full of mobs for a given quest.
---
After max level no one wants to explore anything because the mob density is so high. People are just trying to get flying.
---
Doomsayer jfc
---
Gotta love sitting in queue more than you played the first days :D
---
Could you modify my current macro so that it includes that? This is currently my first time playing WoW or using macros.

---
I'm also on that server and yes people do RP, right now most are focused on levelling up and getting nice looking gear to actually RP in.
---
Like others have said, people mostly stick to RP in /s rather than global channels.
---
There is an add on you can get to help identify others willing to RP called True RP 3 Classic. It's a great mod.
---
Your name is the best
---
Hey Moltenballs is a great name
---
Because money.
---
Bahaha I struggled so hard getting from 10-14 in Westfall.  I finally said fuck it and went to Loch Modan because I only had orange quests left in Westfall and as a warrior im lucky if I can kill an enemy one level above me.  Now Im slaying level 10 troggs and I feel on par with the other level 10 players running around.  Finally!
---
It‚Äôs only useful if you‚Äôre not playing right.
---
you are talking about bloodfang and judgement right? they were literally announced a day before the opened them.
---
Gold-wise skinning + tailoring is way better since bags are in high demand. I can make 5g an hour from farming with those two proffs, which is really nice seeing how I also get anywhere from 15-30k XP an hour doing it.
---
Make fun of it all you want. But this is really the most efficient way of getting a gf in wow. Dont let it rely on chance. You have to pursue what you want actively
---
So what is the plan, they going to do BC next in a year or so?
---
You have something a lot of people dream of. Enjoy every day of it!
---
I think he will be spending his twitch money üôÇ
---
&gt; I agree it's not that much harder than other classes. However, 1-17 is hardly indicative of how easy or hard any classes are to level.
---
I was expecting 10-20 to be the hardest since you still have jack shit in talents and in equipment so now when I keep my eq up to date and gain more and more useful gear what can possibly go wrong? I also hear about some fish and a potion that regenerates hp, gotta check it out, with this + regeneration talent it should be a breeze.
---
Hey,
---
which is the better class especially for PVP? ( Hunter or Rogue)
---
Secondly for PVE, but this part is not that important for me.
---
I heard that rogues are in 1.12 not that good?
---
Are you actually retarded?
---
A full holy will have the same buffs, more tankiness (if they go the usual 31/20) and their heals will be more reliable. 
---
A ret sacrifices part of it in offense he cannot itemize properly for. That's the actual tax.  
---
There is the issue. mages/locks/rogues do not have any of this problems, the maximum extra itemization trouble they might face is +elemental damage items. Warriors' gear overlaps quite for PvP, tanking or dpsing in  PvE, with damage pieces used for extra threat for tanking and not limiting rage generation too much.
---
yeah just redo the 10 level you did and stop whine.
---
Pretty sure you can squeeze in /petattack at the start of the line, won't matter a lot though seeing as how your Void Walker will Taunt the target.
---
Seems like it is whomever rolls first if you look at the chat.
---
Sorry if stupid question, but how?
---
Warlock is not a support class so idk what you're hoping to help? You're helping by killing mobs as fast as possible. That's your job I guess
---
Lucky boi
---
In retail botting quests never got as long ban as your friend did for trying auto clicker, your story is clearly a fake.
---
Oooh i hadn't thought of that lmao, what lvl can i go to my trainer for that?
---
wtf ?
---
Omg. Elizabeth Shue nailed that dead-eyed smile when someone says something she disagrees with, but wants to stay coordial.
---
Care to elaborate?
---
Soul stone, Health stone, crowd control, portals, void walker aggro saves, the list goes on and on! Warlocks have a ton of ways to help people in a group or outside of a group. You‚Äôll get the hang of it as you get more used to your new class!
---
Yeah it‚Äôs been really nice to group up with others for the more challenging quests. You can tell the world was not designed to be solo‚Äôd when areas have groups of 3-4 mobs at once. It actually encourages people to work together
---
Not the lvl 40
---
If the queues and getting groups are really that big of an issue, what‚Äôs going to be faster? Rerolling on a server with no queue timers and getting full same-language groups?
---
Vendor it so we know it‚Äôs real ;)
---
Leather belt.
---
we got stuck in the same puddle, it's just flat, no liquid really.
---
I think everyone is in this situation.
---
Blizzard really screwed the pooch on this one.
---
Yeah, they should.
---
Pretty sure lvl 10. If, not, not soon after that.
---
Out of the loop. What is layering?
---
I see,never played lock so i only know about the healthstones haha
---
As someone who is only at lvl 12. I both look forward and dread reaching STV by the time I make it there.
---
Yeah I was dpsing on my priest really badly, I think the healer priest was doing more damage than me, nobody said a word about it.
---
haven't heard that in a while
---
Oh ok i'll have them tonight then sweet
---
There isnt enough quests to level only by doing quests in one zone at a time, you either have to travel between zones or you have to grind it out just killing mobs at your own level
---
Sheep your cat.
---
As if anyone actually uses the word literally literally these days. still, a lot of players are older these days, with decent jobs. Paying $25 instead of spending hours and hours grinding will seem very tempting to a lot of people with money to spare.
---
And yeah, it does sound entitled. That still doesn't change the fact that I couldn't care less about Activision Blizzard's profits. I think tokens would be extremely detrimental to the game, far more so than wow sellers. We had wow sellers in Vanilla and things still worked fine. And yeah I might be selfish, because all I really care about is that me and all the other players who want to re-experience Classic WoW get that, not some modernised version created to earn BLizz money. After that for all I care Activision Blizzard can go bust.
---
That's when you call up the guild
---
&gt;Got me thinking how as humans we seem to do better in smaller tribes and all this metropolitan urban sprawl is leaving us disconnected and unhappy.
---
Honestly its not even that, its the fact that you'll never see people ever again in retail wow. I've played retail WoW for 25,000 hours. I still remember people i never spoke to, ever, from TBC and vanilla. An example would be a night elf rogue called Sapulots. Never spoke to him. Not even once. Still remember him because i saw him every day.
---
You probably have a similar story.
---
Now, a challenge - name a random pug. Someone you manually invited, maybe even spoke to, in mythic+.
---
You can't. Your brain just doesn't work that way, in fact, its probably trained to not store that information because it knows it won't matter. You'll never see that player again.
---
All this is thanks to cross realm LFG and CRZ. They could easily do server-only LFG and it would solve that problem. They could easily remove CRZ and it would solve that one too. These things combined would near instantly bring back community to retail WoW.
---
It doesn't matter if your server has 100,000 people on it. You're still gonna recognise people. Can't do it if they're literally deleted from existence by CRZ, or you're being paired up with people from different realms in France and Russia, despite playing on a totally different English speaking realm.
---
If Mograine is low pop server then someone should tell Blizzard about it, keep hitting queues every fucking day up to 12k.

Couldn‚Äôt they use their zone scaling approach to make the difficulty of the world elites scale to the zone population? Seems like a relatively straightforward way to make the content playable on low pop servers.

What is the layering exploit exactly?

No you shouldent really ever do, unless it might save their loves. Shields prevent their rage regeneration and is bad from a mana/heal perspective. Use shields when casters get aggro instead :-)
---
I do this on my priest all the time! Running by a fellow classic journeyman who‚Äôs running from the harvesters? Stop and heal then throw up a buff. See a non healing class sitting for some food? Hit ‚Äòem up with a renew! Fort for everyone! Or at least til my mana runs out. Then  I realize I used all my water or milk, I‚Äôm in the middle of nowhere, westfall and I gotta run 6 minutes to the nearest vendor.

I‚Äôm loving (most) every minute of the community feels!
---
Its Filthy casual not fookin'!
---
in retail wow i very, very often will run through a pack of 10-20-30 mobs just to get to a herb.
---
Why not, right? Pop wings, wake of ashes then divine storm. All of them are dead. Not a paladin? Try frost orbing and cone of colding once. Try using cataclysm once. Try pressing multishot and letting your pet vaporise them with beast cleave, etc.
---
30 god damn mobs just vanish. This an anime hack and slash game or is it an RPG?
---
This one of my favorite things to do in an mmo. Find those people overrun and coming to terms with their impending doom, alone and without hope, only to be  given new life. Thrust back into the fight swinging deadly vengeance down upon those who had nearly bested them. It is not your time to corps run my rando hero. This day you fight!

.....unless you don't acknowledge me afterwords. Then I'm dragging everything on top of you and taking you out with me. How dare this mere moral squander my gifts!

Thats weird. Im still seeing long (5000+) queues and full cities. Must be that i was incorrect in my assumption that all those people i saw were real. Probably just a figment of my sleep deprived imagination lmfao
---
Nah, flying is fine. It's the group finder and cross realm partying that ruins everything. You lose out on any sense of server community and there's no incentive to not be a massive prick since you can just drop group and immediately queue up for another.
---
Back in Vanilla if you were an asshole, word got around and you stopped getting invited to shit.
---
XP is better than Pservers.
---
A lot of people just play on RP because it‚Äôs usually lower pop. But I just got out of Mulgore on Bloodsail Buccaneers, and the RP community was pretty strong there.
---
I just go through RFC every once and a while and sell greens. Make at least 1g a run and it only takes 20 mins.
---
I jumpped to another server from Whitemane since I saw 25,000 queues.
---
Never sat in queue again. Feels good.
---
This is it. Sense of a world
---
I have EVE when I want that, and it does it much better IMO. I don't enjoy WoW PvP much at all. Why waste time fighting over a node when I can just move on to another? And in any case, you can't kill your own faction and they're competing for the same nodes. WPvP doesn't enhance the aspects of WoW that I enjoy.
---
Not even a week yet like if you spent 6months on a sever then yea maybe but not after 5 days
---
See you soon in hot
---
No, 20-30 is the hardest. Rend starts tapering off then, you have no good rage dump, and your great AOE hasn't kicked in yet. You will have no great rage dump, and if you crit at the start of a fight you cannot even justify sundering armor. It's very tough to spend your rage well.
---
Fuck him then
---
Yesterday i saw a mage and hunter killing crocs i needed for a quest, so i politely asked "hey guys, may i join you?"
---
They ignored me. 4mn later i looted a mage belt that increased fire dmg by 6.
---
I went back to the sa.e mage that had ignored me, traded him the belt, he accepted and replied with a "What do you want?!"
---
So yeah.... some people are just rude and inconsiderate.
---
I never had an issue with groups not speaking English on my server, but I do get how that might become a problem. But what if your server gets full after a ton of people migrate and now you have hour long queues and you are 30+? Are you going to reroll in an instant ?
---
Starting all over again is kind of a waste of time as well. Doing the same zones, same dungeons. I'd kind of rather wait for the queue.
---
"By nightfall these hills will be swarming with benzos"
---
So true
---
Yeah shes from north germany. Yeah must be hard to find players that are from the netherlands. Do you play on EN or an DE server?
---
Actually, i did search and i even discussed this topic on the forum, if i'm not even the one that annoyed this sub the most with the feral tank thing, but i NEVER thought about the horde side, ty very much though, i thought i actually had to reroll, was alliance all the time, wanted to try out Horde for once.
---
Go in a party with someone on that layer.
---
I think I ran past you in Westfall yesterday. I threw a druid buff on you and got a macro thanks.
---
Don't get me wrong, I don't want to wand mobs from 1 to 120 and die every time I pull 1 extra, but the quest &amp; class designers have done a disservice to the game.  Their redesign of vanilla maps and classes shows.  All over-the-top quests, with vehicles, and "funny" moments that really don't fit anything.  They're now in the business of making efficient and painless quests.  Something really feels wrong in that department.  Their raid/dungeons are great though.
---
10g...? Oh wait, I just need to finish this quest, oh, and this dungeon, and...
---
Well, at least *his* story can be a fake. I have no single reason to think so however. 
---
Stay safe and leave the server if you don‚Äôt play.
---
That's when you take to /1 for da boyz.
---
BOBBY B, LOOK OUT!
---
Lmao this guys pathetic. Grow the fuck up mate.
---
&gt; Flying killed the last bit of world pvp though.
---
What world pvp there can be if noone is out in the world because they can insta-teleport to instances, even those of the opposite faction capital?
---
Hahaha or /g to call in the big rigs
---
Do you ever get to a point where you don't need to feed them anymore or is it a more constant maintenance kind of thing?

This is also why I don't get how people can hate on streamers. If you don't like them don't watch them, ignore their fans and do your own business. Noone can pop an event so fast as a streamer though and I really like these. How can you not?
---
I agree with your last sentence. I've played since vanilla and hate retail, absolutely hate the players who made retail as bad as it is. Retail is a mess but the players didn't help with their attitude and the way they treat eachother. I'm just kind of disgusted at the flowery way I see everyone here talking about the classic community when they more than likely contributed to the broken community of retail.
---
You‚Äôre just not looking at the list of servers which never have a queue :)
---
What in tarnation
---
Yes. I played loads back in 2006/2007 (loads). Now I'm nearly 30 with 2 kids and can only squeeze in a few hours each night and that's with well timed remote queueing lol.
---
That's brilliant man, thanks for reminding me of this.
---
A druid named Restosterone and a gnome lock named Harrydotter.
---
Group with someone from another layer. I don't think it's permanent though.
---
I hope mods won't block this as a low effort meme. They like to do it to good memes here sadly
---
I was kicking myself this morning for not thinking of this a week ago.
---
Everyone is so happy playing WoW classic. 
---
I just wanted to point out its a 15 year old game. Its been constantly updated for years. But somehow the original was magic. I had forgotten how good it was.
---
A wild blade master appears to harass you!
---
Quick to the moonwell or it will be your end.
---
Not liking flying and not wanting it into the game is absolutely legit :)
---
It's believing that flying was the thing ruining the community that is a wrong assumption.
---
Good question. AFAICR I dont remember seeing any log in game but you go have chunky wooden maces with some wooden etchings on.

Please stop telling people how they are allowed to have fun.

I start next week but I wanna play wow classic today :/
---
There's definitely some class/race combos that are much easier to play on horde on pvp servers than on alliance though.  There's a reason there's often twice as many warlocks on horde than alliance on pvp servers, but not much difference on pve servers.  Playing an alliance warlock on a pvp server is playing a warlock on hard mode.  And this kind of thing attracts certain types of players to the easier version (horde).
---
However you are mostly correct.
---
Meanwhile on retail you don't need to do all these actions that slow down gameplay.
---
This guy quit his job so he could play wow classic 24/7
---
Ingame chat. Listed as known bug
---
no it's just he's 4 levels higher.
---
I've only played for 4 days, so what is retail like, culture wise, if Classic is like this?
---
Like. Why can't both have this kind of thing?
---
The question is, how much more damage. Just the fact that something does increased damage from other sources, does not mean it should be replaced with just a damage judgement. Short fights dont profit much from debuffs.
---
Or in my case never reach 60 and just alt and dick around all day while still having fun. No pressure to reach 60 ever. :)
---
I never had any objections to your language barrier point. Of course, if you find yourself on a server where a foreign language that you cannot speak is prevalent, you should reroll. I was just making the point that people have rerolled to a new server in order to avoid queues, but are still getting queues shouldn't have to do it again.
---
Rogues suck balls to level. Honestly not too far above warriors and that‚Äôs only because they have CDs like evasion for pills that go bad and they don‚Äôt need to generate their resource it just regens automatically so you dump a full energy bar right off the bat
---
SoR sucks balls, i kill faster with seal of crusader. I will judge with SoR on cd and then flip back to crusader.
---
Just abandon your family and your job.
---
Everyone needs to buy ammo for their ranged weapons ;)
---
\*whored mouth.

---
Yup you‚Äôre going to want to google a vanilla database because there are many axes.
---
All axes that are not two handed are dual weildable if your class can dual weild.  Currently only warriors hunters and rogues.
---
It's all glorioud until you get those bright green shoulder pads you can't turn down.
---
How would thousands of people be able to lvl in the same zone without layering?
---
Limiting the number of times you can change layer doesnt seem like a bad idea at all
---
As a feral I wouldn‚Äôt want to main tank, but off tanking is absolutely fine. We just don‚Äôt have any good mitigation and taking things like potions or health stones requires us to leave bear form.
---
Even told my dad cause he told me to tell him anything big happening in the gaming industry cause he saw what happened with turtle beach stock from .70 to $34 back when everyone started the fortnite hype haha. Told him how good Classic was after playing it.
---
You just made a mage feel sad
---
I used to have a mod that replaced the paintings with lewd paintings, but i cant for the life of me find it again.
---
Because we can actually play now
---
I play with my penis
---
My ignore list is filling up nicely with inconsiderate players. Worse I've had so far is when I was clearing an area to get to a chest, cleared 3 or so of the mobs then stood on top of the chest whilst I finished off the last one as I couldn't loot it whilst in combat. Then another player started opening the chest whilst I was standing on top of it whilst I was still fighting the last mob. Yey.
---
There are so many issues though. Towards the end of classic, raids started getting irrelevant. Solo play or casual play was much less possible, because there was only group content added (and let's face it: new solo content without a leveling component never worked all that great long-term, things like sunwell won't hold a casual audience's attention forever). Sure, they could slap new max level content onto the game past Naxx, but even during Naxx power creep was a serious issue. There'd have to be SOME kind of solution to that problem, be it a gear reset through a level cap raise, some mechanic that forces players to abandon old gear for less powerful gear (through resistances or whatever), which would suck, or whatever else they might think of. I think the best and most reasonable course of action would be to either remake BC to be more similar to classic, release BC the way it was (which I hope they wont do but think they probably will) or add new additional content along a level cap raise.
---
i know how to do that, i just wondered if there was anyway to manually switch without partying
---
World First and/or his Agony
---
It's quite an issue when you have 3-4 very different playstyles but you can barely use one of them  since itemizing for any other is almost impossible and everyone wants you on it, while the rest aren't even taken into consideration in most cases (exceptions being ele sham in PvP -due to Rsham being inferior- or PvE feral)
---
This is quite different to  mage/rogue/hunter/lock specs, a mage or lock will always be itemizing the same caster stats (where the only difference comes to additional stamina for PvP purposes and the special case of +elemental gear) rogues will always focus on the same stats (again, the only difference is +weapon skill stuff) and so do hunters.  
---
Changing specs barely has an effect on the gear choice and the playstyle of the class doesn't suffer too many changes, mages/locks will stay casting their spells from range and mostly spamming X-bolt in PvE, hunters will keep the same rotation but will try to keep shooting the same way while being backed up by their pet and rogues' only changes are their builder (SS/backstab/hemo -in PvP-) and some combo generation aspects (seal fate and sub's bonuses to openers). 
---
Compare this to paladin (because of this topic's focus, but the same can be said about shaman and druid). Ret focuses on damage, prot on tanking, holy on healing. Two will try to be in the face of mob/boss/enemy player, one aggroing mobs, one damaging them (but using their utility when needed), while holy might do so every now and then (in PvE for refreshing JoL, PvP... well, because he's been engaged by an enemy) but will avoid it most of the time. So 3 quite different playstyles, each one focused in a different aspect of the class. 
---
Itemization also changes drastically for each one of the three.  
---
Notice that I omitted both warriors and priests, it is intentional since they're somewhere in the middle. Their itemization changes aren't as harsh and playstyle-wise a warrior will always be a full melee regardless of their spec and priest a full spellcaster (either damage or healing focused).
---
not at the start of the fight or they wont get any rage and be unable to keep threat initially.
---
Yummy!
---
And those addons are just as capable of posting full stacks.  It isn't the addons fault, it's the people.
---
Well he frequently pitted people against each other to purposely create competition within the company/teams/departments. Now that doesn't have to be bad but early Apple brooke a lot of people mentally. He was just really aggressive about it when you read the different sources like moving the Lisa team to a different building of campus and flying a pirate flag to make them really feel like outsiders from the rest of Apple.
---
Sure it got results sometimes but is that style really worth it?
---
His real genius were imo marketing and placing the right people on the right place. Like Iveys, Cook and Lassiter.

That depends, a fair few 1 hander's are main hand only.

I totally agree with that point, absolutely. But I don‚Äôt have any solution that Blizzard would definitely do right this second, unfortunately. I‚Äôm not sure how they‚Äôd give people like that priority, or shut I feel. 
---
And I still really don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre going to do free server transfers. I‚Äôll be glad if they prove me wrong, though, for sure. It‚Äôll help quell a lot of the issues people are having.
---
Save it/buy your skills at trainer

Hi, /u/doom_boi

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cxv2gw/today_i_bought_a_wow_subscription_but_whenever_i/). 
---
Idk I used to moon fire the afk people and kill them. You have plenty of time to shapeshift back.
---
&gt; we want to [...] die
---
haha yes
---
Save it!! Mountat level 40 is a must!!
---
Save as much as possible for your mount.
---
He isn't suggesting removing layering, but limiting how often you can switch between layers.
---
Get some bags and save the rest.
---
Nope to sell for more som vendors.
---
Ah ha haaaa!
---
Do they add up pretty quick? I've not had the problem of it costing too much yet. Thanks for the quick response!
---
i generally agree but my literal first experience with the game was playing a tauren and ill never get over how amazing thunderbluff was to me at the time. it all still feels so beautiful
---
Real wisp heroes detonate themselves for the greater cause, anyone is capable of gathering lumber and scout by it need real balls to sacrifice themself just to powerlevel that KotG asshole leading the army
---
There is no previous record because Vanilla and Classic aren't the same, just very similar.
---
Well getting to 18 doesnt take that long
---
Oooh. That's like 100G total isn't it?? Good point!
---
My constraints only fall within the queue times. That is why I am not progressing.
---
Seeing this argument everywhere and it‚Äôs just not realistic. It‚Äôs impossible to convince all 50+ people to reroll their level 30+ characters. Why does rerolling have to be the only solution here? It‚Äôs not working, they‚Äôre throwing new servers at it everyday and yet the queues stay the same: Blizzard has the technology, it would fix the problem, and mend the only flaw many people see in this launch. Let it happen.
---
Daddy Metzen is the real gift
---
Organic timesink, you are living the world for better or worse which in turn connects you with it.
---
Interesting! Can you name an example?
---
I've been liking mocking blow as a backup for when my taunt is resisted in a hairy situation üò≠
---
How would there ever be thousands of people in a zone? Each server should not have more than 3000~ player slots.
---
Its all about skill and preference not class
---
My trick I booking it around teldrasil. The baby nelfs have been sticking close to dolanar and the further you get, the thinker the spawns. They also have mageroyal!
---
Thanks for sharing that! I used to love to do this stuff back in the day (old Iron Forge, under Org/ SW, inside Caverns of Time) but I‚Äôve actually never seen that one before.
---
It makes as much sense as me saying I need the Untamed blade for wing clip damage.
---
DD resident here, maybe I'm biased in saying that I love it here. I always run into mobs of people while questing, I had a few random open world RP sessions so far and the PvP scene seems buzzing right now. We might be a little smaller compared to Grob right now but we're definitely growing. I suggest checking out r/deviatedelight and giving our discord pinned at the top a poke, there's always people chatting away in the discord and they might be able to answer any other questions you have.
---
it's better than 5 enemy rogues harassing whole map
---
You can have a staff and wand at the same time :)
---
You only ever RP in /g?   What nonsense!  I've only been in heavy RP guilds, first on Defias Brotherhood then Argent Dawn and now Hydraxion, I have never been in a guild where people RPed in /g.  That sounds like it would be the most frustrating shit ever unable to talk ooc in bloody guild chat.  Furthermore how on earth does that work IC?  Eveyone has a Gnomish radio??
---
Sounds like you have to wait until you get paid... like every other adult
---
Cheetah aspect.. those first 20 levels are rough without it.
---
It‚Äôs useful when you tame something new, otherwise it‚Äôs pointless
---
It's all worth it to have a helmet at level 18
---
Trolled
---
Bruh you might use that for 10 lvls more
---
I remember back in the day getting my then gf now wife to login for me while I was at work and by the time I got home I was in.
---
Dont be an asshole then
---
Classic example of why cops don‚Äôt discriminate.
---
I really dont now whats happening, i started my queue 2h ago and now it has more than doubled, i went from 4000 to 12000 in the span of 2 hours and i gotta say its very frustrating.
---
Eventually you'll have to feed them very rarely. Depending how often they die.
---
https://youtu.be/UAAwTlCp3OE
---
Funny i am a dumbass too.
---
Playing hunter wondering why my pet dont have Spott and cant get Aggro
---
On level 17 i realised finally xD
---
I wouldn't spend it personally.  My mind is 100% on affording a mount at level 40.
---
I know!  That's my point!  I'm not saying itsn't RP or people can't RP like that but is *is* unconventional.  If someone is interested in RP and asking if this what RP is like, the answer is 'no'.  This is not what RP is like, this is 'unconventional'.
---
An eternity
---
Yep. I was looking forward to Classic, but I‚Äôve spent the whole week playing Retail. I only get a few moments here and there to play around my family and at night once they fall asleep. Even then, I usually only play for an hour before I go to bed so I‚Äôm ready for the next day. I just don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll ever contribute any real time to Classic.
---
You can basically tank up to endgame in dps spec. Prot does very low dps while solo, making questing/grinding a chore. I would stick with arms.
---
Blizzard will review and ban him if that is the case.
---
Drive by buffs are the best thing in the world
---
Not at all. May I ask why you keep coming back to this conversation? I mean, I'm fine with it and all, it's pretty entertaining to see someone less fortunate than myself try their hardest to get some kind of interaction, but I can't help but wonder why you would even keep engaging with me. You must be so lonely..
---
Because bored Method fans annoyed him all the time at the end for literally only time wasting.
---
Imagine being this rattled someone else can set their UI up, my god you must live an exciting life lol
---
B-But my 10% pet dps. It's very important!!
---
One the one hand I wanna jump on the hype train and try WoW for real this time, I've played a little bit to the free to play level cap waaaay back, but quit cuz I didn't wanna do a subscription.
---
On the other hand, I have irl taking time, I'm having way too much fun with SC2 atm, and still need to finish the Witcher 2+3 and have more backlog in bioshock and dead space to play
---
Struggles
---
Just play on a full realm with 15k queue to limit your play time, it's that simple
---
I only see people inviting me for a quest and then kicking me or leaving all without saying a word. I also see a lot of people stealing tags and not giving a sh\*t about anyone else. I also got ninja'ed in WC yesterday.
---
Welcome to PvP servers?
---
50 DKP MINUS
---
I've got a small guild going called &lt;Waterpipe Warriors&gt; if you and your friends are interested. We're veteran players but we don't take ourselves too seriously. Right now we are focused on leveling, obviously, but when we hit 60 we want to start hosting raids, and when battlegrounds come out we are going to hit them hard. Add Daganja if you're interested.
---
Not sure that would have gone over well. the empiricist in me however would interested in you yielding to your temptation and reporting the results. :)
---
It‚Äôs honestly so amazing. I feel silly for even mentioning it. Pretty perfect, just one groups worth of people farming instead of several. 
---
Glad to fight at your side.
---
Or....
---
Am I?
---
Drive by buffs is my favorite term
---
Not that unpopular tbh. Giving it longer than a month is pretty generous with how boring it can be.  The community is just the same one bfa has being a little less cancerous because it's a "new" game right now.
---
It's mindblowing that some people believe it's "immoral" to be afk in a videogame you pay a subscription to play.
---
All these whiny posts make me want to sit afk in an Inn just out of spite.
---
solo warriors... how many times have you died?
---
Be honest
---
Yo don't feel down, vent if you need to. Don't think of it as a competition, just try to immerse yourself in the adventure and levels will come even if u grind mobs
---
Come dreadmist:) horde
---
No. The sheer lack of burst means you will need a buddy, preferably a rogue or a mage.
---
Don't play on PvP server if you don't like to get ganked? You knew what you signed up for.
---
And here I am, a West coast player on DD
---
Shouldn't there be a general WoW Classic thread (say, one per week) where we can post questions that doesn't deserve its own thread?
---
Need me that deep sea helmet
---
He had 40-50 viewers day one when I started watching his stream. None of his assistance was pre-planned at least
---
Imagine getting killed six times before asking for help.
---
Certainly not me because as a cook, I have to work.
---
But hey, it's the best thing that can happen to a wow player! Less people on working hours when I have my "weekend" (usually Thursday and Friday) and even less people after midnight because they need to sleep.
---
And when everyone is playing and you won't be able to farm decently, I'm working. Life's good.
---
Chances are you are more likely to do more damage if you use that first judgment to judge righteousness one additional time rather than deal with crusader.   Crusader is more for soloing elites and other difficult fights.
---
Blasphemy
---
Yeah, that guy was almost certainly not a real monk. You see those around Asia a lot. My local friends called them foxes.
---
What server üòÇ
---
PvP happened on PvP, huh?  Very concerning.
---
When you got your shit sorted and taken days off an you have waited years for this, emotions is allowed. 
---
Friends of the guy, make he's wait worth it :-)
---
Awesome man! Where‚Äôs you‚Äôre team at level wise?
---
Ask your parents for 15$ tell them it's to pay your internet bill that you need to get a job, problem solved
---
why not play on pve server if you dont want any fraction pvp?
---
is this good? https://gyazo.com/84ca29b9508e3b0853517ce44f23d4a7
---
The thing is in fury there is Unbridled Wrath which seems like it would be a huge help for questing and tanking, right? I need a good build so I dont waste points trying to get specific talents
---
Mages can commiserate but they're just faking it
---
I've been using linen bandages. Now I feel guilty haha I was just trying to be helpful XD
---
Leatrix also has it as an option.
---
I think maybe a guild of like minded people that really worked toward helping each other as far as profs and stuff and sharing could shave some time down immensely.
---
Yeah especially healing touch. Had all agi Stam str gear and healed rfk at 26 as feral mostly fine. Well, we were 2 healing with a 26 tank too but I was top heals 3 lvls below :)
---
lol !!!
---
I was grinding in the stagnant oasis and I got a green bow. I look to my left and there is a hunter fighting mobs. I go over and inspect and he's using a very low DPS white bow! I opened trade and gave him the bow, he was over the moon!
---
This is literally the reason I play on PVE servers. I don‚Äôt have two hours to die 1000 times trying to finish a single quest. 
---
But this what they‚Äôre like. They will absolutely just kill you over and over again specifically to prevent you from finishing your quest.
---
I would also be interested in some more thoughts on this choice because I keep swinging between the two. The big downside for shaman for me is the number of keybinds. At least for Druid you get new action bars for the different forms. And totem management seems like it might be a faff. But Druid is even more complicated to do well and no viable ranged damage spec even for PvP. I‚Äôm happy to heal for PvP and no interest in tanking. I love the Druid forms and the idea of moonglade and also the ability to stealth but also think shaman healing looks more fun and like the ability to walk on water and self res.

---
Then have 0 mana when the mob is at 30% health, every mob
---
It's insane but absolutely impossible without layering.
---
Well, its also worth noting that this is a unique time in that we are all leveling and out in the world now. Once people hit 60, there are less reasons to go out in the world. I think the problem all MMO‚Äôs have is managing end game because it‚Äôs an entirely different gameplay than the leveling experience.
---
He actually made money doing this so not a waste of time
---
I'm new to WoW.   
---
Isn't there a PvP toggle or is it only for low levels?
---
Sending thoughts and prayers.
---
When the screen is bigger the enemies are bigger and therefore easier to hit!
---
I'm already disgusted in myself for the 30 hours I put in this week. I happened to get a week off by some miracle chance. I don't have time to do that again, nor would it be fun. My life now adays, I have time for 1 level 60. If I had to re-roll, I'd lose interest.
---
Thank you for providing an immersive experience for the rest of us, kind wisp
---
Tailor + Enchanting, DEing every green loses a lot of gold over time. Down to 80s at level 18. Also buying every skill even when I don't need them because the trainer menu looks so messy if you don't...
---
Barrows chat
---
More than half of damage goes from wands. My regular fight is:
---
Shield - Mind blast(or smite, depending what is more efffective) - SW:P - wand till death. Mobs of your level die before they break the shield, your mana abouve 80% and you can kill another mob.
---
The hell do you eat?
---
Maybe you were out of range. I actually don't even know the range for /say. Or maybe some people have silly UI setups so they don't see things in /say.
---
Yes. If you are logged in and get disconnected you get a 30 minute pass to get back in. If a layer drops you will see queues bounce back up for q short amount.
---
Added, Thank you.
---
I am not whining. It's just a fact that stalling the logout does increase the queue times. Besides I am not judging you for going afk.
---
Priest is easily the funnest class to play consistently across all expansions
---
I mean I'll go digging, but I clearly(and many others seem to as well) remember "LFG VC/LF2M VC". Gnomer wasn't called GM before Arathi Basin came out and Gold Mines existed. I'm sure there's screenshots of people in westfall with others looking to group for "VC". 
---
"Literally could not have played" seems like a stretch too, unless you're using literally just to exaggerate your point. I have my original CD keys/boxes if you need photo proof lol.
---
Also, you gotta do lab to get ascendancy points so there's a great feeling of going through a somewhat intimidating challenge and getting a solid reward.
---
That zone is like being in the barrens. You have to expect it there.
---
Haha you sound so butthurt. Also I get the feeling that you in fact are a kid yourself.
---
I personally would love a transfer, but no way in hell are blizzard gonna do realm transfers , the classic hasn't been out a week, just reroll
---
I don't min-max so I'd tell you to choose the race you think matters most to you. Don't feel pressured to choose something you're not comfortable with just because your favorite YouTuber or internet tryhard said so.
---
Pls sir, can you spare a bag in these trying times
---
I loved that haha
---
They're not level 18. They have runes of teleportation which would tell us that they're at least level 24 (which is when you unlock IF and SW teleport), having 12 gold by then isn't too hard to manage.
---
Are you already questing in zones with your alt with a main high enough level to help out? Or did you just post this because you wanted to.
---
The first few days were great. but now the toxic timmys are catching up.
---
Ye he‚Äôs gotta break it in, by that I mean his back
---
They said they wanted to aggressively *reduce* layer count asap so they always have as few layers as possible
---
That would be a really fun way to diverge the future content of the this version of the game from retail. Almost definitely way too much work that won't happen but boy would that be neat.
---
You're the reason there's queue problems.
---
So he finally got his castle then.
---
Maybe too serious: working less actually helps the global economy, measured in terms of jobs
---
Somehow I'm just assuming most people playing classic are my own demographic. Teenagers when wow was released (I was 19) and late twenties / in their thirties now.
---
Even if I know that's not true, and I've even met a bunch of people playing wow *for the first time*, that still decided to start with classic.
---
If you‚Äôre on a PvP server and you‚Äôre in a contested area (neutral faction or the other faction‚Äôs zones) you‚Äôre automatically PvPed. Pvp toggle is only for PVE servers.
---
People that say pog outside of twitch chat...
---
cuz most of us look like shit in classic until we get to 60 and start getting some set pieces that actually coordinate with each other.  So looking good in classic when not max level isn't a case of just clicking a few things and transmogging, it actually takes work.
---
So yeah, revel in your accomplishment even if it was accidental.
---

I have been doing this to prevent afk dc‚Äôs so i can play when i get home from work.. never crossed my mind it may not be allowed
---
You just know he said that, saw you replied, and then blocked you so he didn't have to see you say he was wrong
---
Thank god for Metzen
---
Without any proof he was account sharing it seems unfair to throw it out there like it's a fact.
---
It doesnt work for me can you pm me where you downloaded elvui?
---
Suddenly everyone in my guild is asking for layer invite.until yesterday nobody talked about that.
---
Oh man and the gear! And it gets so much more fulfilling the more you level, but damn it‚Äôs more meaningful than retail right from level 1.
---
My level 7 mage has a broom for her staff cuz that shit had like .3 more dps than get arcane staff and now I bop mobs on the head with my broom like a woman getting a rat out of her kitchen lol
---
You‚Äôre not crazy there was a wow animated version of code monkey.
---
&gt; You accused him of having no world pvp experience without any evidence.
---
I said he *sounded* like he had no experience. Big difference there, but I guess everything's black and white from the perspective of the type of person whose first response to seeing someone become persona non grata is to insert themselves so they can act high and mighty :)
---
How?
---
I had this argument with a friend yesterday. When I did it I had to /cheer to get it to work but he was adamant I was full of shit cause he didn't do it and he has the pet. I don't know why that is though.
---
I love how people aren't even bothered to cap, they just run halfway across the world and fight random folks.
---
I just hope they don't rehash every expansion pack as is until we come to this point again.
---
I hope they learn from their mistakes and change accordingly towards the next expacs . not a carbon copy of what we've had until now.
---
There's a reason I only really play tekken nowadays, you said it yourself. Games in the past decade are shit =) Open world being an illusion is boring when there is nothing to discover.
---
It's honestly not impossible, there are some interesting things about DXVK.
---
For instance in Elder Scrolls Online you'll actually get better graphics than on Windows because of Vulkan features.
---
First time playing as horde for me, they have more (?) dungeons available during leveling, and I have no clue which ones are worth running and at what level.
---
Do you really not no?
---
He constantly layer hopped to avoid gankings.
---
not once has any stranger ever given me help lmao, what?
---
This is 100% blizzard's scuffed launch.  Everyone whining about people doing this probably have never tried to work an overtime week, start their next semester,  and get in on a launch week all at once
---
Lol, I would but I'm strictly pve usually
---
The fuck dude y'all ganged up on this guy
---
This is probably macroable.
---
Sadly, there is probably a bit of layers in this one. People are probably layer-hopping a bit just like they do with sharding or CRZ (not sure which) in modern WoW.
---
But some people do run towards the fighting; ask in chat for help or invite random people.
---
If this happens to anyone just accept and get their name and report them. The more accounts that get a ban means they spend more and more money on new accounts and therefore lose profits to the point where they no longer are inflating the AH market
---
Didn't record it. I did mess up a bit too. Might try and hone my craft and try again. Problem is I can only do it at night because it's impossible when fighting other people for the mobs.
---
Not an obscure reference. If nobody gets it then they deserve to not understand.
---
Sounds promising!
---
Making a /chicken macro REALLY helps :).
---
Now that is some 5Head engineering
---
I think Joker had the Lights Hope 1-60 record too and did it in under 3 days
---
Oh yea, I read about that, will take a look at it!
---
I actually got the world first for farting on and then killing a squirrel a couple days ago.
---
That's why everyone over 12 rolls alliance
---
kick the baby
---
You asked how you were being an asshole. I laid it out in an objective albeit boring way. Don't be upset if someone answers your question.
---
Ahhh the great outdoors!
---
(which they preserved)
---
&gt;  normally isn't allowed 
---
"Normally isn't allowed"... IT IS ALLOWED. It's allowed because Blizzard fucking implemented layering in classic.
---
Literally every player in the game is layered in some way shape or form. Even by not being ganked 2x is technically "layer abusing".
---

/cast [target=mouseover,exist] Holy Spell of Doom
---
I'm on my phone, so I'm not 110% it's correct. But it should look like this (:
---
Yes, but it's nice to give a small commission on top of that.
---
It should be possible, but everyone is leveling rn
---
I've had one negative interaction so far. I was doing a quest in Stonetalon where I had to kill an elite, when I got there a group of 3 was already killing it. I asked to join, we killed it, and when looting it gave me some cruddy green gloves. Now this warrior makes this threat/demand "Dude give it to me, or else" as though he had some power over the server. I just left the group and ran off, but jeez some entitlement there.
---
What can you do really. If your business model is to release expansions and content for your game then you're inevitably going to continue to release stuff until the game is pretty unrecognizable from its original conception and with all the baggage and bloat that entails. That being said WoW has still remained insanely popular through its various expansions. 
---
The issue with Classic is that it can't ever sustain the needs of a company like Blizzard nor the size and dedication of the WoW fanbase. It's taken what 3 days for someone to get to 60?  What happens when the curious fans drop off, the core base all get to 60 and all the contents been complete? Just endless runs of Molten Core and BG? In reality people will get bored and stop playing unless Blizzard releases new content but then you get to the situation we have now with retail so it's a bit of a rock and a hard place.
---
Don't get me wrong I love Classic, but relatively speaking I'm pretty casual and even back in the day when I got to 60 I quit because it felt like I'd completed the game at that point.
---
Depends. I'm leveling Blackmsithing, Yeah It costs a bit of money but being able to sell Weapons for upwards of 1g a piece makes it worthwhile
---
??????
---
It's a bandaid fix. People are still going to exploit it hard. People are going to complain that they did a few group quests and now they can't play with their friends.
---
Imo the population is already evening out decently well. Let's just remove this trash and be done with it.
---
Simple: Classic is a brand new game/ experience and isn't "vanilla" so any use of layer is acceptable
---
Classic =/= vanilla (2006 wow)
---
Put render scale at 200% it will look much better
---
Mining and herbalism will be good choices, skinning is fine too. 
---
You can learn professions at level 5,  but you can‚Äôt max professions until (35?) 
---
You can unlearn professions at any time you choose by opening the skill tab (k) and clicking the circle next to the profession in the lower side of the tab. So yes you can replace one with engineering.
---
I wonder if Blizzard is going to try to take notes on things people are loving about classic to try and translate somehow into retail. It seems like they really have an opportunity to be reminded of what it is that made people fall in love with the game.
---
I'll give it one month and hold my breath.
---
There's not thousands of players in each zone
---
I got a quest which rewarded a headpiece and legit got hyped. It's some shitty white headpiece, but it's my first!
---
What a pile of nonsense this is. 
---
Again, not "offended", or "triggered" or whatever, just calling out shitty language when I see it. Stop pretending that your video game is so hardcore that only the tuffest can handle it, that is ridiculous. 
---
I realize now I'm likely speaking to a minor, so thats the end of this conversation. Just remember that when people call out language they're not offended or mad, they're just setting higher standards for their communities. 
---
Just because people use slurs all the time doesn't mean it's okay. Just because something is a meme doesn't mean it's ok.
---
Why is it even possible to layer from an (almost) empty layer to another completely empty layer? 
---
You should be forced to stay in a layer unless it's full. Everything else leads to abuse only without any benefits ...
---

I'm playing a Pally and I love healing random folks while questing. 80% of the ones that are near death are warriors. Toss them a holy light and BoM and continue on questing. Warriors are a lot quicker to thank me for that the rest of the people.

Hey boys, thanks, appreciated.

i got one in WC 2 days ago, sure it costs a gold but the damage is so jummie at level 20
---
I said in my post "when the dust settles". They have enough trouble with the game already, they can offer the transfers a few weeks from now. I don't have the time nor could I convince 20+ people to re-roll.

#1 streamers are doing it

I'm so glad joining a dungeon isn't a matter of your r.io score and iLvl anymore. Now it's just a matter of your level being midway decent for the dungeon and your class rounding out the group.

I died and now I'm dead.
---
Yep
---
As much as I hate layers, I already think there are too many people doing the same quests as me.
---
Shame that the only time Darnassus was relevant in WoW was when it was destroyed.
---
Great so i assume i just spam flash of light?
---
It is Finnish.
---
It‚Äôs certainly been an interesting experience, even with the layering it was hard finding mobs to kill at the starting zones!
---
I‚Äôve made it to level 12 on my human warrior (first time ever playing an MMORPG so I‚Äôm proud), and I desperately don‚Äôt want to reroll as all my friends are on the server too. 
---
Are there going to be any solutions to the huge queues for the server? I‚Äôve had to get up early just to join the server, and even then I have to wait 10 minutes ha
---
Yes. 'Woof' is a pretty common one word response to something that is bad, embarrassing, ugly, etc.
---
Wow tokens would completely destroy the economy and you would end up having to grind 10 times as much if you aren‚Äôt willing to spend real money on (in my opinion) cheating
---
Why?
---
Nooo you should listen to people
---
Mostly yeah
---
No kidding.  Thanks for ripping off my meme.

Don't know about recount, but Details works great.

Homer solution is better and economical

Well.. dont see anything bad about that. It's a pvp server after all.

Thank you for explaining!

Nah ideally you grind certain mobs if you want gold for mount at 40. Proffs aint making you that.

If you fish in pools you have a chance to fish up lockboxes which can contain cloth, leather and items. When a pool spawns it has chance to spawn as a flotsam pool (looks like barrels and junk floating in water) which drops lockboxes often. :)

Ah ok. That seems stressful to do, for 72 hours
---
I mean I'm sorry, but how is this happening so frequently? Do you not think about running into this problem when u decide to split servers? I couldn't get onto the server my friends and I are on for the first 2 or 3 days. Doesn't mean I was going to run and create a character on something else, that doesn't make any damn sense.
---
This is why layering needs to go away
---
Feral druids are pretty fekkin awesome when leveling. It's only in 60 they fall behind, they don't scale as well with gear.

Welcome to the most addicting experience. What class race spec r u going?
---
This is it. In wrath I had a top geared priest with no guild. And even now, a raid ready priest at 120 with barely leaving a city. With thousands of people around it feels lonely. Classic does not feel that way at all so far.
---
This works in theory, but not really in practice when you consider that the reason for layers is to spread out the player base. So if you‚Äôre landlocked to a layer for a specific time frame after too many hops it could potentially cause an issue of overloading a specific layer if it just so happens that several other player end up landlocked to that layer as well. 
---
I agree that something should be done about its exploitability, but I don‚Äôt think this is it. I think Blizzard‚Äôs answer will ultimately be trying to remove layering prior to phase 2 as they‚Äôve said they will attempt to do if at all possible. 
---
I think what *could* be a possible fix is if Blizz could find a way of locking guildmates and people on your friends list on the same layer whenever they‚Äôre logged in similar to a raid id. This would eliminate your ability to intentionally abuse layering.
---
Yea, severs holding like 5x more than they can hold without layering but sure they'll just flip the switch and remove it, that'll really help with queues...

Shield spellcasters about to get spellpushbacked. Especially mages doing blizzard:)

I can understand the rp peeps to not be excited about. They give a lot of themselves to create these moments and friendships that people who don‚Äôt respect rp can just so easily ruin. It just comes down to respect. You don‚Äôt need to troll rpers. They know what they‚Äôre doing they came here for this. Either join in on the fun or run on.
---
That's a really solid find dude, grats!
---
I would agree, hold onto it for a bit, but the people saying it will go for 1000g like it did 15 years ago are wrong. It usually went for about 250g on pservers and is a solid staff until 60. It wouldn't be that bad for raiding either. 
---
If someone had a Staff of Jordan, I'd definitely take them in for MC. But [there's another staff](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18534) that is better for preraid.

I dont think you gain xp in a raid?

failure..... failed to work.

Macros.... are a set function of actions

No, but yes......

Not even close, bud.

Rogues are better in pve and pvp. Rogue is probably the best pvp class in the game.

Why you getting mad at how other people want to play lmao just play the game

---
Let's say they offer transfers from high pop to low pop or to new servers, are all your friends playing on high pop and can you convince 20 people to transfer to the same low pop realm ?
---
Druid is #1 gank class it‚Äôs just that the number of players that are good enough to show the potential are few and far between. Rogue is far far easier in all respects.
---
They had to reshoot the DK fight scenes because the DK accidentally killed the rogue and the pally about 9 times in recording, so eventually they just made him use one attack every 5 seconds to get the clip they needed, and it wouldn't kill them. 
---
Shit was hilarious when they had the gag reel up.
---
Meta means metagame, right?
---
XP in a raid is halved, you don't get any quest progress, and you don't get the ~40% XP bonus you get in a 5-person group. I doubt it compares in terms of XP to other things.
---
Shamelessly, yes. Because it was 300x345 Pixels with two different, badly looking regular fonts. I improved it.
---
And/or increased spawn rates
---
I hear you! Killing bandits and getting gnoll paws in Westfall have crazy numbers so you really need a group, and you need a group that will stick together.
---
I had so much fun last night doing just that, everyone was patient and funny, we had some deaths trying to break some camps of gnolls but damn it felt like we were a team!
---
A patriotic American, what are you?

dont i need shield for dungeons for taunt and to maintain aggro?
---
Haha yes maybe I play on Firemaw, but I barely entered Westfall yesterday.

And I should have been more clear it's a macro for the emote "ty"

I mean. If an alliance is taking my quest mobs hes going to die. Or if im scared he might pull up on me while im weak i want to get the jump on him first. I dont corpse camp.

It was nice getting flying and skipping so much content to do quests.  It was terrible for ganking and you never saw anyone.

Autoclickers and such use windows API to send inputs. Windows automatically sets a flag on your operating system indicating that the input is not from a human. Warden reads the flag and knows you are faking input commands.
---
Yep. A bunch of my friends started on a PvP server virtually guaranteeing that my wife and I won't play with them.
---
I got tired of that kind of toxic teen culture like 10 years ago.
---
In classic you can get xp in 10man dungeons. So more people= faster.
---
But that's just a fucked up advantage and had nothing to do with classic..
---
World of Warcraft is one of my favorite games. I love it so much that the insignia of the Horde is tattooed on my forearm. That said, I do worry for the future of Classic. I don't believe whether or not Classic dies is up to Blizzard. They did their part and gave us the game, something that people spent ten years fighting for. Blizzard called our bluff and gave us what we claimed to want. If the community abandons Classic 1-4 months in, then J. Allen Brack was right all along and Blizzard should never listen to us again regarding these matters.
---
I think Classic+ will happen and I fear for the worst. I think Blizzard will adopt a voting system that is similar to OSRS and that people will vote for "Quality of Life" changes that will snowball Classic into Battle for Azeroth with a level 60 cap. 
---
I think if Blizzard rolls out polls that a new addition to the game should require an 80% approval rating and the polls should only be accessible to people who have reached level 60. I believe a level 14 stuck in Durotar shouldn't have a say in the future of a game they barely experienced in the first place.
---
I didn't mean to derail into a rant there. I liked that you said Classic was more on the casual side because it was always marketed as a casual game in the first place. It was meant to be a calmer version of EverQuest that was more forgiving and Blizzard nailed that perfectly. Plus, the Mr. T Night Elf mo-hawk commercials really brought WoW into the mainstream and helped it to appeal to a broader audience.
---
Anyway, long live Classic!
---
I know what you mean about feeling more rewarding, I was excited to get a green item last night lol.
---
Okay I'll bite. Proof?
---
Alliance players who level in stonetalon are like horde players who level in ashenvale. It‚Äôs a fucking stupid idea and you only go there if you atleast 4-5 levels above the zone and looking to party.
---
OmniCc Cooldown timer will do what want
---
Meanwhile I accidentally pull two mobs and am about to die, only to see another player come to my rescue... oh wait, nevermind. He's just using as bait to grab the quest objective and let's me die.
---
You can taunt with a 2h equipped, just use your rage for sunders. Do you have your stances easily changeable? You can charge &gt; def &gt; sunder. Make sure to sunder each mob on you at least once then focus the mob you want dead. Rebind your skull marker to something easy, like a wheel or something, and mark what you want dead. Dps usually will focus it.
---
So you just sit there and looking at the gnome all day? Give the gnome a name and login instead
---
Here I am hoping I get Tuesday off so I can play more wow while the hurricanes here
---
Actually on Classic itmis much more reasonable
---
Than on Pservers
---
Did you actually check the options?
---
Escape-&gt;interface-&gt;display. 
---
Show chat bubbles:None.
---
Feral is stupid strong before level cap since they aren't as gear reliant as other melee. They just get straight up really good stat conversions for damage. That and level differences don't help the gnome.
---
Who even gives a single crap about this? What impact does this make in your life? Are you lvl 59 atm?
---
Amen !
---
Even at lvl 9 I find hunter leveling easier than most other classes.
---
correct
---
Ay yo spoiler alert
---
because of layer abusing....

nah, that happens, i open the raid options and i have everything good but still can't see their left side bars...
---
&gt;Layering was implemented to split up the playerbase to avoid lag and other issues
---
No, layering was implemented as a way to handle the inevitable drastic player drop as time goes on.
---
For example, Old School Runescape released to 40k players. [Three months later](http://www.misplaceditems.com/rs_tools/graph/?display=avg&amp;interval=qtr_yr&amp;total=1) it was only 12k.
---
Under normal circumstances, this results in mostly empty servers that need to be merged, which comes with its own set of issues mostly related to name conflicts and server identity.
---
Blizzard tried a different approach: basically stack several servers on top of each other - using layering - and as the population drops with time, less and less layers would be enabled/necessary.
---
The main point here is, is that without layering the servers would never be as big as they are to begin with. So arguing that layering ruins economy because there's several times the normal amount of resources is nonsensical, because multiple layers means multiple players' worth of *entire servers* - demand(number of players) increses supply(number of layers)
---
tl;dr this was a topic discussed to death weeks before Classic release, go away
---
Yes. We'd love that.
---
Yeah... It's everything... In retail grouping seriously hurts my xp/hr and I never do it.
---
In classic I love it because 1) the players talk 2) it matter because these people (assuming they don't quit) I'm stuck with and 3) even though I get a lot less XP the fact we can actually kill mobs easily and get the quest down without a real mana/hp.issue means it's actually faster xp/hr in the long run.
---
I always remembered classic being better than retail but fuck... I've been blown away by how much better it was. It's no surprise when TBC came out I went more casual and rerolled a lot more. 
---
Classic is just perfection. (Obviously there's annoyances) but it is 1000% peak Warcraft.
---
Dat gold do!
---
yeah servers are good but they need more capacity
---
Just a fact.
---
Owls and Carrion Birds both have screech abilities 5o their families.  
---
Yes Owls come with an innate 7% bonus damage for their family, but there are no owls with fast attack speeds.
---
Also you are misinformed, the normalization you are referring to happened in patch 1.9 and was only *movespeed*.  Attack speed normalization for pets did not occur until late Burning Crusade.
---
I hope they never change it tbh.
---
Only party leader could mark targets after the raid icons were added.

Not surprised. My brother got into a dungeon group and they were being total dicks the whole time. It was a group of 3, and my brother wanted to invite our friend to come DPS since they had a spot, and they said no, unless he pays them 1g. They didn't even invite anyone, they just 4 man'd it. Then they demand him to make 100 water and said they wouldn't start til he does. 
---
He ignores all this, during the dungeon the tank is purposely trying to let him pull and die, and healer won't heal. He still sucks it up, tries to get through to get his quest done. Final boss he gets kicked for no reason at all.
---
Everyone upvote this man
---
I didn't catch any GoT references other than him being a gnome. Was this before GRRM wrote GOTs?
---
Restarted the same toon 3 times now. I‚Äôm ready to stop Savoring the journey
---
It genuinely hurts me who accurate this is.

It's leveling time. Diaper up!

I love this so much

Find a chick you can game with.

I popped home a few days over my lunch break this week in hopes that I could hop in queue, and by the time I got home I would be mostly thru the queue.
---
Only to find out that most people apparently don't wake up until 1pm because the queues didn't exist until then &gt;.&gt;
---
As a paladin i heal people in need as I pass. Res people when I see them die and give them my 5min buffs whenever I pass them. Just handing out good vibes. It's great, me and a warrior who needed help on a quest ended up playing together for a couple hours and started talking. Nobody is trying to min max. Just a dwarf Warrior and his paladin friend killing troggs and bears. I had more fun doing that than playing the Majority of BFA.
---
wow ived been using 1h and shield for dungeons all this time. so 2h is going to be better for me?
---
Wotlk was still an incredible experience. It was only after wotlk where it started going downhill
---
For Classic, there's always the whole 'we need to get to dungeons, to battlegrounds and so on'.
---
Less bound to cities in general.
---
Don‚Äôt blame the pet, blame the hunter,
---
I'm not sure how that's relevant to my point.  The game doesn't have any content to interact with while flying.
---
Shaman reminds me of [Breed - Revenge of the Windfury II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2V6Q075DvU), a sequel to the PvP movie [Creed - Revenge of the Windfury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLrrXaTq1Yc)

Is the tukUI add on on the twitch/curse app?

 or just on their own client like I have for retail?

I swear I‚Äôm not lazy, I‚Äôm just at work. Lol

---
Happy it works for you, but I hope you get kicked and let someone else in haha.
---
I've been loving this. I was questing as a drood yesterday tanking and rescued another drood in a cave and then we quested a few levels together as a healer/tank combo it was so much more fun than having soloed it.
---
What is the name of your questing add on with list of step ?
---
Man I would not spend a gold to fix a point or two. Not until post-40 at least.
---
I admit it would really suck e.g. as a warrior if you grabbed a fury point by mistake, since that's a whole extra level tou have to wait for Mortal Strike but really not that big a deal.
---
Lol no it isn‚Äôt. You can find similarities in literally anything and say it‚Äôs ‚Äútoo real‚Äù if you discount literally everything else. 
---
America has its fair share of fucked up shit, and so does each country.  The vast, overwhelming majority of the people in each country are good folks.
---
Your reputation standing gives discount on prices/services. Just like in regular WoW. 5% friendly, 10% honoured, 15% revered, 20% exalted. If you are honoured with Darnassus I would go back there and train there or in Stormwind in the Park. Though one of the NE druid trainer is classified as Stormwind faction. The other ones are Darnassus
---
I think 3 weeks give or take is a good pace to hit 60. Getting pre-raid bis can either go quick or take awhile depending on how lucky you get with drops and how quickly you're able to find groups.
---
So leveling 1-60 then pre-raid bis I feel about a month and a half would be a good timeframe.
---
But at the same time I don't feel like completely full pre-raid bis is absolutely necessary to start working through MC.
---
Given everything we know now I feel like MC will be cleared quicker and with lesser geared people.
---
Obviously some guilds will still struggle until people get geared up, but serious raiders who are generally better at preparation, play their class, and have better raid awareness won't be as held back by gear.
---
What is the UI Addon you‚Äôre using?
---
What do you mean?
---
Sword and shield Works fine.
---
The main wow had the 1 hour refund quality of life
---
I would say your secondary setup makes more sense. Great with the Engineering but taloring + enchanting makes a great combo to have on one character.

can u maybe re-post a "fixed" version?
---
I prefer: mo work?

Must‚Äôve been no lifeing since launch
---
All this in 5 days?
---
Aaah thanks guys I am bit noobish in this gane
---
I can read it just fine?
---
this came out after TBC came out...
---
There are a few great addons including recount for classic on legacy-wow.com
---
It's the original art director. Classic wouldn't be the same without this icon
---
I'd think about it this way, is $17 worth one month of a game? If you get even 5 or 6 hours of play out of it and decide that it's not for you, you still got your money's worth compared to say, going to the movies. I've certainly dropped $60 on a AAA, played an hour, and then never picked it up again. By that metric a month of an MMO is cheap.
---
Yes blizzard see that kind of thing as a breach of TOS
---
Just taunt and tab sunder
---
Idk you guys just don‚Äôt understand that you want Azeroth armor and non player interactive content. Smh. You guys are ruining wow with your not wants.
---
For leveling, armor stamina and growl are all you need. Dungeons and later raids, you'll need the resistances.
---
Also: TURN GROWL OFF WHEN GROUPED. &lt;3
---
"very difficult to level" lol stop being clicker.
---
You do, only much less. But it's still more xp/time efficient to do it in a raid group. That's why many players from method and other streamers are farming the dungeons in raid groups because they can pull a whole ton of mobs at once and aoe/cleave them down.
---
True, but the fact he slept only 6 hours and 5 hours on a total of 92 is suspicious. Sorry if my wording was not proper, non native speaker here.
---
WotLK was way to easy mode though. I understand that people say that Vanilla is easy... but I literally would pull an entire instance in WotLK and wouldn't die. WotLK had a few good things, but my unpopular opinion is that it sucked other than Ulduar / PVP / Lore.
---
Levelling from 70-80 in WotLK felt like a rush and was a lot more streamlined, similar to the more recent expansions. I cherished levelling a lot more in Vanilla and TBC...
---
&gt; I swear this seems to be working as intended. I remember not using my pet in bgs because I'd go to feign and my pet would keep me combat locked.
---
It's not the pet, there's a delay between pressing FD and combat actually dropping.
---
That‚Äôs fine, but nobody should be surprised when they lose viewers because they‚Äôre not giving people anything new to watch.
---
LOL look at this guy making dumb as fuck demands to the wowsubreddit.

AH and chat channel don't seem to be layered
---
Stupid question, to hats with your key bindings? Are you using a gamepad or something like the razor Naga?
---
Legit man
---
Isn't layering going to be taken out after phase 1? How long can we expect phase 1 to last? Would it be worth the time to amend an issue which will only persist for another month or two? Right now we have no world bosses to layer to, and most of the best loot comes from dungeons.
---
Damn u got swiped mate
---
There is a possibility yes but I have used mouse macro for ~5 years in about 10 games, including wow. So chances are very very slim to get banned for it. Unless you show it on YouTube or twitch with your toon name etc.

I can't wait for vulkan to replace directx.. lol. I've also heard that DX12 runs so poorly that DXVK can outperform it because the translation layer is more efficient than the native calls but I'm not an expert on it

Thank you! I have died approximately... 35 times now, levelling solo as a warrior is rubbish- even with my (also warrior) friend we died plenty haha

Tauren are natural born sprinters, VERY dangerous over short distances!

jealous of what ?  that he spend half of his life in private servers grinding this shit for this few days ?
---
The game is designed this way on purpose.  Heroic raids, Mythic raids, mythic dungeons, and Ilvl are all elitist ideas.  Raider IO and warcraft logs are things that were added because they were added.  People won't let you in a heroic pug unless you're curved and won't take you on a dungeon without 1k rio and 400 ilvl.  If they want the game to feel more like an mmo they need to remove sharding and a lot of the extra realms to get people onto the same realms.
---
True! Sorry for my wording, I‚Äôm a non native speaker. I salute the achievement but still, a few things are fishy:
---
- no webcam
---
- 11 hours of sleep (6 + 5) in 92 hours
---
We will never be able to prove it however.

Give him a moment for pitys sake!

Auto-attacking and shooting are different abilities. You wouldn't be able to make a macro to detect range and use what's optimal. Best I could suggest is setting the actionbar button you have shoot on to activate with a right click, but then no melee auto-attacks. Realistically though, if you're a wand using class, wands will do more damage, as you aren't gonna want to be building strength.
---
 It's a good small sign but looking at the bigger picture Activision Blizzard is far away from the highs.
---
Same as me. I always run to the human starting zone because I know it best and can level the fastest.
---
That's a bit misguided and even Jeff Kaplan said so at Blizzcon. Something like: "Only a tiny percentage saw Naxxramas, but it still motivated lower tier'd players to know there is something waiting for them. Not everybody has to experience something for it to have an effect on the world."
---
Its been very true im only lvl 22 and i had never leveled before cata and i gotta say this is what i wanted out of a game for so long
---
Engineering costs a lot to level and doesn‚Äôt make you much back in return.  I don‚Äôt think your one miner will support two engineers so you‚Äôll be spending even more to gain the necessary mats. If you‚Äôre ready for that, looks good to me.
---
Not a single comment about gear-score in sight!
---
The devs have explicitly addresses this lol, its gone before phase 2. Google is your friend
---
I'm pretty certain they're not.
---
Try: https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/
---
You can filter down to one handed axes. Doesn‚Äôt have the comments like classidb so sometimes is annoying but also doesn‚Äôt have misleading info from 2.0+ content.
---
The gear existed, it just wasn't tier gear.
---
Source : I was Ret in TBC from Karazhan until Sunwell.
---
Yeah I dinged 20 on my mage yesterday, can confirm it wasn't great for my wallet. You can also get the teleport:Org (or SW) spell then, which is another cost, not to mention the reagent cost
---
this is really salient and true  
---
game mechanics encourage it but also there's a passive expectation of like "everyone is nice here because they have to be, so i'll be nice too"
---
I would play if it didn‚Äôt need a subscription.
---
My parents were still together.
---
How is that controller addon? Seems like it would be pretty cool for kicking back and questing with. Can you make binding for multiple button presses? Like A+B taunts, LT+RT uses charge, etc.?
---
The gear existed, it just wasn't tier gear. Being neutered without a windfury totem was a bigger issue, albeit shared with all other melee.
---
Yes this is just evidence for a ban hammer let these kids keep posting it.
---
Fuck that‚Äôs adorable

Some cultures might classify this as a world 2nd.

There‚Äôs 1.12 recount on the twitch app.

Thank you sir, as a new warrior this is very helpful

Yoooooooo. I haven't had time to try but wall jumping still works? Legitimately one of my favorite things to do. Where did you start your route?
---
I‚Äôm just imagining Metzen going in as Ret in a high level dungeon and the other group members give him shit, like ‚Äúgod you‚Äôre doing horrible dps what are you new to this game?!‚Äù

Lmao that‚Äôs fucked bro ahaha

Do you even see the Ah? 8 mean every everyone is doing that. The tier 1 and 2 gathering mats are overflowing

I grinded as hard as I could just to get 21 to go back to Darkshore for this pet. It wouldn't be classic for me without my childhood pet. I feel you op

This was my Shadow Priest's weapon from 35 until I got Anathema. Also gotta get that 30 spell power enchant on it!
---
*sniff* YOU‚ÄôRE CRYING! *sob*
---
The game is designed this way on purpose.  Heroic raids, Mythic raids, mythic dungeons, and Ilvl are all elitist ideas.  Raider IO and warcraft logs are things that were added because they were added.  People won't let you in a heroic pug unless you're curved and won't take you on a dungeon without 1k rio and 400 ilvl.  If they want the game to feel more like a mmo they need to remove sharding and a lot of the extra realms to get people onto the same realms. Also, the level squish would probably help as well.
---
You could literally look like this in retail
---
Yep, you are right to be enhance, that's the leveling spec, and leveling is one of the only times it's useful. It falls off really hard at 60. 
---
1. Priests have a lot more tools, and I wouldn't say they heal any more than a shaman. Shadow priests are very mana efficient and have very few mana issues, unlike shaman. If you're in a group try to save all your mana for heals and totems. You are one of the worst classes in the game for dps, even if you do decent damage while leveling. Just get used to it.
---
2. You're going to be drinking allot, it's a fairly slow class. Searing totem is actually cheaper than flame shock. Keep your totems down, flame shock to pull, then just melee it to death. Your spirit will start working and you'll gain more mana.
---
3. Use fewer spells and spend more time regening.
---
4. You get mail at 40. 
---
I was a shaman in vanilla and was dismayed to find the only raiding spec for them is resto. I wish someone told me then before I hit 60, so I'm telling people now. If you want a damage class or something that levels faster shaman is not for you.
---
aww dude 4 strength 4 stam leather belt

I might be going to their show on November and I'm wondering if I scream FOR THE ALLIANCE, will I come back home alive
---
Originally the party leader could mark by either right clicking the portrait and choose a mark or could be done via keybindings. I used F1, F2, F3 etc for my marking which worked very well!
---
I am in the same boat. Find a solution?
---
Layering was only really used to avoid people streamsniping which is fairplay imo, at most he saved 1 min between aoe each pull, and that's stretching it, because his zones were vastly uncontested anyways he could've just moved a bit and had another full pack to kill.
---
I started rezzing people who die in the Barrens, because the walk from the graveyard is insanely long.
---
Telling people to fuck off is crybaby behaviour.
---
Not the same person you were talking to earlier.
---
Looks like my post must have *offended* you to get such a strong reaction out of you. If something annoys you just ignore it don't be a snowflake who has to voice how they feel.
---
How tho
---
Layering isn't in retail but they don't give a shit about if you use sharding or realm hopping or whatever
---
Troooooooth
---
can confirm, we formed lines on the wrong layers as well
---
I mean, 20 silver is 20 silver
---
That's one way to alienate and make people who never played classic before feel unwelcome, I guess.
---
If layering was removed the queue times would explode. It isn't possible.
---
Is this the legendary classic difficulty?
---
Sounds like a smart argument if I hadn't made a few hundred thousand gold healing 10 carry runs so far this season. I doubt any of the guys paying for carries have been doing it every season for 12 years. Their IO's look good, but their DPS sure doesn't.
---
That‚Äôs not how it works homeboy.
---
A druid
---
How about you do a macro for Defensive Stance in which you equip your sword+shield when you enter defensive. And then you just use shield bash as normal. 
---
Same thing when you switch back to the other stances, do a macro in which you equip the other weapons
---
Druids are fine. I've had so many people argue this against me... We shred clothies like a rogue while leveling and at 60 we rely on attrition and out lasting and out cc'ing an opponent.
---
Nice name
---
"Are those the pants?"

Ask her if she‚Äôll play with you sometimes.  You can level an alt with her character.

Apples and Oranges don‚Äôt compare well

Do you know if that works for buffs as well?

I pay rent now so that sucks.

But hey at least I can go buy ice cream whenever I want.

I‚Äôm a little late to this thread, but I completely agree. They kept the dream alive for years and years.

Ah yes, one of those people who only do things to be recognized and praised, not because they‚Äôre genuinely nice and want to help.

Nah it‚Äôs all about the succubae

A) see the picture first. B) wince a little bit. C) read caption. D) look again at picture. E) slowly nod in agreement as a Shammy main. F) let out a small sigh with chuckle. G) feel bad. H) chuckle again.
---
Oh well there ya have it! He is a reference himself then!
---
Same here. The questing is the hardest shit ive ever done in a pve game. Then i ran into a random and we paired up to quest together. Was awesome
---
Why do you assumed it's the Brazilians being racist?
---
I have a friend that‚Äôs been doing this in Scarlet Monastery the last couple days. They go in with 7-8 and can clear each wing in under 30 minutes. They use a healer and have a Druid or paladin for off heals. A main tank and an off tank to grab strays. Mages to aoe. It‚Äôs pretty effective.
---
Yep, same! :-/
---
that is all i type? dont need to put the weapon/shield name or its ID or anything?
---
Lol implying druids don't need spirit.
---
What is the add on that tells you the vendor price?
---
And LFG was fucking amazing when it launched TBH. It was much-needed, especially for people who played on lower-pop servers. Most of my time running dungeons in Wrath was spent in trade looking for more people to run dungeons with. I'd spend 5 hours playing WoW and 3 of them were spamming trade.
---
Damn EU Internet...
---
You just need to ask -- I usually give healers 2x20 stacks unless I'm a x0 level, because then I only make 2 at a time right after training it. Everyone else gets one stack unless they speak up.
---
Wait don't mobs reset aggro after a while?

Brb gonna see a doctor because my eyes rolled way more than they should be able to

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cxvwis/what_class_are_you_seeing_the_most/).

Serious question: how are new layers formed? I thought it was so weird that first 60 guy's guild could make new layers for him to use. How do they force a new layer in a barely populated zone?
---
If there are only 20 people in that zone, why not put them all in the same layer?
---
I don't know where you got that to be defening blizzard i am saying that remote desktop to que in and keep yourself online is not the same as those guys being perma online due to bots scripts or macros wich should get banned 24 or 72h as a warning.  
---
It is not helping anyone. I mean blizz hugely underestimated the popularity of classic but that is no excuse to lock up the ques that are there.
---
Any recommendations?
---
then it would be a 2 macros, i would much rather group all of them up because the purpose is to interrupt only not to sit on the stance, my 2h damage is alot better for now while solo questing, dont realy need the 1h+shield gameplay atm!
---
Hecking?
---
Why, oh, why is consecration in the holy tree?
---
He's also the lead singer of Elite Tauren Chieften
---
Didnt get have someone else play his character as well? Sounds like cheating imo
---
Classic WoW honestly feels so different coming into it off BFA rather than coming into it right after Warcraft 3.
---
It‚Äôs a hard thing to explain, but like I remember thinking back then ‚Äúhow are night elves ok with questing with mages? Wouldnt they want to murder them?‚Äù Now it‚Äôs just like eh lol
---
21 is the perfect time to start Stonetalon, the first couple quests will be green but it climbs fast.  Easy 3 levels in just 2 hours if you do it right.
---
increasing the max level, according to the precedent set in tbc, makes questing to hit the new max level somewhat imperative and forces players to at least experience some of the story of the new expansion
---
Haha yes! I helped y‚Äôall do the quests outside the instance before I had to dip
---
Dawg, Teldrassil right after the Third War, this Satyr we called Hoofbeat Harry brings me some owl wings with no sauce and I just send it back cause Darnassian Bleu or fuck your mother.

YES IT'S BANNABLE! Holy fuck people stop setting up your fucking fans as an auto clicker, It's like its fucking 2004 and we're playing runescape. You might as well download some software buddy
---
RPPVP servers are full of interesting shenanigans
---
I abused the layering system on accident by running in and out of a dungeon.
---
Flying to sentinel hill and then swimming downriver can be faster than darkshire if you are going straight to Nes.
---
&gt;No danger of a daze or pvp just fly high and no punishment for afking in pvp zones....

*laughs in PoM + sheep*
---
I've already had a super good experience from a shaman tanking RFC and WC. They can certainly tank those lower ones with a good group. I love seeing a shaman tank
---
Lvl 30 as priest. Went in with 12g. Came out with 2. And I dont train 5 spells. Damnnnnnnnn
---
I‚Äôm leveling a priest rn and it‚Äôs an absolute blast! Spirit tap is just so good there‚Äôs almost never downtime
---
Gotta pay for every single teleport location?
---
Yeah I'm going to start doing this. It's just too expensive.
---
Modern problems require modern solutions.
---
Was this not a common thing? Ive only ever played ESO, but this sounds pretty accurate. I guess thank you to WoW for setting the stage?
---
Hey, take a downvote. Not bannable, but a mighty shitty thing to do if you're not going to be playing for a while.
---
This is going to start a transmog trend lol.
---
But it is not going to help the tank get aggro back if it is on another player aswell and he keeps running away in threat.
---
Yeah.. I‚Äôm enjoying it while I can, but I have a full time job and I am taking college classes online at full time credit-hours. Classes start again in a week so I will be very limited on time.
---
Imagine being on the Retail WoW team and having to read all this praise about Classic. Read from the original creators of the game what the game was good and that today has no more ... I hope they learn and in the next expansion improve.
---
Clearly that Little Lion is for the Alliance!
---
Gonna be honest not something I wanted to read today lol
---
That‚Äôs when you get the crew down in all tier 1
---
If you mind control a target and do /e you can speak to the horde.

Can i choose blacksmithing + enchanting for warrior?
---
I typed a long reply but then Reddit mobile ate it. I was in a party with 2 warriors and a healer and we had pulled 3 elite level 19 mobs and the warriors died and I was able to tank and dps the last mob with a level 16 rogue down from half health. It required using my cooldowns like evasion and I had to gouge and bandage at one point and I also always use armor kits and food. Didn't have a potion though. I really like rogue, they always were dealt a good hand in vanilla.
---
Also travel to another leveling zone you don't have to do the undead areas. Take the zeppelin to Org.
---
You lose durability and need to repair your items which costs money.
---
I think I'd just blankly and emotionlessly stare at my screen for like 5 minutes if I did that.
---
And here goes OP taking all this dude's reddit points like a douche. Could have at least let the guy post it himself.
---
Uh not really no lol. Literally pretty much everything has things in common and you can easily say "oof too real" if you choose to ignore everything else they don't have in common. Did you know that both Nazi Germany and Canada have treated minorities poorly in the past? Oof a little too real Canada is now a fascist dictatorship :(
---
Every country on this planet has it's fair share of dark history. At least today a lot of them, such as America, Germany, Belgium, Canada, and so on, atone or at least try to for their sins of the past. Not only that, but the vast majority of people are good folk trying live their lives. Their governments might do fucked up things, but the ultra rich and 1% aren't a good reflection of the average individual. It's extremely unfair, save for a few countries such as Russia or China, to paint a country black or white and say that it's bad or good.
---
The Orcs as well as much of the Horde are pretty fucking evil, and have shown that time and time again. None of that I have said can really be said for them. In like every expansion they have been the aggressor of something negative. One of my favorite things is the false dilemma Sylvanas always would whine about that they need the Valkyr otherwise her people would die out. So what? There is nothing wrong with the Forsaken dying out. They aren't dying out because they are living creatures that need to eat, breed, and thrive. They're dying out because they're dead and can't make more unless they continue to force people from the dead to undeath, against their will &amp; without their consent. The death of the Forsaken isn't a humanitarian problem or a real issue. Their existence is the result of dark magic, nothing more.
---
The fact that the Alliance is holding back is comical and only exists because it would be boring if they decided to act realistic and completely fucking annihilate the Horde - which they should absolutely do. Tauren  are the only people on the Horde who are even remotely redeemable, and I honestly can't think of anything horrible they have done or continue to do.
---
Greedisgood 10000
---
This is the reason there‚Äôs so many queuesüôÑ
---
Without a doubt! I had every intention of just grinding my arms warrior to 60 the old-fashioned way, but I've been roped into RFC, SFK, WC, BFD runs by so many people looking for group, I'm thinking of just going prot all the way to 60 for the lulz.
---
But I'd miss out on a lot of questing gold that I'd have to go back and do anyway. Annoying.
---
Does anyone know when they‚Äôll be back up?
---
Its considered botting and there are checks to catch ppl doing this.
---
In my experience Skeram Barrens has been free of that bullshit.
---
It‚Äôs been less than a week...
---
The secret does not lay in the xp gain, it's the speed in which you clear dungeons. Which is what makes it quite efficient
---
Yes if your group xp is cut. If you are a way higher level it gets cut again. If you don't group and you kill his mob it gets cut
---

ive never spent 6 hours getting a group for anything in vanilla and ive played since launch. I have of course, spent time getting groups together to see it fall apart, but not after 6 hours, . Maybe for something like an MC pug, but those are a bad idea.
---
Not bannable. And reddit gets mad about it because it‚Äôs not like there are 10 other servers with no queue
---
5 person is way faster, my group has slowly outleveled all the 10 man groups that have been running because they just end up gimped for exp
---
It may actually have been easier. If you screenshot it in the PC he'd probably have to go find the file and then upload it. On the phone, just take the pic directly in whatever reddit app you use and post it.
---
That must me mostly uninformed ppl then. Method as a guild never was in the race nor they ever claimed to be in the race. 
---
What is happening here is the business Method covering the race to 60 and first to rag / ony. This is not the guild method though. 
---
They are following ppl from Progress from their studio, but also ppl like Esfand, tipsout, guzu. They basicly have a streamer ensemble from different guilds (both pserver players and also players that didn't play for years)  in their studio combined with casters but they never raced as the guild Method. As of now one of the players in their studio (Kennymarch) from Progress that is in competition for ragnaros.  
---
But why ppl think Method as a guild was racing kind of baffles me, from the first moment they started their coverage they said they were not racing under the Method guiild banner. But just covering other guilds / players in their respective races.
---
I didn't say a waste of 'time's, I said life wasted.
---
Just started playing priest im going all in holy right now should I talent this? it looks amazing for mana regen
---
Just call it a gnomish invention and you're good
---
You can assign random intervals to some autoclickers, would this be a safer way?
---
So go arms and starting at 30 you can kill a mob by just auto attacking to fill your rage bar and then use sweeping strikes and kill two mobs faster that you‚Äôd kill 1 with cleave you spec for sweeping strikes and it makes your cleave on two targets hit both Twice you want to be arms anyways for early pvp and axe spec and then sword spec if you‚Äôre lucky and get stoneslayer from uldaman
---
Arcane Intellect absolutely devastates our mana (less so the closer we get to the next rank), so we very much appreciate...appreciation.
---
Fortunately top server guild doesn‚Äôt really mean squat right now. People don‚Äôt realize that being dicks right now will just backfire. My 20 guildees and I already have a few people each on our ‚Äúshitlist‚Äù, a couple of overlaps as well, that we know not to group with. If a whole guild starts becoming notorious for being dicks, all of their members will start having trouble finding or forming non-guild only groups. This was the beauty of Vanilla.
---
Will be hard and expensive to level as you level

Geez I wanted to make a meme like this but I couldn't figure out what to reference :D good job OP
---
Not really.  He exploited the system to get it.
---
&gt; this was a topic discussed to death weeks before Classic release
---
And I remember people specifically complaining that players would exploit the system exactly like this.
---
Disable the blizzard one maybe?
---
I was able to play a lot but my friends are split on two factions/servers so I've been dividing my time and they're mostly outleveling me.
---
breaking news tab says an hour
---
*tries to shrug*
---
Grobbulus feels like America right now. 
---
There are a ton of assholes, lots of pvp players, lots of RPers and a few hardcore PvE guilds.
---
It is a melting pot of all the best aspects of WoW and I love it. Me and my friends have new stories every day about our interaction with one or another group of these different types of players.
---
Not being able to find stuff is fun. 
---
Reading the quest log and having to follow a river to find a corpse is fun. 
---
Joining up with strangers to kill Hogger is fun.
---
I'm sorry you weren't raised right.
---
Drive by dots too. I'll toss a serpent sting on mobs others are fighting while I rip around with aspect of the cheetah
---
Yeah, and then people like me explained to them how fucking nonsensical that was.
---
I tried to convince my wife to invest when Diablo Immortal was announced.  I knew it would go bs k up when Classic was released.  But we just didn‚Äôt have the funds to have money tied up for that long.
---
Though admittedly, the stocks didn‚Äôt go up as much as I anticipated.
---
The servers are busy, so it‚Äôs easier to find mobs that don‚Äôt have friends with them. Any time my warrior needs a quest and I‚Äôm wondering how I‚Äôm going to break that camp, someone wanders by and I ask them if they need this quest too. I‚Äôve thrown on a shield and gone defensive stance out in the world a lot, you and a few dps can kill a lot without a healer.
---
1. Did quests
---
2. Didn't layer swap every 10 minute
---
3. Didn't mass farm
---
I consider him world first. Jokerd were just exploiting, as his record is not achievable in a classical situation

Right now those items are only worth a couple gold tho...they will be worth 500g once twinks are a thing. Nobody has 500g

You can create your own guides and it comes with a bunch of built in guides. I copied Joana's guide into it myself and changed the coordinate format so that I get markers on the map and a directional arrow at the top.

Turns out I‚Äôm better at video games now than I was 15 years ago, but I also didn‚Äôt have a wife back then

40 is like 40-50 hours efficiently. If they took the week off, that's only 8-10 hours a day. 
---
I am in a similar boat to you, level 19 but I couldnt get into the game Tues/Wed.
---
No it's not fairplay, if you want to have the advantages of streaming and making thousands of dollars cheating to offset the negatives isn't fair.
---
Why the fuck would you shave a gorgeous cat like that?
---
Nailed it
---
Lol, picturing him sending "decline" messages in reply.
---
Someone said it already and now I can't find it and I don't know how resource intensive it would be but tiered (I guess is the word maybe not) servers with different versions would be great. Not every patch but more along the lines of here is all the stuff the community wants from classic and these are the servers. Same with BC and Wrath.
---
EVERYONE GETS UNENDING BREATH

It looks like wow-pro leveling guide from that box after you tell it to show all steps instead of just next in line.
---
Oh my god I remember that and I only played WoW for a few months!!! Brings back memories hahahaha
---
&gt; An 8,000 queue on Firemaw disagrees.
---
That's completely irrelevant.
---
1. Servers back in the day such as Darkspear, Arthas, etc, had thousands-long queue times
---
2. Queues will slowly degrade as Blizzard adds more servers.
---
3. At the moment on most servers, queues only exist during prime time.
---
4. Queues don't have anything to do with layering. Layering does nothing to alleviate queue times. It's simply there to cause players less difficulty waiting for mobs, ores, and other shared resources. This all has to do with how closely clumped together players are.
---
I hope you're just trolling, and not actually that level of dumb.
---
 Go ahead and /who 45 on your own faction then ask your self what the chances of you running into a horde player 45+.
---
I absolutely despise becoming someone‚Äôs personal healbot. This is low level content there‚Äôs no reason for me to have to forego dps entirely in deadmines. 
---
No I will not stop wanding to heal that 15% damage you took by being an idiot.
---
About 30 minutes of your time.
---
Aren't chats layer only?
---
This is why layering is going to be removed in phase 2. Idk why people would try to plan this shit in phase 1 knowing full well this is likely to happen.
---
Hell yea brother, cheers from Taurajo
---
I was under the impression layering does help with queues, if combined with server capacity?
---
I had someone steal my chest in Barrens yesterday when I was killing harpies.
---
The player later apologized for stealing it and helped me with the harpies for the next 15min.
---
So to the undead rogue on Razorgore Europe, you can have the rest of my chests until I reach level 60
---
We'll see how long that lasts.
---
This has to be the most wholesome thing I've ever read in my life. Tears man, tears.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as big of a deal as most put it. I would rather have healthy populated servers in phase 2 when they remove layers, when it‚Äôs actually important and the world bosses can‚Äôt be farmed multiple times.
---
People are literally butt hurt someone got to 60 fast.
---
I had the same happen with some jackass peddling his shitty music in LA.  Scummy scammers.
---
Hit your friendly warrior up with these too. Helps level weapon skills.
---
Yesterday I was questing, needed just one mob in a pack of 3.
---
Lightning bolted the mob, burned it down quickly, dropped stoneclaw totem and took off running.  I was perfectly safe and wasn't going to get anywhere near dieing.
---
Apparently a hunter attacked the mobs behind me because I got the tell.
---
"You're welcome, I GUESS."
---
...uh...if thanks are the only reason you're 'helping' someone, just don't.
---
He did it before on pservers but still was at about 3 days played everytime.
---
I'd say he could've done it faster or slower depending on several factors tbh
---
I guess Runescape classical is the go to reference here. Where they forked off the development cycle and specially the design philosophy.
---
That ele resto build is pretty gimped as a healer. You're missing 30 resto talents, and even with those shaman isn't close to priest healing abilities.
---
Maybe Hunter or other dps classes. Mage, lock (shards problems are overstated) would work fine too.
---
Shadow priests are pretty amazing grinders and dominate world pvp.
---
Seal twisting isn‚Äôt worth it leveling, crap dies too fast.
---

Try using one of those laptop stands with a fan on it.

Sorry, didn't mean to imply they didn't. I simply meant that some types of mobile development can yeild such great profits with such little input that it's easier to imagine a scenario in which someone who doesn't really care for video games goes into game development for a cash grab. I know a few mobile devs and they definitely care about their products.
---
This is so good. Fantastic work as always from carbot
---
Sharding has largely addressed this.
---
You see a decent number of people while leveling on retail, you just have no reason to interact with them.
---
Cruel Barb from Van Cleef, replaced it at 39. It still felt like a decent weapon at 35.
---
Interesting.  I really hope it works out for you, but seems rather perilous.  Would be nice to hear an update after a few months.

This has been talked to death before classic released.
---
The game will be fine.
---
If the game and economy will be trashed by then if this is not implemented, then just leave right now because this is never going to be a thing.
---
Yeah I've been leveling with frostbolt now instead since this morning, was actually better with the slow keeping them from slowing down my attack
---
They are trying to get people to play retail again.
---
&gt;tl;dr this was a topic discussed to death weeks before Classic release, go away
---
Please. There were lots of valid arguments against layering and lots of alternative methods proposed to addressing population drops. It's not like we came to some sort of consensus as a community before the release.
---
I feel this in my soul.
---
Depends on time and day but top 4 servers seems to be similar on queues
---
You won't be able to do that
---
One more time?
---
The reverse for me NA -&gt; EU for years with 120~ ping as well.
---
I went on NA for classic though just for this reason now at 65~
---
Casual PvP won't be that harsh however let me tell you the delay is painful on many scenario like Kick-counterspell / attacking people from back = RNG so you miss/parry more often etc. casting at the 'same time' and the spell doesn't go hurt.
---
Some of TBC end game elements needed flying. Like the apex quests, shatari sky guards and the legendary netherwing quests. I just think flying should have more restrictions. Perhaps enforcing no fly zones at random times in different zones with a pvp based objective with nice rewards.
---
Personally I prefered TBC, so I'm waiting and hoping they bring that back. Classic for me is too dull. Tbc took all the good of vanilla and made it better. Once people get to 60 their attitudes will become more negative
---
Hell yeah!
---
Nope and nope
---
Remember Snape kills Dumbledore?
---
To me, retail feels like a single player RPG that gives you the option to play co-op for certain things. Classic feels like a true MMORPG, a real virtual world that is inhabited by other people who actually interact with each other.
---
Wouldn't recommend smithing without mining.
---
You can make tons of money just selling ores and gems, even.
---
2 different groups....
---
Edit: still could‚Äôve easily been 2 different groups lol and is probably more likely.
---
Of course you need to put in the actual weapon name
---
Shift click should paste the name, make sure it's in your bag
---
[here's the comercial](https://youtu.be/9jOTvnK0kbs)
---
Feral DPS have to run away often
---
Only on private servers. On retail vanilla and Classic mobs won't leash if you keep attacking them while kiting.
---
I believe that all these problems will go away in time as player counts dwindle.
---
Also... that "exploit" isn't as bad as everyone thinks. A drop in the bucket which allows some dedicated people to lvl faster... Big deal.
---
What are those pc's you are playing on? Look nice and compact
---
It's against a mage.
---
You're a clown
---
Reddit broken, discord broken, wow broken, wowhead broken. "You think you want it but you actually don't"
---
That's all true but if you know before you start that if you will have to be a holy paladin, or whatever specs are viable, why should that matter? Yeah the diff specs use similar gear for other classes' specs, but all their specs arent viable for end game content. Demonology warlock, sub rogue, etc arent going to be used in raids iirc. So you're basically pointing out that some obsolete builds use the same gear in the non hybrid classes. At the end of the day it's not just hybrid classes that have obselete specs.
---
I have about 8 gold at 24 just playing normally, buying all skills, and buying upgrades from AH.

Every time.

---
You don‚Äôt have to be a chef to know this food sucks.

I upvoted every single one

That's just it: players around 20-25 have jobs and responsibilities, possibly even neglecting those. Everyone higher is taking vacation for WoW or not employed.
---
Was done like 4 months ago
---
I don‚Äôt get it.  You‚Äôre dodging buffs?
---
The two time! u mad dog
---
Gotta pick a gathering profession to make money leveling. Skinning here and have 40g @ lvl32
---
It's been discussed before and never was a reason given for why near infinite farming of rare resources by exploiters wouldn't cause economy issues.
---
Good times breed weak men. Week men bring bad times. Bad times breed strong men. Strong men bring good times.
---
As a Shaman, what have you skipped? The only things I‚Äôve thought weren‚Äôt useful are firebrand/frostbrand weapon, and rank 2 Stoneclaw. I‚Äôve barely saved anything!
---
It's literally happening Rn.
---
Holy shit nice! Here I am having trouble paying for my class skills.
---
i can see this but ive also run around starter zones leveling professions 
---
there are some people but it does not feel like a server with a many hour queue that is full
---
does that make sense 
---
layers should be more dynamic so if there is only 100 level 35 or 45 ish players on it will group them together 
---
and towns like stormwind and if should not have layering at all or the least possible while letting people get 60 fps
---
Must be nice- ggzz
---
You always could, but you can't do your quests if you do that.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt skip renew.  It‚Äôs an instant cast heal.  It‚Äôs pretty awesome for when mobs are beating you as you try to run through then.  It‚Äôs great for PvP.  It‚Äôs a core priest talent.
---
Damn near all tanks while leveling will be in dps spec because it‚Äôs hell to level otherwise. Sometimes I‚Äôve noticed they rock their dual wield to make the trash go by faster and hold more threat but that‚Äôs usually if they out lvl the place. I‚Äôve never seen it be an issue for the healer tho.
---
Doesn‚Äôt excuse them being dicks however. Just tryin to offer some insight on why some people play like that. It is doable not just in retail, even if it‚Äôs a bit harder. It‚Äôs up to the tank to use common sense and not strain the healer. It‚Äôs also up to the healer to speak up about the speed of pulls.
---
Down for 15 minutes, the restarts are taking place over an hour period. Not all servers down at same time either. Helps to read just like reading your quests in classic
---
This
---
That timeline isn't worth saving
---
Why, his binds?
---
I use a 12-button mouse (Logitech Scimitar, there's also stuff like the Razer Naga) and keep my binds akin to that with shift + control modifiers for top right/left bars.
---
Works just fine IMO.
---
You can 10 man them
---
It does.

Friendly reminder alliance, back to school savings end soon!

And if you are alone and can‚Äôt get help, just leave the area, they will get bored and you can come back later.  PVP leveling 101.
---
Apart from point 3, you are absolutly wrong on all points!
---
Sorry I meant to put journeyman which is the next one I think.. I assumed the trainer would be in stormwind
---
I get your point but this is wow. He's on a pvp server and streaming his location. Get ganked, fair play.
---
What class ya pick?
---
You can't do quests and exp will be terrible so what's the point
---
The most satisfying thing for me is *seeing* my damage and stats go up and the impact it makes. Not a chart telling me im doing 2% more damage, but when I went from rank 1 to rank 2 shadow bolt, I could **feel** how much harder I was hitting, I could **feel** how much tankier that +3 stam wrist was making me.
---
Ease up boi, just a meme

Yup. Exactly. Especially when you have multiple projects due right before finals...

I really hope they are wrong.

Sounds like Horde

Would it be worth to swap now?

Same. There are loads of quests that I just had to give up on because I was wasting more time dying (I'm a warrior) than making progress.

Same on Herod barrens chat. Actually been chill and funny af but nothing even close to out of hand.

Druids can burst fine / can always duel mages easily

Nothing is "happening".

Read my post again.

Try to understand it.
---
If you can't, no one can help you. Stop posting.
---
I think there are other factors at play here that are effecting a lot of people's judgement. You think you enjoy waiting, but you don't (sorry, had to). You're just putting up with it because you like the idea of an active world and eventually you'll reach the tipping point where it's not worth it anymore. I could be wrong - there will obviously be some people who truly do enjoy it - but most people don't and you can see this clearly in the feedback on every other modern online game.

I have been playing RPPVP. Currenty lvl 16. Have about 10 hrs play time. To sum it up really Quick. 99% of players are friendly, happy, help full and seems to be playing more "in character" not Rping but doing small things you never saw on private servers. I love it, makes the world feel so warm and full of life
---
The cream rises.  The game will separate the wheat from the chaff.  The morons that think they can pull the zone will be blacklisted bu the healers.

*dives into lake and laughs in gutterspeak*

---
Layering helps you at low levels, too, even if you don't realize it. Not taking away the achievement, mind you. 3 days 7 hours /played is crazy.
---
Layering IS exploitable.
---
It will NOT ruin classic.
---
Right now most servers only have two or three layers active at a time. The dude first to 60 successfully exploited because he was WELL ahead of the levelling curve, and was thus one of very few people in those zones.
---
for example, you go try layer hopping in the Barrens to find yourself a Hezrul. You won‚Äôt be successful.
---
I am in a minority, I preferred CATA to both of those, but only the first month of Cata before huge nerfs to difficulty.
---
Just keep a 1h and shield in your bag, and once you're about 50 start casually putting together a pseudo tank set from whatever obviously good tanking pieces you get.
---
Sure, but valuing a digital video game over other things is, like I said, a sad thought. At least to the point nothing else in your life needed or was given your attention for half a week.
---
How so? talent trees of the time would say otherwise.
---
Nah. Screw missing a quest because it's hidden somewhere.
---
No, it‚Äôs funny.
---
Usually I learn them in 1 or 2 uses so far. The current pet already know the skill so it's gray and at the bottom of the list.
---
I'd abandon the pet and see if it's In the list, I bet you already have it.
---
I do the same. Looking at my main action bar you wouldn't know I even paid attention because I just leave the default bindings, since those happen to be the exact same 12 buttons sitting under my thumb. I just order my skills so the ones I use most often are 1-6 because those are the most comfortable to reach.
---
No balls

Blizzard could see ut as botting since the presses are in regular intervals

Yeah we couldn‚Äôt get into Herod, then I was the only one to get into stallag, then we all went to kitronus and there‚Äôs no que.
---
This just in: embarrassed neckbeards getting butt hurt defensive over being made fun of for giving their gold away to a streamer they live vicariously through.

---
Imagine playing classic EQ with no map. No tooltips for what spells do. No linking items, you had to type out the stats of every item when selling it. No auction house.
---
Yes I love to buff and hot people that are in need on my druid :) I wasnt expecting it but genuinely one of my favorite things about classic.
---
In my head I'm drawing parallels to someone moving to LA for a new life but realizing it's going to be a struggle before they get where they need to go, but they make friends and create a great life there along the way.
---
Back to retail, kid.
---
This is a whole other level of RP I didn‚Äôt even know existed.
---
Cata's launch was like getting cheated on. Yeah, I came back for a bit, but my trust was gone and the end of the relationship was inevitable at that point.
---
I love the power spike at L20 too: Cheetah, and you get access to claw rank 3.
---
Came here to say "so this is how you're avoiding the AFK kick huh?" And realized other people beat me to it
---
I was the same I started in WoD and assumed I would hate classic as I started when leveling and gearing were fast I thought classic would be too slow, now I can't stop playing it the game is amazing
---
It looks like the staff you linked is from Dire Maul which comes out in phase 2
---
This is like the Tuscan Whole Milk, 128 oz., Classic WOW/marriage edition.
---
Rest has no AoE in classic, unless you spec some into holy for consecration which I wouldn‚Äôt suggest because it‚Äôs very mana intensive so until you get to later levels it increases your downtime for not much value. If you want to level Ret then just solo mobs while questing and run BoW and SoC, then get sanctity aura. 
---
If you want to AoE grind then you‚Äôll need to wait until you have Seal of Light, spec into port for blessing of sanctuary and eventually holy shield while running Ret aura. You‚Äôll pull a bunch and let the mobs kill themselves on your reflect dmg while you use SoL to keep yourself alive. Also make sure to grab a shield spike for this build. 
---
If you can find yourself a frost mage buddy, go holy or prot and AoE grind. It‚Äôs a great duo leveling comp, but mob grinding to 60 gets boring
---
Battle.net clients out of date
---
The correct way to handle it is to open a trade window, put in a bunch of shit they'll want, then go grocery shopping while they wait for you to confirm.
---
As an alternative Bartender4 works well with Bagnon and !moncai equipment compare addons.
---
Everyone‚Äôs 10 maning right now it‚Äôs all the rage
---
Hourly instance limit has been there as long as I remember.
---
well you're deaf then
---
You need omniCC and classic aura durations.
---
Layering does alleviate queue times because if they removed layers then they couldn't let as many players on a server at once without overcrowding parts of the world. They would either need to reduce the number of players allowed on each server OR render much of the starting zones completely unplayable like they were on launch day.
---
Been around forever, you can only do 5 an hour
---
Ty the help
---
I use dominos and bagnon and never had a problem.
---
It is there, it is found after searching with the classic file selected in the drop down in the top right, maybe try restarting the app if it doesn't show up.
---
i never cheer for cheaters bro... you do?
---
smh
---
I believe you can block incoming channel invites in your settings somewhere
---
You don‚Äôt remember because you probably weren‚Äôt facerolling dungeons fast enough.
---
Wait until you have to grind gold so that you can afford to repair your gear during raids.
---
Roll a lvl 1 alt and run it to the nearest mailbox. Mail is essentially infinite so you can mail your stacks of materials to your alt and let it sit there for up to a month before it gets sent back to you. 
---
I've been mailing all hides, cloth, cooking/alch ingredients and such to my alt then logging over later and returning it back to my main. That way if I'm ever in my faction capital I can pick and choose which items to grab from the mailbox to level lw, cooking or first aid without having to actually keep everything in my bags when out questing. You can also make an alt have a guild for access to a guild bank and level it to 5 to disenchant greens and store the dust.
---
The way I see it, the queues came first that's why people do this. Not the other way around. The queues aren't there because of this. Unless there are 8000 people in a server all doing this
---
But... fuckin WHY. There's an entire, deep, developed, extremely expansive game full of QUESTS ahead of you. 
---
Can these type of people honestly bugger off back to their modern games with their metas and speedruns? It does nothing for the classic experience.
---
I disagree about no one wanting them for end-game raiding. Their gear scales incredibly well, and they‚Äôre often one of the top healers in AQ/Naxx. Before then, they‚Äôre always welcome (1-2 per raid) because of their utility.
---
Bless your soul
---
Just go full fucking 40k levels of fanaticism.
---
I've said it for a long time, make the Light the enemy. Or even better, make the alliance the bad guys. Before Before the Storm came out I was really excited about the idea of Anduin going all crazed fanatic, sadly that didn't happen and we got the most predictable story.
---
Yeah, it didnt work...
---
Speed &gt; xp per mob
---
Nope just stated that it is evidence no need to get all up in arms. Plus seems you are the one whining. Have a classic day.
---
I never draw aggro until the enemy is almost dead. I lose a lot of time on killing each mob if I'm going to wait for voidwalker to build up aggro, and it just isn't worth it. You have lots of ways to sustain with drain life, demon armor and life tap, so you can go for quite a long time without needed to eat/drink while also taking some hits.
---
Sure, maybe if it's a really tough mob and I want my voidwalker to be tanking it for a long time, but that usually isn't the case.
---
There aren't infinite rares, there are rares proportional to the player base. WAI.
---
As alliance at your level go to wetlands and do the quests in the expedition full of raptors for a nice bow upgrade.
---
Otherwise there's the STV grand hunt quest chain for another good bow uphrade for both factions.
---
Honestly though hunters really don't need much gear for levelling, if any at all.
---
Shadow is still better isn‚Äôt it ?
---
That‚Äôs why PVE servers exist, if you have a problem with this. Roll on a PVE server, simple
---
I just downloaded it and checked it with my friend, it's the same version with my friend who is playing right now.
---
Big difference between PvP banter "git gud" etc, and something as toxic as "go to retail".
---
And having 50k+ ppl queue for 32 hours would be a better idea?
---
Or merging servers later that would ruin the community that was already established on every server?
---
Layering have worked amazing so far and soon it won't be needed.
---
Once feral druids get ravage their damage out of stealth goes up dramatically.
---
Ye, but if someone who doesn't know the value of the item "Needs", whole group should Need.
---
It's not worth it, for you, or for the guy equipping, to equip a 500g item that he will only use for 5 levels
---
We are reaching a point where it‚Äôs rude to suggest playing games for money isn‚Äôt a real job, based on how rewarding it can be for some.

---
Just a thought :)
---
Haven‚Äôt found one yet. Been messing around with a lot of warrior macros, and for some reason the wep swap+shield bash doesn‚Äôt work consistently. It‚Äôs weird though because equipping doesn‚Äôt trigger the GCD.

His name was Robert Paulson
---
Are you seriously comparing playing WoW to the Olympics?
---
Yes I did, I also have the latest version.
---
I'd suggest Druid, paladin or shaman for your first time. None of them are the top healers but they'll be much nicer to play than a priest while levelling.
---
Retarded post of the day.
---
Train sword or axe?
---
I just dinged 32 on my priest. 4g in skills :(
---
Best thing about new players is that they are like lost little kittens that you just want to shower them with kindness and hope they enjoy the game enough to stick around as an extra body to burn in the fiery pits of molten core!!
---
Gotta be real, this ain't it.
---
I mean, this is literally no different than retail except some people can actually fuck you over on purpose in classic but they can't in retail.
---
How did you get that nova off so fast? Did you have your finger on the button or something?
---
Haunt sucked. Wotlk also practically gutted Warlocks, I dont know why **any** warlock would be happy for wotlk or say it was peak talents. Tbc was peak by a mile.
---
This is the correct way to do it
---
It‚Äôs all nice and dandy until you notice most of that time is spent walking.
---
You can‚Äôt go wrong with any at this point however silverleaf and earthroot will keep value longer due to mana potions and strength potions. Hope this helpsüëç
---
I think he was layer jumping for this reason (as well as fresh mobs)
---
Lots of streamsniping.
---
also, he was them.  Roommates were taking shifts grinding.
---
Same with me and my wands. People are losing money on the AH for them now. I get being charitable, but I need a return after awhile.
---
Allying myself with humans who were forsaken by their own race just because they got a disease and were slaughtered by their own leaders. FTFY, racist alliance scum.
---
I got lvl 30 tonight, prolly died a bagilion times, luckily I had gildem8s help me with the wwaxe quest, because now as a lvl 31 warrior with wwaxe I‚Äôm balling throu the quest even some yellow one ;)
---
Oooh name calling. Yeah I‚Äôm entitled to what I paid for, everyone is, but when the supplier doesn‚Äôt provide enough for everyone then it‚Äôs clearly not the problem of the customer to sort out. I‚Äôm all down for rationing and shit and if blizzard brought in a 2 hour per day limit so everyone got a turn, I would play ball. But they love the waiting line and the exclusivity it brings as much as any other business would.
---
*"Quck! People are accepting layering is a good thing in regards to population control, let's find a new reason to bitch about layering!"*
---
This is honestly a self correcting problem. And I don't mean when they remove layering, I mean as people catch up, and higher level zones start filling out more. It's only effective to bounce between layers right now as the zones are empty when you swap layers. When more people catch up, that won't be the case. Layer swap to farm rares? Please. Eventually, they'll be dead the second they spawn due to the amount of people.
---
I wouldn't worry about it until 55, prob the only place that you need a tank gear would be brd lbrs   ubrs, etc.... And up dungeons...
---
I keep vendoring them.  The sad part is, I know they‚Äôre future quest items.  But, bag space is at such a premium and I‚Äôm going to have to grind mobs anyways.

In BfA I feel the world is only those 2 stupid islands and the rest of the continents are useless. Play the patch mindset.
---
World first hunter, first "legit" world first. Depends how you look at it but this is more impressive to me. Having the pathing rememberized on the quest is insane
---
Good dagger &amp; shield with flametongue is nice, but the staff from WC quest is really strong at those levels. After 30 you just want a slow 2h with Windfury, as far as I know.
---
You want to use your wand even in melee range.
---
loot EVERYTHING, vendor everything. always chose quest rewards with highest vendor value(unless one choice is a big upgrade for you)
---
Also, some classes just have it easier than others. Warriors for instance, have high repair costs and cant grind as much or as fast as others
---
Nice!
---
We did our first world raid last night and OMG, watching is one thing, being a part of it is another.

There are no words, this is the first time i went pvp in wow, was always pve, if only i knew what i was missing.

Sneaking into alliance territory, like a huge amount of people, moving through the forest, over the hills,

and... SURPRISE Mother F\*\*ckers!!!  omg it was so good.

Just watching some other players like freeze like they are "O. M. F. G." lol, run for their life's, then they start mobilize, more alliance coming in from all directions and it's all out mayhem, f'ing legendary.

If that‚Äôs your way of doing it then by all means go for it, I‚Äôm just saying they wont ever seize to exist.    Just like irl.Handle the issue however you see fit. From my personal experience so far the WoW classic communities been great, there‚Äôs only a few assholes. I‚Äôll take that over a majority of players.
---
Bravo üëè
---
I mean that's what trade and city chat got used for half the time anyway. LFG was effectively just a faster way of doing it, but also one that could be used to, for example, incentivise healers and tanks when they didn't have enough looking for dungeons to actually form groups.
---
The tool itself was much wanted by a lot of players for its convenience, it was the X-Play that really had the effect on server identity.
---
Y u hav to be mad is just game
---
Its awesome. I always throw a Renew on people i run past when theyre fighting.

Or blizz could stop being cheap and setup enough servers.

Who tf is chopping onions?

I'm a Dad now with only a couple hours a day to play if I'm lucky, what is the easiest class to solo and level with?
---
The funny thing is this has been a thing since legion. I thought it was a horrible mechanic then, and I think it's still one now.
---
I remember people would constantly jump layers to farm WQ, resources, rares, and cheese world PvP. I had guild mates jump layers to find where alliance was owning a zone in world pvp, and if they were close to dying, they switch again mid fight to stay alive.
---
Just seeing a repeat of it here with the addition of XP farming
---
Wouldnt 5 points into Blessing of Might and 5 more into Parry be a huge benefit for tanking? Parrying attacks will let you prevent damage on yourself, while also allowing you to attack faster
---
Why not keep tailoring but dropping chanting for skinning
---
How bad is that for it? It always makes me a little nervous that I'm doing damage to it.

I didn't get the reference.. but that's because i grew up on wc1 and 2, and hated wc3 for being so out of left field different from the first two.    :)

I‚Äôm level 25 and the world seems empty

Wait until you‚Äôre 60.  You can heal anything in vanilla, regardless of spec, as long as you have appropriate gear.
---
Layers and server capacity are two different things. You can can keep server capacity high and remove layers.
---
Protip: don't train most of your skills.
---
Druids are needed for a battle rez. Locks are a solid choice in classic for dps.
---
&gt; The majority of classic players are not 15.
---
The majority of classic players are not 15.

theres a lot of people playing
---
What everyone else said. This is another thing that makes classic different from retail. It's not a set - linear path as you level. You are meant to visit different locations as you quest unless you choose to grind mobs to get you through.
---
Isn't it glorious that we're paying to sit in queue? I expected a better launch from a company such as blizzard.
---
Probably just a LOT of people in the Barrens and no one having the money to buy it for more currently and people being impatient.

American coke isn‚Äôt even real coke. Coke classic was a marketing scam to get people to like corn syrup soup that is coke.
---
Real coke uses sugar, and it‚Äôs harder to find than the corn syrup soup.
---
It's all fake and gay though
---
#method jealous tho
---
Or a cast?
---
I knew it! The warlock said.
---
Ive been enjoying vanilla pservers while you guys were "enjoying" Legion. 
---
After WoD flop, faith in Blizzard was totally lost. They now have the chance to redeem and build WoW again the right way.
---
FFXIV is a good game. But classic is absolutely destroying it atm. The sense of community, adventure, fun, the sheer amount of people playing dwarf FFXIV. And you don't need to spend a hundred hours to get to max level and slog thru an endgame/expansion set worth of awful just to experience it. The new expansion is amazing, if only they made the game more accessible/fun to play pre-expansion. FFXIV does not even come close to what classic has to offer, especially the MMO part. Especially pre-expansion leveling. There is a reason Classic has 1mil viewers on twitch and FFXIV has what, 10k? PS, yes everything pre-the last expansion is a huge grind with hundreds of hours of awful ,  ARR is a giant clusterfuck wether you believe it or not.
---
I freaking love the charge pathing in classic
---
Looks like he just got.....Trolled.
---
YEAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH.
---
And they still downvoted. Feels bad man.
---
No changes!
---
Then you cast eye of the beast and manually jump it down. Big brain play
---
Rekt
---
I would save them until the supply dies down. Then the prices rise up. Honestly anything that you might make a quick buck just save it for a while and you'll make even more money on down the road towards phase 2.
---
Yea. I tried to play all week. With queues and work and being ready to go to sleep 1 hour after I finally get in the game I am only at 10. Feelsbadman
---
TBC? Where Shadowbolt spam was by far the most viable spec in PvE? Not so sure, there...
---
Regardless, I meant peak in that they were the most complex.
---
Hah! That family just got viable
---
my guess is back stab doesn't share global with pick pocket like garrote does?
---
I think dual wielding is not in Classic?
---
Right?! Plus with the amount of people playing rn it makes it so easy to find groups quickly.
---
Been around since the game started.  I remember it from my days of stealth running BRD for dark iron.
---
Should be a guy called Georgio Bolero in the Mages District in Stormwind hes an artisan and should be able to train you journeyman
---
This is what I do too

I was under the impression you weren't supposed to buy everything that was available all the time.

It's def hard, I'm level 17 and have yet to break 2 gold at any one point.

You can still cross layers if invited.

It's just a different phase

Hey, what unit frame addons are those you're running?  I can't get any to work.
---
Any new town you go to, have a look around for a Gryphon master and he will have a green icon above his head, just speak to them and you'll unlock the flight path. However not every town has one, Goldshire is one of these as its so close to Storm wind. Most zones will only have one or two flight points.
---
I cummed üò≥
---
I mean, okay? It's not like watching the same dungeon being grinded is any more exciting than walking through varied locations to do things like a person
---
Welcome to vanilla. Obviously your first rodeo.
---
Make sure to travel to every level 10 zone to do every posible quest. Grind your way to levels with mob kill xp or you wont be able to make it further.
---
If you have Discord on your PC, turn off the Discord Overlay. It doesn‚Äôt play nice with WoW.
---
It's sadly a side effect of something necessary
---
GW2 has a similar system. Each area is instanced off; each area will have a numbers of IPs assigned to it, depending on how many players on in that area; more players = more IPs (instances).
---
There was a huge exploit back in... 2016-2017(?) where basically EVERYONE-- absolutely everyone-- was taking advantage of this system. There was a periodic meta event in the Auric Basin map. If you successfully completed the meta, you could loot 5 Grand Chests.
---
Basically, the entire playerbase would form squads (50 people) and coordinate with each other, so they could maximise how many IPs were generate, and ensure each IPs own meta succedeed.  The squads would have one players acting as an 'anchor' for their IP; they'd stay in their IP, and thus their own completed meta map; more IPs = more anchors.
---
People would join those IPs through the anchors and re-loot those five chests. You could loot upwards of 100 chests, depending on how many anchors you had + certain speed-boosts utilised.
---
It crashed the prices of so many materials. Took ArenaNet like 8+ months to patch the meta, so you can only loot X chests per day. IP-hoping is still an 'issue' and each time a new money-making method is discovered, IP-hoping is a key compenent of it. 
---
It's not a bannable offense, though.
---
Looks like it‚Äôs not just me having trouble with Reddit telling me it can‚Äôt post my comments and then showing up anyway.
---
Really? The criticism above was
---
&gt;That would be to confusing and players wouldnt understand.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;-Blizzard
---
and Nintendo has gone almost so far as making players actually play the game is too hard, just let them win. In Mario Maker you can literally make Luigi do levels for you. Kirby can be won just holding right and your allies kill everything *and solve the puzzles* for you. Nintendo is maybe the worst at doing this. You don't need to make games laughably challengeless to appeal to kids either.
---
Yeah it isnt a fucking undead that's for sure
---
Dude I remember doing a LBRS run during a tornado warning in vanilla
---
Correct, and plus axe skills is very lacklustre for hunters. So two of the orc facials are very good for hunters and the other two are so-so.

Well I can understand blizzard - it‚Äôs a spell name
---
My reply is group up with someone! This game is meant to be played with people, not solo. I did this same quest last night with a random warrior we destroyed harpies in seconds together(ima rogue) pushed all the way to the tree with the chest, he looted and we got a green chest armor which was a super upgrade for him. fast respawns had no chance against us.
---
Thank you for this, definitely going to look into it!
---
Sorry... Retail spoiled me!
---
How‚Äôre you that riled up lol. Don‚Äôt die then

everything is immune to fire
---
I keep selling to vendors... then trying to figure out where they went.. it dawned on me after a few hours.. oy.
---
Silverpine is rough especially those cancerous Ambermill mobs. Barrans is more open and easier to avoid pulling more than can be safely chewed.
---
You know you don't *have* to level in stv, right?
---
Yeah, I just didn‚Äôt know it would be at the time and what I was missing. I wanted to be a part of the late game and didn‚Äôt realize what I was sacrificing
---
He would have been first if OCE servers didnt shit themselves everyday.
---
Smh.
---
This guy AHs.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to assume people that pick an rp server will either rp voraciously or disrespect those that do. 
---
I didn‚Äôt see any examples of disrespectfully behavior and chat throughout Elwynn and sw was heavily weighted toward ooc.

As a healer when the tank keeps pulling when you're on 25% mana and you're wasting milk by the mustache-load*

Omgsh I spent so much time in there solo trying to be adventurous! Ended up accidentally aggroing Edan the Howler and had a sick fight with him. He dropped me a Wendigo cloak and a bloodstained knife and it felt so fucking cool

Why did you delete it? I was enjoying it :(
---
Like just this morning or what? Its rough out here for a swingy boi.
---
I really don‚Äôt think they had any consideration as to what their audience thought about the entertainment value of their stream.
---
It‚Äôs a race to 60, dungeons are efficient.
---
Nice one!
---
Warriors can learn guns and bows. Go to IF and pick up a shit Grey gun to pull from distance.
---
At later levels, BiS guns with stamina are necessary
---
There are a few site dedicated to free classic leveling guides I'm at work so I can't find it right now but a simpler Google search should find them.
---
For a technical speedrun, no cam is totally fine.  Although for runs that can be machine assisted, showing controller is standard if you're claiming it's a human run.  Similarly, for a stamina speedrun, showing clearly that it's a single individual is absolutely critical for making that claim believable.
---
If the guy who rolled need can use it, and everyone else is wanting to sell it, they roll greed. To hell with him equipping something worth 500g
---
It‚Äôs no ones fault but your own that you chose a server that everyone wants to play on. I haven‚Äôt had a que since 6pm on release night.
---
Don‚Äôt forget to drop an Earthbind Totem on your ass!

Hey yeah! I was just coming to this sub for this.

 I have 0 experience with wow but I want to try this classic out.  After watching like 5 minutes of stream and that Joker guy
---
 What servers would you recommend?
---
Would starting in late September or October make PvP harder cause everyone will be a decently high level by the and do you believe this game will die out in 6 months? 
---
 What happens at level 10?! 
---
 Another other quick tid bits or YouTube videos or links really to someone who has maybe already compiled all this data ? 
---
Thanks for helping me and OP out.
---
And this is the story of how the first minotaur came to be.

Chain tanking instances has me 4 levels ahead of my friends lol

the difficulty of warrior leveling is way overblown imo

Yeah, why can't they use WoW Glider like the tryhards did back in the day??
---
Actually something a lot of people don't know is body pulling is better for peeling mobs from groups usually. Ranged pulling has a wider aggro assist range than body pulling.
---
Legacy-wow.com
---
That's the point! We need a new timeline :)
---
 One of my favorite parts is seeing people you‚Äôve been levelling up alongside or people you‚Äôve helped/that have helped you. A quick emote, buff or trade of items, maybe a few words and you‚Äôve made a new friend. I‚Äôm glad to need people again.
---
Grinding tokens from the ToC area I think. If you had 4+ max toons, you could get all of it in about a month.
---
I thought it was bullshit when they made a tab to permanently store and reuse the heirlooms anywhere. I thought of them as a (that server only) reward for dedication to the game. Now they're pretty much mandatory if you group while leveling.
---
I'd argue spirit tap first simply because you may not even have a wand yet when you hit level 10 so spirit tap is more immediately useful.
---
Is it stupid that I would use it if I was OP? To have the chance to use something so special for once could make for a memorable time in the game. Gold is replacable. This staff and the adventures with it not so much.
---
Magic
---
We‚Äôve got a few months of layering at least
---
All the time
---
But why does it need horns....it has claws.
---
Yes. I was on stalag initially and couldn‚Äôt get on after 10am so I moved to newly opened sulfuras and then that filled so I went to benediction which is high but sucks...and last night I rolled a new toon on the newly opened nightwind. 
---
I‚Äôve lost the drive to relevel the same too again.
---
Needs more jpeg.
---
The game didn‚Äôt start to lose the sense of community until Wrath with the release of LFG. All the community aspects we loved were still present throughout BC, flying had nothing to do with it. Hell BC was built around flying and Dreanor had lots of places you couldn‚Äôt go to unless you could fly. You couldn‚Äôt fly in Azeroth anyway at the time either.

---
What does it remind you of?

Okay thanks I found some but they speak in wow terms and have no clue what kiting is or anything lmao

Lock, mage, Hunter after 10, Druid after 10. Downside to mage is but slower progress until mid game then it picks up.

MacBook airs do not have sufficient cooling to sustain extended work load. Also doesn‚Äôt have a very good GPU. MacBooks in general don‚Äôt have great airflow. I have a 2018 13‚Äù Touch Bar MBP that I usually use for work. I installed classic on it for fun only to find that if I play at the native resolution of the display the fans start screaming. It maintains 60fps but gets hot. Kind of sad tbh.
---
Shit man do you think I kept count? I died four Times of murloc swarms in Redridge this morning before getting a decent pull. It's brutal.
---
Thanks I‚Äôll try it
---
A lot of folks I think would recommend a Beast Master hunter, or a Demonology warlock. Having a personal tank reeeeaaaallllyyyy smooths out some of the edges of solo play. I personally would say Frost mage as well, if only due to my bias and love of their don't-touch-me utility. Your mileage may vary, though!
---
You realize that quote is part of the meme template, right?
---
I died about 14 times or so up to lvl22. Maybe 2 times past level 15. Up to 15 was rough.
---
She‚Äôs seems to love it to me!! God I am fiending to play

"put the cow in line" LMFAO

My party hit Ashenvale and wow. We were in there for less than a minute and got in a 3v3 fight with alliance players. Then there‚Äôs the random lvl 29s and skull monsters. It feels so good. We were questing and actually scared to wander too far from the path and objective points. I‚Äôm enjoying this so much
---
I think the main time sink is just in the poor quest design, which I won't fault them for much because it was a relatively new thing, and you see more of the pain Horde-side where they had to rush that stuff to get it out the door.  So many times you're asked to go right back to where you were, sometimes from across the map in a new location, for simple fetch quests or to go kill X number of mobs again.  And the drop rates can be pretty rough (I am incredibly suspicious that last night every Plainstrider I killed actually had a beak).
---
I think the biggest point for people that they recall is playing with friends, a bit of nostalgia from being younger, and/or being forced into making groups for dungeons.  And you can play with friends in modern WoW and make your own groups (have to in order to do the Mythic dungeons), it's just that the same people who complain about it "not being part of the game" are also not interested in doing it anyway and partake in the conveniences.
---
People take the easier road, ignoring the existence of the harder mode, then complain that things are too easy.  The main difference is that Classic doesn't give you that choice.  But while some folks like that, the flip side of things like manually grouping for dungeons means a lot of players will be left out as folks scoff at the idea of things like non-Warrior tanks or subpar DPS builds, leaving those folks to solo until they can grind enough gold to change to what others want them to play.
---
I have to admit it: If i give people free stuff, its only to create bagspace

Always have healing and swiftness potions to get out of a jam. The centaurs that patrol with a hyena pet? Always know where that jerk is. Always look around on the camera for hostiles before you start a fight. 
---
Every time I‚Äôve gained a level I check 2-3 times a day  on the AH for deals on green weapons and armor. Bank space is precious so some people put things up cheap. I‚Äôm level 15 with green in all but 2 slots that I paid less than 10 silver for each on average.
---
But yeah I would have died a dozen more times if not for potions and updating gear constantly.

Seriously. When I see people talk about the "competitive scene" I just have to roll my eyes. These exploits arent going to affect 99% of the playerbase and is vital to making the game playable while the servers are at capacity. Of course I want it gone soon but people blow the "consequences" way out of proportion, plus Blizzard has said that by the time world bosses are out layering will be gone too.

I'll add onto this that u need something that gives you good mana.

The actual line is "Ishnu-Alah-Ackbar"

You mean like how retail has armory ? That would be cool if vanilla had that
---
Look this argument is dumb. Yeah servers will decline. But they will over xfers. I understand some people can only think of one good username so the thought of having to change from noonegivesafuckaboutmyname to noonegivesafuckaboutmynamexxx. But a name and Server change is a better future than the one where that‚Äôs not offered and layering continues to water the game down. 
---
Layers have been great for launch. But now they‚Äôre beginning to cause issues

I think we‚Äôll have a better understanding of our layering  situation by the end of the month.

Did you draw this or is this some addon making the game look like that? I honestly can‚Äôt tell.

It's funny but only because it isn't happening to me

I still reach for my mount keys...

Servers "back in the day" consisted of the current layer pops. We are basically playing on server groups from wrath, now imagine if during wrath they just up and merged 10 servers.
---
Haha, holy shit this is amazing.
---
This issue just reeks of astroturfing. A few months ago a post suggesting to use large-scale sharding in wow vanilla would have been downvoted into nothing, you would never even see these outside of the "new" category.

Now that the game is out, its suddenly fine to have that crazy mechanic that wasnt even in cata...

Rerolled from my hunter at level 23 because I was so bored of the gameplay. Sucks to lose that progress but oh well.

The gnome who ninjad 4g worth boe chest from stockade is true gift. ‚ÄûI will wear it‚Äù he said

I agree. I play an undead priest in CWoW and even though I have very little time compared to back in the day I always stop long enough to buff, and heal if they need it, when I see folks out questing.

Just think if a great upgrade for you drops.

Woule you rather have it sold and split gold with group?

Everyone but Rogues ;)

Why Retribution (with Enhancement) had to be the worst spec in the game ? my favorite specs :'(
---
I'm 33 and I've been trying out reckoning, the procs seem Weird and you definitely don't get a stack of anything
---
So far my best method to trigger it consistently has been to sit as the enemy would hit you (using swing timer) then immediately auto attack
---
I've tried the macro
---
/Sit
---
/Startattack
---
And it does seem to work, it's like having the ability to attack at the speed of whatever is attacking you, not sure how viable it is though
---
I've got a video demonstrating it:
---
https://youtu.be/eNAO6gVXFP4
---
Anyone played around with it?
---
We starting this trend again?
---
I'm level 13 and I'm somewhere in the 20-30 deaths range. Silverpine Forest is absolutely destroying me. I can kill 2 mobs at the same time only if I'm very lucky. 3 is a death sentence.
---
I had my first PvP interaction in ashenvale as well. 
---
Myself(25Warrior) sees a Tauren(25Warrior) walking towards me. I think ‚Äúfuck it, I‚Äôm ready.‚Äù 
---
I charge him, he is clearly shocked I would attack. His shield blocked my white swing. He keeps walking in the direction he was going, cba I suppose. I pop bloodrage, hamstring him, watch him waddle away as I continue, full speed towards my quest. 
---
Satisfying PvP doesn‚Äôt have to end in death :)
---
I would love to see the layer exploiters get banned for misuse of mechanics :)

I usually spit on everyone i see.

 Nothing makes me happier and more nostalgic than getting the elite quests in Loch Modan for the Mo‚ÄôGrosh Ogres. Getting a 5 man party together, fighting through the spawns and cave, for what feels like your life. I LOVE elite mob areas in zones. I miss Loch Modan so much because of this, had to go Horde this time around.
---
Rogues shine in those one on ones. It's the large scale fights they shy away from, except to watch.
---
There is no Trump in Azeroth, so..
---
It takes dedication to be an asshole. I applaud you!
---
Wtf
---
thats insane
---
Its better to start now because u need some help at some quests and it will be harder when there will be no players .. and that thing with many players around the Azeroth is actually reason why is this good experience (Im one of those who like solo exp but Its helpfull that I can ask nearby players to kill elite with me and those mostly help then I help them ..)

Bruh
---
&gt;And you don't need to spend a hundred hours to get to max level and slog thru an endgame/expansion set worth of awful just to experience it.
---
First of all, you definitely do need to grind that much in classic and it's not all a perfect experience. Also, there isn't 100 hours f awful in XIV. The only part that even reaches close to the realm of awful is the content after ARR and before HW, and that's a relatively small portion of the game. Heavensward, StormBlood, and Shadowbringers are all either good, great, or amazing.
---
&gt; The new expansion is amazing, if only they made the game more accessible/fun to play pre-expansion. 
---
Agreed, they need to shorten the ARR grind, which they have stated they're working on.
---
&gt;FFXIV does not even come close to what classic has to offer
---
Ah okay? That's highly, highly subjective. Both games have a TON to offer. You seem to have these abstract rules about what an MMO has to be that are simply that, abstract. 
---
&gt;There is a reason Classic has 1mil viewers on twitch and FFXIV has what, 10k?
---
Yeah because WoW Classic is a remake of a game that is rightfully a cultural phenomenon, that came out at the height of MMO's, that was literally released 5 days ago. I'm sorry if popularity doesn't factor into my opinion on the quality of a game. **Especially** when MMO's have been decreasing in player numbers in general over the last decade, no matter the quality. 
---
Besides, you seriously gonna act like WoW is going to have that many viewers 3 months or 6 months after launch? Don't act like the hype isn't a huge part of that view count.
---
In retail, after a month you're out of shit to do until they release a patch so then you go and do everything again on 12 other characters to fill the time. If after 2 years I run out of things to do on my main, which I doubt because I played for 2 years at 60 in vanilla and I still had stuff that I wanted to do but never got to, then I will play an alt. I never had the feeling when TBC came out that I was ready for new content. If anything I felt like I never had enough time to enjoy vanilla. People thinking the game will be boring after naxx have the same thinking that made people think classic wouldn't be popular. Yes this is my opinion but it is based on years of experience playing vanilla.
---
üôÑ c‚Äômon bruh
---
Not trying to argue against you but I have not experienced switching layers even once. To me it feels like there is no layering at all. Might be different on the super high-pop servers though.
---
nope, you?
---
The feeling of training skills feels so good though.
---
I felt like a god when I hit level 6 and unlocked Parry.

---
*laughs in bear form*
---
\+1 Thx
---
Obviously part of one of the welp groups
---
I mean you could level solo on quite a lot of eq1 classes.  I think the "more casual" changes are not deleveling on death and not losing all your gear on corpse rot.
---
You can have a successful launch and be super hyped for content. I saw this happen with WoD, everyone was like WoW's getting back to it's roots etc etc. Then WoD turned out to be a shitshow, people loved it the first month or two, same with Legion, same with BFA. I've seen it over and over. Classic WoW is extremely obtuse and archaic, it's got some great aspects that I wish were in modern WoW still but overall I think after the sheen wears off, a lot of players will be leaving.
---
Ironically people hated MoP or at least trashtalked it a ton before it came out and it turns out that was one of the best expansions to ever grace WoW IMO.
---
&gt; after I finished the escort

---
Realistically how long do you think before there's enough 55 plus players to have consistent grouping in lbrs ubrs scholo and strat farming pre raid gear? 3 weeks?
---
Just enjoy the ride. I am in the same boat. I have a wife and a serious job, two things I didn‚Äôt have 15 years ago. Also non-wow hobbies. There is finite content to classic and no need to rush through it. Despite what the naysayers may nay say, there will be plenty of people to group up with for content when you eventually get there because there are thousands upon thousands of us in the same boat.
---
Portals are level 20 and 30 (TB/Darn).
---
Before release this sub was filled with "my thoughts on Classic" posts.
---
This is pure gold and all to real!  Keep fighting Broham
---
22 was probably the age in my life I had the most free time to do anything. No job, didn't go to school. I was better at WoW than anyone at 22.
---
Bro. I'm only on the Prisoner of Azkaban. How could you
---
Moonglade
---
She's just sleeping

I hope so brother
---
Who cares, you‚Äôre in.

Whiners are gonna whine
---
I've put 2 days played into professions and leveling sitting at 155 tailoring and 158 enchanting on a 30 lock, very proud of what I've done with my week
---
&gt;Hardly anyone is actually racist anymore
---
Been outside lately to talk with people?
---
8g, but only because I loaned 20g to a friend for his mount.  Now he's going to pay me back and help me get mine!
---
The warlock seemed so sad at the end
---
Oh didn‚Äôt realize that. No worries. Wasn‚Äôt intended to start a new trend. Just sharing some thoughts. I‚Äôve asked a few questions in here. And people have been awesome at answering and giving me some ideas.
---
Dude just chill, in 5ish weeks it won't be an issue
---
I heard sit Crit reck doesn‚Äôt work on twitch idk if true though
---
You're going to want to go to the bottom of one talent tree, but which one and what things to dip into other trees I don't know. I'm going by what I think will help my playstyle.
---
&gt;An 8,000 queue on Firemaw disagrees.
---
Layering is more so done so you can level without 300 people for every 1 mob. It doesn't really impact queues.
---
I had the exact same thing happen in SFK... except it was 81 rolls. I got the item and the salt was real
---
Leveled a fury warrior to 18 only so people can tell me to tank in dungeons T_T - tanked 3 DM runs and never want to tank again, way too clunky      
---
I just wanna DPS and have an easy leveling experience, might roll a hunter - what do you guys think?
---
You can Shift+click quests in your quest log, that will display the objectives they track on the right hand side of your screen, for more than that you have to manually open the log and read them. 
---
Also that depends on what two races you‚Äôre playing. Dwarves/gnomes start in the same area, as do trolls/orcs. Tauren can get to the orc starting area with some difficulties.
---
Laughing all the way to my class and professions trainers buying all the skills
---
&gt; Can we just accept that people exploiting it really isn't that big of a deal
---
It's a huge deal, Devilsaur farming with layer hopping will be  crazy.
---
Nope. I had one where I rolled second on a tie and still won.
---
I have a cat right now and it doesn‚Äôt have anything besides growl. How do I get claw? Do I have to tame another cat then get the skill?
---
‚ÄúI get a quest and I don‚Äôt know what it wants me to do‚Äù if only reading was a thing right guys?
---
Nothing says Zen like water starved and sun baked desert along with a volcano blasted wasteland
---
Lol dude you are not gona play on the first five OG PvP. Get that in your heads. If you want to actually play and enjoy you need to love to a lower pop. For some perspective it would be like going from LA to Pheonix. It‚Äôs still grossly populated everywhere.
---
If it was launch I‚Äôd be in school. As an adult now I was able to take 2 weeks off and nolyfe it until I burnout.
---
i'm an asshole for not caring about some random dudes level in a game?
---
that's really weird
---
Whats going to happen with devilsaurs now that there will be way more available and we can just hop around layers.
---
Only you can answer that question, but it is a great game IMO.
---
Im upgrading you to a scouting wisp . Now go and fulfill your new calling
---
Spirit tap is an insanely useful soloing talent that can save you lots of time and water. Wand spec is also useful simply because spell pushback means that when a mob is hitting you wands usually do more DPS than smite spam. Unless you intend to spend 100% of your leveling time in groups/instances they're both must-haves.
---
(Going further down Discipline to get 3/3 Mediation before picking up any Holy talents is also probably the better way to go with a healing-focused leveling build, since Vanilla healing is much more about keeping your mana up than throughput.)
---
First isn't always better.
---
15 year rs vet and rs classic 2100 total.
---
My first experience with Vanilla was on a PVP server.  Got to Stranglethorn and the gankfest and I had to bounce.  I love pvp, just not like that
---
From my perspective questing in WoW is playing a single player RPG with shallow and repetitive gameplay.
---
I think there's a happy place somewhere where we aren't all flexing our gear score, but I also think ignoring gear score and the end game is being willfully ignorant of the fact that you'll spend far longer at end game then leading up to it. 
---
You're ignoring the difference between doing Deadmines at level 18 and doing a 40 man raid at level 60 by stating that all dungeons are the same.
---
In the end, pre end-game gear score **does** matter. If you're trying to finish some quests in a dungeon but the tank gets crushed in one hit by the trash mobs, you won't be able to accomplish your goal. It matters significantly less but to pretend anyone at any level wearing anything can do any dungeon is wrong.
---
&gt;If I played modern WoW, I doubt I would enjoy the quests. People say the writing is terrible.
---
I'm getting some really mixed messages from you, the writing in the older quests is worse than the modern ones. You never answered the main question of **why** do you enjoy questing - it's clearly not the writing. It's not the progression since you don't care about gear. It's not the teamwork and grouping since you don't want to group up for dungeons.
---
Check out Nobbel on YouTube, he does some nice story telling... I used to listen to him while falling asleep lol xD
---
But what about every weekend? Weekends will still need layering way past when weekdays settle down. But then I suppose we could just have no layering and just have queues?
---
See, they know we don't actually want it.
---
Sargeras was huge even after the Detheroc transfers. Definitely an outlier.
---
15,000 queues on several servers. I'll take layering over being unable to play.
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers!
---
I believe they‚Äôre blocked in retail now, but I know they weren‚Äôt blocked until at least Wrath.  Some people in retail reserves these names right when Blizzard announces the merge with Activision.
---
I guess part of #nochanges is that even the censorship goes back!
---
That's not the same for most people tho, if you dont have a job or go to school when you're 20+ you are probably an outlier.
---
The first epic is such an explosion of joy. I personally can not wait.
---
*misses
---
Not stupid. Everyone has their own values.
---
Most would probably hang onto it and then sell it, opting for a less minmax staff to get them to the point where they get an epic staff from a raid instead, I guess.
---
Personally I think I would use it just for the joy of it, but I believe we are a minority.
---
Have you ever played WoW? Aggressive strategies and coordination is how everyone gets world first. 
---
World first TBC was just running around tagging mobs while other people killed them for you, etc. 
---
Another one was just chain running instances by jumping from one group to the next.
---
World first is always a combination of creativity, clever use of game mechanics, and staying awake a long time.
---
Hover over the item with your mouse should tell you, you can get an add-on that shows you how much it sells for at auction too.
---
I swear it actually slows down my wand speed.  Apparently this is the way it worked in Vanilla? Can someone confirm "The Berserking Troll racial ability is behaving as expected and matches the reference client." ?
---
I can't wait for that to happen. These logins are still ridic.
---
All cats are Alliance.
---
If you invite them, they come to your layer.
---
Edit: not that this couldn't ever be a problem in major cities with trade and stuff.  When I first heard about layers, my first thought was that it would make cities and trade suck.  But I don't think it would often be an issue.
---
I'm looking to do DM soon but need money for skills first. Thanks for the tip.
---
What does spirit do for warriors though?
---
This is the best thing I've seen today, bravo !
---
Both god tier dps. If u ever wanna tank the choice is clear. Rouge is a percentile above warrior in pvp i believe. Id go with whatever i used to play but if u dont feel nostalgic about either then pick the coolest race.
---
Maybe in your social circle. In my small town it's pretty common. I'm 29 now and most of my friends *still* don't work.
---
it works when mob isn't engage already by a party member, so it's not gcd
---
Something I appreciated to get all my addons working properly.
---
As a warlock, what's the difference
---
Chat isn't layered, just ask and invite there's probably several other people waiting for a spawn / find others
---
Morning fellow moms.  Getting mom duties out of the way this morning and then it's a wow kind of day!  I was thinking of starting a discord for general hang out. If you're interested let me know and I'll send you the info when I get on my computer.  üíú
---
Without growl though the power spike is almost pointless.
---
Fellow War here, except I played back in the day.
---
Don't quit, the server needs you.  If you think leveling sucks, re-roll an easier class before you think you're too deep into the sunk-cost fallacy.
---
I don't want to see this game succeed in the long-term, I want to see it thrive. 
---
Safe travels.
---
After months of free with optional donations, and almost a week of monthly subscription which you are encouraged to refund.
---
I‚Äôm debating if I should stick with a paladin or re roll hunter. I want to eventually raid, but I heard that ret paladins are nearly useless in raids. What about prot paladins? Are they viable tanks in raids? Any help or advice would be appreciated.
---
Tbh, she probably is having more then one dick at the moment.
---
Safe? Sure. But would the druids want a dwarf family drinking an fighting? Orc/Troll Party vacation!
---
Dont mind my "LFG Group" brainfart
---
Shadowbolt spec was the **entry** level pve spec in tbc, afterwards it changed up.  
---
Also theres nothing complex about maintaining dots, Haunt was a trash skill because it didnt do its fully intended purpose of spreading your dots easily. Affliction's greatest problem was aoe and burst. Haunt didnt fix either of those so it just became simply another timer to maintain.  
---
And in exchange of that.. warlock suffered greatly on the pvp end. Class just stopped being fun really.
---
I think so. I really want to play with shamans to see how close I can make a tank spec viable by going either Full STR and shield for blocking or full agi for parry. I want to satisfy my curiosity without having to spend gold on respecing/ buying gear I might not even use.
---
Zug zug
---
Oh didnt know about the duel thing
---
Thanks so much!
---
That is awesome thanks for sharing the story! I met my wife playing overwatch so it's super cool to hear stories like this!
---
How about the troll party village
---
Odd, haven't ran too many dungeons yet but my two PUG WC runs were fairly smooth. We had standard tanks, though, a druid and later a fellow with a shield who used Rend a bit too much.
---
isn't MCP available in phase 1 and the best feral weapon?
---
You need something to resist, to push against, if the earth and air didn't push against people they wouldn't be people at all.
---
First lvls are Not that much of a grp Play going. When you get out of the Starting Zone you could look for dungeons depend wich side you are.(horde allianze) first dungeon on the horde side is ragefire chasm ~lvl13 on ally side it's deadmines ~lvl18
---
Yeah, you're not wrong. It seems like all the people who worked on the game back then have moved on.
---
Until people aren‚Äôt able to play with their friends or join a group on a different layer and come to Reddit to complain.
---
Check the vid, it's at around 18seconds in, I definitely swing a lot faster than I should, that's with 60% chance, I'd be interested to see 100%
---
Doing that right now, new charachter. Just be patient with them and only help if they want. Mine wants to figure some stuff out on her own :p
---
It's a bandaid for a larger problem, wow is not going to fix it
---
What support are you looking for? They warned you that full servers would have extended wait times. They added new servers that people decided they didn't want to use. They raised the cap on players that can be on a single server at one time.
---
You understand that removing layers is essentially reducing server capacity, right?
---
Auctions last at most 2 days. The market will balance itself out and without flying and with world PvP resource gain will be limited and thus stabilize the economy.
---
If you decide to play on Flamelash-eu alliance
---
Add my character: Blacklaw and whisper me
---
Unless they‚Äôre at their limit too
---
I guess that would be awesome!
---
Not sure why "enjoying" is in quotes. It's fine if you don't like something, but don't try to tell me that I don't actually like what I like. I enjoyed every moment of Legion and there's nothing airquotes about it.
---
One of his main competitors and a part of Method, kennymarsh, said on stream that Jokerd was not account sharing. Kennymarsh is behind now, but at the time his party was in the top 2 or 3. There were other people that were streaming that slept less than Jokerd. Also, I doubt he was up all day leading up to launch, he likely slept until right before. You could probably add to the count and say he slept for 20 hours over 100 hours, which is not unbelievable at all. 
---
You can be suspicious all you want, but stating it as fact so bluntly is being totally disingenuous. Jokerd is a known private server 1-60 speed runner, with a history of fast times. He isn't some random that just happened to be able to put more playtime in than everyone else by account sharing.
---
You are my hero, congrats!
---
I think I found a classic compatible version I'll check that out.
---
Edit: nevermind the earliest version seems to be Wrath. Sad.
---
I found another one though called RingMenu. I'll try it out it seems Classic compatible.
---
Yeah, you don't need the zip file for any addons, just the folders
---
I should preface this with by no means am i a tanking expert, this is just what I've experienced while tanking so far. I did also tank back in Vanilla but dont remember too much from then so its a relearning process. 
---
For the bare minimum basics: 
---
Single Target Pull: Sunder Armor / Revenge to keep aggro
---
AoE Pull: Demoralizing Shout once or twice and try to spread sunders evenly. 
---
Only use Taunt when you dont currently have aggro. 
---
Bloodrage early and often so you can begin stacking sunders early. 
---
_____
---
For *slightly* more in depth
---
Go into keybind setting and set up keybinds for target icons 
---
Personally, mine are all set to my numpad keys. 
---
7: Skull, 8: Cross 9: Moon
---
(Primary DPS Target, Secondary DPS Target, CC Target) 
---
Getting aggro on a single target is way easier than on multiple. If all DPS is on Skull you can stack Sunders on one target and Demo Shout or a single sunder to keep everything else on you. 
---
Try to "pool" your rage without capping  when you're just starting out. If you have aggro already, wait before you stack another sunder because you could use that rage to start strong on your *next* pull. 
---
If you're leveling as Fury be sure to pick up Piercing Howl. You can utilize this in two ways. You can AoE slow mobs that frequently run at low health, and if you have aggro on a large pull you can Piercing Howl and slowly kite them around to allow your healer to play catch up. 
---
Also pick up a ranged weapon and ammo so you can pull from a distance so you dont face pull unwanted adds or patrols. 
---
Ill try to update if i remember anything else. Hope this helps! Good luck!
---
Yea I tell myself that every day and the queue issue seems to be good so I am relishing in every little milestone and upgrade. Every eviscerate crit and ambush 1 shot ahead of me.
---
Im more worried about gold than anything. Retail  is so easy to have hundreds of thousands of it and I never had much gold in my early days of wow
---
I'm lvl 34. Have 60 hours /played. I'm still working just sleeping like 3-4 hours a night. When you're extremely dedicated sleep is the first thing to go.
---
Thanks! 
---
Ok I‚Äôm playing night elf and he‚Äôs starting dwarf
---
People oh Florida act as if a hurricane is like some event. ‚ÄúOh so wyd for the hurricane this weekend?  Wanna come chill?‚Äù
---
Classic codex will tell  you what items drop from mobs and how many you need if you hover over them. It also puts a gold ! above heir nameplate so you know its a quest mob.
---
Gotten 2 staff of Jordan from layering , this is so broken
---
Or the random guy the one time in 2 hour when you fuck up says God you suck so bad goddamn I love that guy makes me wants play lol again
---
Last stand or anger management for an offtank?
---
I currently lean towards AM since it should also do alot for my dps wich i will be doing like 90% of the time. But LS as an "oh shit" button seems like it would also do a lot for me.
---
None of which negates the negative impact that flying ALSO had on world PvP.  
---
LFG would have been fine if it only ever assisted in finding groups for dungeons, and skipped the whole teleporting part.  People sit in capitals to find dungeon groups; they did it in vanilla, and they‚Äôre doing it in classic.  
---
LFG should be a menu that allows you to post what you‚Äôre running, what party requirements are needed, and for other people to join your LFG group through the same menu.  This way you can post what you‚Äôre looking for while out in the world, and others can join your group without having to be in the same zone to know you‚Äôre looking for members to quest or run a specific dungeon.  
---
Both LFG and the current spamming for groups from capitals takes people out of the world.  Both teleporting to dungeons and flying were nails in that coffin.
---
You will be at a significant disadvantage
---
Pretty much western history in a nutshell.
---
You're DAYS into classic. Not even a week yet. You can reroll at no real consequence
---
How do I do that? Sorry new to it
---
I‚Äôve been saying this for years, WoW being so streamlined really took away the sense of community that we had during vanilla, BC, and WOTLK. LFR and dungeon finder are just so business foreword and expedient that you can stop and appreciate the game and group members. I forged so many close relationships during the early days of WoW, many of which are still going and who I‚Äôve met in real life. It‚Äôs heartwarming to see that back again
---
Kill all the mobs as youre travelling too, or just do some grinding (kill mobs that you dont have a quest for)
---
raised the cap, not limit.
---
people were asked to take a name and join the launch, now in a 10h queue.
---
this is not getting media coverage. just like the world first lvl 60. 
---
the guild like all the guilds are loosing members by the hours due to queue times.
---
wowhead had comprehensive display on queue times, and it seems just 2 servers dont have that issue, and those servers were released on day3. seems rerolling a realm inst a permanent fix, is it?
---
Why attack speed matters so much for a pet? Is it for PvP?
---
People are shocked when I say I've easily made 40+ gold just from vendoring leather, but there are usually 50+ dead and looted boars just sitting there right now.
---
You lost all credibility at the beginning of your second paragraph.
---
While I understand the concern, I think this is an instance of seeing something on streams which makes us feel like it's a major issue when in reality a very small percentage of the player base are trying to take advantage of it and/or are being effected by it. 
---
Secondly, I think we're about to see how easy the raids in classic will be for the guilds gunning for world first. This game was never built to be a competitive platform and that's OK. Not everything needs to be turned into a streamed spectacle. If Method and other want to use it as an opportunity for that, great. But we shouldn't expect blizzard to interfere. They gave us the exact game we asked for and produced a tech to allow us to play the game smoothly. 
---
TL;DR: While your suggestion to limit layering would fix the "problem", the issue isn't impacting 99% of the player base.
---
This shouldn't make me laugh as much as it did
---
Remember this thread https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cpd7sv/blizzard_knows_more_than_you/
---
that everyone upvoted and the guy even got gold, silver and plat. It was so clear layering would be abused.
---
When I get off of work I can help b out better if no one has by then
---
Not really. High pop servers are fucking packed and even with the layering, mobs are killed the second they spawn. I can run through areas usually infested with mobs +10 levels higher than my toon and encounter zero difficulty at all because five to ten players immediately converge on anything that moves.
---
You got 12 gold at level 8? Holy hell! Share your secrets lol
---
You want overpower.
---
The launcher probably needs to be updated! I had the same issue and updating fixed it
---
Pshhh, that's for nothing in the pig squeal.
---
SQUEEEEEEEE!
---
Kirtonis?
---
Regular mount is 100 right?
---
Barrens Recycling inc

I'm gay
---
Do you need counseling or perhaps some Medication to deal with this micro aggression?
---
You also want sweeping strikes and cleave. That 35 you see is based off the weapon you are currently holding. As you level and gain bigger weapons it will change.
---
Sure it does. Blizz said they increases server cap. I can only imagine them adding a few more layers.

Your imps name is Pizbis which is really really funny.

My question is, does rank 3 scale more than 1, if so where is that info available? Because otherwise it's just a 30 damage increase after 50 levels?
---
Yeah I‚Äôm ret snd I have a few + healing items and some int and spirit gear. Never had any trouble
---
Kromcrush - Eastern PVP. At peak hours the queues are 30min. Any other time it‚Äôs instant. Balanced and great world PvP!
---
Yes it‚Äôll work.
---
Sounds like blizzard is the one who decided to implement layering, not like he is relying on a bug or something.
---
I‚Äôm assuming that Blizz knows this and won‚Äôt remove layering until peak times are manageable
---
Good gear is super important for sure
---
I can‚Äôt help you with that, but I‚Äôm almost certain classic has it‚Äôs own executable, so you should be able to start it ‚Äúmanually‚Äù whilst figuring this problem out.

I started playing WoW right after BC launched. I leveled my first shaman right before Wrath, so I don‚Äôt have any experience playing in vanilla but I can tell you that I love the class. I have switched between warrior and shaman main since Wrath launch (dictated by guild needs at the time) and I believe that all 3 specs are a ton of fun to play. For Classic my plans are to play almost exclusively with WF and the biggest 2h I can get my hands on (went with Blacksmithing for this reason).
---
Classic reminds me of the [Allegory of the long spoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_long_spoons).
---
Classic is kinda like both, it can be a fun ride, or a brutal hellscape. When people work together in classic though, it's amazing.
---
No, that is a meme.
---
They summoned the mob and didn‚Äôt attack it as I was taming.  How else would you describe it?
---
That seems like a 'wait till 60' upgrade to me!
---
Classicdb also has the damage as 5 at 1 and 35 at 3, so it doesn't look like the tooltip updates from weapons.
---
I'm currently level 17 alliance..I found westfall difficult at first when I went without someone to help me..I went to loch modan until about 14 and came back made it much easier for me
---
Classic reddit therapist. There are two scenarios in life with relationships. Cheating, and Cheating. Just depends which side the redditors find themselves on.
---
where can i find these? they all seem to be outdated the names you listed. I don't think that's what Asmongold has?
---
This is why there should be a 10 second timer before they can release.
---
It's also about slapping a wolf for those sweet unarmed skill points
---
What is oddly satisfying to me is leveling in the Barrens. Half the people making dick jokes and the same jokes that were being made 15 years ago.  It‚Äôs like I never left the only thing that‚Äôs missing are Chuck Norris jokes.
---
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs all new kids that are making the exact same jokes or what I suspect 30+ year olds that are making the same jokes they were making 15 years ago.
---
Is this why the cities seem like ghost towns?
---
You are missing the point.. This fella got first 60. He's not trying to smell the flowers.
---
Probably stick around until after wrath. Played cata last time but that was the beginning of the end for me
---
My dad bought me that and the dungeon guide one. I love them.
---
Not an exploit, blizzard chose to implement layering.
---
No, no it literally CAN'T be undead. Undead can't reproduce that's kind of their race's main issue
---
It will. More than likely just not showing yet, maybe an update or something will correct it. I can assure you it will.
---
I would stick around up to wotlk. No further
---
There is a several minute grace period, for both your position in queue and re-logging from within the game.
---
Yeah because it is not like every single devilsaur spot will be contested anyway? Dont forget, each layer has more pop than most vanilla servers back in the day had. I believe we can have 4 times the number of players per layer than back in vanilla launch.
---
Good strat is to always grind on your way to and from quest locations.  You lose a lot if exp per hour running without killing anything.
---
Get the TitanPanel addon, it shows you your exp per hour.  Then just try to keep that number up.  As you move and run you'll see that number go down.
---
I've got some good guides and even with the guide it'll be like (grind out four bars of exp).
---
None of the quest chains in any zone will level you up fast enough without also adding grinding.  There are mobs in every zone not associated with quests to grind on.
---
So youre saying youve become a woman?
---
isn't this relying on a /sit macro which is confirmed not to work in Classic?
---
Do u vendor everything or ah?
---
In the settings. I'm in the queue atm, so can't tell you exactly.
---
Who is shitting on anything? I wasn't the one who made a post saying all other MMO's suck. 
---
If you even read my post I praised WoW multiple times. I've literally been loving my experience the past couple days. I have said NOTHING negative about WoW, outside of the grind not being perfect, which isn't even a big negative for me, as even if a grind is boring, it's still relaxing for me. ESPECIALLY if I'm in love with the world itself, as I am with both WoW and FFXIV..
---
Shockingly, I don't have to pick one or the other. I know, it's crazy, but I really can love both games! 
---
Also, I'll talk about whatever I want here. I love both games dearly, and if I want to stick up for FF then I will. It's not a big deal, it's just a discussion. If it pisses you off so much that I, and many, many other people like XIV than you can just downvote and walk away.
---
Or you can waste your time telling me that I'm not allowed to love both games. You do you.
---
And if not, rename the folder to just Questie without the version.
---
Everything he had on was Blue except for his crazy Armor of the Fang full set. Absolute UNIT.
---
I must have bought the health pots just before you go there. :)
---
People like undercutting for fast sales. Shit is annoying. If I want a "fast" sale I make my price the same as the lowest competitors prices. People who come in and post for like 10% under everyone else tank the economy.
---
‚ÄúTrousers of The Whale‚Äù are u calling me fat
---
Not really fair to add an xpac that is the beginning for all of the negative changes to the classic experience.  
---
Everyone is applauding what classic brings back to wow that has been missing for years now. While a segment of the community is asking to have those thing taken away with the Xpac that originally started us down that road.  
---
Teleporting to dungeons, flying, raiding for tokens, smaller raids, easier content, changes to class development, obsoleting gear and the work it took to acquire it.   It didn‚Äôt start after TBC, TBC was the start.
---
yes i meant restart sorry. This happened to me yesterday, I paid for a month but I couldn't select classic. Then I restarted the battlenet launcher and it appeared.
---
But if you say that you already restarted it might not be the solution.. 
---
I assume you have an active wow subscription right? If not the classic selector won't show up.
---
Also there's a comment saying that the launcher might need an update, take a look at this.
---
RealMobHealth works by seeing how much damage it took you to kill a mob. It then uses that in the future to show that mob‚Äôs estimated health. 
---
So, when you see a mob you‚Äôve never fought before or of a level you haven‚Äôt faced before it will just show the percentage. If you‚Äôve faced it before, you will get the health numbers you expect.
---
It was hilarious then as well. But we live in a time where virtue signaling about pc culture reigns supreme. The more it pisses these people off, the funnier it is to me.
---
tbags are best bags.
---
Yeah I keep seeing how great the classic wow community is.  I've now been in two different guilds (currently in the largest on my server), the chat is filled with "Jew this" and "Jew that" with a variety of other racial slurs peppered in on a frequency I'm not comfortable with. They claim it's "gamer speak."  I don't know how I feel about this.  It definitely wasn't like this in 2004.
---
Right. How the fuck does a raptor fucking Parry me 3 times in a row lol
---
Those trainers must be the richest fucks in Orgrimmar
---
Ya why not? Let retail complete its transformation and let classic take over as the true mmorpg.
---
Able to share the guides at all?  Thanks for the info!
---
Effectively the servers are made of of ‚Äúlayers‚Äù which are full Azeroth worlds that hold 3k people so they can fit 10-15k people on a realm at a time. So you can be standing in the same spot and not see someone because different layers nodes and mobs are present on their own mutually exclusive layer
---
Blessings upon you! This has fixed the one and only issue I had with ElvUI
---
That‚Äôs a good idea!!
---
Yeah but is it tied to the machine?  Has anyone tried a cross two computers?
---
That's what the world chat channel is for
---
I always give warriors some bufffood. They need it.
---
Incendius-NA
---
Oof I felt this. My wife told me to mow the lawn before playing this morning. That sucked.
---
Im using joanas horde leveling guide, I paid for it.  I've had it since vanilla, have new version now.
---
That's my problem I like the two but I started playing in TBC, so I don't really know how they felt in Vanilla ^^
---
quit now, save your marriage
---
Well i don't know if it is your type of game. But i think the fact they brought vanilla back and how eagerly people want to play, i gues that should tell you enough of how good it is.
---
It is not so much the game as the whole experience tbh. Just a ton of fun, meet people, challenging and rewarding gameplay. 
---
Yes, you should get it.
---
Play without sound and listen to music like a normal person
---
Except the Coca Cola Classic for many of us is Coca Cola Classic üòã
---
That‚Äôs the world of Warcraft that we play in...
---
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
---
Well , IF was the capital whe I played vanilla.
---
Most people were there .
---
Dont really remmember why it was favored over SW but SW was mostly empty.
---
I‚Äôm out at first sight of a flying mount.   WPVP is wow
---
Didn't even occur to me, love it! We're all finnish indeed.
---
This was before the launch, when it was time to reserve a name. I was also debating between gnome mage or troll shaman
---
Probably because it is way easier to post from mobile
---
Servers??
---
I wanna know too
---
this game wont grow like vanilla though.  itll shrink.  its a totally different problem i dont think blizz will keep adding servers when half are at medium or high even at peaks. it wont fix anything.
---
Sounds about right
---
i took the Tram from IF to SW, and my character kept falling beneath the tram. If I would have afk‚Äôd for the ride I am sure my toon would have clipped off and been on the tracks... I had to keep jumping back onto the platform. Hope this gets fixed.
---
Ehhh I just dropped enchanting @skill 125 because it was sucking up my money and every 3rd person on my server seems to be tailoring/ enchanting
---
Yeah. I do have an active subscription.
---
Also it‚Äôs like 5GB vs the 100+GB install of retail which is cute
---
Exactly that
---
I opened a chest and got a nice leather green so gave it to a shaman nearby. He didn't even move his character or say a word, just took it
---
Gotta put it on the auction house
---
At 14:00 I had only a queue of 1000 people. The last week it was average 8000-10000. Seems like the people make use of the good weather
---
You can always multi-pull or chain-pull to keep things spicy (and to level faster). üèπ
---
tfw on vacation and playing a shitload and only 24
---
I just explore a lot, it was one of my favourite parts of the game back in the day :D.
---
~~God bless~~ [Blessing of Kings] Chris Metzen
---
Is that plank or whatever from ed, ed, and eddie behind you?
---
It was before launch, during reserving name time. And as we all know, choosing a name is one of the hardest parts of WoW
---
Relative novelty is much higher when you aren't running the same dungeon over and over, which was my point.
---
Uh concussive shot? It helps w/ kiting a lot. I had minimal issues b4 level 10.
---
Oh but dont worry vabillo is so friendly and so much better than retail theres a real sense of commu- and my item got looted as I was fighting the mob guarding it and McGee looted during the distraction. And hes laughing at me.... and he's gloating in general. K let's post it on Redd- aand I'm told I'll laugh about it later.....
---
***imnotlaughing***
---
No. It‚Äôs the way you go about it.
---
Not a single minute in a queue today. EU, RPPVP server, won't tell which one.
---
Ya you definitely know more than the devs. You should apply since you're the only one with any knowledge of how populated the servers actually are. We should vote you in as wow super classic president that makes all important decisions.
---
alliance
---
You betcha buddy
---
Blizzard should give us a one time change to let the servers go down a little
---
A couple other people had this issue. I'm on vacation. Can you try this and see if it works? This only works in Battle Stance. Make sure it switches stances properly as well as uses Cleave from Battle Stance. If it works, I'll update the OP with this and the other stances version.
---

the new server had queues last night and for some strange reason the sites that offered quque times are down. 
---
we reserved names, made a guild and leveled, im about to hit lvl21, and worked on proffesions to support the guild, im paying for this and all you can say is reroll ...
---
the guild is loosing members and blizz is loosing subs.
---
the media isnt covering this and thats disturbing. 
---
10h day queue 5 days not solved. 
---
you not understanding the effort put in, is disturbing. 
---
to me it seems like blizz isnt stretching to resolve the queues, its stretching to mitigate negative media covarage (or i can imagine test the limits for their needs not ours) , and you look like are the joker helping. 
---
im paying to be treated like a dog. rerolling wasnt an option then and isnt an option now.
---
You get a new level of growl every 10 levels though, so you've lost me there.
---
its the weekend, so ppl are staying on longer now. expected. so unless u pick a lower pop server, expect the queue during peak play hours especially first weekend after launch
---
It allows more people to join some without layering the amount of people in some areas would crash the server.
---
It directly impacts the queue
---
Ugh wrong character...
---
Dont know how well youre geared but thats a really solid axe for a level 13-18 warrior. You can train it in orgrimmar at the weapon masters, close to the warrior trainer un thevalley of honour. Dont forget to pick up the flight path when youre there haha.
---
How the flippity flip would a warcraft joke be too obscure for a warcraft subreddit?
---
They are Micro ATX EVGA cases I used when I built our computers a few years ago

The worst is that most ppl have the same behaviour in RL...sad...sad
---
Fishing buddy is a hack or not?
---
Nice blog
---
Why are we praising this crap. Its totally unhealthy to play that much and with that little sleep..
---
You mean I chose the lion over the purple weeb cat?  Lol seriously though I wanna bear tank so cat forms weren‚Äôt even on my mind
---
Right? I've not had a drink in nearly a week, Classic WoW is doing what CBT couldn't for me.
---
This is perfect
---
Then do Classic +. Dont add an xpac and then remove  vital parts to the expansion. As a lover of TBC, i would be extremely disappointed if they added tbc and it wasn‚Äôt an accurate representation of the xpac.
---
In end game the community difference between having a solely local server population vs mixed in with tons of other server strangers is a huge difference in quality of community.  
---
There is something magical about a server "tribe" and feeling one's self growing familiar with various people you see at the AH, or running around in the world, or over and over again with and against in Battlegrounds.  
---
Yeah it made queue times shitty at times being isolated to a single server - but that community feel really took a big hit with combined server populations \[instancing\] for various functions.
---
Got some grey cloth shoulders off a mob in Westfall. Can‚Äôt remember being more stoked about a piece of gear. More stoked than any point in BFA, that‚Äôs for sure.
---
As a side note, how do you think layering would affect the rag race? That one totally baffles me.
---
Hey what‚Äôre UI‚Äôs?
---
You think layering doesn't affect queues?
---
....
---
... ... ... ...
---
Wow
---
I hope so. Dont want to wait until 11 pm to lvl up my priest
---
Thanks for the details ! Getting skinning and mining then saving mats sounds like a great idea
---
GW2 did it well imo. It was a glider, not a full-freedom flyer. So it was fast, but still involved the world a little, with finding high ground to launch from.
---
Reroll
---
Dude I'm a glutten for punishment I just got to start last night and grinded to 10 now the prot grind to 60 starts...
---
Thats not how it works in this case.
---
How did you get that?
---
No clue what you guys are talking about but it sounds pretty amazing. That's awesome
---
I tried that and it didn't sell, but that was a few days ago.  Doesn't seem like there's a huge demand yet.
---
TB is most underrated cap.
---
My brother and I used to read through this on the school bus to decide what quests and areas we were going to do next, good times :) still have it, although the front cover came off.
---
Thought the same thing!
---
Didn't experience a queue once.
---
&gt;Why are
---
Frost bolt, frost bolt, frost bolt, frost bolt, zzzzzzzzzzz frost bolt, frost bolt, zzzzzzzzzzzz. You basically have to spec frost bolt to do any damage in Molten Core/Blackwing layer. Frost mages are really fun when getting to aoe. But, for single target damage, you just spam 1 key the whole dungeon.
---
It's an mmo, what's the media suppose to cover?
---
The media has never covered game issues, unless you mean like ign or something.
---
The new server had queues because everyone went there last night to bypass queues.
---
I play on Old Blanchy, no issues.
---

---
You're weird.
---
I enjoyed this post thanks.
---
But I like my rogue I've played a day and a half so I wouldn't want to restart
---
Yeah I love wall jumping. There's that one gryphon camp in the mountains that you pass over if you fly from IF to Wetlands I think. Took me forever when I was a kid but I managed to climb the mountain up there.
---
If you never try something different, how are you supposed to know that (almost) all others have it harder?
---
I‚Äôve done Deadmines only twice now! Our tanks have been pretty good, some pulls got dicey (sub 20 combat parties) but I haven‚Äôt wiped yet! My one complaint is that clothies are needing anything and everything. Had a mage on my 2nd run who got the ring off 2nd boss, and ninja‚Äôd the cape off VanCleef (3 stam 6 agil)
---
As a druid, I was fairly unimpressed. Some of these guys are being so selfish. 
---
Nonetheless, I am excited to run DM another 2-3 times tonight after work! Going to ding lvl 20 and finally get my kitty form!!
---
Did a quick google cause I had this issue. Rank 2 will scale with your level and get stronger where rank 1 stays weak
---

Pretty sure fishing buddy was a Bot, or at least turned into one for retail in Legion, don't use it.
---
Vendor Price will highlight the lowest value item in your bag that isn't a reagent if you open your bag and hit ctrl. The downside is most of the time i WANT to throw away meat or fish, but it will highlight grays over them because they're reagents.
---
The rest i can't help with because i'm not interested in them so i have no knowledge.
---
I don't think you got the point of what I'm saying
---
You'll one day think back to this moment and think wtf was I even doing?
---
If you've got more please go ahead this has been rather hilarious. Havent even read your last 3 replies PepeLaugh
---
We need to decide this quickly. Game has already be beeten. All the lvl 60 are already bored out!
---
/s for the obvious
---
Ecb is broken, get Quartz
---
You ever stop to think that you might be the problem? People deserve to be happy and enjoy things. Stop trying to ruin it for everyone else.
---
Laughs in warlock
---
Well the only other thing I can think of is that you tamed something with Rank 1 by mistake but I‚Äôm sure you checked that.
---
Go darkshore or loch modan until 17/18 then return to westfall. Did the same after that quest and worked fine
---
Game has it flaws of which everyone is aware of. That's why it won't last for long (as it was before). But for the time being it is too early even to speak about this. What was it exactly, day five? Come on!
---
Wash your back
---
You said it was nonsensical when they claimed layers would be exploited but they are literally being exploited. You were wrong. 
---
You seem to be the one that could use a little more understanding. Maybe stop posting?
---
Anal
---
You shouldn't really be using a guide if you're completely new. Just play the game.
---
I want to heal in raids and do damage in solo PvP and heal in group pvp.  Priest or paladin?  Alliance only.   I don't have a lot of time to play so it's important for me to be able to get groups quickly.
---
Naming policy is a lot more strict. For instance, on an RP server, if your name is "Doodymcfart", you can get reported. Even stuff like "Policeman" can be reported, but you only get flagged for a name change, I don't believe you actually get in trouble unless it's a repeat thing.
---
Spoilers?
---
I was told he gained over 5000 subs which is a minimum 12.5k in the bank before donations.
---
Hello. Brand new to MMOs in general (I know).
---
I've been trying to settle in a class for the last few days. Currently have a lvl 16 priest and a lvl 6 Rouge.
---
I really want to like the priest because I understand that healing is a desirable class for groups/raids but the solo questing and leveling in general has been so bad that I just want to have some fun early game.
---
Are there any tips for solo leveling a priest and what are some easy/fun classes for a beginner looking to just level without worrying too much.
---
Yup. We have some small windows for low or 0 queue times but it‚Äôs far and few between. Last night we had well over 12000
---
My man, I understood you the first time.
---
Enough already. It's my opinion and I'm free to express it.
---
But what about the people that aren't giving quests, the rich are getting richer and the poor poorer.
---
The main reason people wanted classic is for the game exactly as it was, warts and all. Right now people are enjoying the game as is because its what they wanted. Wait for the hype to pass and people will be open for the discussion of changes or things that just make no sense. For now leave em too it the time for change will come.
---
Wimmy wam wam wazzle*
---
So to clarify are you staying logged in while sleeping... thus preventing other from playing? Or do you log out?
---
I saw this happen yesterday with the random hunter i was grouped with. I was playing a warlock. We both hit 10 on a quest and decided to work through our lvl 10 quests together and stuck it out for almost an hour. Went from struggling against lvl 11s to completely destroying lvl 13s. Awesome
---
He wasn‚Äôt letting me train anything last night!
---
Remember that peak hours are a thing. And timezones exist.
---
If you kill the acolyte who is building the new ud base after Jaina's base goes down, the entire mission becomes trivial.
---
How do you use a gun on a warrior orc ? I dont really understand how it works
---
Yeah. It‚Äôs happening to a lot of people. I‚Äôve seen them everywhere.
---
I have a /thanks macro just for the bros.
---
As a career Warrior, I kinda missed the struggle of getting a second mob on you, or accidentally pulling one 4 levels higher. Or my favorite, while waiting for a Hogger group, Hogger spawned on top of me. I got one shot at level 7. Good times.
---
But damn it gets annoying at times.
---
Still don't wanna see retail anymore though.
---
Are you specifically downloading the version for classic ? Mine is called gathermate2
---
Play on Grobbulus. Community is friendly, active, and the server seems balanced.
---
Classic be like that
---
"We want the classic experience back!" Less than a month later....let's 10 man cheese dungeons
---
Well it depends, as an alchemist, when I have healing pots I'm fine! Unfortunately, I ran out a while back, so I lost count...
---
Those bears are the real final bosses. Thanks a lot!
---
It is not a need, the pushback is the same not just to me, but to other people, including creators etc. Is everyone with a different opinion a problem?
---
Layering doesn't affect the queues. It doesn't increase the server capacity, it just prevents the zones from becoming too crowded.
---
lol, I think your memory is hazy. I played Rogue and Spriest in pvp back in the days and I absolutely deleted these classes with Rogues in BG and wPvP (all lvl 60s)
---
Do you play retail at all? Cause if you do then you‚Äôd notice that both games are very different and that‚Äôs because they ‚Äúfixed‚Äù what was ‚Äúwrong‚Äù with classic. 
---
The people asked for complete classic experience, and that‚Äôs what Blizz delivered, so talking about ‚Äúthings they could change‚Äù is stupid because they already did that.
---
Hit print screen. It‚Äôs easier.
---
Try going into a world pvp event with 200 people and tell me the server doesn't lag.
---
Now imagine that 200 instances of 1v1 pvp happen all throughout the server ALL THE TIME. And somehow the server isn't on fire.
---
It's the same with 10 instances of Barrens vs one massive Barrens.
---
Not that I'm aware of? Unless it turned into one later? I just used it because it rebound right click to cast line, and changed volume levels. It also kept track of catch rates in various area, but I didn't care much for that.
---
Level 18?! AHHHHHH OHHHHHH
---
Poor guy on the 13" laptop as well!
---
High five for all my Floridians not evacuating but telling work you are for the day off we are the true hero
---
Well, I wouldn't be making this post of I was frail. I just wanted to see if there are people who share my opinion for once.
---
How do I update the launcher manually? Shouldn't it update itself?
---
Like I said, maybe on weak geared people.
---
And the layers are going away
---
Hey man, maybe Classic isn‚Äôt for you, and that‚Äôs not a bad thing. If you‚Äôre hating the grind now, it‚Äôs only going to get worst.
---
You are slow, true, but you are a walking minigun aimed at every enemy who dares approach you.
---
&gt;Pretty sure fishing buddy was a Bot, or at least turned into one for retail in Legion, don't use it.
---
Yikes. Duly noted. 
---
&gt;Vendor Price will highlight the lowest value item in your bag that isn't a reagent if you open your bag and hit ctrl. The downside is most of the time i WANT to throw away meat or fish, but it will highlight grays over them because they're reagents.
---
Hmm. Sounds okay, but you're right, often it's the whites I'm more interested in tossing. 
---
10/10 execution
---
If you're on fornite, there's no reason to play retail. It's not sexy.
---
Classic is sexy. Anyone will play a game that is getting this much attention. It's all about perception, and little to do with actual facts. The fact is they should have been able to play wow before, but it wasn't sexy to do so.
---
You can send good and bags to your alt and also buy good weapons from the ah.
---
Firemaw has like a 25k queue now
---
The pet damage talent is garbage you go marksman until 29 or 30 because without frenzy making your pet hit faster the range is way worth it and this is considering a pvp server at 41 yards no other class can even dot you meaning with cheetah on they literally can never land a blow if you do it right it‚Äôs 100% better than BM or survival I mean the ability to attack without being attacked surely sounds better than what 15% damage on a 20-30 damage attack? But call me crazy
---
This was more of a TBC thing, but being one of the few warriors to max ranged skills made you a total baller. It was super convenient to be able to break polymorphs with your gun in heroics, and have the mob instantly aggro onto you instead of rushing and one shotting the mage. Not quite as big a deal in classic dungeons, but still useful. Furthermore, in Classic, where you cant Thunderclap in prot, actually hitting the shot you pull with and following up with bloodrage can make or break you initial threat lead if you have trigger happy dps.
---
Also TBC dungeon/raid bosses had so many "FUCK YOU MEELEE" abilities. It felt nice to actually he able to get some small damage in while you watch the boss have a temper tantrum from 30 yards away.

As far as pvp - you're gonna spend a lot of time frost nova'd. With the low delay ranged weapons warriors typically go for you can usually get 2 shots in before it breaks and you intercept. Might as well, nothing else for you to do at range.
---
Perfectly balanced.

*Gives us classic*

Haha yeah fuck you Blizzard!

‚ÄúCreators‚Äù means one YouTube video by a moron who intentionally riled up the FFXIV community and then when his video received well deserved downvotes made fake claims that he was receiving death threats as an excuse to delete the video and save his channel‚Äôs ratios.  That‚Äôs literally the only person you‚Äôre talking about.  This has never happened in the WoW community.

Oh so you got lucky with your group? Cool anecdote bro
---
Do you really LFG through the chat 3 times an hour? Are you joining a new group via LFG for literally every quest you do? Why aren't you just asking people in your layer for an invite when you stand next to them?
---
I have so many questions for you.
---
what happens in 1kn stays in 1kn

If it is a fun class? You bett. Lot's of lore, fun and diverse playstyles, wolf travelform, totems, cool spells. And a lot of quests to get their totems and abilities. 
---
One of my favourite classes.
---
So they really just mirrored the landscape there? wonder how much of the world is just copies
---
I'm a priest and i'm getting bandaged constantly. Thanks I guess?
---
I had a guildy asking for help questing in Westfall, saying he was getting wrecked. I made the trip from Loch Modan to help, because that's what mates do, only to realize he's a warlock. He even had the big guy out, but he was in aggressive mode and didn't have the auto taunt activated, so his familiar was attacking everything without ever keeping aggro.
---
Some people just don't know.
---
I have, and correct me if I'm wrong but it wasn't set in Azeroth was it?
---
I'm also a rogue, checkmate.
---
There should be quests available in The Parc :)
---
Yeah, but they have that tamagochi crap.
---
Nope, I'd rather die because I was stupid.
---
Price will grow when people collect more gold. Servers exist less than week and therefore, for example, right now there are no reason to sell peacebloom for 5s each because nobody have enough to spend - there are much more needed things such as skills, professions.
---
I was letting it go as I believe it's for the greater good in the long run and I expect we will be getting some free gametime back for the delays but 5 days in now and I've had around 3 hours of actual playing the game. I've been in the queue today for about 3 hours, just went to check how long was left and I've been disconnected and am now back to 7320 in the queue. So I'm looking at 6 to 7 hours today just to get in game. I'm not one to normally get annoyed by things like this but this is just piss poor. 
---
I'm sure it's somewhere in the terms of service but I'm considering a chargeback via PayPal now for services they have not provided and making a new account in a month if it's got better.
---
The last time I played rerail was MoP. I don't really get the "things they could change" part, since I don't think they should change classic. It is the holyer than thou mentality that classic is full of.
---
I thought we were getting no changes, servers didn't go down for 8 hours on Tuesday morning.
---
I don‚Äôt think they even know how to do that at this point. It‚Äôs too far gone to repair and I think even they know that so they‚Äôre just doing what they can to pump money out of it. The only way to capture this classic feel is probably a new IP
---
People will start running out of PTO soon so I suspect queues will be shorter or gone in a week
---
It's the name of the game
---
There are no Druid trainers in SW or IF, best thing to do if this is set hearth in whatever zone you‚Äôre leveling in and port to moonglade to train/pick up quests
---
It do be like that
---
We have World of Warcraft Battle for Azeroth or retail and then we have World of Warcraft Classic.
---
&gt;the act of layer skipping was intended for people to play with their friends on the same server so that they could group up and do quests together or RP. So why is there no hard limit on how many times this can be done? 
---
That isn't the only purpose is probably the main reason, you may also not always be put into the same layer every time you restart the game.
---
Suppose you find several groups outside of game (eg. discord), group with non-friends in different layers to do quests a few times, or similar, and then when you try to group with friends you're locked out of swapping to play with them? What if you have a lot of friends, or heck, a full guild you're running around helping, or say enchanting stuff for?
---
Unless the finite cap is very very high with a reasonable refresh period, normal players will frequently find their experience impacted by this, while trying to play the game normally. I suspect the layering cooldown is pretty low and not hard capped for this reason.
---
I also expect blizzard doesn't put people back into the same layer unless it's within the disconnect grace period, which could increase the amount of layer swapping people normally do, making a finite cap more problematic.
---
There are some alternatives that might sort of help some abuse cases but not a lot. Suppose the timer was a couple of minutes longer. This wouldn't entirely stop AoE mob farming and rare farming abuse because in some cases it would still be faster than waiting for mob respawns, or could be used to create a slightly slower but still very fast farm pattern (eg. Farm, layer swap, farm, move, farm, move, farm, layerswap, farm, repeat). So having a cap of say, 3x 30 minutes wouldn't be a huge help really, since you could still get a lot out of it.
---
tl;dr Any obvious fixes would also impact people playing normally in fairly common cases.  Your own example would be more than low enough to potentially split friend groups, or more commonly split guild grouping attempts.
---
&gt;If it keeps up, the economy of servers will be marred, the world first Rag kill race will be pointless
---
I seriously have to question how exactly you expect this to happen.
---
Layers are still a pseudo fixed (blizzard manually sets layers/ranges of possible layers) full server instances, they are already being farmed by people right now, and very close to their full impact on the economy and say, rep farming, is already being felt even without intentional layer swapping. Even without trying you might often multiple full guild groups not competing for spawns in an area because they might naturally be on different layers by coincidence.
---
This inherently gives an advantage to anyone doing targeted farming of a particular area in an organized way, so I kind of doubt any large guilds *won't* be benefiting from it. Additionally, this is something you could still organize intentionally even with 3 layer swaps an hour.
---
The economic impact is simply that the economic is about under the strain of one healthy population, since there's an instance of resources for each healthy pop worth of players roughly.
---
All in all, this does definitely make the experience faster and smoother than classic, as a truly jam-packed classic server might have fewer resources and more competition for spawns. However this is a playing field that everyone is on together, and room for abuse is pretty limited outside of the top wave of people who are in their 50s around now. For example, Jokerd AoE farming aggressively while layer swapping never would have worked if every layer on the server was full of level 50s AoE farming, which is probably how it will be in 1-2 days.
---
Instance progression is largely going to be unimpacted by this, and world firsts like Rag will still be relevant, after all they're still going to be the world first for Classic, where all the top guilds are playing with this mechanic.
---
Obviously it's not the "Authentic Vanilla Experience," and we need layers to go away in the long run, but I don't think a kneejerk quick fix like this is going to do much besides annoying more social players in large guilds. If blizzard fixes this say, later today, the damage will have already been done in terms of progression as we do already have a world first level 60 and most of the super tryhards approaching the level cap already.
---
Me and my friends settled in DD and the amazing community keeps delivering
---
We're finally having the wow-time for which we have dreamnt for years.
---
Get off these Grob. queues, come to DD!
---
lol whatever makes you feel better dude. Not hard to google or youtube either if your memory is too hazy. Sounds like you are just bias against rogues
---
You‚Äôre right there isn‚Äôt anything wrong with complaining about the flaws but there isn‚Äôt anything wrong with disagreeing with you as well. You scratch this off as ‚Äòfanboying‚Äô but in reality there are more dimensions to it.
---
For example, in my opinion I‚Äôve seen the flaws I‚Äôve complained about them... 14 years ago. When I see those same complaints now I want to roll my eyes. You full well know what you were getting yourself into. This is what majority wanted the ‚ÄòClassic‚Äô WoW experience... untouched, mostly. That includes its queue times, spending 2 hours on one quest, etc. If you want to complain you will get backlash. Some downvotes, some comments like move on to retail. 
---
This is what I‚Äôll say, be vocal do what you are doing but don‚Äôt disregard the majority. Talk on wowclassic+ and get a following get the majority on your side and maybe the flaws will be fixed. Until then let‚Äôs enjoy what most fans wanted, Classic wow.
---
DOTimer is really good
---
They are also hoping you'll choose a lower pop server
---
Lol! Just lol! :D
---
I said the same thing. I really think they should and it wouldn't be that difficult. I know people will lose there work, but it's not for them. It's for the people who love fresh worlds. What better time to get into WoW than a fresh server? New ones launch every year or every other could draw in a lot of people.
---
By trashed they mean different than in 2004. As if it wouldn't happen either way.
---
The market will correct itself in a month or two after layering is gone, maybe it'll be off by like 10%. No reason to think otherwise. If people talking about this shit had any sort of knowledge of economics they'd know that.
---
A single gold selling bot has more negative impact on the economy than 10 layer hoppers could ever hope to have.
---
The name of it is ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù World of Warcraft
---
im surprised to hear that honestly, im level 22 and i've had no issues doing yellow quests so far, i've even soloed a few red quests but those were rough.
---
I like it. Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs practical though.
---
People: WE WANT A CLASSIC EXPERIENCE
---
Also people: ooee an exploit! Lemme hit that hard!
---
And here I am only just got my 2 set :(
---
Sounds like time for a new guild with people on your pace then
---
I find this hard to take seriously since we are all affected by layering whether we think we could handle it being off or not
---
Colloquially, both blizzard and the community adopted the name to differentiate it from its previous iteration, which most people call Vanilla WoW. It is a different game in a lot of ways - the new client has many new options and QoL improvements, anti-cheat system is better, etc.
---
Yes, but he is trying to apply exact same version, not a lower level of a spell. It does less damage in first seconds, but does more in a long run and it allows you to fear a mob and switch to another target, thats the problem he is expiriencing
---
I think your best bet is priest (shadow is OP in PVP) or Druid (you can carry flag). Paladins are overall not good DPSers.

This issue is magnitudes smaller than the same issue caused by gold farming bots in vanilla.
---
This time around we have much better bot detection so their impact will be marginally smaller than back then.

The economy should be HEALTHIER now than it ever was despite a few players getting rich due to layering exploits.

Also hunter was shit-tier back then in pvp

Aw dude...

You mean Brazilians, Cubans and Venezuelans that are living in the US? That's just a small portion of the population tho... like ridiculously small.
---
If it's what they would vote... well it depends on what communities you hang around. Check /r/Argentina and it's almost everyone leaning right. Brazil and Argentina are pretty much at a similar point in their political cycle right now, they finished 10+ years of left-leaning dominated politics, with high levels of corruption and after getting tired of corruption, taxes, etc. they elected a dumbass right-wing president that would have lost by a landslide on pretty much every other context. Argentina just finished his 4 years of that right-wing dumbass after 12 years of left-leaning corruption, taxes, etc. The left is winning this years elections sadly.
---
But the title says "It's **all** over now". :(
---
Seal of the crusader sucks.  Unless you hit that mob for 15 or 20 seconds.  I dont even waste gold on crusader.  Righteousness is faster dmg, judges can crit, and seal of command will be your bread and butter for leveling
---
If you are dungeon grinding the way to 60, you'll probably have most of the gold done.
---
Hahahahahahah
---
There are a lot of russians on any server in any case. We can't hide from them XD and, yes you are right 10 k razorgore queue and around 3-5k on fireleash in peak hours.
---
It's even worse than that. You don't pay in money, you pay in the time... in a game that's already a time sink and has much sparser graveyard placement than later expansions. Screw that.
---
Don't play warrior if you hate it, you'll stop using it eventually and you'll feel like you wasted your time.
---
Im running a paladin for my solo main and duo leveling a mage with my friend who's a rogue. 
---
The paladin is fantastic because she can easily take a hit, and if she gets overwhelmed, she can duck out and heal herself. And I know that I'll be contributing to my guild once im high enough lvl, since holy paladins make fantastic healers.
---
But honestly, I enjoy playing the mage WAY more. Dishing out a lot of damage is so fun. It's just tough doing anything by myself since im super squishy.
---
So yeah, id say if you want to go heals and you're soloing, run a paladin. But it really feels good to DPS in this game. Rogue and mage are great choices, and warlocks. I don't know much about hunters - only that i am jealous of their pets every time i see one - but they should also be a good DPS choice
---
If they do what op wants maybe they also give you more layer jumps in a city... And if you leave the city it dumps you into the last layer you were in before doing city stuff
---
I will just say that I didn't know wowclassicplus existed before making this post, neither is it my goal to get the majority on my side. I have just had a number of negative experiences that I wanted to talk about, and my overall thoughts about it. Yes, I know nobody cares, but you never know.

Do your class quest in darnassus to get teleport:moonglade and bear form and then go to stormwind.
---
From here you get teleport to moonglade and fly darnassus for your class quests and then hearth back to stormwind
---
Don't know why cause if you're on Whitemane your realm is way more populated than mine and my quest hubs are just stuffed with people.  I see people everywhere.
---
You're probably just ahead of the average level right now.
---
Yeah, but why not?
---
Play one of the empty servers?
---
You're displaying exactly the kind of stupid teen shit I'm talking about.

You have life tap right? Try to be outside the 5 second rule when it kicks in and you'll rarely be out of mana. It's a very fast leveling class if you do it right.

BTW it's spelled rogue, not rouge. It's a common mistake but people will tease you for it. Rouge is a cosmetic.

I dont think the economy will be "ruined" because of it. People really need to calm down.
---
This guy here has it.
---
You'll notice for some classes this matters more than others and for certaint things. E.g. as a spell caster having your wand regularly upgraded or as a warrior constantly upgrading your 2h weapon  will have huge impacts on your performance.
---
Its wowhead they have europe, oz and na
---
Don‚Äôt restart. Head to Undercity and do Silverpine forests or grind out mobs your own level. You will need to grind xp at certain points, start by always fighting something on way to any quest objective..that should reduce the amount you need to straight up stop and grind significantly
---
Found the guy abusing layers to level.
---
This isn't anywhere near the level of what happens in retail since those are shards not layers. Your server only has a handful of layers and the number/population of them is determined by your server pop. On retail you can flip between any of 1000s of phases some of which are on empty servers.
---
Group up? Or go level ? Would be my advice I wouldn‚Äôt start over  imo
---
Go back to retail. 
---
Jk but maybe its just you
---
My parents would only let me play on weekends, barely on Sunday, and would still limit game time on weekends. I feel like I have more time now lol
---
I think the main reason might be time. In retail and other games nowadays for that matter, there's always some new patch, raid, etc. that people want to complete as fast as possible. In Classic, I don't need that constant feed of new things to keep me playing, I'm already enjoying playing the game as it is. I don't feel like killing trash mobs and playing on auto-pilot. Instead I'm taking each mob as a challenge and I can't be sure of the outcome. 
---
When I first logged in, the starting zone was so crowded that I couldn't get the quest progressed at all. So I went past them to kill level 5's. And fighting those level 5's with my level 2 Rogue was the most fun I have had in years of playing video games. Sure, I died a lot. Like really a lot. But the first time I downed one of them, every time I ran back from the graveyard, every time I repaired my armor in Brill, every time I charged back into battle and of course, dinging level 3, I enjoyed all of that. It took an hour, maybe more, I'm not sure. But hell, every second of it was worth it.
---
I am hopeful for many more years of enjoying Classic, helping others, and maybe one day doing all the things I wished to be able to do as a kid.
---
Didnt know you could pickpocket mobs in combat, og garrote might be the same
---
Layering is how people within realms are sectioned off to reduce population. Idk what resetting a layer is though
---
Overlooking that the horde has started all the wars past and future in World of Warcraft.
---
Damn boy upgrade that S7
---
I was making a failed pregnancy joke
---
So, should I just not care that the community is like that? Do you not realize stuff like that can and will have negative consequences on the game itself? If you are a new player looking for a new MMO to get into and the first thing you see or hear about it is that people are willing to send death threats and are incredibly nationalist, you won't be encouraged to keep playing.
---
I've just had to log out because even with layering there are so many areas where there is maybe at best 1/3 of the amount of mobs needed to deal with the population.
---
Collecting 15 defias bandanas even in a group took over an hour because for every mob that spawns theres multiple players or groups waiting to tag them.
---
Definitely not anywhere low enough population wise for single unlayered zones.
---
My only advice is to get herb and alchemy. Alchemy has a ton of buffs that make a huge difference for melee classes.
---
Welcome to Azeroth:)
---
I'm in the same boat. I'm lvl 22 and questioning if AOE farming is more efficient
---
correct, heckin gosh dangit
---
Except world bosses. They aren't allowing that anymore.
---
Yeah we've been getting some low effort recently.
---
My wife heals me and gives me windfurry as i protect her with my big 2h
---
Have you looked at Kargoz priest guide for exmple? If you are having a bad time leveling the priest its Maybe because you are not specced into spirit tap and Wand specialisation. Have 5/5 in both and use a wand and you will have no downtime at all! Or maybe you Knew this and your problem is that you the priest boring?
---
Druid trainer is in the park, in SW.
---
People do share your opinion but like I said above majority don‚Äôt, and most don‚Äôt send death threats. If this is a major concern to you maybe we should step away from wow classic and talk about the mental health situation instead.
---
Water is so expensive as a mage /s
---
Do you have an active sub? This happened to me too I deleted and reinstalled and it worked

AHH OHHH

Grey items are for vendoring. White items all have a purpose. Always worth finding out what it is. It helps speed things up when you know you need to collect hops, okra, flasks of oil and murloc fins early on.

Anyone who doesn‚Äôt get the reference is no true blizzard fan. Maybe you and a few other dead homies want to blow a demon up too.
---
Christopher Reeves ?
---
Lmao what server has a raiding scene already?
---
No need to restart. In classic WoW you'll be hard pressed to come out on top fighting a mob a couple levels higher. Stick to mobs your own level or a couple below. Go back to your starting zone and see if there's any quests you missed. If not, grind some mobs until your next level. If you're horde, go to Orgrimmar and queue for rage fire chasm groups when you hit 13. I made a lot of silver selling stuff from those runs. Good luck!
---
Yes you have twitchemote
---
You just enjoy endulging in the sexual pleasure of being dominated by a superior male. Which makes me kinda uncomfortable in a way but I'm no person to deny you your orgasm.
---
You said blizzards intent for layering was for speed runners to level faster...
---
You're going to win every single engagement that you start. If you're being jumped then you're not in the scenario where you'd be able to utilize the 41 yrd range so I'm not really sure where it comes in handy.
---
That being said I'd take the increased move speed on cheetah, 30% pet move speed and 20%(~8-10% total damage) pet damage over imp concussive shot, 5% crit, and range every day
---
You're the class that is known to beat literally every other class in wpvp while leveling, I don't know why you need the upperhand unless it's phase 2 and everyone is just constantly group ganking and you plan on winning 2-3v1s.
---
Not to mention imp revive pet + pet armor/hp
---
and if my server gets overpopulated again? just like this one did?
---
im not bloating this. we are a guild just like everyone on the 10hour queue i doubt accepting moving to a realm os an option for most, as does the 5day - status quo scenario is playing out.
---
blizzard is putting more in to mitigating negative media, than solving the problem.
---
And you are not helping.
---
You'll probably be better off with a Paladin for solo PvP, but high level groups will probably find you more immediately desirable if you're a Priest - raids especially. Then again, everyone I've been playing with has been super chill, so it's hard to say if people will really care about the differences. Priests are better at doing MAIN healing, while paladins can protect squishies with melee combat and also give a lot of powerful buffs, but yeah you're going to be doing less healing to a large group as you have to target your heals more. I would play both up to level 12 or so and see which one you vibe with most :)
---
Feral Druids, how has your experience been so far? Do you get snubbed by groups because "warriors are better tanks" or "feral is the worst"? Have a 17 mage rightnow, but for some reason feral seems really appealing.
---
Eyyyy I‚Äôve seen you around, names woogy.
---
It‚Äôs my bosses work phone lol
---
Yea no, intentionally abusing layering is different from the passive layering you're always subjected to. If i use bugs/in game mechanics to skip something in any other speedrun catagory i am no longer in the skip less catagory. The dota balance thing is comparing apples to oranges, and makes no sense here. You seem pretty dumb in general. Blocking dumb people is my general rule of thumb so you keep making nonsense arguements.
---
I'm just about level 40 and let me tell you aoe farming us very efficient especially with layers.. but it's very difficult you have to use all your tools available and you will die lots. You want to be probably level 26 before trying to aoe farm for cone of cold.
---
Some of the quests are notoriously shit at telling you where to go

Yes but also... Barrens chat.

Your friends aren't automatically on the same layer.

Yes I did. Still enjoyed it for what it was.
---
I fully understand that I am in the minority, and for good reason. The game is great and it means a lot for people who grew up on it or have met friends/SO there, etc. My major concern is the nationalism that is spreading through the community. This kind of "us or them" mentality isn't healthy.

From the post I just replied to, I‚Äôd does seem like you want to find some like minded individuals. Hell, don‚Äôt we all? I‚Äôm just afraid you are over analyzing what/who this game was meant for.
---
Clothies gonna clothy. I was at the gurubashi arena yesterday as an 18 priest and traded a few times with a 15 rogue, because if he got the jump on me and got some backstabs in my health plummeted. No surprise that a druid with such a level advantage would easily eat a mage like that.
---
This is the same with any class. Priests, Shamans, Druids and Paladins don‚Äôt level in their healing spec but heal just fine.
---
Transmog, while fun in it's own right, completely ruined the sense of uniqueness. I'll take my guys mismatched random shit over a lie any day.

---
Reminds me of bandaging the green dragon boss in ICC a long time ago. All the mobs were dead and had a few seconds, why not? I got laughed at, but the healers weren't getting the job done. We got through. 
---
We had the worst healers in that guild. They were best friends and one was the guild leader. It sucked so bad.
---
Also known as the kids table.
---
Your reasoning would allow people to press need to vendor items

There are empty servers if u don't want to wait, don't. You are wanting the impossible no one can unpopular a server so you are your friends can play. Make an alt and if you have a queue and its longer than you want on a low population off alliance alt.

Yeah that's what I meant

I've enjoyed the time with my old buddies quite a lot, and we have 6 weeks of vacation in Denmark (plus flex-days when you work more than 37hours a week) so in reality they haven't really suffered any damages. If anything they are super hyped to try it out as well.
---
Tbh you just sound salty about not being able to play.
---
Ppl can do whatever they want imho. If they want to speed run let them do that.
---
The Charr would like to have a word with you
---
ok ill do that, thanks
---
Just use eyes of the beast and jump with the pet down yourself.
---
You are correct. I am abusing them. I'm going into ENTIRELY NEW INSTANCES to run content nobody else can kill. It's cheating, really.
---
I think blizzard already said their plan is to use layering only in the first phase, until server demand evens out
---
Call me a noob but what do you mean by ‚Äútools‚Äù and is it a solo farm or can you do it in a group
---
Reeve
---
It would be Keanu or George
---
Grandma's dead. Try again
---
Seems to be because tons of people are doing it.
---
I mustve had a shoddy version, redownloaded from their website - imported my profile -&gt; no issues. 
---
Thanks for the suggestion and confirming that it was indeed just mine that was broken. Thanks.
---
Wait, what do you mean by "orange quests"? Are quests ranked similarly to rarity of items?
---
But sending mail is so god damn expensive
---
I'm certain some people go horde because of this, but the problem is everyone, including kids, thinks this so it actually ends up being the opposite
---
&gt; The real question is, why weren't any other companies able to make a game that competes with WoW Classic by following its example?
---
I think there are a couple things going on here.
---
For one, while WoW was in its prime, maybe competing with it was just a poor idea. Why will I go play a less polished WoW clone in a less compelling universe when I can just... play WoW? The time to shine was really somewhere around Cata and beyond, when WoW started seriously degrading. But by the time that came around, the other games started adding LFG and such, too, missing the point.
---
For another, the games I've seen made some simple mistakes that made them not quite following the formula right. For example, Rift decided to come out with fairly ridiculous system requirements, and frankly didn't look that great on a lot of settings and was very drab in places. But WoW was successful because it was accessible and everyone could go play it, making the game only run on top PCs is a good way to limit your playerbase.
---
Some later installments focused on the wrong thing and/or got lazy. For instance, Wildstar, the so called Vanilla WoW but not actually Vanilla. Questing was limited and fairly streamlined (no cross-zone quests, no class quests). Action combat is not actually conducive to this kind of MMO - hard to talk when you have to spam 1 all the time. Too focused on raiding and not at all on the world/leveling/socialization.
---
At the current rate I'll be one of the first level 60 druids on my server, and that's without the AOE dungeon grind cancer.  I'm satisfied with that.
---
Rip bro
---
*Laughs in defias mask*
---
So what is barrens chat like now a days?
---
WC3 is the shit
---
Well if those people start the game because their favourite "E-celebrity" as you put it, and then hear about this stuff, it definitely won't help them get into the game.
---
Yes, the closest thing I can describe the behaviour is to call it nationalism. But go ahead and call me a troll if that helps.
---
He never said jobs was a failure
---
Maybe by doing so he will have changed the course of events, and created an alternate timeline where wows Xpacs don‚Äôt happen
---
Also known as Trump chat 2019 lol
---
The title is something you are not reading?
---
Personally I'm in a guild lvl20, put some good work in supporting the guild, and the best part is i have a name reserved!
---
Apperantly you are here to mitigate negative feedback and blizzard is putting more effort in doing just that, mitigating negative feedback, rather dealing with the issue.
---
Your comment is disturbing, I'm paying this and i have to solve the issue?
---
You are a joke!
---
Most people are leveling really slow. I just got into thousand needles and barely anyone is here. I'm not even near the highest level on my server.
---
Which vault did you crawl out of? :D
---
Why are you killing lv 14-16 mobs as a lv 12.
---
Heres your help; step it down a notch and take on mobs your own level.
---
Its called common sense
---
This was a thing in Vanilla.
---
Hopefully
---
I'm convinced that the major reason Horde is accepting of the Forsaken because they're already nose blind to the rotting corpse stench due to their own horrible body odor.
---
Only with a parent or legal  guardian
---
But r/wow keeps telling me that this is all nostalgia and we're going to get over it within a week!
---
Idk, I think the visual progression supplements power progression to make you feel like your character is actually getting stronger.
---
Why you playing on NA fella? You lost or something?
---
28
---
This guy TOTALLY doesn‚Äôt use anything to stay logged in.
---
It‚Äôs been a treat how people have been with each other so far, everyone has been nice and helpful.
---
No, I'll take a look at that guide! I don't even have a wand... I have no idea what I'm doing and I'm sure that's a terrible way to try and get into a complicated game like this.
---
Just run thru ashenvale from astranaar.keep heading east till azshara.
---
Yea like the addon ui, do you have to customize it a crap ton? Want that ui, dont want a buttload of work to get it like that.
---
That empty tabard tho... :S
---
Do not listen to this person lol. Put your dots on them and wand, thats all u gotta do
---
Nobody above the age of the 12 year old Fortnite crowd  is selecting games based on what some streamer tells them.  And if you‚Äôre not legitimately trying to troll you might want to look up what nationalism actually means and why using it in today‚Äôs political climate coneys a very specific meaning even if you don‚Äôt try to.
---
Who dropped your pants?
---
You should check out the warrior discord https://discord.gg/RbCZJtw
---
It is full of useful information and some great guides. Just don't tell them you're a dwarf haha.
---
If they release TBC in 2 years, and Wrath is 4 years, classic probably wouldn‚Äôt be popular enough for them to keep servers open
---
There‚Äôs a classic download on their website! It‚Äôs beautiful.
---
Once again, I agree. See you have found someone like minded. It isn‚Äôt healthy but we should not call it the FF11/14 effect we should call it one of humanities greatest downfalls. It‚Äôs everywhere man, politics, sexism, racism.. literally everything. Fuck man it‚Äôs why Hitler wanted to ‚Äòcleanse‚Äô the world, right? 
---
At the end of the day, we are getting better as time goes on. Don‚Äôt let fake news say otherwise to further divide us.
---
whats layering
---
ELVui
---
What do you mean by it sounds like retail swill?  I don't know anyone in retail optimising  their pre raid gear
---
Was this on Incendius? I flew through Barrens last night on my way to Org and all I saw was BZZZZing in chat. Wanted to know the context so badly!
---
Grey
---
Green
---
Orange
---
Red
---
In order of the level of the quest relative to you. Red is like plus 3i think.
---
They are ranked by difficulty if I am not mistaken. Greens are easy for example. Orange are much harder
---
u/dynatroon thats a fucking yikes from me dawg 
---
How has this not been taken down lol
---
When your friends would make you wait in queue alone at a LAN party rather than reroll on a server without a queue so that you can play together.
---
Was in a queue for 220 minutes the other day 7968 infront of me...
---
The media is shutting down the fact the realm u want to personally play is full? Call Alex Jones.
---
****
---
So I have a question. I‚Äôm playing on a laptop with a ball mouse, low internet, and not a lot of time, what‚Äôs the easiest rotations/something I don‚Äôt have to think about to hard in classic, class wise.
---
Fuck yeah. WC3 was my drug for so long hahaha
---
The build is viable for both but the talents for Blizzard slowing the mobs is a tool, cone of cold slow is a tool, frost nova, mana shield, frost barrier, ice block. All of these are used when aoe farming. So around level 26 you can start solo aoe farming! Best of luck.
---
Critical strike
---
If you create a system that fosters this type of stuff then the toxic people will show over the good people.
---
Think so yeah... But do you have like full data for all the zones, or do you fill up your map whenever you gather something?
---
It's not a "buzzword", it's an accurate descriptor of the shitty parts of the gaming community. You're displaying hints of it right here with your garbage downplaying.
---
So what does layering mean for leveling up fast like that comment was saying? Never played WoW and I‚Äôm kinda interested in starting classic
---
I don't... I get up and press the key physically... Is that against the rules?
---
Public transportation beats flying every time, honestly. They removed ships and zeppelins in favor of portals in BfA and it just... *isn't* the same. Don't get me wrong, I like being able to get from point A to point B much faster, but I also liked riding a ship to Darnassus sometimes and running across other people doing the same.
---
What's the point of an immersive world if you're just going to cut corners everywhere? Let mages have their fast travel portals and put people back into a single hearthstone. It's just one of many ways WoW could get back a little bit of that magic.
---
And maybe get rid of the absurd rep grinds, but let's face it, that's one ship Blizzard is going to ride until the MMO dies.
---
They‚Äôre hoping enough players will be sick of the game (unlikely) OR that people will transfer their whole guild to a new server (unlikely).
---
Basically what I‚Äôm getting at is: learn to enjoy the ques.
---
:/
---
it was the only option, it's not a choice anymore. im not paying to solve blizzards problems.
---
stop mitigating negative feedback!
---
Blizzard totally shouldn't have solved this a better way
---
lol I just rewatched this ep last night. God bless the blizzard cash grab
---
And weeks before that and before that. It‚Äôs not going away until layering goes away.
---
That wasn‚Äôt very nice :/
---
All realms are max population at all times?
---
Developers themselves call it like this. If you check the installation directory, you would find at least three folders - classic, ptr and retail.
---
I switch to BM with frenzy and then after bestial wrath at 40 I go for the rest in marksman I suppose it‚Äôs playstyle but as someone who plays hunter for pvp (because pve as hunter is awful) it‚Äôs the only way to go yeah I live for the 2-3v1s man but I‚Äôm odd like when I play lock I level as SM/Ruin putting 30 into affliction for instant longer range dots CoE and siphon and of course instant Sboltz and improved drains and then 21 in destro and I know most lock go demo but you scrifice so much of your own ability buffing your pet
---
Oh really dicksmack?  Can you not sense the sarcasm or should i shove a /s up your arse?
---
Hey, I'm thinking about playing a rogue for the stealth but wondering how it plays in solo world content
---
I logged at 5pm on my server, still 70 min to wait
---
No, nor is chat.
---
There‚Äôs a bank in Ratchet that is quite familiar with me. And when I hit 16 I skinned some medium leather so I took the time in Org while training skills to clean up the bank and level Leatherworking.
---
Fury warriors are insanely powerful and sought-after end-game. You *may* need to tank occasionally along the way, as you‚Äôre finding right now, but you‚Äôll eventually be accepted into groups by virtue of your DPs. 
---
Between mage and hunter, it really depends which of the two things you prefer more: DPS or easy leveling. Mages invariably do more damage, especially end-game, but the leveling experience can be a bit tedious without a dedicated healer. As for hunter, they level ridiculously easily after getting a pet, but their damage is in a lower tier than mage/fury warrior. 
---
In the end, I‚Äôd either recommend sticking with your warrior and just accepting the tank burden from time to time. Otherwise, I‚Äôd roll a hunter. Hunters are one of the easiest classes to play well, but easily the most difficult class to master. There is a super high skill cap for them, and when you group/raid with a talented hunter, it‚Äôs pretty nuts to see.
---
Blizz has already added more server capacity by utilizing additional layers. None of the servers started running maxed out on cap.
---
While at work?....
---
You took it to a whole new level of addiction with playing Wow and driving. 
---
Kids and adults - DO NOT WOW AND DRIVE !!!
---
Haha - I had a hunter/druid combo questing in my area for a npc kill I was looking for. I asked them to group and the hunter joined me, asked me to share quest, I did and then he left and shared the quest with his buddy. I left before the npc could spawn because that would of sent me over board
---
Every dungeon ever, past present and future...
---
Holy shit that's good üëçüëå
---
‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt be done‚Äù
---
‚ÄúNobody wants to play old WoW‚Äù
---
Soooo, basically devs should stfu and just make what fans actually want.
---
Stop calling people who support this stuff a vocal minority, the naysayers look like enormous fucking idiots now, at Blizzard and on Internet forums.
---
Damn that's genius and spot on sadly
---
Thanks so much this was a ton of help!! What level do you think is the minimum I could make that journal to his starting area? And I‚Äôm guessing I‚Äôm going to need some silver to use the boat
---
I might reroll to a rogue for that very reason. Ret is utter trash in a raid
---
This is the best
---
I get that servers should have been larger, but staying logged in and congesting the server is perpetuating the problem.
---
You definitely didn‚Äôt player vanilla. Hunter was pretty mid-tier, comfortably above bottom tier because of how they could hard-counter rogues as well as beat mages that weren‚Äôt able to get inside their dead zone.
---
Yea, pickpocket only requires to be stealthed. It's a really good way to make money, tank pulls and you pickpocket  every mob. 22 copper doesn't seem like much, but over the course of 100 times per instance and 50 instance on your path to 40, it pays for your mount on its own.
---
I mean that's a book about how order breaks down when all authority is gone.
---
But ignoring the fact that they're children, order wasn't established overnight. Humans created it because it was better than the chaos. Made life easier.
---
Given enough time, assuming they didn't all murder each other before they grew up, the kids would have created a better social structure.
---
Also... you know... it's fictional.
---
I have never played this game and am middle aged. But I‚Äôve always been curious. Is it worth starting or do you think I will find it too complicated?
---
Haha this time I rolled Ally instead of horde so I'm going to miss that lovley chat hub.
---
Oh got it. So if you get an orange quests at like, level 10, but level to 20, itll probably turn green or something
---
No you didnt
---
Is there an Anonymous class for that?
---
A bloated game that failed at launch and failed to pick up steam? What? It's one of the most popular MMOs out there, and just recently had a HUGE influx of players with the last expansion. It has a huge playerbase and the latest expansion if highly praised in nearly every outlet. Just because you personally doesn't like it doesn't mean it's doing bad or has "failed to pick up steam".
---
If you're gonna make an argument, don't just make shit up.
---
im not about to run statistics. the sites like wowhead have cache cleared for no reason, but there is an apperant footprint that says that most realms had queues.
---
it looks like you are here to mitigate negative feedback. are you here to do just that?
---
A Raid grp typically consists of at least 4 pallys but at max. 2 druids. This applies a lot to semi hardcore + guilds. If you are playing casual you should have no problems to get a raid spot when you're a mature and reliant player.
---
Progress could end in AQ40 if the guild is very casual.
---
A gif that's not very giffy...
---
Wow. Someone here has a lot of sodium, Horde.
---
I wish I had a notebook to play.
---
Druid first is better regardless: easier leveling thanks to no downtime and paladins with gear are less boring to level!
---
It helps server population and reduces the potential for abuse.  Why is it bad?
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfAS7ONO8OU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfAS7ONO8OU)
---
How so? I haven‚Äôt played in forever.
---
It‚Äôs for sure a buzzword, all it means is ‚Äúthing I don‚Äôt like.‚Äù 
---
Griefing is an essential part of video games, not sure when it became OK to be a massive carebear boomer, but it‚Äôs super toxic.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs only been posted 134 before very cool
---
I was thinking earlier today - what if it's not a local hype? What if the whole world will run down the Warcraft's addiction hole again? Imagine all of it starting all over again.
---
I saw somewhere that fishing in stv is in later phases, dunno if it's 2-4.
---
There is a grace period
---
Are you saying it's a conspiracy?
---
Must be an addon, mousing over doesn‚Äôt show for me
---
Not at all a viable comparison though to the old days when you're just being fed party invites to get in different layers with fresh mobs.  Still cool.
---
Understanding this doesn't help me not get fucked out of playing all night because I need to go cut my dad's grass rq
---
I leveled up with that guy! Since day one in Durotar
---
Yes, dad.
---
Charizard, obviously.
---
The big thing is use a 2h weapon, and when L40 be arms for mortal strike.
---
A layer isnt zone based, its the entire continent
---
You stupid.
---
Maybe adress my real points instead of focusing on peanuts, fuckwit. Why so tunnel-visioned on *technically* shit? Like what the fuck are you trying to prove here.
---
"Ooooooo k-" AAHHHHH OUHHHHH
---
im saying you have something against negative feedback. you are putting a lot of effort in it.
---
ps. are you conspiring that im conspiring?
---
answer: im having problems with the product i pay for and you are putting a lot of work in trying to pushing me in to solving blizzards issues.
---
there is an apperant negative feedback and there is no media coverage.
---
Fluffer*
---
*Gives us classic after 10 years of saying we're wrong*
---
*Gives too few servers*
---
Please blizz lemme suck yo cock
---
I‚Äôve met some great assholes already, mostly people who don‚Äôt know class took kits at low level ‚Äújust Rez me‚Äù
---
it's standing in the fire, bruv
---
Amen bro
---
Did you see the price of gold? Lmao
---
Jokerd got world first yesterday using mage AoE farming thus proving aoe leveling is the quickest method in game. Your welcome
---
BOBBY B WATCH OUT
---
We had 1 pve and 1 pvp. Sorry if i want to play pvp. Dumb comment.
---
All our servers have queue, not everyone is american / english, scoop.
---
It will only matter if you are Ahead of the curve in a few weeks every layer for contested zones will be full. Layers is important because there are 5x as many players using up 5x and many resources
---
Micro transactions and greed
---
So, what you just said is wrong. If it was true, every game/movie/book/food critic would be out of a job. People very much listen to what others, who are, let's say, more knowledgeable about certain topics/fields, tell them. Just because you don't do that doesn't mean many other people do. Besides that, I wasn't talking about creators etc telling people to go or not go play this or that. I was speaking broadly on the terms that a person might watch a youtuber or a streamer play a game, think "that looks interesting, I wanna try that game" and picking said game up.
---
If he wasn't a warrior, then maybe equipping it would be the right idea. I know if I found it as a caster I would use it just to say I have it, but it'd be a huge waste for a melee class to do that.
---
Don‚Äôt reveal the secrets. Then everyone will do it and the queues will be just as bad.
---
Yeah I'm using a 2h axe right now. I'm trying to stay up to date on my weapon
---
Exactly
---
This is why every toon I've rolled so far is a Night Elf. Sure, Auberdine sucks but it's better than spawn camping in Westfall or the Barrens.
---
&gt;Fuck you ~~Blizzard~~ Activision
---
Activision acquired one of the single best game companies in history and drained every ounce of soul out of it.
---
So people are just assuming that is what that meant. I've seen people say this a lot but blizzard increased the total amount of people allowed in the server, they didn't increase layers. That's not how layers work as per blizzards explanation.
---
You gather data as you find stuff
---
I work and get home when there is no Q but I can‚Äôt play until a few hours after I get home. If I started the game when I can play I‚Äôd never get to. So we do what we have to, and if I have to jump every 5 min to stay on until I can play that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm going to do. It‚Äôs the way the system works right now.
---
True, raids did start to be come irrelevant because they started to figure out how to actually itemize gear in AQ40/Naxx, and I'm not really sure how to fix that.
---
It's the opposite for me. I will miss Ashenvale and Westfall leveling dearly. But I am already hooked up to the Barrens chat.
---
These are great. If your planning on making the next one's up to 300 that will be sweet!
---
I wouldn't. You are already half way there and it's kinda to late to pickup skinning because you're probably levelv20+ same goes for any gathering profession unless you plan on going back and farming nodes and low levels beasts. Just stick with tailoring and enchanting.
---
Don't you EVER buy all spells!
---
You should be leveling in Frost, you only need intellect, food n drink, arcane explosion, fire blast, fireball, fire AOE, frostbolt, blizzard, nova, mana gem, mana barrier, evocation, blink one of cold....
---
Ignore all ampliffy/reduce magic, vrappy elemental Shields, arcane misiles, scorch, etc
---
Those are very rarely mutually exclusive
---
I meant how is Activision ruining Bluzzard.
---
Can I just install it with the main Tukui client? Or manually install via download?
---
It's random, usually anywhere from 1-10 kills or so
---
what do you mean ‚Äústanding in the fire‚Äù? i‚Äôm new
---
Definitely worth it. The game will teach you what you need to know early on, and there‚Äôs plenty of guides online if you have more questions.
---
https://youtu.be/XnRWz6g3zOY
---
Oh shyt he comin' boi-o's
---
Also your a shit friend, go ride your high horse alone. They shouldn‚Äôt be your friend imo.
---
Oh yikes ok thanks :))
---
Hunters are above shadow priest. You may get lucky and be the token shadow priest of a raid guild.
---
LOL
---
&gt; Which abilities are low priority, which ones do I continue to upgrade as I level.
---
If you don't know when you would use an ability, you wont use it when you should use it, and as such you can safely skip it.
---
I could tell you right now you should train Intimidating Shout, but if you don't know when you would use it you wont use it when you need it, it will just sit idle on your action bar forever.
---
&gt; When do people start using macros?
---
level 1, something as simple as
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /cast Heroic Strike
---
    /startattack
---
should be replacing your regular  heroic strike key from level 1.
---
You can do 2.
---
You can do all the secondary ones though too, first aid, cooking, and fishing.
---

I feel like the deeprun tram is where these conversations always happen.
---
This is Bloodsail, the only RPPvE US realm.
---
Thanks mate üòäüòä
---
You need to do the ashenvale hunt quest in splinter tree post (twice) before they can drop
---
Yeah with a priest I feel like a beast
---
The best response is it was glitchy back the. Most of the time they would evade. But not always.
---
I read this as went outside for a quick grass smoking break.
---
Ours is 4 minutes from moon to darnassus but then we have to fly to dark shore which is probably another minute
---
Yikes. Yeah the minute they start with 4 people I would leave, good luck doing it with 3 people then!
---
Yeah I installed it a while ago, I've looked for it everywhere and I cant find it
---
Sometimes you have to wait a few hours. Happened to me the first time I subbed to WoW a few years back.
---
Gold selling spambots are like the bedbugs of mmos once they get in it's incredibly difficult to get rid of them.
---
A lot of career jobs give you hundreds of hours of vacation time per year. You request it off with enough advance and it gets approved.
---
there is a 30 minute limit in the queue I believe. you get kicked.
---
Hold on I'll make a few calls and get CNN on this.
---
Looks like you‚Äôre downloading the wrong thing too.  On the bottom above the ‚Äúplay‚Äù button there‚Äôs a little menu you can chance to WoW Classic.  The download was only like 5gb I believe.  The 62 gbs is for retail.
---
You sound like a guy complaining that chess doesn‚Äôt have enough role play elements.
---
It‚Äôs an MMO, not diablo single player.
---
Thanks for shating!
---
You have to dc for pretty long though. You get like a 5 or more minute grace period.
---
I‚Äôve noticed the same. I think a lot of people are using AH Addons or are simply just undercutting each other without double checking the vendor price. I was listing some mats last night (on Ateish) and tigeresye that vendors for 2s had literally dozens of listings for under 50c. People are stupid. 
---
I‚Äôve had to buy two bank slots just to keep stuff for when the market eventually levels out, it‚Äôs such a mess right now.  Also why at level 22 I have almost 10g with full training and all my friends have barely 1g.
---
This is a huge plus for me right now on a pvp server. I can use boats and quests in contested zones without much worry.
---
Guidelime

Could you please elaborate a little more on the sex part? Thank you.
---
The only thing I can see is the orc on the left transcending into the fight with style.
---
The cat... in the picture... is literally standing in a fire.
---
I really love how the game reserves your spot for some time when you dc. I dced the queue after 3 hours. But it set me right at my place again when I logged back 3 minutes later.
---
Ps. At least you guys dont have all these afkers blocking access. I'm at number 1800 and need to wait another 50 minutes. It was at 180 minutes at number 5300. 83 minutes for place number 8500 is like a dream.
---
EU has 120000 people in queue. More work is being put in to mitigating negative feedback than solving the problem.
---
Good call
---
That was really interesting! Thanks for sending it my way.
---
Dude, you‚Äôre internet famous now. What will you do with your fame?
---
Lol this is great, even the pet's ownership is in line with the idea. Perfection!
---
yes
---
Firemaw has queues from around 11am to around 4/5am...that's more than the prime time "only". New servers might help with queues but I doubt that all the lvl20+ people will leave for them so that's a moot point. And yes, layering DOES help with queue times.
---
Streamers, with very few exceptions, are not critics and they‚Äôre not ‚Äúmore knowledgeable‚Äù they‚Äôre people bandwagoning to make a buck.
---
I read "then sucked". Then reality hit me hard.
---
I'm tempted to make a character on one of the pvp servers just to experience stuff like this.
---
Edit: Also, I've seen people talk about making alternate characters to give stuff to their main. Do you have to do that on the same server, or can it be on any server and you just mail stuff to your main?
---
Yeah, right after Half-Life 3 and the StarCraft MMO... ü§£
---
I know that, I was just asking about Activision ruining WoW.

Try to reinstall the launchet. Also, sometimes it gets up to 48 for the sub purchase to proceed.

Never played a warrior, what is he doin when he is attacking the boar?

Arms is fine. Sword and board. Defensive abilities. Good to go... lol really that simple.

So what song are you playing in STV? Fortune Son? Paint it black? War by edwin starr

You're probably right...

Lol thats a nice one

You can have any cosmetic pet in the game. For example. You can buy snakes in orgrimmar and cats in stormwind/goldshire

No only spamming /4 10 raidgroup (spell)cleave farm SM ... shame

I didn't get growl on my first tame unfortunately. So maybe it was just a bug?

yea, it is, and having proof of it is just brazen.

the problem isn't the individuals as much as an entire portion of the community being onboard and willing to make a coordinated effort to circumvent the intended normal playstyle

I said in another comment, it's fame to play; similar to pay to play yet requiring fame (twitch) in order to achieve one's goals.

edit like taking creative measures to stay active other than using other people is okay. but if someone else does it for you and there's evidence, then yes that's a TOS violation

Yeh well. I think its kinda dumb to ask people why you‚Äôre dying, if you‚Äôre killing mobs up to 4 levels higher than you.

Layering isn't sharding, although it has similarities. Layering is continent wide and has thousands of people on each layer. A new one is automatically created whenever the previous layer fills up. Currently, layering is only exploitable by players who are *way* ahead of the level curve. If they have an entire zone to themselves, they can switch between layers and never have to wait on respawns.

I think I remember it at about 150-200g in 2006.

Haha! It was! I was leveling on Incendius in barrens. Bunch of people talking about politics and yelling profanitys so we all just "Bzz" at them and filled up the chat. They shortly stopped after.

Hit level 20 last night with my two closest mates, and cleared the deadMines multiple times with 3 randoms beside us. Forming parties is so easy too! Plenty of players willing to help you grind.

 Yoooooooo. I haven't had time to try but wall jumping still works? Legitimately one of my favorite things to do. Where did you start your route?

Blizzard had been getting greedier and greedier and people can‚Äôt handle that the company they used to love has changed so they blame Activision when really they are very autonomous from each other

You're welcome! The boat is actually free! I did it at 10 and only died 4 or 5 times along the way. A tip I read in an article is to take off your gear before you start (LOL naked night elf coming through!) so that you don't have to spend any money repairing the gear. It's inevitable that you WILL die because there are high level mobs in wetlands that walk all over the road and one-shot you (darn crocolisks). 
---
You'll take the boat from Auberdine (go down the long pier and take the boat on the left that goes to Menethil Harbour). If it's not there, don't worry! It takes like 5 mins I think to return. Then you'll get off in Menethil, don't forget to grab the flight path, and hit the road. You'll want to take the road that goes East and then South so that you can enter the Dun Algaz mountain path and cross over into Loch Modan. Here I made the journey south to grab the flight path then doubled back up, but that's up to you. You'll go west into Dun Morogh and follow the path to the middle area of the map and north into Ironforge (you can't miss it, big fortress on the mountain. I loooooove how it looks from outside!). You'll be able to find your dwarf friend by then as he's probably either in Dun Morogh or Loch Modan. :) You can take the deeprun tram from Ironforge to Stormwind if you want as well, it's located in the TinkerTown district. 
---
If Dwarf wants to go to YOU, just reverse the above instructions. :)
---
Let me know if you have any questions! I'm finally playing wow again after an 8 year long break and am super excited. :D
---
It‚Äôs good, but not as useful as you‚Äôd think, sort of. 
---
You can skip through most areas to only get the specific mobs you‚Äôre after. However this generally isn‚Äôt recommended as you‚Äôll end up underlevelled. 
---
You can, in theory, pick any fight you want in PvP, however if someone else gets the drop on you, you‚Äôre worse off than almost any other class. 
---
Base rank stealth reduces movement speed by 50%, meaning it‚Äôs **painfully** slow to get anywhere, even just to garrotte that mob 20ft in front of you, before it changes path and detects you before you can get behind it

doesn't seem viable that eg an elemental shaman has to state 'i will be rolling on all cloth and leather caster dps gear' on every single dungeon/raid he's doing. like i said, is it not generally accepted etiquette?

Ok ok, leveled rallies in vanilla, and TBC. Spec prot, seal and judge light/wisdom. Shield spikes, conc, holy shield, watch as 10+ mobs kill themselves. Pallies best tool is JoW, this is the ticket to making raids a cake walk. Sure sure blessings, but you as a pally provide stupid amounts of mana and trickle healing (JoL).
---
That said I am going druid this time because bear is life.
---
I have no Play button I'm afraid, that's my issue. I edited and added a picture so you can see my interface.

You just have to keep hitting it with something. Hunters are great at kiting mobs because they can alternate Concussive Shot and Scorpid Sting for no damage, but it keeps the aggro.
---
???? No ????

Probably is in Barrens
---
Thank you! Yeah I think its got buried with the hype, I've not have time to improve it before launch but glad you like it :). When I get stuck in the next queue I'll fix some small things I noticed whilst levelling and submit again!
---
Blizzard is indeed locked, however... Capital i uses the same ~~character~~ visual as L ;)
---
Over the last 9 years the game has been less about what's fun and more about keeping you addicted with soulless mandatory daily grinds. For example at the moment you're expected to level up a necklace which controls your overall power and unlocks attributes on other pieces of gear. If you don't want to fall behind you're forced to do a bunch of daily world quests and weekly do a bunch of island encounters. Nobody enjoys doing these things but you have to if you want to keep up. It's absolutely miserable. Activision sees that mobile games make more money if they can make you feel like you have to play it every single day, so they're building those elements into WoW to try to make more money, with no consideration for whether anyone will find it fun.
---
There are other problems too but that's what bugged me the most and made me quit earlier this year.
---
Durotar and the Barrens are just aesthetically boring. Long walks everywhere and very little change of scenery. 
---
I think that's why I'm having a hard time leveling horde, especially since I mained ally in vanilla.
---
Much people are followed by much people. The realms are exact the same, but pvp makes more fun in a high populated world and when the hypetrain is gone, I expect that around 30% of the players will be gone, so the realms with low population will get less attractive for players like gankers etc
---

Or you can follow the meta and just grind SM from 30-40, which is so stupid btw
---
And none of them are topping the leveling charts lol

So you get comment notification - ironforge trains guns, darnassus bows and SW xbows.

We were fighting the elite ogres and the party had the quest for Choksul but you had to be 17 to get it and I was 16, but as we were at where he spawns the party leader asked me how close I was to 17 and I was right at the edge of leveling so we killed another mob, I leveled up, got the quest, and we got back in plenty of time for the respawn.
---
Vanilla isn't the same as classic and we should have known it never truly would be. Times have changed drastically since then and general access to information has increased when it comes to games. In some ways it sucks but you will always find people that agree with you to run 5 mans with. Just how it is man at least we have classic.
---
Do you vendor everything or AH?
---
JUMPIN'N'SHOOTIN!
---
They are not, they are still exposing the game to others tho, so people can make their own decision based on what they see and decide, without the streamer saying a single word whether they should buy it or not.
---
I remember that . They hit 60 and I hit 50 . The race was real .
---
Hey, everyone is allowed to ruin their own experience hovewer they want
---
Just smugly assert your superiority
---
Happened to me yesterday after activating my account.  Took about 6 hours for it to register me as a normal account, and I could whisper/invite, etc.
---
They are just missing out on some of the best aspects of the game. A lot of those players hyped Classic for so long only to skip over most of the content. Makes you wonder if they even enjoy the game.
---
I stop after the first rank of Cleave and Overpower. Rend stops at about rank 3. Things that just add damage can be skipped at need, but Heroic Strike really ought to be kept up to date.
---
Facts, tried selling some level 5 green item for like 1 silver in chat and was offered 5 copper then some guy said 4 copper and a hug lmao it just continued after that
---
dude this is no way affects your gameplay.
---
stop complaining about everything
---
Then I shall offer you the best honor my modest means can
---
\*Press Follow\*
---
Lol you dont even know exactly when he hit 60, how you gonna talk him up so much but forget the most important detail?
---
People literally just have to wait a damn second before starting to attack. You can auto attack for a second but don't start bursting until you see a stack or two of Sunder Armor. Don't force the tank to waste taunt because you can't control your fingers for a second.
---
I was speed ran through to 70 in bc by my friends so I never really explored. I'm taking full advantage now :)
---
Rogues are definitely formidable, and I'd argue OP in PvE, but they weren't impossible to beat for any class. 
---
Assuming equal skill and gear - let's say two Warlords/Grand Marshals - a rogue would have a hell of a time against a warlock, paladin, warrior, or hunter. 
---
But, if the rogue had better gear, or just a more skilled player, then yes - I agree with you - they would roll over just about any class in most occasions.
---
I don't think that works tho
---
You're absolutely right. It's one of my favorites.
---
Lvl 26. Not including a few dungeon run fiascos they were of course the hunters fault, I‚Äôd say died 20 times give or take 1-2
---
Yeah exactly!
---
Not to mention there being no honor in pvo
---
There seems to be one if you alt f4 or quit but not if you get dc'd, which sucks.
---
Interesting. TIL
---
I was leveling up tailoring yesterday by offering free bags for anybody that could provide me with the mats. In the 20 minutes I was doing it, I probably switched layers a good 10 or 15 times and all I was doing was sitting in SW trading bags for 9 wool.
---
I would respectfully disagree here. Mortal strike is simply too good of an ability to have as soon as it comes online. It scales with weapon dmg where as blood thirst scales off attack power which you'll likely have very little of at 40. Although I do agree in some sense, I'd say go arms straight at 40 then next 5 points go back to fury to get that crit back by 45.
---
Axe spec is great combo. 10% crit when combined with fury and by this point you'll most likely have a ww axe or a ravenger from sm so you can get full use out of the axe talents. 
---
Just my opinion for what its worth but ty for commenting!

Invest in bags, vender everything, get skinning and skin everything and vender the leather
---
Most people who are passionate about classic are those that played during vanilla and that are looking for the exact same experience as they had when they were younger. They aren't looking for a perfect game but rather to re-live something for the second time.
---
As someone without the nostalgia there are several improvements you can make to the game, but it's not what these people want. Hence when you propose changes/improvements, even though they may objectively be good changes, it makes it a different game from what these people know and want, hence why there's often backlash.
---
lol I got invited to heal some elite quest I had already done, said no, and the dude said  "fuck you piece of shit."
---
stay mad
---
This is sad. I would have loved some ice cold milk when I was leveling.
---
I've was doing a kill count quest, and invited a warrior to my group which he declined and kept soloing. We proceeded to finish the quest before him due to killing mobs he could have gotten. 
---
Some people really just don't want help.
---
Oh man this is great

Lol. Speed runs

I rolled an orc female. I look pretty stupid right now during early levels, but this is what is keeping me going.

---
I chose female orc because they don't look chunky on the warlock mount.
---
That is group play though, warriors excel in group play. We are talking about solo questing

Neither was anybody doing 5 man's, the first person do ding 60 was farming mobs and exploiting layering.

Why is it so easy to level hunter?

still living with ur mom? loser

Reason it's not working is because of the table actually, there's a plate so he can't put his legs under the table which means he has to lean in to actually reach the mouse and keyboard.

The chair is good for posture, but sitting too far from the table is really bad for posture.

There are already enough realms. EU has at least 6 realms with no waiting times. Problem is, they are basically dead outside the peak. When 3am there are only 15-20 people in the barrens at this time, then you know the server is dead.
---
I opted with the solution "be the tank" largely for this reason. It is hard to get people to be aware of their healer otherwise.
---
I tried climbing to IF airport in the beta but didn't have any luck, is it different now or am I just rusty?

This man is doing the good folks of Razorgore a disservice

Ahhhhh aaarghh
---
Good job, mall cop. Life of the party you are not.
---
I‚Äôm in USservers and I‚Äôm in que. check your facts lol
---
Yeah, I did see a lot of UD in Durotar. I personally love the style of zones in EK.
---
As a healer I feel communication on both ends is required. 
---
While there isn't anything specific I say to my tanks I always make sure to tell them when I need mana and ask them to mark targets so our dps isn't all over the place.
---
If the tank/leader doesn't care to or feel like marking I always offer to do it.
---
You would think people would naturally target down the tank's target, but that unfortunately isn't always true so marking, even at low levels can be very helpful.
---
I only have 4GB ram and even that is all sorts of clunky on this old-ass macbook :(
---
I also got the model that doesn't allow for RAM upgrades.
---
Bro early wrath DKs were so fucking OP. I remember being decked out in the same pvp gear he had in the video just crushing people.
---
Had no idea tbh but the long queues are a real issue. I'm french and before launch we only had 1 pvp server, they added another one 25 min before launch which is useless cause all the guilds and people won't change their plan, now my server is saturated 6000 in queue rn and the other 2 are high, would love to transfere for free but it is not possible and i don't want to lose my progress (lvl 35 atm) so yeah if i happen to dc for whatever reason i'm fucked... how do you deal with that ?
---
Why??? It‚Äôs funny as hell!
---
You can‚Äôt capitalize a letter that‚Äôs not the first.
---
Its best at lv 40 when you have the mount to gather the mobs. Just take advantage of the lf mage sm hype and dungeon grind
---
Ayy what up Incendius
---
I won't start playing classic ever, but you gave me a flash back to the time when i farmed for my wariors first epic in zul farak. Wonder if it is in the game?
---
Not really...
---
Great screen :) 
---
Now match your equip with it :D
---
Just multi pull to make it fun. Send your pet on one mob and put up a serpant sting then pull another mob and just kite/melee weave. You spend more mana but it's fun and good practice for elites/pvp.
---
Thats what i did, now heading down shadow for silence. Im on a pvp server tho so maintaining my mana and also being able to fight back is what i value. Dont think i will respec at 40 either. Im saving so much not buying water.
---
Media coverage? Lol mate you need to get your perspective of life fixed, there are bigger issues not being shouted about than your World of Warcraft lineup. 
---
Shout outs to HONG KONG btw! I hope you are all sticking to your ideals! Give it your all and more!! PLUS-ULTRA!
---
All that stock I bought in office fans before the launch is really paying off right now
---
I know exactly what cave that is because in retail when i tried recently the mobs were busted as fuck, they reflected damage from melee but it isn‚Äôt scaled properly even though you‚Äôre scaled down so i needed like all cooldowns + potions etc to kill 1 as a warrior, everywhere else i could take 5-6 on at a time
---
It‚Äôs not even really faster, especially looking at how poorly these sleep deprived streamers do it. But they got it in their heads that aoeing dungeon mobs was fast xp, and then it didn‚Äôt actually work out, so they keep banging their heads against the wall by bringing 10 people to scarlet monastery.
---
This kind of thing happened early in vanilla as well. People used to wipe so many times in strat they‚Äôd bring 10 people to finish it.
---
Great for her. Branching out. Best way to get pubertal neckbeards to subscribe? Be a pornactress
---
Guilds in a Pacific server are doing to have, on average, later raids than guilds on Eastern servers. So if you often have to work late and don't mind late nights, then it can be a good idea.
---
If you're concerned about lag, don't worry, it's negligible.
---
Just did dead mines where a warlock waa constantly low on health and like to pull things
---
Where you live lol

Try learning it.
---
Brilliant!
---
I had the same issue in Darkshore with the quests to kill bears and prowlers so I ended up logging back in really late and did it then.
---
Fortunately I have time off now so can play in the week, a lot of people only have the evenings and weekends.
---
Either way it definitely makes me wonder what it would be like without layering given how bad it is with it.
---
Big ooof, c'mon...memes are fun but I think this is a bit far lol
---
I've not seen a raid group doing 5 mans once on Grob.
---
some pservers had 15k pop caps and ppl played there just fine, outside of performance issues server side, wich blizzard should be able to solve better than couple guys working afterwork hours with emulator from 2005.
---
I remember back in WotLK when I was farming ore on my pally and a DK came up and wrecked me since I wasn't really paying attention. Came back to revive and he was there waiting. I laughed as he tried to kill me again with my half mana/health and I killed him with a thousand light taps of my hammer. (He stood no chance vs holy spec.) Proceeded to camp him for a couple times before they either logged or took a graveyard rez.
---
Then there were the people who would try to take on my ele sham without using PvP gear while I was in PvE gear.  Pretty much an instant 1 shot. Berserk, flame shock, borderline instant cast lava burst that would crit followed by ele mastery into lightning bolt for an instant cast crit. Mainly tanks were the only ones able to stand up to that.
---
Made me lol
---
Are you by chance on Arugal OCE? I found quite a few of elitist that have ruined my experience. Still loving classic wow but a few bad apples can really left a bad taste
---
Started at launch, to the minute, and have had zero queues so far. Not a single lost moment of play.
---
Smug face.
---
Yeah it doesn‚Äôt lol
---
In a pet name you can, I am the guy from the post! That's how I named my pet :)
---
Is this on Incendius?
---
Nicely done
---
Has been surprisingly calm for me. In fact for me horde/alliance just fight side by side, not minding eachother and respecting eachothers area to kill mobs. On Shazzrah at least.
---
Pacific servers are located in LA, East in Chicago I believe, so pings could be higher depending on where you live. 
---
I get like 20-30ms on a pacific server and around 80ms on a EST, which in my opinion is a big difference.
---
on every server combined counted 30th Aug, 11PM. Berlin time.
---
Give it a few months

Hunters are a weird class in Classic. They will rarely top the charts, even end-game with best in slot (BiS) gear - but they bring *so much* utility to the group. There are lots of encounters where their kiting is necessary. They make all of the pulls for raids. Their pets can be formidable OTs on encounters. They have great debuffs. But the raw DPS isn't there.
---
With all that said, I have nothing but respect for hunters - especially really good hunters. They easily have the highest skillcap in Classic, with the difference between a good hunter and a great hunter being massive.
---
You can get a chicken in westfall, I forget which farm (it's one of the three in the north portion of the map) it is but the guy outside the house sells special chicken feed. Go up to one of the chickens, target it and do /chicken 100 times. Make a macro and spam it unless you're masochistic. When the chicken goes from neutral to friendly you'll get a quest to give it the feed the guy sells. The reward is the prairie chicken pet. You'll know you're at the right spot if you see other people doing /chicken.
---
You can have all the pets you want, but they will take up a bag slot each.
---
Vanilla wow is not classic wow the troll got maybee the vanilla worlf first but the bold gnome got the classic
---
I dont understand what I'm looking at
---
blizzard should have locket the servers not expand them !!!
---
And then in 3.3. people started running Icecrown dungeons again as farms and whatnot, and that was that last spark of community in WoW.
---
gotta remember a lot of the most enthusiastic classic wow players haven't even touched the live game in at least 10 years, they don't really know anything.
---
You're the one who doesn't get that it's an MMO. Other people exist, and you should take steps to behave like a decent human being instead of a 14-year-old shithead who takes pleasure in upsetting others. 4chan culture can fuck off.

See how stupid that sounds?  Just because it's the only thing they do in raids, doesn't mean it's their only good spec.  If that was the case, 7/8 classes would have the description of "tHe OnLy GoOd SpEc Is" with whatever their primary damage ability is.
---
If you're not remoting in from your phone to avoid queues then imo that's your own fault. I have not had a queue since launch, Skeram usually has a +1500 person queue by noon too. If you try to log in after ~430 getting home from work you won't be playing until like 7-8pm some nights.
---
Abusing layering is annoying as fuck though I agree, even just for guildies/randomes asking for layer invites all of the time now.
---
On the contrary, scarlet monastery is about where they start being best. I play a priest and the best experience and speed I get is 3 melee and a shaman with WF totem. You can speed clear library so fast.
---
Path Available.
---
There‚Äôs more screen space these days. Hard to fill it all up.

Is enhancement shamans any good at anything or the bums of parties

Got there to do a few of nesingwary quests this morning. Luckily I only encountered two allies and both of them didn't have any interest in fighting either. Left by the time the clock hit 11 am.
---
I think my biggest complaint now is when playing with friends. We will be standing in the same place but in different layers. Only when we start inviting each other do we all get in the same instance. By default all friends or people in your friends list should be in the same instance.
---
i think u missed the point hahaha
---
What were some of the valid alternatives presented that would have made the game playable during primetime hours? Triple the number of servers?
---
Incorrect.
---
You‚Äôve gotta watch that afk timer. You can bring up a keyboard and do single key presses but you can‚Äôt do a long press. So it‚Äôs a little tricky to move your character. It can get kinda choppy.
---
The sword?
---
Some people just don't like healing.  It's a calling and not for all.  Those that do like it, love it generally.
---
dude you are mocking my negative feedback? im paying for this!!!
---
Would you require a picture of my nice and neatly cleaned bookshelf, along with the guide and everything else? Since, of course, you're one of those people.
---
Can go lvl one. Just HS to darnassus. Go to SW. Level to ten. Hearthstone. Get bear quest go to moonglade back to darn on flightpath.  do quest auberdine. Hand in darnassus.  Travel back SW. Set HS SW. Use teleport for moonglade Spell learning. Only way. Or just go SW and ignore bear form.

Hey look it's some moronic 12 year old or man baby.
---
The macro doesn't make any sense. Then again, what do you expect from macro spamming human trash.
---
Whirlwind weapons for warriors. Amazing mid level 30 weapons that serve you well into 50.
---
my experience in classic was much different than this, esp once you get to booty bay
---
Yes. Gotta keep them humble
---
I don‚Äôt know why anyone would pick Faerlina
---
He is talking about the lore not where people hang out the most
---
I don't get it...

---
Welcome to Silverpine Forest
---
As a warrior, this is too true
---
The layering means you have no idea how many people are actually on the high pop servers. If whitemane got delayered, it would be completely unplayable. In fact, most of the servers would be unplayable, because they would be at populations multiple times higher than was intended for vanilla.
---
The 3000 player cap was for gameplay reasons
---
I'm still undecided on whether the gear or AP catch up mechanics are worse.
---
The diminishing returns on AP terrible and you can just tag along when they trigger the catch up on AP and be 3 or 4 levels behind guildies that spend ages farming out their neck in the previous tier. When I switched mains when BFD released that's what happened and I ended up level with, if not ahead of some of the lazier guild members who had been playing since launch.
---
There are people selling and producing wants everywhere rn
---
They are actually so closeminded about anything not vanilla it's insane. Mop was the time where we had the best design of nearly every class. They were nowhere near homogenized and immensely fun to play. But I guess they would rather spam frostbolt over and over just so that they can have fireball on their bars that they never use lol.
---
Go arms while leveling. Last stand is a raid-tanking talent.
---
Next minute 400 people in Hillsbrad killing each other
---
As a rogue, I normally tell my healers to don‚Äôt worry about healing me unless I‚Äôm like 25% or under. I‚Äôd rather just eat a little before next pull than have them waste mana/time on me.
---
Don‚Äôt play on a streamer server
---
I had a queue once, but that was only on launch day and that was for about 40 minutes. haven't really had one since. God i love RP servers
---
I just have e or scroll up bound to pet attack and scroll down on pet follow. I keep it on passive unless I go afk
---
The realms with the most queues are the ones that blizzard released first and the oldest realms they added, people don't want to lose names and levels so they don't move.
---
 I bet he plays Undead.
---
PEG OR BE PEGGED. You can't escape just by logging out
---
User interfaces, to change up how your action bars, unit frames, etc look and behave.
---
Yooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. I haven't had time to try but wall jumping still works? Legitimately one of my favorite things to do. Where did you start your route?
---
What is that?
---
*laughs in warlock*
---
That's sweet.
---
Yep - 2000k that went by fast into a 6000 que
---
Imo he was the world first. Account sharing, which Jokerd did, shouldn't really count.
---
Edit: Never mind Leshraque shared as well...
---
bruh
---
Because this game is more of a calling to veterans and WoW players of the past, therefore lots of people premeditated in which server they are going to roll on ahead of time. Hundreds of guilds with tons of players all picking out a server ahead of time, then the streamers choosing their server and their natural following of thousands of players. 
---
The majority of the player base has played WoW before.  They planned this out before it released.
---
Supposed to help people out of the goodness of your heart! Not for the praise. They‚Äôll learn... Hopefully, or they‚Äôll quit. Cause Classic is not about praise, it‚Äôs about helping each other have fun.
---
This worked. I used Lesser Heal(Rank 2). Thanks!
---
Sorry but atm I‚Äôd much rather have layering and no queues.
---
&gt; Remember green quests give the same xp they would ahve done if you did them at the correct level. Xp only gets nerfed on grey quests.
---
This is not true. You can get XP nerfed on a green quest, it just depends on what level you finish the quest. [Here's an example](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=338/the-green-hills-of-stranglethorn). Scroll down and use the slider. The quest XP is green at level 43, but starts to decay at level 46. The quest doesn't turn grey until level 49. It is a progressive decay from 46 until 50.
---
As a healer I also belive it's within my legal right to not heal people who use "twitch language"
---
Sorry I didn‚Äôt know what ‚Äúkited‚Äù meant
---
Its like 4 seconds faster to fly and run i thought
---
I haven‚Äôt mocked anything, just lent out counter points and a different perspective.
---
‚Äúi WiLl AdDrESs it‚Äù  lol, guess now I‚Äôve mocked it
---
Which Paladin tier is that jacket?
---
Is there any effective way to level if I spec holy? Can I solo quest or should I just run dungeons?
---
Did the Druid say ‚Äúyour mother is a whore and I hope she dies of cancer‚Äù? No, because that would actually be toxic. This isn‚Äôt, don‚Äôt be so sensitive
---
Let the party use CC before pulling, turn mobs away from  the party so they don't get parried. They'll have to let you build up stacks of sunder armor before all out dpsing or you might lose aggro.
---
This makes a lot of sense. You could lower the number of layers based on every 10 levels. There's never as many 60s as 50s as 40s, etc.. I'd lock everyone 55+ onto one. It also prevents exploitation from the high-end content but doesn't affect most of the leveling issues.
---
I don't think he understands how the companies function...
---
Elitism hasn't set in fully yet
---
Ye makes sense.
---
I stream on twitch.
---
You on BB too?
---
No you dont, I don't have Retail WoW installed but I get the drop-down menu to choose. Try re-installing battle-net.
---
I‚Äôm actually in the exact same boat and need the same thing. I hope we get some good recommendations!
---
How are there going to be any stats for longevity when it's been released for less than a week? Sure folks will say that their character or guild will play it forever but man in realities, only time will tell.
---
quit now, save your azeroth
---
Makes sense if you're levelling tailoring, that's a money pit. I'm level 28 on my mage right now and I'm at 15 or so gold. I've been frugal with which skills I buy, but I have spent a few gold on upgrading some really old greys/greens and buying 10 slot bags.
---
and you are putting effort in it. 
---
amazing how you spend your time. im glad you find it amusing.
---
Locks seem to be almost as popular as mages. Unlike early vanilla, with 1.12 talents they do very well. In raids, they start out a little worse than mages (no +hit talent for shadowbolt) but they scale extremely well with gear, and keep up with fire mages in the top tier raids.
---
Actually feral Druids scale remarkably well with gear, they do not fall behind their leveling state at all in terms of DPS - it‚Äôs just that proper gear is very hard to come across for hybrids who don‚Äôt heal in Vanilla. 
---
A full AQ gear feral has over 30% crit chance and does A LOT of damage in Cat Form in PvP, but you rarely see that - it‚Äôs just that Cats are so fragile he has to alternate between kiting/ bear form not to die in a global when focused himself. And then again, he‚Äôs generally fucked in PvP because raiding feral gear has almost no intellect on it, so he‚Äôll go OOM very fast shapeshifting and healing himself. 
---
Coupled with Mages‚Äô low health pool, a geared feral can totally two shot a mage at 60 with a Ravage+Shred lucky crit combo, even if the mage is very well geared himself. Maybe won‚Äôt take 95% of his HP with Ravage like in this clip, but 70% totally, and Shred will take the remaining 30% easily.
---
You aren't camping me when you kill me.  I'm camping you.
---
Thank you.

The best is when you see a warrior running away with mobs on his tail yelling "HELP" lol

---
Before i have 1 sunder on all the mobs they are all riddled with dots and they are hellfiring next to it, Warlock players are a different breed.
---
Fire Bobby Kotick, btw. Courtesy of Jim fucking Sterling Son, Thank god for him.

problem is not the scaling, it's that there is no gear for them.

People refusing to move to lower pop realm: "but mah pahpoolayshunz in fewcher!!!11"
---
For sure, fair.
---
You‚Äôre a legend, that‚Äôs the price I was dreaming of. Do you think it would get to 30fps on lowest settings?
---
I‚Äôm curious if you would have a 300ish dollar suggestion for people who might stumble across this post in the future
---
And why is it important to you too block out your character name?
---
Use your warrior as your alt and give him year with your main = easy leveling
---
O.o run you fool!
---
It is funny how you get all these oldschool style pictures of people playing oldschool WoW. But all the people are middle aged and the computers are curved flatscreens instead of bulky crts.
---
You wouldn‚Äôt happen to have a link to this spec?
---
We skip all the other xpacs and go straight to WoD instead.
---
The darkest timeline.
---
The black fly few across the desert, and the fly swatter followed.
---
But it‚Äôs 2 people who played not just 1
---
If you want to play the game, you cannot play on Feralina. It is not sustainable. Same scenario as you happened to me. I bit the bullet and started horde on a server with no Que.
---
This is Zandalar Tribe EU, right?
---
Because Trump is our president and that is the state of truth in 2019.

I make agreements on playtime. That really works for me.
---
Right
---
I‚Äôm weirdly happy to be finding out I‚Äôm not the only one barely scraping by on my warrior. Was beginning to think I was just bad.
---
As a lock, this is also true
---
People know that‚Äôs not how the company is actually set up right?
---
there it is again!
---
Probably a neckbeard
---
Must be a nice area
---
*laughs in ZT*
---
Zandalari Tribe EU
---
Genuinely, don't do this to yourself. You'll reroll a new class, get to 30 and want to change again. 
---
I'm currently 33 on my druid, every so often I suddenly get a wave of anxiety that I've picked the wrong class for me. 
---
At the end of the day, focus on these. Warlocks are easy and fast to level, end game they are always wanted for cookies and summoning , in PvP they hit like a truck and turn into God's a few phases down the line.
---
I sincerely think an actual potato would, but yea it might even be able to do a little higher then that even.
---
Can you ELI5 the English language?
---
I honestly want to respond in a constructive manner and contribute to this discussion, but every single person that has a different point of view than you has been responded to with "you're not helping".  
---
Your queue times are manageable, and quite easily.  You just need to put forth the effort.  I'm on one of the most populated realms NA and I've waited to play exactly 10 minutes total since launch.
---
The entire rogue community is laughing at this post currently.
---
Yeah. Also if someone camps low levels to grief them, they're fair game for camping. I remember in vanilla when someone would attack a low level area the high level characters would mobilize and make them pay.
---
Good to be back!
---
That's so genius I love it
---
It was rough.... But I ended up just dying right on top of the spawn point and waited in spirit mode so nobody would see me. Then once he spawned, I healed up and got him. Luckily it was 3AM and nobody was around lol. There were many many hunters who came looking for him as well, but would only wait 15-20 minutes.
---
Twitch desktop app is easily the way to go now that Classic is an official Release. Easy way to find addons that are up to date, and stay up to date automatically.
---
YOU'RE breathtaking!
---
His automation interacts with the game which is against TOS. Full stop.
---
True. I did 2 to 18 and both were around 16 hours? Im not great but it was consistent.
---
You make a macro announcing them. You mash it whenever you are in town.
---
Most people are not going to seek an outside source to get names of ninja looters. They only find out if it's handed to them where they are
---
Feral spec is more efficient if that‚Äôs what you mean. Both would work though. With balance you would have to drink every 2-3 mobs for mana.
---
I would throw me pc our the window lol
---
I hope they do man, but those are pretty rare. If you don't mind paying 2 accounts for now, that would probably work well for you.
---
They are selling 100gold for $1,750.00 canadian. Holy shit
---
The sheer look of "fml" on his face is fantastic üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
No me :)
---
So if he has been ninja looting since instance start, why not kick him?
---
It means every server has multiple layers of X number of players. When phase 2 rolls out every layer will be merged into one.
---
They layered realms so zones and mobs for quests woudn't be overcrowded when 25k+ people are trying to level on the same zone.
---
Your layer is the same every time you login, only way to change layer (aka reset it) is by being invited by someone from the same realm but in a different layer
---
Pick a different server?
---

We were among the very first to start on Gandling-EU not a single Q yet.

I am honestly very positive about the player activity here as well.

WOW and runescape did a great job of building community for quests

Just get invited to the right layer and then invite everyone else. Annoying but it'd only take 5 mins

I got into queue at 1PM today. Still counting, and it was only 11k when I queued up. Fun times.
---
Yes it does, including new weather effects that weren't in vanilla. There are dynamic skyboxes and weather effects that change on time of day and area of zone you're in. Sunny, foggy, cloudy, rainy, stormy, etc. BFA zones are beautiful.
---
I guess you found the pasty white 45 year old playing Classic WoW in his mom's basement still
---
What, why??
---
I love not doing the hardcore stuff this time around. I‚Äôm gonna level cooking and have a slow and grand time!
---
They are true almost to the minute for me. It showed me 315 minutes exactly 310 minutes ago. And I just entered.
---
For a lv 18 staff, its not bad for hunter
---
No one has any gear, every item is a upgrade
---
By level 23 you shouldn‚Äôt really need to be in melee unless there‚Äôs mobs everywhere preventing you from kiting. Even if that‚Äôs the case, your pet should be holding aggro as long as you don‚Äôt max out your damage right after it attacks
---
I'm not quite sure what you're talking about for those centaur mobs level 26-28. The only loot I got was silk cloth. Barely made any gold from vendor loot, no food whatsoever.
---
One hour is an incredibly short amount of time to get this pet. Congrats.
---
Tbf, i didn't RP when i played vanilla either. I didn't start playing on an rp server until around Mists. I'll never go back to Normal servers now XD
---
The fricken windfury proc xD

I said a bow string, not a G. Ugh never mind.

Lol, reminds me of the South Park episode. Good stuff.

Haha yeah I'm buying skills I'm just obsessed with farming mats.
---
36g at 32 currently.

hes more like an influencer now... /entrepreneur/model/actress
---
So spot on
---
They don't, nor do they care to. They just want a scapegoat, and Activision has always been an easy target.
---
Yellow
---
Yeah it's dodgy but it's fine tbh
---
As a Brit it's really noticeable but it's not enough to ruin anything, to me it sounds like someone who moved to the UK so has a mixed accent
---
Dont they have someone that stops them from going afk by hitting the spacebar every few minutes? Sounds like they are account sharing to me...
---
Keep in mind portal darnassus is lvl 50 for whatever reason so I'm not sure you are going to get much more than 20s(the price for the portal mats) from low level elves waiting for portals from darnassus to sw/if.
---
Just start another character :) one to play woth buddy and another for solo
---
Any of the other EST high pop servers. Herod has big queues atm and Thalnos has a large Spanish population.
---
It‚Äôs true as a warrior or you‚Äôll be stuck in combat and can‚Äôt charge for shit
---
Yes. Next time we will foresee 5 hour queues all day every day. Our bad.
---
May I have the correct Parse Syntax Grammer or the voidance of the purgery?
---
Hell yeah! They should totally do another episode now that Classic is out. I think it would bring more people together. :)
---
in front of clothers thats a rule breaker , we forgave him the entire  "im sorry guys im new to the game" thing for  looting the entire DM on "accident " fcking hunters will need on anything nowadays
---
They can't stop me, I have become the fun police.
---
Yes we were all on discord.
---
Set up realVNC if you are tech savvy enough and then direct connect using their app on your phone. I do that and get in queue around 1 PM.
---
No matter what game you play, there is someone who no life‚Äôs it. Don‚Äôt worry about being outpaced unless your ideal lifestyle involves playing the same game 18 hours a day.
---
the excuse was he was new to the game
---
I played warrior back in the day. My god it felt brutal and thankless. Paladins seemed to be the same, but better across the board. I'd lose pretty much every duel with one, even if they were lower level. *And* they get a free mount? Assholes.
---
Now I'm a pally, and one of my favorite things is throwing heals and buffs in randoms as I pass by. I also find warriors most likely to be having issues, and since they can't recover health in a fight without a potion, can always use a heal.
---
Doesnt matter, if you are playing alone that still mean you will half ofbthe quests in group for two reason: too many player or too strong mobs
---
just the flying tiger goggles at a side angle haha
---
You shouldn't tbh, there are infinitely more rewarding things you could be doing with your time
---
I like you.
---
What was the name of your first pet?
---
Heh.. I literally did the exact same thing this afternoon.. also on the seed quest in stonetalon. Also aggroed some mobs in the barrens I could have avoided except they were hidden by the tall grass. It does look pretty @ 11 tho. :)
---
*Nozdormu wants to know your location*
---
You know why warriors and priest blast through quests? Warrior can do dumb shit and get healed for days. 
---
Now imagine that, but combined a d miniature. That's a hunter
---
The person in the pic isn't OP.  If it is, then my apologies
---
and you clearly play autism alot too, because you are autistic
---
Just pointing out it's a selfish behaviour. It's not on my server so IDGAF personally (i also play other games or do something else rather than queue if the queue time is over 20 mins)
---
Yea, but so far they have been few an far between, so that's a plus
---
Well let me put it like this.
---
Let's say server A has 20k players on it. During phase 1 blizzard split that 20k population in 10 layers of 2k players so it's easier for everyone to level, yet they are all on the same realm.
---
The reason why he was switching layers was so he could get fresh pack of mobs right away instead of waiting for them to reset in his layer since none of the other ones had players farming those mobs.
---
That's weird, I feed my cat as much as I can and all it does now is pounce on my sack at 3AM
---
skinning is the best PVP profession in open world - don't leave a trail of bodies for enemies to track down to pounce on you
---
I like her Sublime cover
---
What does he think of it? Does he enjoy it?
---
ClassicCodex. It‚Äôll even put where it drops on the map.
---
Wands are critical to your success as a priest. they do huge dps for no mana, really increasing your efficiency. Priests aen't exciting to level, per se, but they are consistent and fairly easy. If you want easy and like casters, warlocks are great fun and good to great at every aspect of the game, plus they have lots of flavourful spells and interesting talent specs.
---
It honestly depends on what server and when you are logging in. I logged into whitemane yesterday and had a 5k queue with a 2.5 hour wait but this morning I logged in without any wait.
---
Can you share Joana‚Äôs guide in guidelime format? Me love you long time
---
I understand all that, but you actually had to be mindful of stuff like that back then whereas now you don‚Äôt.
---
When people say skinning is good for money on new servers, it's because you get that small amount of money from vendoring it. The crafting professions cost to level and few people have the money (or want to spend it) to purchase the crafted items.
---
If you're one of the people still level 15 or so all this stuff isn't really relevant, I think... It's mostly for that initial rush of people leveling, where there is no market for anything. So skinning is easy to keep leveled and gives you more trash loot from many mobs you kill.
---
At least that's my take.
---
I just tested this, it's the same unfortunately.
---

Activision gave us classic though
---
What server? Could just be popular server.....like some twitch chat server named faeralina
---
Yep! üëç plan is 3-4 vids per profession with beginning guide for each going all the way up to 300 in depth. Glad you liked it!!
---
until barrens - i tried to safe everybody
---
now i just let them die and get the free xp for myself 
---
becoming dull to death sucks boys
---
Shamans are AWESOME, really fun.  battle mage is right but with healing, which can really help you out of rough spot.  They also use mail and can use shields so they are not squishy.
---
Some of the other class perks are ghost wolf at lvl 20 make travel much faster, and they Get a spell ancestral recall that is a 15 min hearth independent of your hearthstone, so you can use it to get back to quest hubs. They can revive allies and revive themselves every hour i think.
---
It's official. Classic is dead.
---
Ashbringer has short queue
---
It's a lot less worthwhile to kick players making mistakes when it takes thirty minutes to an hour to get a group to the dungeon. As long as you try to do better, a group can hold together. Also helps to make small talk, hard to abandon people when they actually feel like people.
---
I haven't respecced, thankfully. I didn't know that. I've been thinking about rerolling a hunter honestly.
---
Epic names, I love it!
---
I try to help warriors whenever I can. Leveling one in vanilla, I know the struggle.
---
The naming convention is all over the place and changes based on the time of day as it is all about the current queue. I suggest ignore it unless you actively see issues.
---
Have you launched WoW Classic yet?  I couldn‚Äôt find my addon folder and it turned out it doesn‚Äôt appear until after you‚Äôve launched the game for the first time.
---
I got a ring in there last night!
---
Is it just me or is the audio kinda weird?
---
I think layering once every five minutes plus infinite layering in a town/entrance to dungeon would be pretty fair.
---
Oh no.. I dropped so many green quests because I thought the xp was worse. :(
---
Lol that's not WoW that's just shitty people
---
As a priest. 
---
This is true üòÇ
---
Yes they increased server capacity like 2 days ago. Now most realms don't have a queue anymore and thus dropped to high or medium. The time of the day obviously depends as well. Also don't forget that a server on medium has more players than the fullest servers during vanilla. So a medium server is far from being dead.
---
I use to play a bunch in TBC (Alliance, Warlock) and WoTLK (Horde - Ret Pally). Haven't played in forever but looking to come back and try Vanilla. Mainly looking to do group content stuff.
---
I really liked and did extremely well as a DD/DPS but loved the flexibility and role filling I could do as a Pally since I like tanking and healing too. Kinda prefer melee over ranged DPS since I could do stuff while moving. 
---
Tried but never got into playing druids DPS or rogues. 
---
I remember Mage being alright and liked the mobility with teleports/portals and blink/iceblock at the end but absolutely hated the leveling part.  
---
Never really tried a priest, warrior, shaman, or hunter before and tempted to try something new especially Priest or Warrior.
---
I have my Hyena a /hug before abandoning him

I will never forget how you got me through STV, Hyena.

Got it.  I want to do Enchanting eventually but people said skinning was good for early spending money, since I won't have the mats/money to level Enchanting anyway.

Let me tell you something Bolvar Fordragon, back then we were savages! We were drinking demon blood by the gallon and that was when we could get the pure shit. You know the good shit, the demon blood that killed Grom....... (pause) What were we talking about?

And that day a ninja was born.

Honestly what bothers me more than layering is elite mobs' damage. One of the things I was looking most forward to was running SM, BRD and Scholo and I have to say with the dungeons I've done so far they've been excruciatingly boring compared to private servers. I'm playing a priest and I was face tanking those elite dwarves in wetlands in a group of 3. I took my inner fire off to see how much it would affect me - pretty much nothing. It would have taken a good while for one of them to auto me down. 
---
When I ran BFD my tank just was dual wield tanking the entire thing, even on the last boss that was landing crushing blows on him, and I only had to throw out 3 heals to him and no PW:S or renew.  Some people made some good points in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/br86ov/elite_damage_is_way_off_evidence/). I just remember getting my face beat off by elites on my rogue and shaman back in the day when I'd pull aggro while leveling in dungeons, and that wasn't even in cloth.
---
There's over 100 zones in WoW. And you'll probably not even see a dozen of them throughout your "journey" to 120. For fucks sake, I leveled from 58 to 82 JUST in Dragonblight. And I did this on 5 characters in a row. All that rich WotLK content and lore, and there is 0 reason to ever see it. Everything in retail just seems like one big ADHD focused joke.
---
I doubt I‚Äôm on the same server but I would love the opportunity to slay Activision.

&gt;I was hoping to enjoy this with my wife since we weren't together or even knew eachother when I used to play 
---
Sure, you haven't ever played wow before.
---
Can take time to process.
---
/startattack
---
Man, I am happy that basically all I do while leveling is auto attacking and spamming heroic strike. The pain comes with my protection abilities :(
---
why dont you heal me dansgame nvm i have healing pots poggers
---
I think so, he‚Äôs just sitting there staring at the screen.
---
if you cant see the "/s", how do you know for *sure*?
---
He "abused" the layering system between the levels of 58 to 60 because he couldn't kill a single mob without getting ganked by a raid-sized group, which doesn't really matter as he'd still beat the previous record by more than a day (IIRC) without doing so.
---
Strange. Wonder if that was a bug back then as well.
---
lets be honest..mage is FUN
---
That warlock is so accurate it hurts.
---
At that low of a dungeon/level he's right though. Shield wouldn't provide enough armor value to move the needle on damage resistance, and they likely wouldn't have any shield specific abilities around then either. 
---
Granted once you're in WC, yeah, you'll want to use a shield.
---
Ohhh I gotcha. So are there people that have a problem with this? Is it considered cheating or something?
---
Yeah but once you have that you can use it to fsrm up cash, reagents etc for your next char (that is probably their reasoning).
---
Also it's not fastest to 60 btw. Hunters and locks are faster for levelling. All the old wow classic speed levelling records were always held by images regardless of the level bracket.
---
It's saturday and my server is medium now.  Pretty soon low...
---
1080p I get 60fps only on classic setting which is fine for me
---
No idea mate. Probably your alt is going to outlevel your main though lol..
---
I‚Äôm just gonna assume you don‚Äôt know what twitch is just to cover my bases. Twitch is a game streaming platform where people can live stream themselves playing games. The chat on that site has certain words that turn into pictures automatically which people use to convey certain feelings and generally be trolls. Twitch speak is when people start talking like they do in twitch chat outside of twitch. It can get kind of annoying and without the context of the twitch website it can seem pretty childish.
---
People say warlocks are good at leveling...How so? How do you approach multiple mobs
---
Drop the fats. They're unhealthy.
---
Completely mesmerised. He loves it!
---
mate, do what you want in pve, it ain't difficult, you don't need to be super tryhard about it, and 2h is the best wep choice for pvp
---
most people go dual wield fury for raids and 2h arms for pvp
---
Slam spec looks something like this  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LbhxkhbZVVuzMEoVo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LbhxkhbZVVuzMEoVo) 
---
i'm not entirely sure how Slam works on Classic WoW, but on Pservers you're suppose to Slam immediately after your white hit
---
When I got to 60 I felt like the game had just begun. Rollouts of content through 1.12 was great but as you said it inevitably stops before the first expansion. If it remains Vanilla it will have to remain that way. At some point anyone that wants to will be fully geared and have the whole game on farm. Maybe they'll find some joy in guiding new/old players back through it for a while... Who knows... I'm almost 40 years old and would love nothing more than to "go home again" with WoW Classic but I don't think I can. I can't sit here all day in Orgrimmar joining UBRS pugs and grinding out T0 blues to get raiding on a regular schedule and all this again. I can't spend 6 hours running BGs to grind toward a PVP title to get new gear to grind for the next. Stupid things like 20 hour long AV matches. All these hold a place in my heart that's solid and in the place of memory now. I'll never remake those friends and feel that rush the first time I joined a 40 man going to MC. I would love to. More than anything. Years back I tried that Nostralius stuff, only made it to level 48 before I just couldn't push forward anymore. But even if I did, then what? Try to relive the old expansions and my old place in them? I don't think I could.. Whole thing breaks my heart honestly.
---
This guy isn‚Äôt mocking you he is also asking for suggestions
---
Two hand weapon as opposed to dual wielding for warriors which is generally the end game build when you can get the hit rating for dual.  OP wants to stay 2h always is what he is asking.  In most casual guilds I don't see them caring.  Probably still be upper dps later just because warrior.
---
they made it as classic as possible, they werent predicting these things back in the day,  you obviously dont understand how things should work , if you did this wouldnt even be a  necessary conversation , he doesnt need the spirit on that staff , and when you have clothers in your team you obviously as a leather class have no option unless they pass, but this is not something that your IQ can help you understand obviously , every clothadin i ever knew asked first if it was ok, you as a hunter are nothing special   he did a dick move and proceeded to glow in it , im not gonna play with  ppl like you
---
I did Blackfathom Deeps last night as a warlock. Lemme tell ya, underwater breathing was super useful there.
---
I usually hate underwater zones (like Vashjir, or the underwater levels in platforming games). I think it just stresses me out. I like swimming but I just always feel those levels are oppressive. Idk why.
---
But BFD was super fun, cuz it's a cave with a lot of water. Made for a fun spelunking adventure. I hope there are more dungeons like this.

You only get discount for honored. And pvp rank 6 but thats not know
---
What's the music on the hunter one.
---
You need a full account to install Classic without a subscription. A starter account will not give you the option until you add gametime.
---
The classic client is less then 5GB though, so it's not like your missing much time on installation.
---
Right. I thought what she said was relevant but I guess not. Thought I was missing something.
---
crushing blow
---
Appreciate the response, and the advice.
---
Layers already completely ruined server identity...
---
The middle ground is letting the tank properly get aggro. The problem in dungeons below 50 is that mobs don't really deal that much damage and therefor don't give you a lot of rage. A single sunder armor costs 15 rage since you don't really spec into the rage reduction for it. Revenge, if it doesn't proc normally also costs 15 (5 for using it and 10 for forcing a proc with shield block). And that's only for single enemies.
---
Sadly, most don't let the tanks get aggro properly. I've been marking focus targets since the first dungeon and except for my guildies most just ignore skull. I'm level 38 and tanked every dungeon several times up to armory.
---
Honestly warriors are a bit rough in the early levels, it does get better though, if you can stick with it they are great to play later on
---
Thank you ! Happy playing :)
---
Don't get someone addicted to thing game!
---
That's true. I want to just play only my main, but I also dont want to make my friend upset :/
---
Big name streamers speed run classic dungeons with specific people and practiced tactics. 
---
This, like every other video game, makes their idiot viewers think that they too are capable of the same thing with no effort, planning, or coordination.
---
You have to learn it at a weapons master.
---
That one's probably my favorite because the guys are just loving it. It probably helped that they were tech illiterate so they didn't understand it was somebody trying to troll them.
---
That's true, potions will become pretty imporant.
---
Priest here, but it's a relevant question for holy pallys... How do I turn on pet health bars in the default UI, for 5 man parties?
---
Now learn to tick manipulate wand hits whilst bashing with staff and you get even more dps for no mana!
---
You can use the same account, so if you have gold on Retail, yes, you can buy the Retail tokens to fuel your subscription and play Classic with it.
---
Edit: "Classic" tokens do not exist, so you'd need to play Retail and farm the gold there
---
Well the guy just got world first using that method so obviously some people are mad because they didn't think of it. 
---
Others say it's not a classic record because back in 2004 layers didn't exist (25k pop servers didn't exist either though) 
---
Some say he only got WF because of streamer privilege and his viewers inviting him to different layers wich you and me probably coudn't do as often.
---
I also heard some people accusing him of account sharing. He got to 60 in about 3 days and 13 hours and the game had been out for about 4 days at that point wich means he only took 11 hours to sleep/eat/bio break in that span of 72 hours
---
All in all, the guy still got world first like it or not
---
Can confirm, I am a Blizzard employee. Please send me your account details via private message for a free 100g in WoW Classic /S
---
Me too.  Had to read it twice.
---
not sure how you managed to attract the one asshole in the game.  everyone so nice atm.  also not sure why you were selected to release his rage on
---
looks like the human zone equal to the barrens.  ya you dont have much time to play of that is your level.  enjoy the game
---
And I give water breathing to players in the barrens, a dry wasteland. You're welcome!
---
waht
---
you can????
---
[Well, I mean he was a dwarf.](https://i.imgur.com/F0wjeofh.jpg)

That's a good point, cos I need money even now cos of class skills haha
---
You are literally the GOAT dude thank you. Happy questing!!!
---
Am druid, the accuracy is amazing.  Feels like i got the zoomies
---
I get it! Thanks for the chuckle
---
You can do that?
---
To be honest I am kinda shitty with the wand, I keep canceling auto-attacks by mistake
---
No INT buff for you
---
was hilarous to begin with that 50yo dudes were seriously trying to compete and ended up in mid 40's when 1st ppl started to hit 60 :DD
---
Thanks for proving my point
---
Hits too close to home
---
Not anymore, now they are relative to capacity.
---
I *love* questing without any quest helpers. It reminds me of single-player RPGs. I have noticed that the quests in Kalimdor do a lot better of a job at explaining where the quest objectives are, though, compared to the quests I've done in EK. Which is weird because most people seem to prefer EK. I know that, as a Night Elf, I can't wait to go "home" after short stints across the world. As I quest through a zone, I begin to know where everything is by heart, which is something that I can't say about other MMOs (retail WoW included.)

Mage isn't the easiest to make level. Easiest would be Hunter because pet tanks.
---
Look at this guy, already done with stv
---
I didn‚Äôt watch, but I‚Äôm sure there were also a ton of spells he never bought because they were completely unnecessary to how he was grinding.
---
No, I will
---
If you are only gonna play this alt with your friend I would suggest a priest as they really shine with people helping, as for professions I would recommend grinding them when your friend is offline as they don‚Äôt affect your overall level in classic .

i expected a drowning pool track for the wf proc 7/9

Send this to activision blizzard twitter pls

I recently got my girlfriend (21) to try both iterations of the  game for the first time ever after having not much previous gaming experience and she admits that classic is by far more interesting and enjoyable. She‚Äôs able to tag along with my friends and I in WC and SFK despite being much less skilled than us and it just really feels a lot more immersive with the having to run everywhere trend. üëçüèº
---
Edit: I really see 13 year old me enjoying Classic rather than Retail if it were my first time then.
---
I think you can /deaths
---
Yeah I was a little upset when a rogue snagged the ring drop off the escort mission final boss in WC. not cool. Esp since I was 4 levels higher and on my last run while he was on his first. Whatevs
---
Edit: wording
---
&gt;We need to make the game more sociable
---
Or
---
&gt;Group finder is good
---
Pick one
---
I like the idea of Shaman because I can play as a healer, but in the future still respec dps. I don't mind if the dps was only 75% of a pure DPS because it's made up with party totems and so forth. Pure-dps still would even have a toolkit because of CC, roots, slows and other utility. 
---
But as it is right now, it's like 30% of the DPS with no mana sustain.
---
Fluffiest*
---
It barely works imo. I stopped using it because it keeps glitching out the horizontal bar feature.
---
The paladin should be tabbed out looking at..... pictures....
---
I have a question regarding a specific addon on classic wow. I used to play on a tbc server and I used an addon that showed how many meters away the target I would click would be from where I was standing. It would show red then green when I get into spell range. I can't remember what it's called, does anyone know the name? And is it on classic yet?
---
"mages face roll over everything" "no chance against melee" alright then.
---
Well, you could keep him in the stable, learn the new skill, then dump the one night stand almost immediately and go back to your best friend.
---
What was removed here?
---
I have no idea if this is a good idea, but I‚Äôm going Ret and gear swap for heals without specing and it‚Äôs working p well
---
You can definitely quest in 1k.  I was doing quests there at 25.
---
Go to retail. 
---
Jk heh
---
I can't say what the future holds for classic and how it will pan out. But currently there are plenty of people of all levels, so there's no need to feel like you're falling behind.
---
I would change it to something more normal. They will be able to see the flags on your account. What your name was and why it was changed. Changing it to ‚Äúlovestocome‚Äù could very well end in a ban. Why bother? Pick a different name and move on.
---
Username: DeathBySnuSnu69

---
Yes, in a way. Classic wow comes with your existing wow sub, any game time used for the "main" retail game also works with classic.
---
As a mage, what is a tank? I only know 4 mage 1 priest comps
---
lol I busted up laughing when he killed me.
---
Uhhh, looks like you used your phone to take a picture of something you clearly saw on this subreddit....
---
It probably won't really help until later in the game tbh. Paladins are probably the class that has it easiest in terms of money early on, along with Warlocks. You don't need to worry about having gold for your mount.
---
So if you roll hunter/mage, don't expect it to help financially until later on in the game, when both your main and alt are 60.
---
Jesus christ stop it with this Jokerd is account sharing misinformation. It's a joke. It didn't happen. Stop spreading this info. Like your whole comment history is just about how Jokerd is account sharing. Do you have a hate boner for him or something?
---
Its not necessary a common sense. There are tons of mmo where all you need is to follow your quests without farming mobs in between to keep up in level. And there are alot of mmo where you can kill mobs beyond your level.
---
Let us know if they make you change it, we'll throw a fit about how they're ruining our memes.
---
Auto flagged in contested. Fortunately it's still early right now and unplanned pvp action is light.
---
Yeah literally don‚Äôt have enough rage for sunder armor. Rogue be like ‚ÄúThis retarded tank doesn‚Äôt use sunder.‚Äù
---
Well I was playing my main (the paladin) with my friend. But I might make an alt to play with him. That's actually a good idea
---
Stand close to the pet to learn faster. This means melee range most of the time or be standing next to it when it dashes.
---
Then you just have the dps pulling for you because ‚Äú ur gong to slow.‚Äù  There is no great solution other than time.  Eventually the retail players will learn or leave.
---
Also, don‚Äôt be a total loser and buy their stupid shyt..
---
Thank you OP for the tip.
---
Illegal Danish: Super Snacks is by far my favorite.
---
https://youtu.be/FUsF8weJJWs
---
Here is the whole thing uncut. Just don't watch part 2 for the love of God.
---
To be honest 2 players should nearly balance out.. you'll basically have zero downtime and can far more easily take on group quests or quests that are a smidge too high lvl for you individually.
---
You'll also die less so less corpse running time. Plus you could sync professions so that they dont overlap AND are mutually beneficial.
---
I was thinking about dualboxing for farming and I originally thought mage/lock would be great and I would have access to summons if a friend joined, but I have been thinking mage/mage would kill really fast with 2x blizzard, but someone mentioned mage/priest is the best for farming, but didn't really give a reason why. Any thoughts would be a great help.
---
It did happen to me, and my friends at 10 10 and 14 offered to reroll servers so they  could play with me... and we weren‚Äôt even together IRL.  Maybe I‚Äôm lucky to have good friends, and I wouldn‚Äôt have FORCED them to move, but just rolling on without a bro at a LAN party seems like a dick move personally.
---
This entire experience would be really, really fucking miserable without layering. It's a necessary evil for a few weeks.
---
Make sure to skin them...huhuhu....
---
/spit is the real true answer. Why? It pisses people off enough to keep coming at you.
---
I joined a world chat on my server to catch group faster for dungeon.
---
Literally Half of the message there are thing like "layer please", people asking invite to change layer for whatever they are farming....
---
Nightfall is probably the one you are referring to.
---
LPT: buy pages on the bb ah.
---
They run out of skill points though.
---
It's gonna cost much more than 150g. And the painful part is that it's not even available until phase 2 or 3 (forgot which) D:
---
in the morning faeralis server, the streamer one, as zero que.  jumps up to over ten thousand still though
---
Yah you torrent that
---
Eu or na?
---
420 is great, but still a long ways from an epic mount...
---
same goes for lfg spam. guys... just right click your general tab in the chat and go to settings. join lfg and guild recruitment there... please save us
---
Yeah that's why TBC patch is so hilariously good to me. It's like the devs were waiting for expac pre-patch for months to unleash a 50 ton nuclear warhead overhaul. 6/9 of the Hybrid specs were turned around and sent to Heaven.
---
Don't seem so. On first day i saw someone selling wand on general chat, he invited me and i got into another layer.
---
nah you sound like a bitch that cries when something doesn't go your way, grow up.
---
Damn that's dope. Sounds like a Orc warrior fantasy
---
Get mob aggro from behind while eating but 2 secs before you get buff
---
the run goes faster if dps isn't pulling threat.  takes 1.5 seconds per mob, so 4.5 average during a normal dungeon pull. if dps are ignoring marks it's punishing everyone with greater down time for the healer.
---
You say shitty tanks, I say shitty dps that cant count time.
---
The tribal tauren track gives me chills. Also the whole Ashenvale soundtrack.
---
Players will always find a way to ruin a game.  They‚Äôve had 15 years of practice now.
---
Try it out, join a couple guilds that are social with people leveling, classic is more rewarding when you don't have irl friends because it has a powerful community, you'll make new best friends in your situation really fast.
---
Most people probably don‚Äôt want to abandon 30+ hours of investment.
---
Classic is very hard to solo but now is the time to play because lots of people to group up with.
---
thanks so much
---
Draelin just hit level 60 on Gandling EU (mage).
---
I think EQ has the best system for this honestly. Every 6 months or so they start out a new server, that starts with just the vanilla experience and time gates/ progression gates unlocking the next expansions. So anyone who is on a server is doing the relevant content for where that server is, whoever wants the beggining experience just waits for the next 6 months to roll around.
---
My warriors name is BTC if you want to add me and play :)
---
I will say I think dungeons will be a lot more fun but I am not sure about the overall game. I think 40man raid is too much.
---
If you play on german servers, you can ask me for help anytime
---
üôàüôâüôä
---
More like. üòû
---
I haven't had a single queue on that server
---
&gt;Layering is supposed to go away in phase 2 anyway
---
I got bad news for people that are looking forward to this happening. They are probably going to keep it on the larger servers if they don't have a considerable drop off in players. The queues would take at least a day if they keep the Vanilla server size when removing layering.
---
The first weekend of launch is going to be rough for pretty much everyone. a lot of people weren't able to play during the week, so expect the queues as well as the starting areas to be packed again on the more pop servers.
---
I usually go for one of the highest pop PvP servers. And now that streamers are in the mix, I avoid any servers that are heavy on them.
---
Yeah totally didnt realize until a friend pointed it out, now its all i see lol, oh well
---
Blizzard was ran by people that like to make good game, Activision is run by shareholders that like to make money.
---
Dude you do this to yourself when you play on a high/full server. 
---
Total pickachu moment
---
It's not only that, it's also abused to farm ressources.
---
World chat on my server is filled with message like "layer please" by people who just want to hop to farm more.
---
It will be disastrous for black lotus.
---
I don't think that works.
---
Sounds like mantra of a dps to not heal.
---
could try something like
---
/targetenemy
---
/petattack
---
/targetlasttarget
---
thanks mate :D
---
Peek-a-boo! Let's help him poo
---
Literally haven't been on Reddit all day until posting this. Saw it in discord.
---
They are just words do you not think you are overreacting at all?
---
Been playing all morning and got DC too...
---
Pve dps can be pretty dull depending on class. I also find pve dps in eso not very fun. I always healed for that reason. 
---
In pvp wow classic is not about button mashing, more about knowing when to use what and how to respond to situations. If you blow cooldowns early or something of the like, you dead. In the current state of eso, I cant really pvp anymore and enjoy it for any length of time. The button mashing and click mashing is not great for my hands, and the current dot heavy meta sucks imo. I have 9 max level toons all for PvP and every time I login I‚Äôm done after a short time. 
---
My favorite part about old vanilla pvp is the amount of situation skills you have. Especially hybrid classes. I also enjoy auto attacks rather than clicking all the time. Even though there‚Äôs a very high skill cap for LA-skill-bash weaving for PvP(at least for Stam), I still find there to be too much constant mashing. Also every class can heal an insane amount of damage if built right... can be a positive or negative, but damn do I love wow classic where classes can‚Äôt just spam heals for all of eternity and spam dodge roll 15 times. 
---
Just my thoughts.
---
uuuuhhhhhh.....
---
I am also on whitemane.  I was hoping for some sort of fix or adjustment regardless of server.
---
Must have missed it, saw it in discord.
---
It's a tough life for rogues. It's so traumatizing seeing all those misses üò≠üò≠
---
You missed the bit at the very end where the boar comes back to the warlock, still gray.
---
How do I play as rogue without dying against basic mobs? Every time I aggress something it feels like I'm playing russian roulette, and I even made a second rogue of a different race because I thought maybe I picked wrong but my experience was very much the same.
---
But Isildur....!
---
This is the insightful comment the thread needs :)   
---
It might be more inefficient per mob to level as a group, but group activity saves much more time. People can get you stuff you might need if they‚Äôre running back to town. More utility, more buff uptime generally, the ability to immediately attempt more difficult quests, and obviously doubling the rate of taking down mobs. Finding tags more quickly obviously helps too.
---
Me too, and not like everyone had flying. I played the whole expansion and never tried a flying mount cause I couldnt afford it
---
I use kiwiplates and they look like that
---
Lets just wait for when they will have to split server because there is too many people on each one which will be far worse from a community point
---
This exact thread has been posted about 10 times now, at least.  :P
---
Its kept people playing d3 long past common sense would suggest is possible.
---
Dual wielding has a massive hit penalty
---
Adds 19% to both hands
---
For me, vanilla paladin is the perfect example of how you can release an excellent game with such a bad class design.
---
I think it would be something like;
---
/targetenemy [noexists][dead][help]
---
/petattack [harm]
---
/cast Charge
---
/cast Dash
---

That's exactly how layering works. It's why the servers are going to be impossible to get into once they get rid of layering if the player dropoff isn't significant.
---
Layering is supposed to be out by Phase 2. Hopefully Blizz keeps their word on that.
---
Lol i just began the game as a warlock and i can already agree

What's this meme format called?

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cxzcmr/why_classic_needs_lfg/). 
---
They have said they will remove layering and keep queues how big they are and so far they have done everything they have said.
---
Just like in the real world, the top 1% have as much impact on economy than the 99%
---
Shaman one made me laugh, good one :D
---
Feral is better for levelling but you can have a lot more fun with an AOE build with balance. Seriously the most fun I had. Prepare to theory craft like a mother fucker.
---
You should be able to use heroic strike without much trouble. But be aware that your battle shout creates a tremendous amount of threat and is actually a key ability as warrior tank. So no shouting and just auto attack, rend and heroic strike and you Will be fine.
---
They‚Äôre mostly all high pop right?  I have ‚Äúnormalish‚Äù hours. So if it‚Äôs depends on time of day then unless they fix something I‚Äôll always be boned.
---
Right now all PvP servers are high/full throughout most of the day.
---
Level 30 and I have yet to experience a que on kurrinax
---
You stack strength and spirit for that, right?
---
Playing on sulfuras. Between 8-2 PDT (so 11-5 EST), zero queue. Logging the last few nights around 6 or 7 PDT (so 9-10 server time), maybe a queue between 2-15 min. Last nights was about 5 min. So overall, very manageable and no problems.
---
You had me at gnome dance. 10/10.
---
Excellent work, that's very similar to the one I use. I encourage people to learn and write their own macros. I leave gaps in my lists so people have an easy homework problem for learning to write their own. It's very similar to a macro I already posted, it just needs the names swapped out. If you can read the macro language enough to do that successfully, then you're well on your way to writing your own.
---
Well by layer hopping, they can farm the rep in silithus for the douse alot faster if they don't have to wait for the respawn.
---
Had an alliance betray me and I wasn‚Äôt even mad.
---
We were sitting on the dock at Booty Bay waiting for the ship.  I /waved her and she /waved me.  I thought we were cool.  When the ship took off and away from the guards she killed me!  When the ship rezoned in Kalimdor I rezzed (didn‚Äôt even know that was a thing) then I jumped off the ship before she killed me again.
---
Not even mad.  It was on Grobbulus.  If she‚Äôs reading this.  Good job, you did what any self respecting member of the alliance is supposed to do.  Kill the enemy, even when you outlevel them.
---
iirc you can set yourself as offline and this will disable realid friends until you turn it back on
---
Oh it‚Äôs rough! Takes sooo long for agony or corruption to start ticking. If I‚Äôm in a busy area I‚Äôve started tagging with my wand first. Just a little faster and haven‚Äôt lost nearly as many mobs
---
I just disagree. The drop rate is at 35%, so about 1 in 3 runs drops one. For a semihardcore 3 day raider, you need a LOT of hammers. Even if you do a full 5 when you log in and log out, for 10 runs per session, you should only have 3 or 4 hammers. You need about 1 hammer per boss for good uptime. With MC being a 1 night raid, semihardcore guilds are doing other content on the other nights they play together. So you need 3 or 4 of the gnomer-logout-login-gnomer cycles to get enough for a single MC clear. What happens when BWL drops? at that point you're doing the run every day of the week if you want to have enough for all the bosses. This further expands past that when ZG and AQ20/40 come out.
---
In MC, sure, I think you can expect MCPs on every boss, it's fairly reasonable, but past that, even with just adding BWL, you double the required farm. Add AQ40, where the fights get both harder and longer, and at that point I think the build is unreasonable, because you need to be doing upwards of 15 gnomer runs a day.
---
You don't really even have the option of using a backup weapon because of the build. The entire Spelladin's itemization is built to take full advantage of MCP, so if you DONT have it, your dps is also really fucky unless you have an abnormally rare or expensive secondary weapon. If you have a slower weapon, you're better off using hybrid gear with a hybrid build. The lack of hit rating in the spelladin sets isn't a problem with 1.1 speed, but it's crippling for 3.x, and even in the 2.x range it's kind of bad.
---
Yes, MCP is the best consumable, but the other farms are more efficient. You can get the gold for a night's consumes in maybe 15 or 20 minutes of gold farming in decent spots, but to get a night's worth of MCPs, you need over 30 gnomer clears.
---
Your farm is a very effective one, i'll give you that, it's just a lot to ask for most players, and I dont think most players have the grit and time necisary to farm out the hammers needed for full semihardcore raiding. I think Nightfall Ret will be a more reliable playstyle at 60 for the majority of players, with a few AP ret players that get to soak gear like Hand of Rag and Ashbringer.
---
Soon, every server will have one.
---
It also has to do with getting a day of playtime in then feeling invested so it makes people reluctant to switch
---
How I feel as a warlock... always have these priests, druids, mages, and paladins running by and buffing me so I do what I can to give back.

Keep battle shout up, don't pull additional mobs. At level 14 there's not much you can do wrong as you have such limited skills. Just follow the tanks lead etc..
---
I tried relogging last night but I‚Äôll try again later tonight

Where are the tauren?

302 -&gt; 404 is nothing. Two or three weeks ago i logged into my 120 Priest that i did not play since BfA start week. Easily got to 400 just through world quests and two dungeons and didn't even start with the two new areas. So what is your point?
---
üëâüëåüí¶üò©
---
You sound really bitter. Just enjoy the game now, what happens in 6 months happens.
---
For casual dungeon tanking, not necessarily raiding, would you prefer a druid or warrior?
---
Is anyone else noticing a lot of warlocks on alliance side? Maybe it‚Äôs because I rolled one myself and expected them to be one of the least played.
---
I'm am so fucking tired of this misguided focus on people that are taking measures to avoid a massive problem that was created by blizzard, and is actively being ignored. 
---
I case you haven't noticed, a patch was released yesterday that has made it very hard to afk-bot. Run around and check the nooks and crannies in your local big city and you will see almost noone jumping at random like a few days ago.
---
Meanwhile I logged in today at 14.30 to an 11k queue which i'm still stuck in 6¬Ω hours later. So what did it actually fix? Maybe the queue dropped from 8 hours yesterday to 7 hours today? Big fucking whoop. 
---
Blizzard could raise the player cap by the press of a button if they wanted. Spread the players on 1 or 2 more layers. They could also allow free transfers to lesser populated realms. Don't want more people rolling on a full realm? Lock it for new players. 
---
There are so many options to fix it. 
---
But they don't. 
---
Stop blaming people for trying to live through this train-wreck, and direct your anger where it belongs.
---
Haven't bought into it yet, wondering what server I should choose. It'll take me a long time to level so I don't want to choose one where it will die out eventually...want it to be fairly populated for BGs
---
NA btw
---
its not really hard ... if you compare it to current retail of leveling up yes i guess it could be seen as hard. In reality its more of a challenge some classes have easier time than others and some quest are harder than others but there's always other players that can help you out.
---
When i first started playing WoW 14 some years ago i didn't know anyone either but that is the magic of wow, meeting new people and making friends. I have met plenty of people that i consider close friends over the years,  some i even met in person even tho we were on different coasts and/or country.
---
Don't be shy, interact with other players, ask for help in game if you need to, you will forge friendship, join a guild, join dungeon groups and eventually raids. When ever i took breaks from playing the thing i would miss the most isn't even the game, its the interactions and late night chats with my guild mates.
---
**TLDR** : Yes you should.
---
–≠–¢–û –®–ï–î–ï–ï–ï–ï–í–†!
---
This convinced me to DL it. I never played wow but I played lineage 2 when I was 13-14, right when it came out, this is exactly how I remember it. I have no idea what classes there are or jobs but oh well, sounds like the community will help me figure it out.
---
You don't have cc you say? So access to slows through hamstring and stuns is not crowd control?
---
If kept playing 12 hours a day in uncontested spots he'd  have epic mount in another day after hitting 60 no problem.
---
and they removed our skeletons for this... instead of just making them spawn in random places and directions
---
There are [shellfish traps](https://classicdb.ch/?object=176582) that spawn in the water near Shadowprey village. Opening these give you shellfish and Big Iron Fishing poles. Sell the fishing poles in trade chat or AH and turn the Shellfish in for this [repeatable quest](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=5421), which gives you 55s and a Bloodbelly Fish each time you turn it in. Just do cycles around the shellfish trap spawns using aquatic form .Every 5 shellfish = 57s (if you sell the Bloodbelly Fish). I sold my fishing poles for around 2-3g each. This is how I got most of my gold. As I said earlier, its only viable on druids imo as we have the coolest spell in the game; aquatic form!
---
you talk (write in text) to people in your 5 man party, in your guild and in raids.
---
later, you get into your guild's discord (this used to be ventrillo / teamspeak) and have the option to talk to each other because that is easier than typing all  the time.  
---
it is really that easy, nothing mysterious about it.  your guild will have the information on how to join their voice com.
---
Personally I just sell everything food wise. If you want to level cooking just do it with fishing at the same time. Super easy to spend 2 hours and level fishing and cooking to 150 together
---
I've been dced tons of times and I've always been able to get back in Immediately

You grind beasts for their grey drops, my lvl 40 spot nets me about 10g an hour just in greys not including greens and skinning
---
I prefer TBC and Wrath over vanilla because raid mechanics get more varied and interesting.
---
Ya. There are enough people leveling tailoring that don‚Äôt want to pay for mats that turning a profit on bags is almost impossible. You‚Äôd probably make more in tips handing them out free than you would selling in the AH.

Pretty good I guess, bit costly. /s

Current state of ESO for me being a problem is the horrendous latency spikes you get often.  It has only gotten worse aince the game's launch.

Yep.

I'm never going in the ocean again.

Have you thought about maybe making friends to play with?  Or did you expect to roll on a PvP server and everyone leave each other alone until 60?  Curious...
---
TBC is a total grind fest they really messed up when they made it an endgame/arena expansion,
---
You are either grinding rep, or tokens, or gear. Then once you done grinding you can grind dungeons for more rep, tokens and gear.
---
Ques are only that long on the massive megaservers. My server has pretty moderate ques and some servers have no ques at all currently.
---
what do you mean? Bliiizaard is the correct GM, he said so himself
---
It's a pretty stupid name all-around. You should be glad they gave you a free name change.
---
The classes are unique, but it's a shame that some classes outshine others in essentially every aspect.
---
They should classic-ify expansions. Make them more faithful to a classic experience. If they added no new content the game would get stale.
---
And honestly, if you actually think classic is perfect, I'd recommend you take of the rose coloured goggles.
---
Thanks! How do I join a guild?
---
and raids are better on retails than in Vanilla or TBC.
---
Vanilla is a better game overall, not just a battleground/raid simulator
---
I do that when no one is around, but it terms of busy areas, even immolate is too slow when you are try to get mobs before others. Wanding first is just a little bit faster

" the world first Rag kill race will be pointless"
---
Rag is an instanced boss that groups will be running instances to gear up for.  Layering doesnt affect that.

It only works for some addons AFAIK
---
An embarrassing amount for my level. Maybe 10-20, I should‚Äôve known better

Nah

Not from the right years but whenever i fight a hard boss or a very hard quest i usually listen to Do it or Die by Die mannequin (2007). I have killed many progression bosses on retail listening to that song over the years
---
WOTLK,DIablo3,Hearthstone,Overwatch,SCII, all games released with Activision. We got so many new Blizzard games thanks to them. The game being shit or not is Blizzard only.

Que is literally just short for queue. I‚Äôve said Que since BC/Wrath fully aware that it‚Äôs not the ‚Äúproper‚Äù spelling
---
It depends on what you‚Äôre trying to accomplish.. Are you looking for an add on to improve your UI? QOL improvement? Assistance with questing or professions? There are tons of addons available, you need to know what you want for anyone to be able to advise you which to use, though...
---
Thanks man hopefully it goes well!
---
*laughs in Frost Nova*
---
They didn't. Ion said in the interview he didn't want sharding (at the time) to be abused to farm thorium vein for example
---
And yet people are literally using layering right now to do that.
---
I dunno dude, Paladin has such strong carry potential in 5m content. Every class has strengths and weaknesses. Paladin has its weaknesses, but in group PvP and 5m dungeons, Paladin is a fucking god king.
---
Why drop a wall of text when Blizzard said they were removing it after launch.
---
Literally not true at all. I just hit 32 grinding mobs and I'm at 60g after using some to get 225 LW when I ran out of my own leather
---
oh lol I haven't gotten onto a classic server yet
---
Thanks mate.

As a full time college student with a job, I can really only commit to 1 character.  So it‚Äôs the horde life for me.

---
Shadow priests melt faces in PvP
---
&gt; The classes are unique, but it's a shame that some classes outshine others in essentially every aspect.
---
Because they don't do the same things, and thats the point. They have own different niches and uses, and that makes the classes much more interesting as oppose to all classes being able to fill a role, and one class is jus tflat out better at that specific role.
---
&gt;And honestly, if you actually think classic is perfect, I'd recommend you take of the rose coloured goggles.
---
Feels like a pretty good MMORPG to me, far better than the mess it turns into in TBC/Wrath where its becomes entirely pvp/raid centric.
---
Lol you seem like a blast to be around
---
Good
---
High pop and no queue. Life is good
---
lol how disingenuous or dumb do you have to be to consider hopping layers to grind mobs being an intended functionality of layers?
---
Are you an idiot or a liar?
---
oof  
---
straight between the eyes
---
Mostly reminders/markers for quests and to improve UI. I remember having a lot of hotbars, for example, and Scrolling Combat Text stands out as one I remember, too.
---
I'm basically the same but for healing -  less demand for healers than for tanks but ykwim. You can basically be quite picky - tanks often leave if the group leader says something like 'ready in 5 mins', or groups where people are underleveled. 
---
If you're on a busy server you find groups suuuuper fast.
---
The thing is: Even if there isn't a considerable dropoff, players will spread out in zones, which will reduce the need of layering. That said, I'm not exactly looking forward to it, I don't personally have a problem w/ layering.
---
Uhh maybe don't have a sexualized name in a game kids can play

Or you know, just use Q and E and make A and D key binds for something else. But to each their own.

I‚Äôve  made so many hillman shoulders just to vendor, at one point you could make 50c just by buying mats off the AH
---
What does this accomplish? People that are near that level can be counted on two hands and everyone that is lower level won't even be seeing them. Once everyone else reaches that level it still wouldn't matter because everyone will also be doing the same content meaning layer jumping becomes less effective.
---
These are the kind of people that leave 5 minutes late but drive like an asshole to get there on time.

If this wasnt a lvl 26 sword that you would just end up replacing in a few lvls then yes i would say the hunter shouldnt roll on it but while you're lvling you shouldnt be overly upset about losing rolls on gear
---
Dont spec ret. Holy is fine for leveling. In fact, Holy does more damage than ret becuase there's minimal difference between 5/5 imp SoR and seal of command. Consecration also does a TON of damage that ret just doesnt have. Holy leveling is fine. Take 5/5 STR, 5/5 iSoR, and conse, then after that work on healing talents. You have higher DPS than ret, but higher downtime for mana. In 5ms, you can heal in every spec until the 50s.
---
Yeah. It was an awesome experience. I was questing in Westfall when people started freaking out in General and World chat. We all rushed to Sentinel Hill and started mobilizing. It's also something special playing on an RP server. Both armies were lining up, speeches were given and when we finally started charging up, everyone went nuts. The server started lagging, players were zooming left and right, people in chat were complaining that we're going to crash the server. It was a beautiful mess all around.
---
There also weren't so many people rushing to play. We already know how layering works. We already know its implinented in the game. We already know it will be removed before phase 2. Modern problems require modern solutions.
---
Wow, if that ain‚Äôt real af

Improved Imp does 30% of your damage while leveling. Robbing your imp of mana robs your damage potential.

Just level cooking with it, makes that not even an issue
---
that's what i always do, it's got the longest cast time.
---
Most of these suggestions are just bad/useless and wouldn't have any or the positive impact you're implying they would have.
---
1. Transmog vs not is purely a preference, and some elements of what you're claiming no-transmog bring exist in the game with transmog. If you see an Xmog from the current content, or special limited time skins, you know that player did some tough shit to get it. This could be further enhanced without removing transmogs.
---
2. Purely preference again, but either way retail involves both farming gear and farming cosmetics. However it is true that there are smaller gear gaps between raiding and not-raiding, and that is actually a possible issue in retail that could be fixed, but you didn't make that your main point. . . .
---
3. 40 man raids don't make the community matter more. Flat out. Throwing more people in a raid doesn't have some magical benefit, beyond the fact that it can be more hassle to manage as a raid leader. High level raiding in both classic and vanilla requires a dedicated community outside of the game (guild, discord, whatever) and coordination to pull off. It's not actually substantially different in its social aspect at all.
---
4. Less fast travel simply means more time texting, on your second monitor, or taking a piss. Wrath did a great job of showing that making an area feel epic had massively more to do with how you actually design that area and the features in it than whether you had faster easier ways to traverse it.
---
5. Buzzwords! Jabberwocky! Perhaps there's a point to be made here, but you haven't actually said anything.
---
6. World PvP is once again, preference. It hasn't changed a whole lot either since Vanilla, which is in large part probably why it's so fucking bad. The developers never really put the necessary time, thought, and emphasis on world PvP to make it any good.
---
7. PvE. Another preference matter that's maybe more bias than meaningful difference. In world PvE not a ton has changed from retail once more. Vanilla is more time consuming, and operates on a different scale. It's very trivally easy if you only kill a few mobs and play a class that isn't just poorly balanced (looking at you warrior). Retail is also trivally easy if you play say, a paladin tank and AoE down reasonable mob pulls, but felt like mission impossible many expansions playing less powerful classes at times, like Rogue or some xpacs, Mage. Playing through world PvE in vanilla as a hunter for example, was easy. Another great example would be playing an ungeared character at BFA launch, as almost any class that was MUCH harder than vanilla.
---
You really kind of missed the forest for the ocean somehow on a lot of these.
---
Wanna know why the community was better in Vanilla? It's not that complex; servers had a relatively small limited number of people, and you couldn't group out of server.
---
You'd often run into a few names you recognized every day, because you'd actually recognize a couple hundred names in total which would be a decent chunk of the active server pop at level 60 and on your faction. Maybe close to all of them on some servers.
---
That's the whole secret, and it didn't change with dungeon finder rolling out. Instead it changed with cross realm sharding, which expanded the pool of people you'd play with to vastly beyond your ability to memorize, and made sure you'd never reliably play with any particular chunk of them.
---
Regular dungeons are actually more challenging in current retail than in vanilla, instanced pvp was the premo way to do pvp in vanilla world pvp was just for lulz and ganking people. 
---
And you're not even going to mention as a main point that one of the best parts about vanilla, specifically in terms of gearing, is that world quests don't exist, great gear for your level is notable, and tier gaps from dungeon, to raid, to higher tier raid are large. Where-as the nickel and dime approach of retail makes raid/mythic gear feel crummy. Also vanilla lacks mob and ilevel scaling, which creates a much stronger sense of progression from both gear and leveling.
---
Edit: I will note that the fact that classic has basically no rez points makes it marginally better designed for world pvp, even if the actual world pvp experience is generally just as derp.
---
LmO no hair hahahhahahahaha that dude is gonna commit neck rope one of this days for being bullied
---
I did it on my shaman in vanilla oh boy that thing used to smoke stuff with windfury.

&gt; I wonder if the success of Classic will make them realize Diablo 2 remake would also be a hit.

Pls I'm already way hyped, my body can't take this (even if I so wish for it ;____;).....

I played warlock all through vanilla wow and it was so much fun, especially the questing and class-specific stuff. If you feel like a demon-summoner, don't think twice about rolling lock. I haven't spent much time as a mage, but I feel like you'll know if you're about that 100% magic life. You get the best AoEs, usually the biggest crits, and you die quicker than I think any other class. So they both cast fire, but would rather have that with a side of arcane &amp; frost? or with shadow &amp; demons?
---
They have a personal tank and can get by pretty well even without their personal tank
---
dude, dont tout diablo 3 as something to be proud about. Yes we got something, with the soul sucked out then thrown into a septic tank.
---
hunter weapon if ever I saw one
---
I agree! Scroll through WoW, scroll through OW/D3/SC/Hearthstone then all those people AFK or in app, THEN your server friends. I think they should show only server friends with the UI, then add a tab or something to show all your other bnet friends
---
Wait has it been a year. Fuck, I'm only level 18!
---
get rekt
---
You don‚Äôt use the imp with a drain tank build you use the succubus
---
Why no spoiler warning?
---
Was agreeing with you till you said that lol. Just because they can only wear cloth doesn‚Äôt mean they get first dibs. If 2 people need it then 2 people roll. It‚Äôs early game so almost anything is an upgrade. Should he have stolen the weapon? Prob not. But if something drops that‚Äôs better stats for me than what I currently have and is cloth on my rogue you bet I‚Äôm gonna roll for it
---
It's at least 200g from the quests alone and that's not counting Arcanite bars.
---
Thank you for the positive comments! I'm gonna start playing it cause I'll regret it if I don't I feel like

Dead.
---
Fantastic video
---
Ay, thanks mate! That soothes me, would hate to get banned just because I'm playing from me birds place. Hope you have a marvelous time in classic!
---
You make the Horde proud, son. Kill those Gnomes dead.
---
BleuxMe gang. No queues since like day 3
---
so people over level 50 can't party up together unless they're in the same layer? that's not a simple solution
---
Alliance cities def better. I respect your choice. If you have tried ou alliance you aren‚Äôt missing anything
---
Then you'd just use that to swap layers and farm rares.
---
It's absolutely not perfect, but I agree that the TBC and beyond route is folly. We already know how it turns out and it's quantifiably not classic, so just make Classic+
---
Depending on your "endgame". If you are a newish player and are not planning for super high-end content, druid tank will not be a problem in any way. For some more higher end content, druid is not so viable (still perfectly viable in most fights or as an offtank in these specific fights), but for anything below Tier 2, I'd say it's 100% viable and after that 90% viable.
---
Disclaimer: I do not have any numbers or sources to prove this, but this is kind of a general consensus
---
Stop! I logged out! I dont deserve to be haunted by my class choice outside of the game!
---
Yeah, fuck Blizzard. I'm only still subbed here because of Nostalrius (Inb4 what's that). Fuck Blizzard for condescendingly shitting on those who were passionate about classic WoW for years, then destroying the fan alternatives to their garbage fucking game, destroying lives in the process with legal fees and then going full wishy-washy with "Oh we've SAVED classic WoW" after mauling it's community by having people pay fifteen goddamn dollars a month for an experience we were already getting for free. Fuck them. I hope this shit dies so we can have classic WoW private servers again.

Dude the layers are packed as is. Having 100 people farming 10 different mobs that spawnIn a small area that may or may not drop 1 quest item is horrifying. Can you imagine if they didn‚Äôt do the layering right now? I‚Äôm Half tempted to think that anti layer people are actually pro retail, just griping to cause dissension in the classic community. There‚Äôs literally zero reason to hate layering at this point.
---
I was just joking about the healing rotation for holy pallies
---
Yeah my usual playlist is nowhere near these songs but sometimes you just gotta go full immersion :D
---
Dude, no
---
Bye.
---
I‚Äôve read that. Between being a husband/ father gamer, and of course work, I‚Äôd love to say that I‚Äôll be a hardcore raider, but realistically my time will prob be spent PVPing and PUGing raids.
---
It‚Äôs mainly the cooking quests that will make collect actually cooking ingredients.
---
Cool story bro. Can I have your stuff?
---
Awesome. I‚Äôll give that a try soon. Thank you
---
I sell whatever bags I can make on the AH, never had one not sell. I'm looking forward to selling my Woolen Bags

But once you find one, oh it's so good. You now have new bff's for the next hour and half

Meanwhile, as people dungeon cleave through as many levels as possible to avoid the packed world. . . .

Im so happy WowItsHard is back to doing content. His MoP arena videos are the single best wow pvp content ever made to this day. I suggest everyone watch those animations too.
---
Exactly. Don't stress yourself out. A majority of us work for a living and have responsibilities beyond that.
---
Of course you shouldn‚Äôt *need* to, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called an exploit.
---
I see what you‚Äôre saying about it not making sense, ultimately the point I was trying to make is that the reason they implemented layering is because of the fluidity it provides, locking players to a layer defeats that purpose.
---
All I hear when I see this is MOUSTACHE sung by Team FourStar's Vegeta.
---
The one asshole in the game? Lol dude give us a break
---
Its because all looking ugly af. Later at 60 it will be even more ugly and people with raid sets will be looking as gods. Love it
---
This is what I was saying when people were all upset over the LFG addon that was broken before the game went live. 
---
It's better than sitting in chat spamming "LF tank" for an hour.
---
But #NOCHANGES I guess.
---
Went with my original plan of warrior. I just feel more engaged as melee I think.
---
That would be a really good idea. Unfortunately my blacklist is just my ignore function, then I just have to remember who I‚Äôve ran with on my friends list. Hopefully some smart fucker makes this a real thing
---
I want Activision and Blizzard to split because the Activision part is no good for Blizzard's part and I like Blizzard as BlizzardEntertainment without the Activision part. Activision is worse company next to their even the worse competitor ElectronicsArts where I hope they change in the coming months.
---
Leveling, dungeons and raiding , PvP. 
---
That's pretty much all the checkboxes for a good class overall. Something like mage is great at leveling, dungeons and raiding (DPS), and versatility in dps.
---
A class like shaman is pretty good in all those categories apart from raiding really, but you'd have one for the totem buff iirc.
---
Classes like druid pretty much suck at raiding, kind of ok at dungeons, PvP there are better options.
---
Obviously, there are classes that clearly outshine others based on those categories. And obviously, I'm not giving a commentary on what one may find fun or not. Not to mention classic wow class designs mostly last rotations, and honestly it's quite boring imo. Rogue has a real rotations I suppose.
---
&gt; Vanilla is perfect 
---
Then you say it's a pretty good game ??? So you are just being hyperbolic. 
---
If you don't enjoy raiding, or pvping, don't do either. That doesn't mean they shouldn't add aspects in that add to this area. It just means they should add more to other areas that people focus on.
---
What the guy below said ;)
---
Ok that's what I was asking cuz I dont have current wow stuff but i knew token existed.
---
My least favorite is people running Stocks that thing they're running BWL. Constantly losing their minds over the smallest things. My buddy let fort fall off for like 2 minutes last night. No wipes. No adds. Just forgot fort. Tank tore into him. He didnt get fort for the rest of the run.
---
Joke posts aside, I could have swore they removed the ability to wall jump. I havent been able to get on top of SW gates

---
These probably aren't bots but just people using AH addons that make mass bidding easy.
---
No, I don't, that's why I'm asking.
---
I've had every stack of light leather sell very quickly, I've sold maybe 10-12 stacks.
---
Thank you, I appreciate it
---
Why? In the future leveling will be far easier as you'll have all sorts of benefits when other level 60 characters can boost you with gold/gear/BoE things. Further buffs to players and nerfs to mobs will also make it easier. If anything this was the first and only time there was a fair playing ground, and this guy beat all the competition.
---
Dont have retail version. RIP lol
---
Can i write it down ingame ?! Thanks
---
In fantasy land, sure. In practice, very few people will know of this or remember these people. I doubt OP even remembers the name at this point.
---
Man i have a labor day beach trip im on. I played a bit the first week, but now im sitting here waiting for my kid to wake up from his nap so we can go back to the ocean. I know im going to log in and it will be alts or other people behind me, and that is ok. Growing up with mmos i remember so many guys and girls with kids they neglected and i swore i would not be like them. I know my limits and am having a blast even though i am a lvl 9 mage and 8 priest. Do you OP
---
Just read on a couple of "wow classic warrior leveling guide"s and they should include have a talent spec. 
---
While a talent reset can become costly, is the mechanic is the same as vanilla then it goes as follows. Resets get more expensive by 5 gold each time you do it: 1/5/10/15.../50 g  if I recall correctly. There is a "cooldown" period of one **month ** after which the respec price drops 10 g. 
---
People usually respec a lot at higher levels when they are doing different content on two different specs. You shouldn't need it while leveling. Just make sure you level the right talents :)
---
Dont have BfA sadly.
---
My ignore list fills up so quickly with people like this. My favorite one to hate has to be the "Dude who waits for you to aggro the mobs so he can slide in and take the quest objective, thereby forcing you to do the work all over again because the item respawn with the group." Then they just fuckin bounce. Thatll be the same guy later on that joins your dungeon group and leaves at some random point because THEY completed THEIR quest and so fuck the rest of you.
---
It's also classic in the sense that you have lesser heal not hot keyed but mind control is üòÇ
---
Especially when you just get into dungeon finder and start spaming at lvl 15 and mobs are your level regarding what happens
---
&gt; Using chat as a means of LFG for quests is very, very slow and rarely leads to forming actual groups.
---
My experience does not show this. Maybe because I'm on Herod.
---
Something need doing?
---
Don't pull orange mobs
---
BFA doesn't exist shut up
---
It's not bybassing. I'm not able to play, and I'm in line with other people. 
---
It's like waiting in line at a bank, while some asshole is at the teller, keeping the teller busy for 7 hours but not doing anything. 
---
Being in the queue while at work is literally no different than being in queue while doing laundry.
---
But you guys just have to hate on something don't you.
---
Y'all are funny.
---
Sounds like you're the 10 year with a name like that then having to come on Reddit and QQ about it.
---
I understand the point, but I still think this is one of the parts that helps build the community, in the sense that everyone is so invested even before the dg begins, that you will stick together, instead of leaving on the first wipe, opening the AddOn and finding an instant replace.
---
I'm not giving an argument. Anyone with eyes can correlate Blizzard dealings with Activision with their business decisions. 
---
You cannot argue that Activision actually told them to do it unless someone admits to it. If anything I'm arguing for a side against blaming Activision.
---
Wait what phase 2/3 why?
---
Oh. Blizzard starting with 10 servers for NA was definitely the original problem. 
---
I think they have allowed the servers to get to max capacity with recent patches. With the additional from the push of a button that you proclaim might cause server problems and  make servers unplayable. Also adding more layers is only a temporary fix. Once phase 1 ends and layers are shut off, the server cap goes down drastically and back to even worse queues.
---
1 hour is a great start at an improved queue time for the most populated server. If these afk-botting, or other TOS breaking systems players are using to stay in the game, are reduced more and more. The times will get slightly shorter.
---
I'm definitely not just blaming people, obviously there is blame to be thrown at blizzard. I do not think it is as easy for them to increase the server capacity as you think it is. We shall see, hopefully if they have not they can just keep adding more and more to the capacity and it will help if so.
---
1) It stops all the main complaints. Sure you can layer hop to farm as a level 45, but there's now so many that's entirely ineffective. 
---
2) Not everyone will make to 50. I'd wager most wont but even still, layering will be removed for phase 2 by the time that matters.
---
We will see how many of those full servers are still full two months from now. Also if we had low/medium pop servers now they WOULD be ghost towns in two months. It's silly to think classic will have 100% player retention. Over 50% would be amazing...
---
I understood that reference.
---
&gt; by now people may have forgotten
---
more likely a lot of people weren't born yet, we're old now.
---
LOL! I figured wand spec could wait, because I really wanted to max spirit tap because I was constantly oom. Well oh boy I should have followed guides more closely because I am absolutely nuking mobs with my wand now. Like just swp and wand and I see chunks of hp go down at a time.
---
uhm no. Not if he has uncontested farm points. Can easily have it a day after.
---
Hmmm, I did it on like day two of the game being open so maybe I started too early
---
Cat not for sale
---
Man I can relate. There is such a strong desire to play on a high pop realm with friends or to have a healthy server a year from now. I rerolled on Kromcrush Alliance. I was worried but man so far it‚Äôs a super healthy community and I‚Äôm having a blast. At peak hours it‚Äôs a 30min queue. I feel really bad for you but if you need a friend to play with on less crazy realm let me know and I would be glad to help you level.
---
Those are two separate people??
---
R.I.P English
---
another sjw owned
---
As a mage, ouch
---
Its not the group finding that is hard its the travel time.
---
Connected servers are different AF.
---
What addons and did you move frames manually? I like this look, still very much classic UI.
---
The latter. PS often made things more grindier than Classic actually was.
---
There's been one for a while now: https://f00l.de/wowtranslator.php
---
Not sure if there is a better one.
---
They‚Äôre watching streamers do it
---
Yea, i wonder why he got so few subscribers
---
The grind in the grind
---
Make sure you get the 5% hit talent in Combat, it makes a huge difference.
---
Hit is the #1 most undervalued stat on a Rogue. Most of your damage comes from white hits, and while dual wielding your hit is something in the 80%s
---
You're not getting any.
---
There are weapons that give buffs to individual gathering stats but nothing that inclusive. Don‚Äôt expect bonuses without trade offs in classic
---
!remindme in 2 days
---
Extremely dead realm, change ASAP.
---
PVP isn‚Äôt really a thing yet (outside of people low health ganking streamers), people are too focused on leveling. 
---
That said, based on vanilla, the beta, and private servers Mages are S tier PvP.
---
Orc for PvP, hands down. 25% stun resistance is really good when fighting other rogues and paladins.
---
SO TRUE, let them learn their lesson
---
Should've put the paladin in another setting, because leveling a paladin in a zone full with undead is a blast. Exorcism everywhere !
---
You should get sap at 10. If you're under 10, then you also don't have dual wield. Once you can dual wield and start getting your openers, the class really comes together. For now use backstab as your opener.
---
In the middle of fights you can also gouge then run around them and backstab for extra damage.
---
No, you need engineering.
---
As a priest I really love healing people about to die while questing, especially warriors. I love thinking what a relief it must be for them.
---
Shit I'm gonna have to download this.
---
Noggenfogger EU dances back and forth from Medium to Full depending on the hour of the day.
---
&gt; Wouldn't recommend smithing without mining.
---
What is opportunity cost?
---
Yeah this is a pretty mind numbing leveling experience as a priest
---
I think you're right, and that it shouldn't be a controversial sentiment. 
---
My hot take is that its not always good to implement feedback without an eye for overall design. Yes, Blizzard evolved with the times and largely drove changes from fan feedback, but IMO that feedback ultimately produced an inferior product.
---
I dont think they even care. Not as much as you I see
---
Sounds like he has the opposite of Little Man syndrome. Don't have to act big when you are big.
---
The gnolls won't aggro to you if you do not attack or heal him in anyway. They will just reset. (Unless they are part of the same social group) but at that point you would have pulled them all from the start. Dont use any aoes. Dont heal or attack anything he pulls and you will be fine.
---
For the zones, I'd tell you to access WoWHead &gt; Database &gt; Zones, and go from there. It gives you the zone levels and you can look if there are quests for your faction

You're the wrong class to have a pet.

Over 10K players but only 7 of those are willing to tank.

I'll have time with all of the timegating
---
As a warlock, we do the same shit. I cast a couple dots, click the wand button and then look at my other screen to watch a movie or show.
---
Diablo 3 is not only a good game but you couldn't find anything else to counter my argument. Activision isn't Satan as this sub suggests.
---
Use stealth.
---
Yeah...no. No. I want to gank lowbies, so don‚Äôt put me on a layer with only people who actually have a chance to beat me, and remove me from the younglings.
---
That's mind blast not mind control xDDDDDDDDD

I have 4 weeks of PTO I have to use by EOY that don't roll over. So I got paid to play this week while still having 3 weeks left off before the year is over.
---
I think I'm glad not to have gotten a chance to reserve a name 2 weeks out and ended up on a post launch server.  Don't think a single instance sticks in my mind of rude behavior
---
TBC is just an extension and improvement upon that..
---
Joana has layers to work with now, will he beat jokereds record in a few days? I'm sure we're all anxious to see.
---
In BC there used to be a bald black human mage named Samljackson. That was my favorite
---
Lmao. Blizzard is Activision‚Äôs pet. 
---
Sad how true it is that Blizzard just isn‚Äôt what it once was when it was independent. At least we got classic.
---
It's basically impossible to remove layering now. The servers are too large and there are too many people, other than the game being literally impossible to play because of too many people, the servers would just crash.
---
I think it went way too casual with 3.3
---
All of a sudden you had 3 new 5-mans that completely invalidated every raid except for ICC. That's unacceptable if you want content to last. The only reason it wasn't as dire of a problem was that they knew they were going to release Cataclysm, so it's not like ICC would've lasted forever.

As a warrior I feel personally attacked

I'm pretty low level right now. 18. Going to try to do RFC and WC with a couple of friends if they log in.
---
Every speedrunner uses game mechanics in unintended manor for personal gain. Just look at all the method people who are 20 levels behind yet still abuse logging in and out to reset instances.
---
That's why you gotta immolate first dawg
---
Okay then.

Why don't you stop ignoring the fact the hunter benefits more from the staff than casters do?

Leshraque already admitted to account sharing with his brother. It's on his stream. It's against the TOS and Blizz should investigate it and put him back to level 1.
---
From WC3
---
Thankfully queue times on my server are only about an hour now during peak
---
Y‚Äôall really are tripping lmao
---
The better balance is to start with a Fireball and finish with bolts. You get nice burst up front and more mana conservation and faster casts to finish off. Most Mages will say to only bolt however, the math doesn‚Äôt lie, it‚Äôs better. I still like mixing it up.
---
Who would have guessed that FloppyGrandmaTitties would create a name in wow classic that some people would take offense at?
---
At the very least. Potentially even better than that.
---
You aren't even in combat with the gnolls he was pulling . Just make sure you don't touch his mobs with aoe and he can kill mobs ontop of you as much as he likes . They won't touch you
---
The world came alive üòÄ
---
They just have it easier because all classes other than paladins and mages have to pay almost 100g for their mount when they hit level 40. For a lot of people this means having to think about saving money from a very early stage.
---
As paladins and warlock get their mount completely free of charge, they have more freedom to spend money on skills, professions and gear while leveling 1-40. Neither of them *get* more money than other classes, but they both have a lot more freedom in how they wish to spend it while leveling.
---
The reason why I suggested hunter and mage for high level gold farming is because hunters can solo farm Dire Maul Tribute runs, which earns them a lot of money if they repeat it again and again, whereas mages can AoE farm different mobs in Dire Maul. These are both extremely good gold farming methods that are completely unreliant on the current AH market, and completely free from competition from other players.
---
In PvE you will only be brought if you have one of two axes acquired from BS.
---
Even then, your spot is not guaranteed as the debuff the axes apply can be applied by any wielder, some would argue hunters are more fit. You will also be there not to deal damage but to totem twist to help warriors and rogues do more damage.
---
In PvP enh is fun but is 100% dependent on RNG as the main source of damage is wind fury procs. 
---
For pve as a shaman you are almost forced to go Resto in pvp elemental is the better of the two dps specs.
---
Any other shaman questions lmk!
---
VERY rng and gear dependent, but a very fun class if you enjoy RNG. The class is much more melee autoattack centric, and most of your time is swinging your weapon and throwing totems/ shocks. Windfury is satisfying in vanilla and can proc OFF ITSELF, hence the 2h pvp memes one shotting every class when the dice roll just right. However, due to low threat management, enh in pve isnt a problem due to damage or mana, but WF spiking threat for tanks to deal with. It's totally viable and a great support class to boot, but you have to enjoy the idea of auto attacking and praying for procs, as the class has relatively little uptime for spells or rotations outside those totems and shocks. Some people like myself love procs and rng, some people hate it.
---
I killed you in the STV arena day 2
---
Bought a 1 month to try it and I love it so far! My going-away party for Uni was last night with my friends, White Claws, WoW, and Battlefront II jedi dueling was had. Going to enjoy playing this!
---
A rogue going whole hog even should never pull aggro off a warrior tank with &lt;=3 mobs. Also threat meters only work if everyone in the party has them

4 warriors and a priest is the superior library farming group

Is WoW Classic free to download and play? If so, I'm going back in and playing my Undead Warlock or Dwarf Hunter instantly. If not, then I'm going to cry and wonder why Blizzard hates us.
---
Also, if you see someone that is the same class and a higher level. Inspect them to see their gear. Look up the items you think you want for yourself and see which quest gives them. That'll point you in good directions.
---
Indeed.
---
The counter argument is that since it's more difficult to find someone for a group, you're likely to make an effort to help them out, talk to make things better, and won't just kick when they make a mistake. Lfg makes it so easy to find people, that you don't matter to the group. Obviously this ends up making tanks super popular lol. Esp warrior tanks if you're good.

She finally decided to start cheating on you now that you're distracted

Okey Thanks. Im only lvl 13 tough. Ill check up Wands on the AH :)

no it's half the joke

Thats awesome! Welcome to Azeroth:)

Yeah, but if current results are anything to go by, the solo hunter grinders will have no chance vs jokered when it comes to /played time either.

I have 15g at 24. Bags sell, man

Of course they have.

They went from wanting to make money by creating great games that would make people want to buy those games and support the company, to a company that wants to make money by creating as addicting skinnerboxes as possible, with as many exploitative microtransactions as possible to ensure that they milk each customer as much as possible.

The daggers in BS are not great but they are something if you HAPPEN to get enough mats by the time you can use them.  I wouldnt opt for that as a rogue myself.  Maybe herb/alch or LW but generally Engineering is BiS profession for all classes.

Haha. I remember doing the exact same thing to a friend while we were having a LAN party in 2005-2006. He went to the bathroom and I traded a super valuable purple BoE to myself. When he realised it was missing he absolutely freaked out. He was almost to the point of smashing his keyboard when I fessed up.
---
And no, I was never intending to keep it, it was just a joke
---
Idk, I don't really care about it either. There are so many ways to min-max your /played. It isn't interesting to me, but the WF race is something entirely different.
---
People compared this /played to Joanas record back on Vanilla. It's entirely different and not really comparable tbh. That was my point.
---
I'm a new player! Well, I have a level 50-something in retail, but I was just mindlessly soloing everything then got bored. I'm level 15 now and really enjoying it! Having to party up actually makes you interact with people and you feel a lot cooler running around with a death squad after dying alone again and again in Westfall.

Start it off with White Rabbit mixed with LBJs speech about stability in Indochina.
---
It ramps up a lot 30-40. Ive gotten about 10 gold 30-32.
---
But I still expect to do some grinding at the end.
---
Just a bit more of detail. I use a MBP Touch 2017 ( i5, dont remember model ). It runs on 2880x1800 on settings 4 at 60FPS most of the time. Drops on fire usually, because of the particles/res combo.
---
Theres no trial to play classic, so you need to buy a subscription in order to play
---
You need to have a sub. No money, no classic.
---
Could consider playing a Pserver while you wait. A few stil out there that are classic/tbc based and bug free so you can get the same enjoyment (just wont have the population).
---
The error shows up whenever the targeting is attempted, regardless of whether it would've been successful. It's definitely not possible in classic. Other implementations might be (like the one from wotlk npcscan maybe) but I'm not gonna port other people's addons to classic.
---
Dead server smh
---
Dammit. Thanks for the assistance.
---
I command my voidwalker to ‚Äústay‚Äù within packs of mobs, while I observe from a distance. Spam tab and attack a mob when they respawn - profit!
---
People get nostalgic for fond memories and good experiences. No one gets nostalgic for shitty wastes of time.
---
"Nostalgia" is not a slap word.
---
Yes, the game is good. Is it a perfect scenario that the best MMO released in 10+ years is a 15 year old game? Not at all. But it is what it is.
---
He didn't level professions either I believ. That's a big money saver right there.
---
you have to add game time to your account/ buy a subscription
---
For me I think it's fantastic. I was a bit skeptical as well if I will enjoy going back to vanilla gameplay, but it's so much more fun than retail wow. I haven't missed any of the quality of life changes yet.
---
The shaman one is too accurate. You're either doing low dps or high burst dps. No in between
---
I AM LOOKING FOR CODY ON MOGRAINE - I WILL TRADE THIS FOR CODY ON GOLEMAGG
---
Yup! It‚Äôs stupid annoying. It takes either 2-3s for damage to actually proc on agony or corruption
---
It's the closest thing I can do to buffing people as they walk by.  For real though I like to help random people kill a few mobs when they give me a buff.
---
Unless they expand the capacity for that server immensely (which they won't), there will always be ques. You said it yourself: it's a streamer server and most of NA can't play unless they seen it first on ttv
---
Should have had the greyed mob reaggro back to lock after the mage tagged it.
---
Even easier, you could do something like:
---
/cast [mod:shift, @targettarget] Mind Blast (Rank 5); Heal
---
I'm not at my PC atm, but that should cast Heal on your current target when normally activated, but will cast Mind Blast on your target's target when you hold shift when activating it.
---
Things go so much faster when people don't try to rush things doing excessive pulls that lead to mana depletion halfway through the pull... It's like they're wasting time trying to save time. This combined with insisting on killing the azbsolute minimum amount of NPCs ensuring people who die meet patrols is usually a recipe for frustration.

It's fixed now but please report bugs on the github issue tracker. It's getting too confusing when I'm getting bug reports on all of reddit, curse, github and even by mail.

Hasn't using company names always been treated as impersonation and resulted in at least a forced name change? (And in cases of impersonating a Blizzard employee, that's a paddl...banning)

---
Oooooh, yeah!

&gt;WoTLK was the clear starting point for WoWs death
---
ok i'm not reading further you're clearly a monkey
---
Oh good the right click reporting is working.
---
Inject some WoW into my vein
---
Yes it's good. The "arguments" you use against it here are just that it isn't easy. Not having your mount until level 40 doesn't make it worse, it just makes it harder.
---
And it's not just "grinding and walking". You can grind, walk (or swim for that matter) around, quest, do dungeons, do PvP, RP or whatever fits your taste.

You should be able to likeopt in to TBC if they are going to bring it in next down the line. Then people that want to stay in classic can. Then the people that opted in can just continue on.
---
EU - Golemagg - I'm 22, British.
---
Got a few 10+ characters, I want to level a Warrior Tank but, not alone.
---
Anyone starting a new character on Golemagg and wants to do quests together? 
---
We'll chat on discord and play some days of the week, preferably in the morning to dodge the queues.
---
The transition from Elwynn to Westfall sucks. You finish Elwynn and you're 10, *maybe* 11. Which is good for like, 1 or 2 quests in Westfall. 
---
For the first time, I leveled a Nelf, and did Teldrassil&gt;Darkshore. It is so much better than Elwynn&gt;Westfall. You finish Teldrassil at like 12, 13, and there are plenty of quests to start you with in Darkshore. I quested in Darkshore until I was 15, went and did Westfall to 18, then back to Darkshore. I'd rather be 1 or 2 levels over a zone so I can actually handle multiple mobs, instead of 1 or 2 levels under a zone, where if I get two mobs on me I'm dead. 
---
I see so many people struggle with this, it's insane.
---
What does that do exactly?
---
I'm starting to understand why so many people complain that there aren't enough quests in the game.
---
I want Chuck Norris jokes like the old days.
---
There're things that you don't need to try to know they're bad. Achievement exists in virtually every game now including simple puzzle games on iphone. Almost universal. It's nothing but a strategy that businesses adopted to increase their sales by getting you hooked. Those goals they set regulate your behavior in the game. Without your awareness, you play the game in a way they WANT you to play instead of what you like to play. If you want a sense of accomplishment, all the gears, recipes and titles I mentioned are self-evident proofs, you don't need certificates from BLZ for those.
---
I'm pretty sure 13 is the first level you can use it.  It's a significant upgrade.

Well, now we know who gonna get trade invite once you fish The 1 Ring out.
---
LFG is fraught with issues but it isn't even the primary cause of the problem you're identifying. The lack of closed server communities caused that. Once cross server went in it was the beginning of the end.
---
What about best in slots endgame?
---
No way it is nostalgia.  Today was first Saturday after many year, I woke up early just to play Warcraft.  Never felt like this in all those later extensions. My EPL morning will get replaced with wow classic.
---
No idea. Corporate greed? Because they would want you to purchase one subscription per person, and not share it with multiple people.
---
They do
---
Nope, the struggle is real.  Need a new weapon every 2 levels or you might as well be using a pool noodle
---
Thats the plan atm. So much maintenance with this class ,(pet ammo food) but its so much more fun than pally like i was back in the day.
---
They did it in vanilla too. Its just tugger most brain dead way too do damage.
---
This is true. Tanks = force disk. Especially enjoy this one
---
I know this thread is 3 days old but it's still at the top for hot topics, SO-
---
Duing my main with my fiance, tomorrow is my day off but not his so I have a whole day to play but I can't lvl my Hunter. After I futz with Tradeskills, which alt should I play? Feral Druid, Fury/Arms? Warrior, Shadow Priest, Prot/Ret?Paladin. Should I take advantage of the fact that strangers are grouping  up and go for Warrior or Paladin or go solo with the Druid or Priest? I'm all for being a tank or dps, never a healer if that matters.
---
I'M SORRY
---
Unfortunately Ret paladins are pretty much a meme on vanilla. They are one the worst DPS specs and bring very little viability to a raid.
---
Shadow priests are okay, but in MC there are only 8 debuff slots and shadow‚Äôs main purpose is to apply the shadow damage debuff to bosses to increase the damage of your warlocks. Ret pally‚Äôs can use a crafted weapon that does something similar to help increase the damage done by your party members. As a class both do lackluster damage and are more support bots than pure dps classes. Unfortunately because of the 8 debuff slots most raid groups will want you to heal until BWL when 8 more debuff slots get added. At that point shadow becomes sought after if a raid has 4+ warlocks and Ret becomes a little more viable, but still outclassed by rogues and warriors.
---
Lol. Notice how the thread says it only has 1 comment, since my 12 reposts were when the servers were down and when I deleted them, they reduced comment count
---
It is however, worth noting that mages are S tier for group PvP, partitularly organised group PvP like premade BGs. This is due to their control and burst allowing them to cc a healer on-command and then delete a target. 
---
I personally don't think their that great for solo play (maybe A/A- tier). Rogues can global them if ice block is off CD, they're hard-countered by locks and spriest and a hunter will blow them up if he can initiate from range and keep the mage out of his dead zone (made easier by hunter's ability to track).
---
Theres 2 reasons, watching streamers and trying to top damage meters. What they dont realize is streamers groups are designed to AoE grind, most groups in reality are not and damage meters are pointless for AoE damage.
---
I just can't decide between druid and warrior. I've been leveling both and I only really plan on doing PvE content rn, maybe raiding, lots of dungeons. 
---
Simply put I seem to enjoy tanking as a warrior lot more than druid, but I like leveling as a druid + the prospect of healing, cat form. Also people keep talking about how king warriors are endgame especially in raids so that's something I keep thinking about, too, though I don't think I'd have a problem healing on the druid. But unless druid tanking gets better cause I'm only 21 I might just keep lvling both and get a feel.
---
Same because I don't have time to hope I'm going the right way. That's not the part I enjoy about the game
---
I left on a family vacation Monday when it launches and will be coming back this Tuesday which is when I will start.  I'm hoping by then I will have minimal queues

What the hell is this "thrown into random layers constantly" bullshit people are talking about. Has not happened once to me, unless it was while I was traveling with no mobs around, then it didn't matter anyway.
---
Intentional layer hopping is cause for concern, but the "thrown into random layers constantly" stuff just seems to be delusion.
---
Layering has not effected me negatively in any way, just like I didn't think it would.
---

As someone who used to frequent the tinder sub when he was a goofy college freshman, every single post where the guy seems oddly belligerent and trolly are using a fake profile of some Instagram model.

Stop making stupid names. Judging by your reddit username though that isn‚Äôt going to happen.
---
For dungeon tanking bears are equally as good as warriors. Bears have much better AoE threat than warriors do and a much bigger health pool which can take a load off your healer.
---
Warriors were the kings of tanking in Vanilla because until patch 1.11 Innervate was the 31 point talent for Resto Druid. Any serious raiding guild would not take a Druid that didn‚Äôt have Innervate talented because it was so important to give to the priests who were the main healers back in the day. Once Innervate became a baseline spell for Druids, Bear tanks were totally viable. We‚Äôre on a patch that has the final talent trees. Innervate is a baseline Druid spell. Bear tanks are amazing in dungeons don‚Äôt listen to the haters.
---
And I‚Äôm not even biased. I played a warrior tank in Vanilla and am playing a rogue/priest now
---
We want you to have the original vanilla forums experience!
---
I had the exact same reaction as when I was 12 years. Pure amazement.
---
Apparently changed in 1.12 https://wow.gamepedia.com/Pick_pocket#Patches_and_hotfixes
---
So the Garrot macro doesn't try to pickpocket either? Does pickpocketing without a macro work in combat in Classic?
---
Was thinking that Backstab macro works because you use when unstealthed and pick pocket isn't available, but if pick pocket works in combat this explanation might not be sufficient.
---
It's not a story the blood elves would tell you.
---
Well for me that doesn't make a difference as I don't tend to kick people and will tough it out to the end unless there is no hope, even on retail. 
---
But LFG doesn't do that in general. Cross realm groups and more convenient dungeon tools makes it so you don't matter. Because you can easily find a replacement when there are 5+ servers to draw from, or all you waste is a few minutes on doomed key or something. With Classic, you have the walk there, the hour long dungeon and being stuck on the same server with everyone else so your reputation is on the line if you are a dick.

That's how I play now and i like it. I come online when I can and play as long as I can. Just enjoying the game at my own pace is actually fun to do. I dont have the feeling I'm missing out on anything by not rushing to 60.
---
Probably. Everybody seems to want to be on a server that is magically always high population but no queue, of course without layering.  I'm glad to see that WoW players haven't gotten any less demanding over the years
---
WHile I initially thought that this was a brilliant option, it unfortunately negatively impacts players in that layer. Imagine release but not it's in a level 50 zone. WHen EVERY level 50+ player is trying to do a zone at the same time there would be issues.  
---
However just limiting layers to level brackers would be a big step to solving the problem. There however would need to be leeway for level 49s to group up with level 50s without then reintroducing yet another layer they can swap over to for potential abuse. I'm sure you could work out a nice tidy forumla to best represent how this could work, but I've just woken up and I've only had 2 sips of coffee. So maybe later.  
---
All in all:  
---
Pros -
---
Stops a fair amount of abuse of layering considering all players after the same packs and rares will be competing all of a sudden.
---
Will be effective more so earlier on as there will be less people in the higher level layers and thus squash the amount of layers needed to hold them.
---
Cons -
---
You need to work out how level 48s and level 52s can group without negating the point of these layers entirely. Couldn't a level 50+ keep joining with his lower level friends to go to their layer? Can't stop boosting for normal players to squash layer hopping behaviour.
---
World PvP would be affected majorly.
---
Possibly a lot of resources to put this into place for 4ish months.  
---
Overall, I like the solution as an idea, but in practice I don't think it does what it needs to in a good enough way to be the option that's used.

If I remember correctly back in the WoW launch days it hardly used any data, like 50mb both ways total for 8 hours of play.
---
I read there were hackers in the custom channels that will steal your login info - best to avoid them.

Na layering is to separate a million people being in one area to increase server stability. It has no effect on the server cap.

Embarrassingly, I'm a frost mage. :( my fatass pulls everything after I used frost nova.
---
That would work today, but won't work when more of the server is 50+, and there literally are no 50+ mobs alive anywhere in the world b/c of the massive population. 
---
We need layering until the pop dies down. It's really that simple. There are other solutions, like limited layer hops like the OP suggested.
---
Dont worry, by this photo i can tell you that he is a filthy casual

---
It won't hurt and you can make money at max level selling food
---
Facts
---
uh no. You are. Armor type means literally nothing in classic but for tanks.
---
Exactly. Blizz made a big mistake. Not saying they did it on purpose, or that they are evil, and I‚Äôm not insulting them, they obviously just underestimated the hype and the launch was not as good as it could have been.
---
Especially the fact that when the first batch of servers were announced all the hardcore guilds committed to one of those, so the early servers will have all of the no lifers who won‚Äôt reduce play time much going forward. I can‚Äôt possibly imagine a future where they can remove layering on Faerlina. So many guilds are on there and they won‚Äôt leave. If there were more east coast PvP servers at the first announcement they may have split up.
---
Now when a new player in a couple weeks starts playing for the first time after they hear about the hype, they will of course choose a server without queues. So the first servers will just always be a bunch of hardcore players who got in early, and starting zones will be totally empty. The realm average level will be ridiculously high, and anyone joining the server will get ganked so fast. Meanwhile lower pop servers will have a healthy balance of new and old players.
---
It's not biting the hand that waters, you turned it into a transaction. From that moment on it's a consumer issue.
---
This is backwards and stupid thinking. Just because Blizzard created a problem, does not mean that the people compounding the problem shouldn't be penalized. It's Blizzards game, the problems they create will be worked on and solved when they deem it necessary to fix them. DEFENDING people that are only making those problems worse is the most ignorant and backwards thing I've ever heard.
---
Oh those damn Orc Rogues, tank range pulls and LOS the pack. Rogue start going ham straight away which means Blood Fury, I refuse to spend most of my mana keeping him alive and then the rage starts while me and the tank just look at each other and shrugs.

Wait until they get older and you buy a second setup just so you can play together. Then feel like an asshole when you don't wanna play Minecraft with them for the 10th day in a row.

Can a 5-person group do a wing in under (...math) 118 minutes (30√ó(7/5)√ó1.4√ó2)? If so, they'll get more XP. I've always disagreed with running dungeons for XP after you've completed the quests for them, though.
---
(I can't confirm that XP is halved in a raid group; it should be easy enough to test for anyone actually playing the game, just convert a 2-person group to a raid and see how it changes XP.)
---
&gt;their mythic raid team lmao
---
Yeah those would be even slower xD

&gt; they are very autonomous from each other

Knew a guy who worked there.  Said it was once true but the more time passed the less true that became.  At least in terms of behavior, he said that atmospherically it became eerily similar
---
My guild on Thunderfury alone has over 700 members. That's one guild. 3000 players per server is just silly at this point in time.
---
Yeah, it's just a coincidence that since Activision took over every single dev at Blizzard who cares more about game quality than bottomline and microtransactions has been chased out.

It's weekend, all MMOs and to some extent online games turn shit when weekend warriors join the party. The atmosphere is much more nastier, there's a lot more spam and aggressiveness in the local chat, people are more rude, more in a hurry and will behave as jerks if it can save them a couple seconds, they'll ask for obscene dps for some random lvl 20 instance and so on. It'll get better on Monday!
---
Twice now I've been fighting a named mob for a quest and someones showed and stood there while I died, then took the tag.  One of them even **spammed laugh at me the whole time**.
---
Go post about it on tumblr
---
You won't need it but it could help, and you'll want it later anyway. Make your own judgement about that.
---
Gave him 18 waters first without asking anything, aita?
---
Yes you can parry with 1hand + shield. And regarding stat priority, parry is better than block rating. Parry is also slightly better than dodge because parrying hastens your next auto attack while dodge only avoids the damage.
---
We're back to the old vanilla rules:
---
If the healer dies it's the tank's fault. If the tank dies it's the healer's fault. If DPS dies it's their own damn fault and fuck it just replace them because there are a hundred more waiting to take their spot.
---
If you need it, press "need."
---
Nice.
---
Hogger is the first raid
---
You can also /join world
---
A mid 20s warrior tank can gain upwards of 15% dmg reduction from the armor of a shield alone, not counting blocks.
---
Some do, it depends on the class/bracket they are running. Just for like Mario bros they have a dozen or so brackets, warpless, no glitch, no ending, no turbo, etc. So this run will have that * of layer abuse. As for the rest of the people abusing instances resets, they all get their own *. As far as I'm concerned they are all flagrantly abusing game mechanics and need a suspension. That's the one difference between other speed runs and this, an exploit in a single player or co-op game doesn't impact others, but in an MMO it does. How does leveling faster impact the community? Access to resources, ability to control markets, ganking, loot, etc.
---
Sylvannas though.
---
You can boot someone who wins a roll and prevent them from getting their loot? That seems like a fail on blizzard‚Äôs part...
---
No there isn't, sat in queue for almost 6 hrs without dcing once. If this is happening to you, get better internet.
---
Just report them and be done with it. 
---
There is entirely too much crying and whining happening on this subreddit
---
yea i usually throw all green up regard less of suffix.  figure some disenchanters can use some mats.
---
Took a look. 2g is going for around $26. That‚Äôs crazy!
---
All wow players of any group? You‚Äôre going against your own words in this post. If you don‚Äôt want to play with them, just ignore them or switch realms.
---
That was me all last night....I never played on a pvp server in vanilla always just pve.....I‚Äôve been a nervous wreck all week playing on pvp server....

Chugga chugga chugga chugga choo choo! Pain train coming!
---
I haven't played wow in an incredibly long time and am just now sort of getting back into it with the release of wow classic and I've seen a lot of stuff about how battle for azeroth ruined the game. What exactly did it do?
---
Just ignore it dude
---
Yeah, although mage and locks are good ar CC, warrior/rogue/hunter combo are superior at clearing dungeons cause they don't need to sit down and drink for mana.
---
Huh. I had claw rank 3 on my level 16 black bear patriarch from Loch Modan.
---
The addons that have this functionality just implement a script. The Addon I know of, from the top of my head, is ElvUi, but it comes with a full new layout override, so if you want an addon just to delete greys, you can create a macro with this script. It will loop through your bags and delete any gray items. 9d9d9d is the hex code for grey color. I guess it's part of the item's name, parsed into display colors on the client side, that's why it's looking for item.name
---
Depends, if there is a leather dps in the group it would be rude.
---
Cyro is only playable at low pop times. Sucks

If your lfg in trade or world . Would that not block those invites also?

Use pet atks to tag too. Vw attks almost instantly even can out tag a wand since his movement seems to increase when hes moving to atk.
---
haHAA
---
Beeing a dick is not okey, but while leveling as a shadow priest, can usally keep up with that pace while healing, as long as i can start drinking every so often. Vanilla dungeons are usally quite easy and i rarely need to drink, unless we overextend and pull to much at a time, or  are going at a fast tempo. You really dont have to be in a correct spec to heal or tank pre 60.
---
OP is a Male Human Priest
---
Bald&amp;beard is a female Night Elf Druid. 
---
Other dude is a Male Gnome Warrior
---
Both girls are Female Mages, but the one on the top left thinks she's the better caster.
---
It's like 6 silver on AH and is usable at lvl 5, it's the single best thing you can buy for levelling, it's so op, worth it over training spells and everything really. 11.3 DPS without mana cost lol
---
I said "I believe" forgive me for being incorrect. Wtf, I'm just trying to help and this kid wants to insult me. smh

Let's be clear: no one knows!
---
Wow-noob here. Since this is warrior related, are there any pros to keep rage as high as possible or is there no difference if you keep it around 10-20 instead of 70-80? I just reached lvl 10 :D
---
Some people get really salty about losing rolls. 
---
Gotta learn to roll with the punches üòâ
---
But this doesn't take in to account the value of the item?
---
the gaming community is largely reactionary and fascist. 
---
case in point: im sure this thread will have 15 posts from people who think joking about death camps is somehow their right. 
---
just report and call them kissless virgins
---
I drink real coke all the time, its still marketed as coke classic. Coke classic has nothing to do with HFCS, but coke in cans and bottles has HFCS while glass bottles generally don‚Äôt. I live in a place where theyre practically in every gas station though so its not a problem.
---
Someone in my guild was invited to group with someone with a name of shitty Nazi officer and refused it and we reported the name. AFAIK name reports don't get much traction unless multiple people report it so I'd find anti-nazi guild or friends if you can. Report the shitheads.
---
Just what the title says, you can change gore settings by typing /console violenceLevel 5 and it makes little bloodlets come out of you and your enemies with each hit. I have only tried this with melee physical attacks so far, but it really does add a nice level of immersion and feedback on attacks animations. ENJOY!
---
Your mistake was giving him anything at all for free.
---
XD
---
Yeah ain't no one strong enough to fight those dude.
---
I am hearing this from many in the game.
---
A big portion of the private server community are nazi sympathizers so it's quite common to see things like that. On private servers it's usually a lot worse due to the lack of rules and moderation.
---
If joe blow does it I really don't think they care. But when a big streamer does it they're condoning it for the masses. That's when I think Blizzard cares.
---
I‚Äôd recommend having a look at their discord channel, they‚Äôve listed plenty of known bugs. God I miss pfUI. That shit was awesome.
---
I tried that aswell, but forgot to target the priest. I just ended up using the int scroll on myself (as a rogue) right in front of him. Really douchy
---
üëåüèΩ
---
Do you think you need to say US first if it's world first
---
Worst time in wow classic to be a healer, just so much ignorance of the mechanics.
---
RIP ur neck
---
Guess so!
---
Leveling with your primary damage being spells instead of melee, be prepared to drink a lot between pulls, both grouping and solo.
---
MVP, thanks!
---
Oh my bad. No, it does not. I read through it and understood grey items, not sorted by value. Ignore my message for now
---
This will be conveniently ignored I‚Äôm sure. All the dedicated devs have left and people have been screaming louder and louder that the game is moving away from what they want, WoW is a modern in-joke for something exceedingly simple that gives meaningless flashy prizes and Classic WoW is breaking twitch records...
---
But it‚Äôs important to remember that retail is better for unknown reasons /s
---
Have you tried the default party raid frames, they are the ones from retail which can be changed enough to look good.
---
know of any sane guilds on ashbringer that I can rally the support of?
---
Is that as holy/Disc? What about mind flay. Can't spend 5 point on wand spec, need shadow form as soon as I hit 40
---
I‚Äôm on track to hit level 20 soon and can‚Äôt seem to keep more than 50s in my pocket.
---
Am I fucked when I hit 20 as a priest?
---
You have to buy game time. Do it, it‚Äôs worth it.
---
Oh, I didn't think it was code for the color, I thought it was a simple string like you could've put "asdasd", that's why I thought there had to be the full name of the item.
---
Now I get the script, thanks!
---
Typically No. If you ask groups most don't care but just rolling on them can lead to bad times.
---
Is this what they mean by cruel and unusual punishment?
---
Yeah so my macro
---
Seems to work
---
The one I'm talking about, Greater Wand, I'm pretty sure was usable at lvl 13 but maybe I'm thinking of something else
---
I don‚Äôt really use sap. You don‚Äôt have to except in certain circumstances (like pulling an entire Gnoll camp) and even then chain resetting is probably quicker.
---
You should level Combat, it‚Äôs the best spec for leveling. Imp gouge is a life saver. If you‚Äôre getting low use gouge and bandage. Make sure you are leveling first aid, it‚Äôs as important as any of your abilities.
---
If you‚Äôre having trouble killing mobs, try to get a shot or two in with your ranged weapon. Then just SS &gt; Evisc. Go for Riposte and then throw that into your rotation. Make sure you‚Äôre using Evasion if in a bind, and **kick spellcasters**.
---
What race are you playing? And what level are you?
---
I started the new classic WoW (first played in Wotlk, played warlords++ since), and I love it. It's "free" per say, you don't have to buy a game, just subscribe monthly.
---
&gt;but the one on the top left thinks she's the better caster.
---
Made me lol 
---
Now let's see of OP deliveres to see if you're right
---
Everything changed when I switched to Deviate Delight!
---
The layering is unfortunately necessary untill the populations level out
---
**however for the long term health of the game maybe we shouldnt be telling new players to go back to retail?**
---
**what?  grow up**
---
Hey, im new to WoW. I would like to be able to do PvP and perhaps some endgame content but i have no idea what to play. Currently i have a Rogue at level 10 and im considering making a new character before i get too deep. any suggestions ?
---
Bro tag this as nsfw cause this is pornographic
---
bro üòéüí™
---
Any chick that say bro.... no thank you hoe.....
---
I had a similar issue the other day that seemed the fix itself after an hour or so. Same issue with 29 ping.
---
interesting.
---
When did I insult you? All I did was correct you, then advise if you are getting dced every 30 minutes you should get better internet. Don't be so sensitive.
---
Brilliant
---
It‚Äôs World first HORDE rogue. And US first rogue.
---
Yeah retail leveling is a mess. It‚Äôs easily the worst it‚Äôs been imo. If you play casually and slowly you‚Äôll be bored 5 hours in, and you‚Äôll stay bored for the next 100 hours. 
---
but this is also a classic wow subreddit :) so I accept my bias, lol
---
6‚Äô2 and sit back a good way it‚Äôs really a good height for me, I had it about 6‚Äù higher originally but that was too high
---
You *think* you want buffs and community, but you don't.
---
Interesting. I always though spirit was just mana regen and is it really significant enough to consider? I don't care about out of combat regen much. Am I right that you don't regen health in combat?
---
&gt;Games need annoyances that bring the players together.
---
Sure, but you need to remember that some players just enjoy exploring and doing stuff on their own. If you make it too hard for these players they'll just lose interest. This is why WoW became the way it did.
---
There is a 10kqueue for whitemaine.
---
Priests drink extra for locks, as has been tradition.
---
no it does not. Its literally pointless. In wotlk it came that it means something. In vanilla and tbc it literally means nothing.
---
I usually give them the mana pots that I seem to always have for some reason. I've found maybe 10 health pots so far and like 40 mama pots on my rogue.
---
Just re-enter your name until a GM forces it to change.
---
I made millions of gold selling carries in Legion and have barely played BFA. Does that make me more experienced and more competent than you at BFA? Experience and degrees are more similar to linkable achievements and parses than you saying ''I've been playing the game for 12 years I must be good''.
---
Same thing applies to raiding, just because I did Mythic Argus doesn't mean I know anything about Heroic Azshara.
---
no need to when you're fully epic'd out in titanforged gear from your leveling quests.
---
Nah people have said paladins are fine tanks in dungeons but they do fuck all for tanking a boss
---
I need those when playing healer and have never had someone complain yet. If they do, they are stupid imo. No one cares if the tank rolls on a nice 2h weapon. Why care if healer need on dps?
---
If it takes 45 minutes you are doing something wrong
---
When geared they are the best healers, before you are geared, they just feel bad tbh. You get so much crit you can cast double the spells of the other healers because of the talents you have.
---
Balance didn't really hit this game until BC, some classes were considered hyrbids which did everything okay, but nothing amazingly. 
---
Shamans without t1 can't main heal anything. They are brought to groups purely for totems. And paladins for buffs/auras. 
---
Paladins are pretty nice in pvp, a strong ranged stun is a great setup for any small group to followup on. 
---
I'd say if you like healing and want to commit to 60, raids will take you. If you want to tank, you will always need to be overlevelled to hold aggro. If you want to dps, you are SoL if I am being brutally honest. Ret isn't terrible in pvp, but is certainly isn't great either.
---
Or you know just release more server.
---
Don't give me the bullshit "server will be dead", private server have been doing fine without layering despite having an harder time with player retention because it's free and people leave when they want without a sub that make them keep playing.
---
The sad part is that mid 2000's Blizz would be 100% okay with that name and OP's name.
---
One button pet maintenance. Shows the tooltip for the food you are using, dismisses with a modifier key, feeds the pet out of combat or mends it in combat, feeds it the specific food from your inventory, revives if the pet is dead, calls the pet if it's absent.

---
Cool cool. Thanks!

as a hidden subtext of this quest, think of what's really going on with getting silk cloth and big giant apples...  And suddenly the robot becomes a woman...
---
yes im logging out. least you can do for calling me selfish is to give me a follow :D
---
I know what it is. I don't understand why it would be considered cancer. It seems like an efficient and lucrative way to level. Boring perhaps, but idk of I'd say it cancer.
---
Maybe i'm the strange one then, but regardless, i'm enjoying it because i've been speaking loads more with people in dungeons compared to what i used to in retail.
---
It's just, it kills my enjoyment of the game to think that half the people I'm playing with probably want genocide to happen. It's so disgusting.
---
Thank you guys, I really enjoyed following this. Maybe some of you would enjoy writing a wikipedia article about the world first race(s). I couldn't find one and I believe it should exist.
---
Just said ‚Äúit seems that‚Äù guys, chill... moreover, He‚Äôs saying that he is account sharing, live, on his stream, so even if it‚Äôs a joke, i‚Äôm saying that it seems he‚Äôs sharing... not bluntly saying that he is.
---
Ah! A man of culture I see.
---
Think someone mentioned will it classic. Com( one word).   Try there
---
all other special pets have been nerfed and are not good.
---
Hopefully these are the fuckers that will fuck off back to retail pretty soon.
---
Skinning is all about consistency. It might not be that much per item. But it‚Äôs consistent hold on every kill. At level 30 or so, a stack of heavy leather is 30s. If you start with skinning from 1-40 you‚Äôll make an extra 30-40 gold or so.
---
thanks man but I already have one

---
That's why the layering exists though, they're planning for later phases when less people are playing. I think they're going a bit overboard with it, sure, but to say it shouldn't exist at all for launch is ignorant at best.
---
Wowhead had plenty of info for you.  Macro guide on there.  All kinds of good stuff.
---
tag with immolate, but yeah still not an instant tag.
---
Appreciate it!

Unfortunately in Vanilla class flexibility isn‚Äôt very viable because there is no dual spec. You can respec all you want, but the price increases every time you respec to a maximum of 50g per respec. And 50g in classic is nothing to scoff at. On top of that, most classes don‚Äôt have multiple viable specs in early Vanilla (for PvE). Warriors are really the only class that excel at both tanking and damage. Druids are decent healers but their biggest strength is giving Innervate to Priests, and decent tanks/cats. Their main strength in tanking is their massive health pool and unmatched AoE threat. Warriors are by far the best tank, but bear tanks can handle multiple adds better than an equally geared warrior. Holy Priests are the best healers in Classic and most guilds will want you to heal, but Shadow becomes viable once we get 16 debuff slots (BWL). SPriest DPS isn‚Äôt great, but their main strength is the shadow damage debuff‚Äîput them in your Warlock group to act as a damage booster for them. If your guild has at least 4 warlocks it should have 1 spriest.
---
My first tank run of deadmines I had a mage who sheeped basically every pull. Was great.
---
Por que no los dos?
---
It's a high damage range means their melee will do a ton of damage.  The int will probably double his mana pool allowing him to dps longer.  The spirit will let more mana regen after he serpent stings and sits inside the 5s rule until the next target.  
---
The only problem here is that this is leveling gear.  Stats are different for everyone than endgame.  Stop being loot whore.  You didnt win something.  So what. Move on.
---
Got him on my NE hunter once.  Renamed him Brokentooth, taught him prowl, and spent the next 4 hours aimed shotting desperate horde hunters trying to tame a fake brokentooth.
---
At this point pretty much everyone is trying to hit level 60 off-stream, which makes our work so much harder. On top of that, a lot of people is going to hit max level within the next 24h, which makes it almost impossible to keep track off and give players their real place in the race. 
---

Correct!
---
People just need to get over themselves if you dont like someone just ignore them let people like what people like.
---
It doesnt take an hour. You could stand in front of WC and invite random people and get a group in 15 minutes
---
Wow thanks. I didn‚Äôt know photoshop had gotten so powerful that this kinda ‚Äòshop could be so easy to create.
---
Mail it to yourself and use the mailbox as a bank
---
Print screen
---
Therefore you don't scale well at all in the actual game.
---
I don't know about this. I had no problems when I was jumped by random mobs of the same level. Found leveling 1-10 to be really easy. Pet just makes it easier.
---
&gt;I case you haven't noticed, a patch was released yesterday that has made it very hard to afk-bot. 
---
Can you show me where you found these notes? Not being snide, I genuinely want to know what changes they made.
---
Yeah cuz priest use no mana to heal lol, think about it it‚Äôs the same time wait for mages to drink and for priests to drink
---
Yes, you will make less money, but you will level faster. The money you make increases substantially the higher level you are. The fastest way to farm a mount is to simply level as fast as you can.
---
As many as you want. I think its 10 per hour lol
---
Well, the regen in combat is sort of negligible sure, but if you feel you don't need it to prevent eating or first aiding, more power to you.
---
Depends on how you play though, if I'm fighting mobs of my level I tend to pull 2 or 3 at a time when possible.
---
The extra spirit plus triggering Blood Craze and Enrage makes downtime basically non existing
---
i'm even enjoying fishing/cooking when i'm chilling if my duo isn't on
---
This happening was obvious to anyone ever. Queues will probably stop in a week or two when people realize the game is too hard for them.
---
youre not really the asshole but they arent REALLY either, but i lean towards them being a little bit of an asshole because lord knows they wouldnt want it done to them.
---
The whole ad has many celebs lol
---
layering has nothing to do with queues ffs. when you're in queue you're in queue for that server, not a layer in that server. fucking really?
---
You both are. It‚Äôs just a game and spawn times are stupid fast right now.
---
Got prot. Emphasis on increasing survivability. Use shield and hammer. 
---
That will level up your 1 hander while ypu level up your one hand
---
How about a round of Gwentstone?
---
Thanks for the gullible idiot term. Appreciate. You should chill and disconnect from the game a bit, it seems that you get a bit irritated too easily.
---
Method was saying this in the beginning and I followed the stream just at the end. Was trying to answer a small post on Reddit but well, it‚Äôs hard to have a discussion with people sometimes. Anyway...
---
IMO yeah, if you "bitched someone out" over a video game I'd say so.
---
Yes but with extra layers server capacity increases so that is also incorrect.
---
Depends on the tank for me, I just finished a dungeon where the tank was basically The Mountain from GoT. I could sit there all day and he's welcome to continue tanking all the mobs without much risk.
---
Thanks! I leveled a gnome rogue a long time ago and had a blast doing world PvP because I was harder to click on, and I could hide in mobs and attack people before they even knew what was happening. I always stuck with daggers because I loved ambush on soft targets but maybe I'll have to experiment with swords for this human character. I'll still be able to control the fight in stealth anyway.
---
Learn to tag faster/better. Just because you're parked there doesn't guarantee you anything.
---
It means you have less armor.  Druid isn't getting hit so the stats are the same between all healers.
---
I‚Äôve learned the key is a quick wand. Nobody steals tags from me anymore... except druids. Damn moonfire
---
I'm pretty sure everyone noticed Hodor.
---
How could you miss him
---
Oh yes you know *wink*
---
You're right! I just see people saying they have 10+ years raiding experience or veteran player and stuff when it literally means nothing. I've raided with players who played 6 months and were really good and players who have played 14 years and sucked.
---
10/10 üëå
---
Give them time. You can only maintain weight while being malnourished for so long.
---
The only other pet with a helpful unique ability in 1.12 I can think of is the Son of Hakkar in ZG, which is the only wind serpent that knows Thunder Breath 6. It's not gonna be in the game till phase 4 though.
---
And the ones that do hit are glancing blows.
---
Yes, I figured, but he's the only one I recognized (I'm terrible at recognizing most celebrity faces).
---
But you arent doing that 8 times within 2 hrs
---
Fantastic reply, my thoughts exactly.
---
The game was in an enjoyable state a little over a year ago.  I really liked Legion, but it's because some of the mechanics were so reminiscent of old wow.  The legendaries come to mind.  Just pure unadulterated chaos.  Sure my discipline priest was useless because I couldn't get Velen's but my ret paladin got both BIS items and she took off!
---
he's not wrong, there will eventually be no queues
---
whether that's 3 years from now...
---
if you want to play without this kind of hassle, you need to switch servers. but of course you will be risking dead server SOONER than your friend's server.  which will also die eventually of course
---
*Lady Sylvanis would like to know your location*
---
UC for the aesthetics is the coolest in game. TB for it's utilitarian layout. Ironforge is pretty cool though, I'll give you that.
---
Later, BMC kinda tied it for me with UC looks wise... But that is by FAR the worst layout for efficiency and in ass fuck nowhere. "Oh don't mind me jumping through this brothel, I have to get to the FP which is outside... For some reason."
---
Go on a PvE server or go back to retail.
---
Looks like a proper 3 day weekend to me.
---
Well I agree. Fuck the streamers that ruin the game and especially the people who follow them.
---
This is epic. Activision make note!
---
SPriest becomes viable in BWL, when we get 16 debuff slots instead of 8. They act as a damage battery for Warlocks because of the Shadow Weaving (or whatever it is called) talent. Shadow Priests are significantly worse than Warlocks, but if you have 4 good warlocks having a shadow priest in group with them will be majorly beneficial
---
Wouldn't that be the same as holy paladin in your group? Like the only thing going on is he's basically a shittier holy paladin using a 2h weapon which a holy speced paladin can still use.
---
That was an option. 
---
Before release.
---
Now, it's too late. Blizzard would have to provide millions of free transfers, if they did this.
---
Thank you for actually understanding how it should work!
---
Legion was not that good. It was ok at best. Comparing it to Vwow or WOTLK is a crime.
---
Oh well there ya go don't need it for switching targets but helps with an accidental cancel
---
Im unsure if this was to the wrong comment box, or thread, or sub, or if this is the best description on how to approach tinder and not go whale hunting.
---
Legion was okay at best the green and spaceships got old fast
---
I think I‚Äôm missing something. He‚Äôs looking for a tank and you‚Äôre a dps. So they‚Äôre full on dps.. I gotta be missing something here
---
Wanna hear a great joke i heard?
---
Meh, nostalgia only, be over in a month. lmao
---
Best joke i heard in a long, long time! lol :)
---
Are you on skeram by any chance? I think I saw you in Orgrimmar a day or two ago
---
I'd like to report a murder.
---
"Stop liking what I don't like, you're wrong REEE"
---
That makes more sense. I could see the reasoning for that.
---
Get a wand first, it's gonna be worth it...
---
You can smell that room
---
Twinkle items are good BUT thats a pretty long long term one because you need the pvp and the BG scene to stabilise first before twinks will really come out in force probably. Reagents will see you making more profit in the shorter run I think. (Also you can get stacks of reagents where as you cant stack items... takes up more space obviously).
---
Especially enchanting reagents since there is no easy way to farm them compared to herbs, ores and skins... and enchanting is always the "worst" profession to level for precisely that reason.
---
Also you should probably be able to find old twink equipment guides... the good thing is they wont have changed because obviously the items wont have changed... so what was good 14 years ago will still be good today.
---
Let us know how it went!
---
Yeah sure and all that without keybinds
---
&gt;Consecration also does a TON of damage that ret just doesnt have.
---
That ability does chump change for damage and drains your entire mana pool. Really the only use while leveling is for AOE tank aggro.
---
This. Pool all your money together by 10 to get a wand.
---
Ah!Thanks everyone for the explanation.
---
For some reason I‚Äôm not having this ‚Äúunlimited power‚Äù experience that everyone seems to bark about while leveling my hunter. Maybe I just suck? But my pet never really holds aggro and doesn‚Äôt seem to do enough damage to make a noticeable difference. Maybe my expectations were just too high
---
That's a really weird justification. "I knew i was going to win, so cheating didn't matter".
---
I got sad. So I ate a popsicle. I went to put it in my mouth. I missed.
---
It's not really half. Idk about your server but I put like 10 people on ignore and it's very clean now. Assholes just clog up chat.
---
That was a CPL expansions after classic...
---
The two factions are well represented here. Shirts vs Skins!
---
I went for a not full PvP server.... yeah that‚Äôs about it
---
Had someone say it told them to go to the wrong area, so it isn't that great
---
Nice one, thanks for the answer
---
It do be like that. Get it. It does it also out of combat so the gain may slow the decay to do that 30% mathematically but im not sure.
---
Fix cables while fixing light switch cover
---
Thats only an issue if your a clicker which most players are not.
---
When the game is so hot that you have to remove your shirts:P
---
I alternate between killing and helping. Ill never camp unless its revenge.  I just like interacting with enemy players and mostly scaring the shit out of them. Approaching them with my Eyes of the Beast'd pet and making them think a mob is bugged following them around. There is lots of fun to be had. No one is ruining anyones playtime.
---
Kind of funny... my own daughter had the same event today ... her first time WoW x)
---
To be fair. I am not sober. Didn't like the title for the first one so I hid it and remade.
---
Good idea actually
---
What's the deal with hunters? They really good at leveling or something?
---
I‚Äôm leveling a rogue, and I died laughing immediately
---
Been skinning like mad!
---
I thought this was confirmed to be fixed from private servers and doesn't work on retail.
---
You know I've been in groups with some pretty bad tanks but no matter how bad they are it's always the dps who wipes you, and they'll wipe you even with a good tank.
---
Visit your class trainer already. Probably missing some spells
---
Thank god BB isn't bad. us RP server players only have ONE server, so if that had been super popular, we'd have been SOL.
---
I got a [good level 30 bow](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=15286/long-redwood-bow) that I can't use quite yet!
---
That‚Äôs the best thing to hear!
---
It‚Äôs 16 for aquatic and 20 for cat.. what I did was wait till 21 till I went on the quest to get the aquatic form because at 21 both talents for feline swiftness can be used and you‚Äôre 30% faster outdoors in cat form.. saved some time on those long runs
---
It‚Äôs 15$. 
---
You decide.
---
He‚Äôs just trolling you
---
Layering is letting us all play righ tnow. Don't worry about it.
---
Blizzard should give this guy the sword from South Park and let him be the top shit for like a month or so.
---
The whole industry has changed. People didn't charge for things back in the day the way they do today because it wasn't accepted. Not because of some moral thing, but because the audience in general wasn't comfortable with spending money online with a credit card. It isn't a coincidence microtransactions in games ramped up with the Xbox360 and PS3 generation. Those were the first consoles that provided extremely easy ways to pay for stuff online, and it was around the time it also became more acceptable.
---
Once developers learned that people are willing to pay for $1-$5 things, it is just absolutely brainless to not put these in your games. Remember, to a rational person, as long as these things are purely cosmetic, it shouldn't effect the actual playability of the game. It shouldn't effect the players that usually play the game.
---
As for WoW, I don't think purchasable mounts and pets effect anything realistically. I know mounts and pets are usually seen as an achievement of sorts, but everyone knows what the store mounts look like. It isn't like seeing the newest mount from the latest Mythic raid.
---
Wait when was the FP to rebel camp added?
---
I would suggest trying to keep it leveled  with whatever you come across. Dont go out of your way to max it
---
It's more of a PvP weapon anyway. Mainly given to warriors or rets, at least in my guild.
---
Ganked by a Furlock
---
Bunch of shirtless guys drinking and playing classic together? Why wasn‚Äôt I invited?!
---
Fairs
---
Dinged 37 last night and caught him by the fortresses after patrolling 30 mins. Right as I was using hearthstone he spawned. Today there were 14 hunters camping badlands for him... I Just need a name for him
---
Amazing. Perfect.
---
There is a serverwide chat channel
---
/Join world
---
Ah a good old GPU sauna
---
Hope so. I hit 30 tonight.
---
 I just bought that laptop yesterday!
---
1 person isnt everyone , its just your opinions sucked but thats what you get when you turn to reddit , im deleting this acc 4ever
---
Try an AOE levelling build its extremely fun. Boomies are also insanely fun to AOE level.
---
You can only trade between characters of the same faction and on the same server. It works just like sending mail to any other character - just go to a mailbox and mail it to whichever of your characters you want.
---
Its not about the money it's about sending a message.
---
Reputation amongst your enemy as a killer is very important.
---
only 6 levels below your level
---
Wow, so the last 2 levels he just switched layers to AoE grind..
---
I TRIED SO HARD FOR BEE. NOW IM BEEWITCHED ;( but twins kinda
---
Not if you go spirit tap and get the party to feed you a kill every pack. ü§î
---
your wrong
---
don't listen to him. Its true. Greens that are within 6 level don't give reduced XP
---
Aquatic form quest has a lot of traveling. I probably wouldn‚Äôt bother with it immediately until you have the speed increase talent in the Feral tree. I can identify with this post so much. I can‚Äôt tell you how many people ask for a rez or asked why I wasn‚Äôt in cat before level 20. Stay strong!
---
We demand additional lumber!
---
Not seeing a lot of people asking about ele shaman. Any good for end game raiding??
---
 First time playing WoW and it seemed like the most interesting class with the slew of buffs
---
Certain fish for cooking are only available now in the summer and are gone in the winter
---
also Shaman &gt; Paladin in Vanilla
---
It depends how much patience you have as early levels can get a bit frustrating if you don't know what you're doing, but I've run into plenty of new players.
---
Yes there may be people who get annoyed that you go too slow if you're in a dungeon with them or something, but anyone worth caring about will try to help you.
---
I would say Classic is more new player friendly than retail though when you look at the experience as a whole.
---
Imagine thinking that someone accepting a group invite and just doing the same thing they'd been doing for 58 levels is cheating. Even if he'd been doing it since he was able to start AoE grinding it would have been fine, layering wasn't available only to him, but everyone. Everyone had a level playing field.  
---
    
---
We all need to get over this, it's silly.
---
That's not a blood elf stupid idiot. Can't u see the eyes?
---
god I still don't understand how I managed to get to 60 on my warr back in the day. noob, never played an MMO, clicker, tank without understanding how treat works or even what is it, the list goes on... 
---
started leveling with my retail warrior friend yesterday, he was frustrating as hell, considering to roll something else
---
you must be new to this, you havent played in 15 years or 4ever but its obv visible you are fresh in this ...and wrong
---
It's the biggest culture-shock people have when they come here lol
---
Learn2mp5. It lines up with judgement and seal so you can pop all 3 in a chain and let your mana regen until you want to combo again. Conse lets you 2 and 3 target cleave. The damage on single target is roughly equivalent to an auto attack per cast, and when considering that judge seal spam doesn't run you OOM, there's no real reason not to use it if you have it.
---
Conse is a very, very powerful spell.
---
Those names. Only in Mulgore.
---
lol yea
---
It might lead to fun.
---
Wtf richard
---
&gt;what was good 14 years ago will still be good today.
---
I wish this applied to my face
---
There are 2 tailoring shops and just check both for the trainer.
---
Eng has some nice stuff, rocket helm and bombs in particular, but it's a gold sink.
---
Alch will at least make you money, and making your own PVP potions will save you money.
---
Eng is technically best in slot, but there are so many things you want to spend money on before PvP consumables that you can do without.
---
You really should get your professions up.  Once upon a time I was able to get 100 gold before level 40 by using herbalism/alchemy, and the majority of what I sold were swiftness potions.  There are other valuable herbs along the way (grave moss sells very well).
---
Don't go enchanting unless you like to beg in the streets of your capital cities for a little bit of money.  That profession is best served on an alt.
---
FRANKS AND BEANS
---
Same.  This solidified my attitude that threat is dps responsibility.  If I let him get one good hit in, I can give one smite.  Two smites in a row pulls.  Now, he hits once, I dot.  Then when I see the mob take a big hit, I smite.  Only once.
---
It‚Äôs nice for both of us.  He can rush from mob to mob, and I never take a hit.
---
Yeah they abused this thing called playing efficiently and not sleeping. Also, not all 40 people are level 60, you can get attuned at level 55.
---
QQ more.
---
So is it getting better?
---
Horrible UI.
---
&gt; he was already killed in classic before.
---
He hasn't been killed in classic before.
---
Why does your enjoyment depend upon what others are doing?  Just curious.  Anyway, if the thought of playing a game stresses you out, then its not a game for you.
---
Quote awesome!!!
---
These must be the people at the goldshire inn
---
It's good to be smart about it and talk to your group. Being a hybrid means you can roll on twice the amount of gear which could seem unfair to some pure specs.
---
I have a 9-5 job, wife, and daily gym/cooking/chores... had all these fantasies about crafting bags and giving them away in the first few days. Now I'm only level 10 on two characters, AH is flooded with bags. Whatever "edge" I thought I might have by starting at launch is gone. Now I see people grouping for deadmines, and gnomer, and here I am getting my druid bear form finally at level 10. 
---
Then I realize that all those people probably either don't work or took the whole week off and played all day every day.
---
You know what i mean!
---
Best thing to do for money rn is probably going to be finding high value greens/trash items with high drop rates and selling them to vendors, but avoid spending money; hs smartly so u don‚Äôt need to fly all the time, always keep an eye out for high value trash, never train spells u don‚Äôt need and throw out stuff that‚Äôs too cheap and you can get some money
---
Did you find his wife???
---
Apes is a guild that was big in a certain private server. They are legit. This could be an old screen shot of said pserver though.
---
Edit: looks real
---
You know, apart from the fact Nost, Elysium, and all other private realms are literally stealing. Most were directly selling other services too, which is a giant no-no. 
---
They reconciled that they were wrong. You fucking whiners will never be happy holy shit. You have the ability now to play on BLIZZARD RUN SERVERS, where some guy who gets pissed off wont just shut down a server and delete hundreds of hours of work. You also aren't paying for *classic* sub. Classic is included with your retail sub. if you don't play retail, that's a you problem. Not a blizzard problem.
---
Uh... you realize that hunters use their melee attacks all the time right?
---
Downvote all you like, unless you are a gold farmer you as a player don‚Äôt want gold sellers to control this. Short of eliminating gold or eliminating trade a la Diablo3 having Blizzard offer an alternative is a best case scenario.
---
More of a gold sink, harder to farm with. I rolled paladin because I can hybrid and be mediocre at everything without respecting lol.
---
Fuck that
---
You can't mitigate damage (block/dodge/parry) unless facing the enemy.  Also you can get dazed.
---
They had all ran dungeon groups. Definitely possible, they are just ultimate nolife guild.
---
It‚Äôs funny because it‚Äôs true
---
Hes all "MOVE! Youre not doing it right!"
---
Short Sweet! Hope to see more Gorak in classic man!
---
Asmon is a dedicated wow streamer while Soda is more known for variety. So when a big wow thing comes out people tend to flock to the biggest names that are known for that content.
---
Been getting a ton of XP running instances as a heally druid, and man I don't what it is about the hunter class that makes so many of them douchy morons, not turning off growl, scatter shitting/pulling extra groups, rolling need on weapons/armor that would be useful to others, etc.
---
Earlier today in WC living root staff drops.  12 spirit, 2 stamina.  Hunter rolls need and wins over a priest.  Justified it by saying it had higher DPS than his axe.
---
Sounds like the dream
---
At level 12 I died to a level 10 murlock. I missed 4 times in a row. 7 total misses in the fight. Now I'm a druid.
---
But how did activison affect WoW ? 
---
It'not like they did anything to starcraft, diablo or overwatch.
---
Esfand isn‚Äôt scared to play ret and you shouldn‚Äôt either! Just go for it
---
It hurts soooo good lol
---
Shadowed unit frames look the same and work excellently from Twitch / CurseForge
---
yeah, even my girlfriend started playing. she doesn't play games normally, but she likes it a lot surprisingly. night elf hunter though, take care guys *gg*
---
Redridge is even harder I died so many  times there today.
---
I want to know what these gold sellers are doing to have gold to sell?
---
Anal[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]
---
https://classicdb.ch/?spell=3562
---
Disagree.
---
had some allies outside wc at 12 am lol
---
Ding btw
---
Oh boy, are some people already some levels ahead of you? I think you should wait until they release fresh realms because clearly there's no way you can catch up and if you don't catch up what's even the point anymore? /s
---
It's classic WoW dude.. You can take a 1 year break and come back and it's still a good game. Chill the fuck out.
---
They are all super hardcore.
---
Exactly.
---
I wish they sold boxes still
---
Meanwhile Bungie giving Activision the double middle finger
---
How are you guys not /dancing?
---
I hope you don't pass many rogues/druids :/
---
As a hunter I just send my pet over...
---
I like it!!
---
What macro can have my lock cast fear and put my pet in passive mode? Would also like a macro that will use the healthstone and a potion at the same time. Are these possible?
---
That Chinese comment......lol WTF? The guy is European is he not? What is wrong with you.....
---
The free trial is for retail not classic unfortunately. I would suggest that you sub for at least one month and go straight to classic rather then to 20 in retail only to start over. The games while similar are also very different.
---
Double D baby!
---
Hunter also a really good starting character. Easy to play, easy to level, pretty cool mechanics with pet, and really strong in pve and pvp. Rogue is fun too but I‚Äôd say hunter is more newb friendly :)
---
Queue party
---
Barrens chat has always been full of trolling/ shitposting. Ignore it like the rest of us and move on. Jfc. If someone clearly has a screwed up guild name. Report it, and move on. Nothing more you'll ever be able to do or improve. Don't feed the trolls, and understand the difference of people who are actually serious, and LARPers who are shitposting. Report and move on.
---
Questie for quests. Elvui or tukui (i prefer elvui but thats up to you) for bars, scrolling text, and nameplates. Details! for dps and healing meters. Deadly boss mods for raiding and dungeon helper. Leatrix plus for automation (like auto vendoring gray items or auto repairing) and lots of extra game options to improve QOL. Leatrix maps for map addons. Weakauras for custom timers, trackers, and pretty much everything else. All these addons have been made into classic versions. Thats all the stuff im uaing at the moment and don't really feel like i need anything else.
---
what about the looting part?
---
That's the guild I'm in.
---
Nothing. I like it!
---
Not once in my life have I leveled professions in WoW. 4 days later, I'm an Expert Fisherman, Cook and Tailor sitting at 23.
---
Helps that I have a hunter to fish for and a group to make bags for though.
---
-Bruh
---
That‚Äôs the way she goes
---
Rogue and warrior are both good dps and are both insanely gear dependent. With no gear you will struggle to level so going to dungeons for gear is almost required for them. Solo leveling can feel like a pain at times on warr/rogue
---
This is the biggest protip. 
---
Ive died a lot still but upgrading your weapon constantly is so so important.
---
This is true, but don't waste your other abilities - gouge and bandage is a classic combo, use your points on slice and dice if you're moving from mob to mob and don't want to waste them, kick spellcasters heals (looking at those dumbass furbolgs in westfall), garrote mobs when you're in groups, etc.  
---
Rogue really is a bag of fun. A bag that's full of dying too.
---
I saw someone with Pornhub
---
Like equipping edgmasters as a hunter I did that on my first hunter
---
Lmfao 100% true, I‚Äôm going to be the world first Human Rogue to hit 60 with my exceptionally specific appearance I have chosen which is nearly impossible for anyone to mimic. 
---
Can‚Äôt wait might stream it as it‚Äôll be such an accomplishment that will impress everyone. God I love bragging.
---
As a tailor I'm buying all the cheap heavy leather I can. To make into silk bags to then sell
---
Sounds like something the fun police would say
---
I trade Manapots that I find on my ways
---
Vendor: 2g best I can do
---
Blizzard is the game developer and Activision is the publisher. Activision bought Blizzard and thus owns them. They are not the same and Blizzard can only do what Activision allows them to do and they won't do anything that they think will not make them money. If you do not believe this then just Google it. Love the meme 100% truth.
---
Yeah i do that too but sometimes i do so much damage (shaman) that i get aggro and then the mob follows me and the guy im helping has to chase it lol. then i feel bad
---
By the time she is ready, she will have a custom built PC, probably with my little pony or something similar themed lights and water cooling (Because it'll prolly be the norm soon.)
---
Can you tell me what he means by honor?
---
&gt;Paladin is THE worst at leveling. I don't have any personal experience of paladin
---
All you have to do is look at old VODs and you can see it's legit.. They are level 60. 
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/474699903
---
End of this VOD is 15 hours ago and he was about to hit level 59.
---
Yes. Thank you frog jesus. This fucking dps shaman in my WC group took 85% of the healing the whole instance.
---
Any server is fine, pick one in your timezone and try it out.  All the most attractive and cool people play on Incendius though.
---
Perfection !
---
Healing is boring because if your tanks are doing their job generally there‚Äôs only one thing to do and that‚Äôs keep the tank alive. This will be consistent through lower level dungeons and things will slowly get more exciting as high dungeons open up and new mechanics. 
---
A bored healer generally means you are doing your job.
---
She was watching my gnome, so probably wanted to punt it. You're not wrong
---
Full of carebears, you get temp bans for literally anything that might be perceived as "offensive".
---
I definitely visualized this as an undead while reading it
---
A 24-hour ban of an obviously egregious name? Good luck man :)
---
They were streaming up to level 60. How are they abusing mechanics?
---
Well yeah, it's against ToS to automate player movement with third party software.
---
Giving up is for the weak!
---
Might have been a mass DC on a layer
---
Whats the addon called for the attack times?
---
as a priest, youre damn right
---
For real though, having a dps help me kill a mob or two is more than worth the mana of a buff!
---
The main bar has binds.
---
In all reality if $15/month makes you think this much, then you should reconsider your financial situation.
---
I‚Äôm not gonna lie to you. I‚Äôm a mage and I do that. I want to apologize on behalf of all of us. But also I‚Äôll never stop
---
It's 100% fake. There's no way they are this far ahead of Method, the best guild in the world. Classic WoW is easy. Retail guilds will shit on these people.
---
Sco said it himself. They researched all the private server guilds and none of them are going to be a competition.
---
As a Priest your Wand is your life, you should really learn about the wand progression for your faction and try to get some of them - if you are ally then the wand from People's Militia, if you are horde then Greater Magic Wand at 13.
---
To be honest, Legion had a fair bit of cool class quests.
---
The Death knight for the frost artifact was quite cool and I had a blast, doing it.
---
Darkshore was a godsend. Got 11-20 with minimal problems with overpopulation on stalagg.
---
Because Rikh, for one.
---
Yep, got 80% chance to prot, definitely more consistent but you need to sit (press X) and right click or press your auto attack button, just before getting hit, that will 100% work, it's quite hard to get consistently but I'm sure someone far smarter than me wil lwork out how to abuse it
---
In which ways?
---
Other people do this? I'm not alone!
---
Nope.  cc completely incapacitates a mob.  Polley and sap are two examples
---
give out a fair warning to people who wanna play with him that he will ninja loot and feign innocence  at any given moment , i got no problem with letting people know that if i see him around
---
Victim blaming?
---
Glad to hear that it seems to work out for you guys. My girlfriend even started playing and is all interested in the stories i am telling from back then. It's like a dream come true, except that i am working 24h shifts every second day since release, while she is at home playing a night elf huntress.
---
meanie head
---
That 2nd entrance save me a lot of time today when I was doing RFC quests.
---
Ok I will have to do that tomorrow cause it‚Äôs late for me but thanks for your help! Appreciate it üëç
---
None of the APES members is streaming. They‚Äôre being extremely secretive about this whole thing. I can‚Äôt wait till they get world first after only 5 days just so I can see the reaction from the Classic community. There‚Äôs still people out there who believe it takes multiple months to even step into MC.
---
I think the question was more about what the reasons were, rather than asking for a number.
---
Play what you enjoy, even if a so called meme spec.
---
It‚Äôs only that in raids. Everything else, if you can play it well, it‚Äôs fine. As long as that‚Äôs what you enjoy, then do it.
---
And if you think pretend to be racist or a nazi for laughs isn‚Äôt far from being one. You lack true perspective and have clearly never met a truly racist to the core person. The difference is immeasurable.

You....leveled 10 levels without any talents? Wow.
---
Just go the beast Mastery tree. Put 5 points into either of the first two talents, then put 2 points in revive pet, points in thick hide, then points in fury
---
You support a practice which devalues  other players achievements
---
this
---
&gt;  chinese culture promotes and accepts cheating
---
&gt;Its not racist 
---
you should stop posting because you have no idea what youre talking about and are making yourself look even more clueless and racist as you go on
---
I screamed this down the mic when a rogue popped evasion against my new corpsemaker in hillsbrad. Overpower and execute are all it takes.
---
Welcome to classic!! Where you spend more time travelling than fighting.
---
Classic is different from Vanilla. Different patch, modern client, layering, battle.net integration.
---
Vanish is a game changer! My deaths went way down and it is cool in dungeons to get those sweet sweet combo points.
---
Having a character called Activision is not very funny in itself. Ok, maybe a bit, but definitely not enough to be half!
---
That's a total lie. Westfall is gonna buttfuck you
---
Somehow it‚Äôs my fault someone decided to grief on me because I was jumping inside the Inn? Reddit never changes.
---
All I do is complain about the instant spawn rates. The sludge fens took my life many times...
---
There is no possible way that a game like classic WoW could ever be free.
---
Hunters have True shot aura and don't compete nearly as much for loot. It will be a shit show gearing as fury or combat.
---
I wonder how worth it it will be to bring a ret paladin in just to use Nightfall

24 with 50s. Got drunk last night and bought all my new skills, needed gear replacements and herbs for pots then proceeded to camp in Stonetalon Peak for a couple of hours. Watching 3 rogues stand on top of each other to avoid me picking them off individually made every copper worth it. God I love this game.
---
But it still sometimes is though
---
Oh right, I forgot you guys think its more than a game. My mistake.
---
Is the same/correct account selected? :p
---
Happy to hear I'm not the only one who's a little bummed about this. Whole group is spread across different servers. Now we're all just playing at the same time but sitting on discord. Its kinda crappy. I was excited to level with my bois.
---
You mean you hop on xfire at least that was what my old guild used lol.
---
Half this Reddit cracks me up. It's been awhile since I had so much fun playing a game and relating to a community!
---
Gotcha.
---
You took the bait you fool
---
Just want to quest eh?
---
Problem with the pet tanking is hunters have high dps so you pull aggro all the time. I'm constantly stunning and running to be able to get in the ranged shots. You can get beast mastery and get the talent so your pets taunt, but that's not available until about lvl 30 I think. Pretty much being an effective hunter is one of the more difficult options.
---
I guess I'm mis remembering, it's been a really long time and i haven't managed to log in yet.
---
Yes it‚Äôs the same account that she added the gift card to, lol I definitely double checked cuz she made a couple accounts and was playing different versions of the game
---
Congrats :) I'm definitely less afraid than I was before of enemy players. Specifically stronger ones.
---
"it's not racist, it's true" - said by literally every racist ever. Your comment was unnecessary and stupid.
---
\- Patrols. Many mobs patrol. Sometimes in groups.
---
\- Call for help. Others can summon one or more (up to all) nearby allies to help when attacked/hurt.
---
\- Someone dropped a train on you: aggroed a lot of mobs and left their range; the returning "mob of mobs" would start checking surroundings for enemies a bit earlier than they'd actually disperse to their original positions.
---
\- Respawn rush, as mentioned earlier.
---
Yeahhh but we def don‚Äôt have wf in the barrens as that suggested :(
---
Did you miss the guild name?
---
This is my experience with getting rushed by mobs that I have nothing to do with... Are there any other players around? If the player fighting NPCs decides to run after being overwhelmed and the NPCs are close enough to where you‚Äôre fighting or where the NPCs you‚Äôre fighting spawn at, they‚Äôll sometimes come to you if you‚Äôre still in combat.
---
No idea if this is how it actually works but it‚Äôs what I‚Äôve noticed
---
There‚Äôs a ‚Äúby Thralls balls‚Äù comment later in the game.  There‚Äôs plenty of cursing as well.
---
To be fair all of that didn‚Äôt help them beat some noname gnome to first level 60.
---
Bl√≠z≈∫√§rd: we depth investigate this account pleas provide email and pasword too confirm you are owner or this account will be suspend.

ya, works half the time for me too

looks like a mix of Enchantrix and Auctioneer (or maybe just Auctioneer); [https://www.reddit.com/r/woweconomy/comments/cx7lt2/auctioneer\_for\_classic\_is\_now\_available/](https://www.reddit.com/r/woweconomy/comments/cx7lt2/auctioneer_for_classic_is_now_available/)
---
taggin /u/swuntalingous since they asked as well
---
EDIT: Auctioneer includes Enchantrix apparently
---
When you hit at least level 16 go try to find deadmines groups in westfall and look for the wand dropped by cookie the murloc boss.
---
That's the best wand in the game for a good while.
---
Ted I‚Äôm dying...
---
+5
---
I'm honestly just not a fan of modern WoW design. Legion epitomizing that and laying the groundwork for bfa.
---
Artifact power ensured you could never stop grinding and also made alts basically unplayable for a good portion of the expansion without huge amounts of time commitment(something previously not done as WoD and other expansions were fairly alt friendly.) World quests are basically dailies on steroids that you need to do 3x as much for the same effect. Legendaries, while great conceptually, were ultimately bungled until the tail end of the expansion due to the acquisition process sometimes even incentizing *rerolling your character*. Add onto this meaningless gear that resets every patch which makes a ton of the activities in the game itself feel completely pointless to even bother doing.
---
Outside of that, retail just feels too much like a mobile game. And if i wanted that i can go play those. You've always got daily "chores" to do, and nothing ever feels good at the end of the grind. It instills a feeling of "thank god its over" rather than excitement at achieving something you've worked hard on.
---
That's the big difference. Retail grinds make you feel like you finally finished up that shitty 9-5 gas station job and got your final paycheck to get a better job(which in the end just ends up being another shitty gas station job, repeat ad nauseum.) Classic grinds, despite being technically worse, at least *feel good* at the end of it all. Like all that pain was worth it in the end. And to top it all off you likely did that grind with friends you met along the way.  Retail being more solo focused makes those grinds just feel that much more unbearable.
---
So yeah, i can see why people think legion was the bees knees coming off the heels of the expansions before it. But it definitely introduced a lot of game design i'm absolutely not a fan of. Things like allied races at the tail end of the expansion especially considering those easily burned me out for good due to the mind numbing tedium that is the unlock process.
---
You had a howling blast doing it?
---
Hey hun! Gonna need another bucket! Thanks boo
---
Jokerd hit 60 live on stream yesterday and hosted Method with his 100k Viewership as a little middlefinger to them so... yeah, no.
---
You don't need a separate subscription to play Classic, it's shared between both version.
---
Something else is going on, try reinstalling, Classic is not big it shouldn't take much time.
---
Yup. Sure is. Used by cats AND bears and makes them viable even in raids
---
I forgot the charter we all signed promising not to use the widely known system to level a bit faster. I don't want to know in what world this is "cheating".
---
Hunter why is your dps so bad
---
Uhhhh idk
---
HEEEEEEHHHHH HOOOOOOOOOOOOUGHHHHHHHH
---
Apparently this is how you set it in chat.
---
* /console WeatherDensity 0 (Turns weather effects off.)
---
* /console WeatherDensity 1 (Low intensity.)
---
* /console WeatherDensity 2 (More intense.)
---
* /console WeatherDensity 3 (Heavy weather effects.)
---
But I haven't seen anything yet. I play on classic settings
---
üëåüëå
---
You know they got beat to 60 by a bald gnome right ? Method in response made chat emote only and refused to talk about it , EVEN after JokerD hosted them with 300k viewers .
---
Thanks for taking the time to tell me all that.
---
Sounds like if I had more time to play I‚Äôd go warrior but priest is my best choice for how I want to play.
---
Now to figure out what server...
---
I'm doing this too, but at 34 spells are 1g+ each and even just a few feels like it breaks the bank lmfao.
---
Alliance can use greater magic wand too lol it's from enchanting
---
Lad :')
---
Are you saying it takes a long time to get attuned or am I misunderstanding?
---
Edit: because it's very quick and easy..
---
You can only attack players from the enemy faction. 
---
In early levels the zones are dominated by your faction without offering quests for the opposite faction. You‚Äôll hardly encounter enemy players there. 
---
Later on zones are contested, e.g. they‚Äôre questing areas for both factions. Like Hillsbrad Foothills, Ashenvale or most prominently, Stranglethorn Vale. As soon as you‚Äôre PvP tagged, enemy players can attack you anytime, anywhere (on PvP servers this is always the case and doesn‚Äôt need activation).
---
And yes, Horde could do that by killing quest NPCs or camping flight masters for example.
---
If you‚Äôre interested in it just look for some YouTube videos from Tarren‚Äòs Hill Open PvP battles.
---
Except they dont make games like we had in 2000s anymore. It's all about appealing to those quick reward people
---
Wand can be resisted though
---
Your dad's retarded
---
...
---
Ok. Tell me what i think wow is if not a game then?
---
Alls fair in love and Warcraft
---
I agree fully.
---
Played RoC endlessly for months, one of my first 100+ hour games, hit rank 33 on Kalimindor in 2v2.
---
Didnt start playing WoW until early 2006, and only because a friend suggested it.
---
You really think a bald gnome from Malta could beat Method?
---
Basically, Beast Master buffs your pet, Marksmanship buffs your ranged damage, and Survival buffs your melee and traps.
---
Beast Mastery is considered the best because it significantly reduces downtime between pulls with talents like Improved Mend Pet and Bestial Discipline. If you play survival and find it fun then that's fine but I'm just gonna say, a LOT of people look at survival and think it's gonna be fun but then find it utterly miserable. It only costs 1g to respec the first time, though.
---
you can watch his videos if you doubt it it's all documented
---
Just look at the ‚Äúfarm spellcleave‚Äù in chat and that‚Äôs enough proof that this is Classic.
---
To be fair, somethung like "I am gaming a lot" should definitely be something dropped early on. Now, you might get laid less in the process especially when you mention World of Warcraft, but if you are looking for a partner for life its important that stuff like this aligns.
---
so in fact, a line like that might scare most girls, but it also may hit the humorous nerve of a girl which actually could be a true match.
---
Female NE warriors are extra lore points.
---
PvP server then yes you will have 'contested zones'.
---
Expect to be ganked.
---
It's part of the fun, good luck in STV.
---
Kid, people who get more practice in will always be better than people who don't. Method is a good guild, but let's be real they have no chance vs ppl that have been playing this for the past 8 years.
---
Absolutely, 25% bonus wand damage is amazing
---
Then I dunno, outside of the normal stuff like restart bnet, restart blizzard agent, restart PC, run as admin etc. I have no clue. Maybe contact support D:
---
I think you cant ask if they are legal citizens
---
Redridge is contested so you're flagged for pvp when you enter.  Green names are Alliance that are also flagged.  Red names are Horde, which you would see as yellow in an Alliance controlled zone until you attacked at which point you would be flagged and they would turn red.
---
Since you're flagged for pvp you can be attacked freely by Horde players until you leave a contested zone for five minutes or something, I forget.
---
There's no way a bald gnome from Malta could defeat Method, you must be trolling.
---
Esfand knows it's a meme tbh, and being a streamer he'll be accepted to raids no problem
---
His name was Jokerd.
---
It's in the navigation bar thing near the top of the app.
---
You may also need to "add" WoW classic on the My Subscription page in the website to get the downloader open, it's wonky.
---
Don't sell yet, let them bake a bit or use em yourself. I would prolly do the latter.  GZ!
---
By level 8?! Not a chance lol
---
With survival, you're supposed to tank, not your pet. The tree has a bunch of talents for doing stuff like increasing dodge and parry chance and arguably the most important talent of the tree, counterattack, is an attack that you can only do after parrying an opponent's attack. That's what makes it all so miserable, you have to worry about your own health, with no self-heals, no reliable interrupts, and no plate armor. You're like a worse warrior.
---
&gt; ...and you get access to claw rank 3.
---
Unless you tame a pet that already has it like certain bears in Loch Modan. I did this around 17-18 but the charge power of boars is better for leveling till 20 IMO.

People still ran MC at the end of vanilla. Without a hard catch-up mechanic as often used in retail you'll always find people running old content.
---
A bit less sex with the misses... But now she gives me heals and windfurry, witch still makes my 2h hard üí™
---
Thank you!!! Was driving me nuts..
---
My new warrior isn't doing too badly. My OG warrior from vanilla has a waterfront property on the river styx.
---
Yes blizzard is expecting ques when layers are removed, that‚Äôs why they are tilling players to move off of high pop servers.
---
Awesome thanks!
---
That‚Äôs a more then valid point. If gaming is a part of your life you shouldn‚Äôt hide it. And to be honest, gaming is nothing that‚Äôs worth hiding anymore, but if you play Warhammer 40k you better hide that! /s
---
the easiest way to be comfortable healing is using something like clique, it will cause all your binds to be different as long as your mouse is on a party frame and is easy to set up. It really helps with binding dozens of spells.
---
I have no queue time, it's been fixed, only exceptions are the super over populated servers, and queues there will likely persist
---
He meant level 18 and I had 13g by lvl 19 so it's not that crazy
---
It's new. It will calm down in time.
---
Legion did have a shaky start but towards the end I really enjoyed it. The new tiers of gear each patch gives you something to work towards and allows you to get gradually stronger throughout the expansion. 
---
The daily things to do gave me a reason to actually play the game between raid nights along with the addition of mythic keystones that kept dungeons fresh and challenging. 
---
Classic grinds, at least so far, do not feel good lmao. I don't feel rewarded after getting the final boar liver to drop after 30 minutes of killing them. I enjoy working towards unlocking spells and filling out my talent tree but the process is relatively the same. As far as the "making friends along the way" thing goes I've made plenty of friends in retail so that's not really a big change for me
---
Leatrix plus has an option for that
---
&lt;3===8
---
Was online, had a crash, computer restarted, 7,000 person queue.
---
I think they vastly underestimate how many will stay. 
---
The only reason they will leave is this BS queue garbage.
---
I[ suggest you read the pre launch AMA the devs did](https://www.wowhead.com/news=294587/classic-wow-liveblog-of-the-classic-wow-dev-team-ama-on-r-classicwow#clearing-up-misconceptions). Layering is used to lessen the stress created by people being congregated in the starting zones. A layer does not contain an entire (non-layered) realms population. Therefore it can easily be exploited.
---
Sage, sage advice. My ex wife of 15 years still has not learned this very basic but extremely important lesson.
---
342k viewership but yeah who's counting. Many donations were made to Jokerd today with the name 'method'
---
Snowflakes don't belong in Vanilla.  If that offends you you're a tourist anyway begone now to spare us of a queue slot.
---
Don‚Äôt forget to skill up too ;)
---
Yeah fuck streamers especially asmon
---
Read the title mate
---
OK I will check it out
---
Shots fired.
---
Snape fan? :)
---
Yes it would bother me. I subbed to classic WoW because I wanted to play vanilla WoW because I specifically like the look and atmosphere of vanilla WoW. If they changed the game I would cancel my sub and find an alternative provider of vanilla WoW that suits me.
---
There's also zero ranged weapon upgrades.. at least as dwarf
---
I've been playing way too much this week and I've outleveled my friends, but as soon as I temper back to a reasonable play rate they'll leave my warrior in the dust. The struggle is real
---
You know where those sites get the gold? Hacked accounts. Dont support that shit dumbass
---
Who thinks these kinds of names are funny? Use abit of creativity and come up with something clever
---

---
These videos are amazing! Keep it up!
---
So it's exactly the same but today. So that makes it 100% different
---
Damn I wish I had more of you in my instances. Instead I get people crying for me to top up that 20% damage they received by being an idiot.
---
You are wasting my mana and dps. Stop worrying about your health bar. That‚Äôs my problem. Do your job and I‚Äôll do mine.
---
omg lol, but it's not really worth buying it you know? ally has so many other wands... jesus people, think before you type
---
R/sounding? Extreme nsfw
---
I Agree, but I have no desire to go past Wrath. You honestly think there is a significant number of people that want to play MoP again? Cata was ok, but it was the beginning of the end in many ways as well.
---
I mean I get it I just don‚Äôt know why any sane non streamer fan boy would join the server that will forever have log in queues and streamer influence. If you love a streamer.. I totally understand
---
If you mean 2 different WoW accounts then yes, you can log them both at the same time, Battle net logs out if you log onto another computer with the same account.
---
"So if you took all 5, 10, whatever full-size layers there are and mashed them together into one, you think that doesn't change anything?"
---
If the server cap was vanilla cap, it would have been the same. Of course the player count of 5 full size layer wouldn't fit in there.
---
" STILL almost no one hopped"
---
This is false, all the new releasedserver got filled up fast, alot of players hopped. 
---
But yeah blizzard messed up by releasing so few servers in the beginning and alot of players don't want to hop. But there is a simple solution for that, allow free transfer on another server.
---
Fucking whooooosh
---
Private server guilds shit on retail guilds 100%
---
classic boomers hehe xd
---
The fuck is wrong with you.  He makes shit tons of money playing wow.
---
Plus wishing suicide on anyway is so fucking pathetic.  Maybe contemplate your own life worth.
---
Lol must be üòÇ
---
In 2005 it was "chinese (country of origin presumably, not racist) farmers". Imagine taking this much offense to an anecdote. If I went back, I'd do it again. And again. And again.
---
Nice man, did you play the AH? That's a lot of gold lol
---
Please tell me someone clipped this.
---
It's been 4 days...
---
I feel This is the downside to the whole streamer/world first thing. Makes people feel the game can only be enjoyed at one pace.
---
i know right, mother nature is wondeful
---
Didn't get a headstart but skinning and vendoring works wonders! at 30g at lvl 32.
---
It was changed in 1.12 so the skill cost money instead of the mounts iirc
---
I agree. I didn't mean changes. I meant adding more pixels to the existing pixels.
---
Looting mob trash and selling it is almost always sufficient unless you're spending gold on useless crap.
---
Im not a native english speaker and I found his dialect very hard to understand, and he seem to vary his speed of speech too, which made it even harder for me. But he did seem to know a lot about the game. Im still looking for someone I can more easily understand.
---
Thank you very much, redownloading it solved the problem, you guys are way better than the support option, it‚Äôs still a 2 hour wait for a response
---
Holy cow !
---
Yea oops I'm on mobile and cba to delete the comment. Thanks lol :x
---
Hunter easiest leveling and solo quest. With limited time you can get a lot done.
---
This reminds of the funniest thing I saw in wow. I was playing legion and was max level and just doing quests for the story when I see in chat ‚ÄúHEEELLLPPP!‚Äù And I look around and see this gnome chasing this panda and it reminded me something like from jackass. So I heal (paly) the panda and kill the gnome. I just can‚Äôt get the visual out of my head of a little gnome chasing a big bear calling for help.
---
Why do we care how fast speed runners beat any game they play? Sometimes it‚Äôs fun to watch them break a new record. I wish he was running speed run splits add on
---
I'm a fan of both versions of wow though so I might just have more tolerance for the changes
---
Para bellum
---
I prefer questie.
---
Heh I would do the same, opting to toss some backup heals if the healer's Mana runs low. One time a healer got all salty, as if I was trying to one-up the healer or something, like I was trying to claim their role, or imply they were bad - where in fact all I wanted was to not have to graveyaed run.
---
it was like that when I first logged in at about 6:30 AM on the 27th.
---
I just kept trying to log in, and about 15 minutes later, I was in and playing again.
---
Robbin Williams made so much more than him was actually funny had a good life and still killed himself .... 
---
no amount of money or things gives you value ... it was a joke you must be very sensitive or a fan boy regardless lol üòò also I didn‚Äôt no said I want him to get neck rope ... read it
---
Are you talking about sam?
---
Pretty sure that's the warlock quest, isn't the paladin quest in Strath or Scholo or something?
---
Exactly if I‚Äôm bored we are either not pulling big enough mobs or people are playing their role how it is supposed to. Either way the end result will almost always be a positive one.
---
You should stop if this happens, I would be pissed as a warr if somebody "helped" me this way :)
---
I still have this quest in my log on retail.
---
The no changes movement imo stands for no changes that have a massive impact on the fundamental game or mechanics of vanilla wow. If you truly believe classic should not be changed in the slightest I literally can not help you because it's probably the dumbest thing I've ever heard. When people voice their "exceptional" changes and they are good ideas the changes should be made.
---
Amen. I struggled with my pally for way too long despite knowing it wasn't for me at lvl 5.
---
Alliance scum
---
That is exactly the problem she didn't tell him and maybe he wanted to play with her
---
What nameplates you using?
---
Or atleast its not the children of goldshire
---
Yeah I just did the basic kill quests, skipped any collect or boss mob quests and just ground out the levels.
---
The trip to 20 is quicker this way on a busy server.
---
If melee always upgrade ur weapon.
---
Priest - focus on wand play (pun intended)
---
Hunter - same as melee but ranged slot.
---
Warrior - use hamstring and melee timer and jump kite the mobs. Single pull. Just be prepared for a bad time 1 to 40.
---
Mage - frost. Blizzard pulls are fun once you hit the right talents.
---
Gif has a rolling r in it. A lot of people don't know that.
---

Goblin shredders in stv

Uh try it? How are we supposed to know if you‚Äôll like it?
---
Yes and 3
---
I do need that much sleep. I can just sleep at another time. After doing something like what I wrote above, I'd go to sleep for the next 18 hours.
---
Classic has been such a breath of fresh air. Doing a recent quest, rogue invites me to group and we go about working on our quest together.  Another rogue questing solo gets over his head and has a train of like 3 mobs on him. Me and rogue save his life and a corpse run, he thanks us and pays me a green item in trade as thanks before running off back on his adventure and me and my new rogue friend co tinue ours. Any of the above scenarios just wouldn't happen  on retail as is, much less any combination of them. This is why to me, classic is just sooooo good.
---
WeakAuras2 works in classic wow? I thought it only worked in Live WoW
---
I wake up early but today, of all days, i forget to set my alarm and end up in 8k queue
---
I have no idea why this is getting down voted. Ive seen plenty myself. One guy even said he was glad he didnt have to deal with all the "chink" gold sellers.
---
How are you so sure? They haven't been streaming since yesterday, there's a good chance that they already farmed the required rep without letting any people in on it.
---
And even if it is just a rep grind, they can get to honored in a couple of hours.
---
Sames but im oce so i guess its expected
---
Yes, there is a classic version available.
---
I did the exact same thing
---
Did you talk to her twice? She didn't show she had another part of the quest for me
---
Finish that and it should work
---
I think people seriously underestimate the no lifers. There are people that have planned, plotted, and practiced this for years.  The average Joe won't be in MC for a few months, but these people are no average human beings. These people have dedicated a good part of their lives towards this, this isn't a hobby or a game to them, this is serious.
---
Darkshire. Love the story quests. Don't love the long runs. Or getting annihilated by Stitches when he surprises me on the road in the mists and darkness.
---
Now I like you both on the outside AND the inside.
---
Why the rush? Not even a week in and people are already 60.
---
I was in a guild and saw the guild leader while questing, he was a bit higher than me and he pulled too many and ran them to me while I was killing a mob of my own, got us both killed. He took the mining node I was obviously clearing to without helping clear, too. I ran back, pulled a new mob and was killing it, I heard him die again nearby so I rezzed and buffed him. Throughout all of this the fucker never said a word. Left that guild not long after for that and other various reasons.
---
I don't need to get my dick sucked for helping someone, but a thanks for a rez and buff even after you got someone killed and stole their node, or a 'sorry' for getting them killed just seems like basic courtesy to me.
---
How did you manage to grind 100g for mount ?
---
What AddOn is that?  For the health bars?
---
I mean it still will for the majority of players. These guys have been practicing this run for the last several years and are now putting everything they have into the official release for it. Of course theyre going to have everything down perfectly and do it as efficiently as possible. But 99.9% of players dont come anywhere close to matching that pace
---
You have to feed it to keep it happy or it will leave you.
---
Boar is easy because they eat just about everything. Click on some food on your inventory and drop on it, it will eat and get the "feed pet" buff on its icon.
---
Keep always an eye on the little "face" icon next to its portrait, if it's green it means it's happy, yellow is so so, red is angry and will leave you after a bit.
---
While spending time with it he will become more faithful and require less feeding.
---
Have they ? Or have some left just for being tired of it or just age.  You don't expect Metzen to work at Blizzard for 30 years do you?
---
Can't. I run Heal/Flash.
---
Triggered much?
---
Amusing conjecture throughout this thread.
---
We weren't talking about dungeon finder, we were talking about summoning.
---
Kek.
---
What if it's worse in 3 weeks? What if all the players convinced their grandmothers to play? What if those grandmothers convince their knitting group to play? Time will only tell.
---
I would have as well, and normally he would, but he had a quest he wanted to get done asap so he just stuck it out figuring he'd ignore them.
---
You're right, I don't. But still. He hit 60 ~4d6h after release in ~4d2h played... pretty reasonable conclusion. Conveniently didn't stream the entire thing, just bits here and there. Why stream at all?
---
But yes, it is just conjecture.
---
It's so refreshing to see people state the obvious like this. It's so weird how people see it as any other thing.
---
Sweet! Thanks for the help!
---
Ok, well if you're trying to get VW to hold aggro while killing multiple mobs that makes sense. I usually just end up face tanking one while VW tanks one I've already dot'ed. I already have a lot of points towards drain tanking, so this usually ends up working out well for me.

I offer to open lock boxes when I get buffed
---
Thats pretty accurate lol
---
You need to feed your pet and keep his happiness green, it also gives him a damage buff (125% damage). if you hover over it, it should show what he likes to eat.
---
If its a boar you can feed it boar meat.

Kitboga fan?
---
lol... this is just hilarious to me.
---
This is great. Pls continue.
---
I'm pretty sure it was sarcastic.
---
I don't even think Blizzard knows yet.
---
Glad i could help. :)
---
It's just the anniversary of its release basically was about 15 years ago, a lot of ppl played for longer, some quit when TBC was released, everyone has their own unique WoW experience and nostalgia about it.
---
Hope so, really couldn't tell.
---
At least we can set the pet to aggressive near important spawns.
---
Options never bother me.  As long as I could turn them off as well, sure.
---
And I agree with that, but switching in the first place and playing on a new server "temporarily" is just silly/ridiculous to me. If the server you are all maining is full, don't tempt yourself by going on another server and thinking you'll just swap over.
---
Ahh well in that case it would be a compatibility issue with fear and agony
---
Same...
---
Shut up boomer
---
You can farm mageweave and make a nice buck off it, plus he's a tailor so it looks like he can make some good bags too
---
I'm in two minds on transmog. I appreciate the visual customization but it also kind of takes me out of the fantasy when I know that what the character is wearing isn't actually their gear. It's just something that kinda nags at me.
---
I've seen a level boosting ad on YouTube....
---
I checked it out.. Just to see how much.. 100g is over $1200 USD
---
Well it's a raid. It's always going to be difficult. I've never done a single raid in WoW though.
---
I spent like 30 minutes trying to get this ring. First competing with other players nabbing it first. Not getting counted for the kill even though I tagged and killed them. Trying to let the Alliance Guard kill them and not getting the kill count. Pulling too far away, and having the mobs turn green\[weird\] Then finally in a group I managed to get it.
---
Indeed!
---
I'm on bloodsail buccaneers (aka the only non PvP RP realm) and everyone's been pretty nice so far lol
---
Alright thanks! I won‚Äôt take this
---
Open your character sheet and check the "pet" tab when your pet is out. You'll see a face that's either red and frowning, green and smiling, or yellow and neutral. That indicates its happiness. Feed your pet with the feed pet ability and food appropriate for your pet's diet. A pet does more damage the higher happiness it is, and it won't run away unless its happiness is red. Happiness is reduced when your pet does and slowly degrades over time. Happiness degredation can be slowed, making it so you don't have to feed the pet as often  by increasing your pet's loyalty, which is probably the number you saw. Increasing a pet's loyalty is just done by making sure it's happy for long periods of time.
---
tl;dr feed your pet
---
Not sure if this is a great thread to ask, but what is the best pet for hunter leveling?
---
Great video by the way, laughed my ass off at the warrior part.
---
lol at the people responding to you. "Sorry, classic is only for REAL WoW players didn't you know? If you liked retail at all you cannot like Classic and are just a tourist. Also you're the one offended, not me. You are a snowflake for pointing out lame behavior, I am not a snowflake for being mad at you for it. "
---
I don't know why everyone thinks "community" is all super friendly cheerful people. It was like this in 2005 too.
---
Absolutely. The OG dungeon group had a healer, a tank, and a support class (pally).
---
It was, and has always been a thing. It is just not enabled by default. Type "/join lookingforgroup" to join it. Or right-click the "General" tab of your chat window, click "Settings", go to "Global Channels", and join "Looking for Group". Please tell people in-game about this, so we can keep /2 for trade.
---
I could‚Äôve sworn it was a joke I‚Äôm too warlock to get
---
interface options, social, and tick block channel invites
---
If both accounts use the same battle.net account will that work? Or do they need to be on different battle.bet logins altogether?
---
I skipped that quest, ain‚Äôt nobody got time to run around motivating peons
---
I know but part of me what's to remind myself why
---
I like it well enough.
---
Back during vanilla I multi box botted farming azshara 24/7 for golden pearls. I had 4 bots running per computer on 2 PCs total. I was making around 2k gold a week and sold it to the Asian gold sellers for around $30 per 1k sometimes more sometimes less. The bot was custom written by my cousin and I managed to avoid most ban waves, not all of them though. There were multiple times I would wake up with a banned account and a random whisper from a GM in my chat log haha. 
---
I mostly did it because I didn't feel like raiding and was bored of the game. Once BC released I stopped botting and haven't since. It was nice money for young me, being in high school and not having a job.
---
Why so many shamans?
---
If it's undead this meme is so fucking dark.

---
I used this and it works perfectly, thank you!
---
Yuuuuup, this is just my pipe dream :)
---
Meh, everyone who knows anything about the game predicted this two years ago. Now it's time to watch retail-only players fall over themselves to express that world firsts don't matter and APES are just pathetic nolifing losers.
---
Go beast mastery. Survival isn't anywhere near as good as the other two and marksmanship puts your dps too high which you don't want because your pet will lose aggro.
---
Are you using a map addon? Mapster and LTM will show the map revealed. LTM will show show un-revealed areas in purple tho.
---
well its not so much a multi box issue its a exp question
---
That's what makes them rare.
---
Show us on the doll where Classic touched you.
---
And hopefully the retail players who are too weak to ever hit 60 stop playing soon so queue times go down
---
Legion Still had mission tables and ap grind. Waow
---
Playing as group healer on priest is basically a series of charts and cooldowns. The graphics are irrelevant.
---
It's not about nostalgia. It's about a game made the right way. Has nothing to do with your 2018 experience.
---
Too soon, you fools too soon
---
This a really good way to watch a bunch of people stop playing wow classic.
---
No lifers.
---
It's hard asses like you that we don't want here
---
I don't know but you can try, retail doesn't require a sub for a starter account (only chars up to level 20 are accessible), so you can try with your subbed account on one computer and the inactive account on the other.
---
If anyone wants to buy some gold I'll totally sell some for $15 a piece haha. I only have like 10 but shit it wasn't that hard to get.
---
Are those light switches higher than average or is your desk short?
---
The awesome thing about a MMORPG is that you can play it how you want. If people want to aoe spam dungeons, let them. Your changes would also affect me, and other people, who like to run a dungeon a few times a day, in-between questing. I think dungeons are a much bigger social aspect to me than questing anyway.
---
No way. I had to hide the fact that I was a girl back then, it doesn't even compare.
---
How will that change the spelling?
---
P
---
Not everyone has 24 linen, or they are selling bags with more slots
---
I have the same problem, it worked fine since launch but now it won't work... It doesn't show me any bag slots... stopped suddenly after a loading screen (switching from kalimdor to EK)
---
Best realm
---
Why would you be at hogger at level 7?
---
I think the fact the mobs u need for green quests are lower often means you make up for less xp per mob with much faster kill speeds and less downtime.
---
You're welcome!! :)
---
Entirely false?
---
They make enough money with the millions of subscribers to the main version of the game, most of which are kids who are unwilling to try the older versions of it. They could easily make WoW Classic a free to play game, where as the rest are sub-based, and still make a huge profit. Only the old school players would go back to classic. Even then they could make micro transactions in the form of skins or unique things that don't impact game play, which again companies with far less of a budget can and often times will do.
---
It's just laziness and greed... same with EA.
---
How would that change the spelling?
---
Thanks, you're a life saver
---
The raid scene isn‚Äôt going to get full blast for months you have plenty of time. Just focus on making each session an adventure.
---
Last night all I did was kill harpy‚Äôs in a cave, for so long the treasure chests respawned like 6 times. It was so much fun!
---
the best server name alone will ensure our home's survival
---
I remember a lot of gear was BoE and you could farm the dungeon with main. Like Shadowfang Keep for I think it was BiS sword or dagger.
---
No.
---
How about adding some value to the discussion and expressing why you think the suggestion is bad instead of making yourself look ignorant?
---
they at geddon maybe ;)
---
Some people can go long periods of time without sleep. He's done these sorta runs before on private servers so he's had practice I'm sure. It seems pretty reasonable to me.
---
This. I tamed a raptor and thought fighting mobs would be easier but I'd get aggro within 2 shots and then it'd be me meleeing the mob while pet attacks from behind. And then I noticed my pet didn't have growl so I looked around and found the "Beast Training" spell and it had all the pet attacks and buffs. Flying through mobs now.
---
Ok so how would I make it so that my right-click becomes my wand attack?
---
nah i just drop a slowing totem
---
I'm playing with my wife as well. We played together in other expansions, but the leveling experience was very different.
---
The only stuff that annoys me is that she won't bother to read the quests she picks up. She'll spend 20 minutes killing the wrong TYPE of murloc, for example, then get annoyed at the game. 
---
I definitely still enjoy playing with her. It's a different pace than when I play on my own, so I've found ways to cope with that. Mostly just tabbing out and reading other stuff while she figures out whatever she's doing in the cities.
---
Every freakin day!
---
Stupid and ballzy.
---
Loving Console Port and Immersion on the big tv.
---
Honestly this just makes me sad.
---
There's already been a few thousand posts with this idea so I think people want it
---
so about that follow :D
---
Would also like to know this
---
For BOP gear - yes. It means your friend clears entire dungeon except last boss, invites you (pre-19 ideally for more attempts) and you kill it. Repeat until you get loot. Use something else if not.
---
Thats funny considering that when Blizzard did start giving free epics / LfG the game also started dying.
---
Explain that to me then, who's right, first 3 expacs that peaked at 12million subs where you had to put effort into gearing up, or current wow where everyone complains about how brain dead it is?
---
There will be plenty of chance for you to gear, there are casuals, there are people playing alts, stop complaining.
---
Genuinely curious, are these really good? Why?
---
&gt;6 min queue sometimes
---
Poggers full server
---
You'd set that in the keybinding menu, you can change the keys for everything.
---
Uhh are you gonna post a link or anything?
---
Good.
---
Adding: some abilities you learn from the pet trainer, for many others you have to first learn them yourself by taming creatures that have those abilities, then you can teach them to your pet.
---
Thank you, some more grand journey questlines like they had planned with meaningful rewards could be cool yeah.
---
'Tis as I said then.
---
&gt; I would be pissed
---
Why? It's MC. and there's also 16 debuff slots lol. Also, the dungeon grinding stuff sped up leveling fast. No one actually expected Vanilla raids to be hard.
---
I saw that post but what about people like me who have put days into a character. Am I expected to restart all over and abandon my friends and guild I have met along the way because they underestimated the numbers?
---
I personally want so bad to play expansions I missed due to my age and replay some of the ones that I managed to experience. I think a lot of people would love to have an opportunity of a new, second life in the game from the beginning and up to the current state. But at the same time, Classic should stay as it is (in the complete state after phase 6), and people should be able to chose what they want to play. For the sake of not splitting the community and making everything logical and comfortable, I assume the best idea is to just implement a "switching button" in the character selection screen. If you want - stay in Classic. If not - go into BC, WOTLK and so on in the future as they will be releasing. The server can stay the same (the name of the server, not the server technically), the characters in it can be copied, so that it will be not only comfortable to continue your journey with your Classic character, but also revisiting him anytime you want in Classic version. What do you guys think? Don‚Äôt judge my photoshop skills please.
---
Oh goodness no. running Deadmines and Stocks to get whatever I can from them was a staple for me back in the day. 
---
Sorry if it bothers you, but this is how it was, and it‚Äôs how it should be. I‚Äôm getting a million percent more social interaction than I would in retail, a lot of it actually came from finding a group for DM and made some friends.
---
And then you get to make a walk from the graveyard.
---
Why? Those that want to play classic will run out of things to do eventually, a season reset where they can rebirth their character like diablo would give the game a new lease of life potentially.
---
Can you tell me more about what Old School Runescape did specifically?
---
Not just any raid, but a reward you get late in the process of opening the AQ gates. 
---
Still, completing that chain was serious work, and you should feel good about completing it!
---
I had a macro setup for 2 hours of different types of movements while staying still through recording to avoid afk detection etc. After 30 mins it booted me also today but worked overnight multiple times previously.
---
You might be right.
---
They have already done that.
---
The end.
---
I dunno, partially because I'll never have the time to dedicate this again in my life.
---
Call me greedy but I would prefer a copy option so I can still have my level 60 on classic server but a copy on a BC server to go to 70
---
Bought a blue level 16 hammer the other day. a good weapon makes all the difference. and it was cheap aswel at 60s
---
Take your time. Enjoy the experience. MC will be a huge bottleneck for you to catch up.
---
Yeah, I'm indifferent. I understand both sides of the argument, but I thought I'd share for those who have been concerned about this.
---
Tbh I quickly skimmed you're post and mistook you're purpose, sorry.
---
When did they change the graphic for hunter's mark?  I was never max level during tbc/vanilla so a lot of my memories kinda blend together, so I'm not sure exactly when the switch happened.
---
Starting at non-peak hours ftw
---
Don‚Äôt you need rep to unlock rag?
---
I was able to quest fine. But I'm playing a druid so I win all the tag races.
---
Just set his stance to aggressive.
---
Same outcome, minimal effort
---
Also did not know this - thank you!
---
Also I heard the drop for that dagger is CRAZY low, like averaging over 100 runs for a drop. I know that running 100 times doesn't increase your likelyhood for it tho.
---
He has two characters (one Dwarf Hunter he uses to play with me, and one Dwarf Priest for normal play), so that's a good tip! It seems like he's set on using one of them to level up in my pace, and one for leveling up in his pace, but I don't want him to get fidgety about his progress on the Dwarf Priest just because he's stuck with me. Maybe just say that he can do whatever he wants, and join me whenever he wants to?
---
I don't have feign death on classic yet, I have not been able to test it unfortunately.
---
Honestly, i have yet to spend more than 5 minutes finding a group for quests or dungeons. Grob squad
---
I noticed this too - i feel so rage starved and groups don't give me time to build threat. They are used to retail where its a zergfest.
---
Why? So they can complain next week that the phases take too long and blowy should release more content of course

Are you talking about how there‚Äôs bars above the mob? If so just press the ‚ÄúV‚Äù key.

Ofc you can't do things for the fun of it on retail. Helping others is also bannable. And there is no challenge in mythic raids or keys.

Healthier in game economy cannot be understated. Also, picking on the lore? That‚Äôs an unpopular opinion I feel like. I know it‚Äôs corny and campy but I have a love for the story that I‚Äôve been following for over a decade.

Everyone should play wow classic.
---
The  nostalgic factor isn't why there are hour long queue's, the game is an actual mmo +rpg.
---
Comes with a standard sub so if you were already planning on playing wow 2.0 it wont cost you any extra to test drive classic for a bit.
---
I'm not going to say that i would have predicted it would be just like 2004 all over again but it is, anyone saying this is a nostalgic only factor has no idea what they are talking about. If i wasn't here playing i'd prolly come to the same idiotic conclusion too.
---
That isn't the case, i'm playing and i'll be playing classic for a very, very long time to come.
---
I was there launch day 2004 and i can assure you i'm not playing for nostalgia, i'm playing becasue it's the best mmorpg to come out in well over a decade plus.
---
i have heared reports that apes is already in MC and might clear it this weekend. Gonna save this thread to eventually go back talk to all the people who trashed apes

Dude wtf so I'm really not the only one lmao

Nah just play like u want to, i wasnt trying to be personal
---
If you're playing a shaman then they might have aggroed on too one of your totems far away and then came after you once they killed the totem, happened to me a few times now
---
Nobody tell him..
---
I used to be 12 when starting vanilla. In german (at least in my group of friends) we always called it w - o - w. Not like wow instead we said every single letter. Hard to explain when you are not a native speaker. So one day my acc got hacked and I called blizzard. During the call the voice tells you some stuff about the website and they called it ‚Äûsomethingsomethingwow.com‚Äú. I was so pissed because they said it ‚Äûwrong‚Äú so I told the lady on the phone to change this because it was wrong. Holy shit I was fucking stupid as a kid
---
Apparently 40 or so of them hit 60 around 16+ hours ago or some shit and just did the rep. I can gurantee if they're doing MC. right now, none of them have slept in 20+ hours.
---
Me and my buddy bought some stock quite a few months ago in anticipation for Classic.  Bet that earnings call will be nice.
---
I am taking more time than ever right now. Wandering around looking for ore veins. Skinning. Cooking. Helping people with quests I'm already done. All the things.
---
I'm in no rush, nor am I expected to be. And this is why I love classic (along with about 20 other reasons).
---
War of the thorns occured. It's described in good detail by the short story "a good war". The YouTubers Hirumaredx and Pyromancer did a good job summarizing it
---
Sure, so are these BiS for Warriors pre raid? Up until when? Seems like a hard to get item for that extra 2% dps but I‚Äôm sure someone out there will pay for them.
---
Don‚Äôt buy frost nova just rank 1 works the same
---
I shut off all the public channels. For being such an old game, I'm amazed at how many kids play.
---
I only wanna play TBC. Outland is life.
---
IS THIS ALLOWED???
---
Or warlocks!
---
Nobody in their right mind supports nazism but I want a community with the freedom to do what they want without people like you picking everything apart that isn't holy
---
Que?
---
Wait, does that mean the Stormwind tower climb glitch to get under Stormwind doesn't work? Did they change something about the slope/wall mechanics?
---
EDIT: Nevermind, didn't know this wasn't a true 1.12/1.13 client and it just straight up didn't include that bug.
---
Alas, my dreams have been crushed.
---
They are already past Shazz. Rag should fall in a matter of hours.
---
That means new servers. More devs. And a completely separate support base. I wouldn‚Äôt bank on it. Classic will either remain as is or will go the route of OSRS and get content updates that won‚Äôt take away from the core game that makes classic classic. Just my thought
---
What addon is this
---
It was either Wrath or Cata, I'm not 100% sure which, though.
---
What else do you need? My PIN and Social Security numbers?

That‚Äôs a big dick plan

Sure but you can take those good and add them to the game that didn't have the mistakesm instead of closing oneself and saying "you either take the old or the new, no fusion/in between becase that takes effort, satisfy yourself with the game you played a decade ago for ages already or play our new shit expansion no one likes"   
---
They even took off another group, for HOTS, they could give the wow team more people to take effort and combine, rather than reboot the ol' shit.
---
Ty!
---
Whew.lad
---
Grouping, although slower looting in theory, will be faster right now because a group of 4 or 5 can just run through all enemies quickly and get a nice loop going. 
---
If it's not toooo busy, then a group of 2 or 3 is enough and better. Just quicker loot cycling.
---
I go afk in one spot a lot and just come back and hit jump every now and then with no dcs today.

What is it by default?
---
Ha, as a level 9 warrior, saved a rogue from those crocolisks in the river between durotar and barrens. Only to realize belatedly that one of the crocs was level 11.  Rogue didnt even realize I was still fighting, so he didnt help as the croc ate my face.  As we corpse ran back together he was man enough to apologize. Lol
---
I read the title and was sympathetic. But I did not expect that BS excuse. That's horseshit.

---
Transmog sucks you‚Äôre doing yourself a favor.
---
I don't see a problem with LFR or LFD. Not everyone has the time to join a raid group.
---
Sometimes it takes a minute to get your stuff prepped. 19 twinking is a niche thing in classic anyways. I personally always founds it really fun and a great distraction from 60 pvp or raiding
---
Title gore
---
It was great to be a part of, such a good community on this game currently!
---
What's above her head? Is this some retail joke I'm too classic to understand?

That could also work

Nope. The skill is cheap, the mounts are expensive. Go to a mount vendor and see for yourself.
---
This is why I avoided these guys. They're gonna get fully geared until most people hit 60. These guys play like 16 hours a day.
---
Yea, they could speed it up a bit compared to the original release schedule but still have enough time for people to enjoy it.
---
Correct. These are the kind of players who want to get so far ahead of the curve they can spend the rest of the time in that content drop running train on what little "competition" they have.
---
Certainly not going to complain about their lead--and you know what? I respect that.
---
Once again, thanks for proving my point :)
---
Too bad it sucks xD But still, exciting :)
---
How many stars in the sky, or grains of sand on Booty Bay?
---
Screw the universe!?!
---
I can't decide between Hunter and Warlock.  I only have a couple hours a day to play and still want to make progress.  One has aspect of the cheetah but the other has free mount!  Does one or the other have a pain mechanic that would make me pick the other?  Only ever played priest and warrior back in the day. I'm probably gonna be solo most of the time.  I seriously have decision paralysis here, please help!
---
What happens if my highest Claw rank is 2 and I get a pet with Claw rank 4? Do I learn to teach rank 3 too?
---
What addons do you have? Ive been looking for a directional arrow one for days. Still new so Im still not surewhat Im doing
---
No to relocate the health bars.

How specifically did you test it

Hi, /u/Hacken_Slash

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cy203z/how_do_you_install_addons_to_classic_wow_through/).

Yes. Because if it did it all 1 click it would be too much automation.

You don't understand what 'straw man' means, so stop using it.

I hit 26 today, so damn hyped for Windfury in 4 levels!
---
Wow queue memes are so funny and original
---
I had a twink 19 Grand Marshal Warrior back in the day with everything BiS and everything enchanted that was possible.  Let me tell you I farmed so much for that bad boy but it was worth it.

Hydraxian Waterlords.

Lousy name for a server, no queues from the first minute the game launched.
---
Thunder is the noise caused by lightning strikes so your house got struck by lightning not thunder lol
---
She's got that "Can I speak to a Guild Officer?" Haircut
---
I've found the complete opposite to be true and I'm trying to figure out why people keep saying this. I'm assuming very few people have tried to level an alt recently. I haven't tried every server mind you but the ones I have tried have never given that experience.
---
yeah who would have thought that all those angsty teens would grow up to be anti-social adults.
---
Some of them have "Molten Core"/"Rag" in their stream titles, so I'm willing to bet that they might turn on the streams when they get to Rag and are about to kill him.

I mean this isn't steamer drama at all just because he steamed his run.  This post is about the accusations on how he reached lvl 60 first.
---
Get your rulebook outta here.
---
OK I figured it out - you HAVE to use lesser healing rank 2 or else it wont work
---
I tried shaman and hated it. All of the weapon buffs lasting 5min had me wanting to blow my brains out.
---
Got in a duel with a priest, had him stand still and right clicked. Priest healed.
---
We need classic+
---
I think part of the reason people use Trade channel for LFG spam is because it's already available to us, whereas it requires action on the players part to /join the LookingForGroup channel. Naturally the new players won't know this and so upon seeing all the LFG messages in Trade channel, they start using it as well.  
---
Maybe blizz should have done the opposite, where /2 Trade channel is an LFG channel, and if players want to join a trade channel (4), we would have to manually type /join Trade. Because clearly LFG messages far outweigh any Trade messages right now. Just my two cents.
---
Already done. Hoping to get video.
---
I‚Äôd love a realistic skin for a while.
---
Honestly just buy spells for single target dps until level 40. Then buy mount, respec for aoe and then buy aoe spells

Make sure your honored...

---
Maybe. I doubt it though. Classic was a way to increase subscriber count while minimalizeing cost. I have no doubt retail is losing players every year. This is a way to show investors that they boosted subscriber count and will try to work on retails problems. I don't see retail going back to the peak of wow unless they release world of Warcraft 2 and redesign the entire game.
---
This was added after vanilla, well after.
---
Wrath baby
---
Thats kinda how wow classic works, almost every class has up keep sort of things you have to deal with -
---
Your other choices are - 
---
Warrior with 2 min battleshout
---
Pally with 5 min blessings
---
Rogue with reagent based abilities and poisons
---
As far as melee classes go, Shamans definitely have a lot of fun mechanics between spells like windfury and totems on top of self healing.
---
Yes, you can set the graphics to 'classic' or amp it up to max settings.
---
A lot of people gave a shit. There was a fuckload of people who spammed every classic related forum with comments to the tune of "pirate server players are in for a rude awakening" or "kiddies only know their ezmode servers, they will get smashed by REAL vanilla".
---
It's really just a fun underdog story, just like the "method got memed on by a balding gnome" thing.
---
Couldn't reflect my experience better. Just this morning, I was running back to town and a random player opened up trade with me. They gave me a couple of spring water, I buffed them and we went on our merry way. Then we had a five-minute whisper conversation about how great it is to be helping each other and the friendliness of Classic. And wished each other well on our respective adventures. Great little interactions.
---
he doesnt, a friend of a friend is in the guild
---
Tip to tip
---
I liked that it strapped across your back like that but I‚Äôm level 20 and have 2 9 dps swords because I went dual wield. Thanks though!
---
Rogue was almost accurate. You forgot PARRY and DODGE.
---
I like you
---
Just right click your character frame and go to move frame. Unlock the frame and then you can move it around. Same thing with the target one.
---
Yeah they are being secretive because they found a way to mass farm UBRS for extreme exp/hour. This whole dungeon grind thing is ruining classic, or at least the initial game. It's actually leaving me with a bad taste in my mouth from how shit this is. No offense to Apes they are just playing the meta, but fuck me this game sucks.
---
Honestly who cares... I personally haven't enjoyed retail since BC. I'm loving Classic. That doesn't mean retail isn't a good game for some people, it's just not for me. I've always missed the social aspect, the simplistic PvP style, the respected grind, etc. Most people don't act the way you're describing.
---
&gt;I can see them putting Classic on its own subscription too but offering a retail and classic option.
---
No way. Bad business. 
---
The only way activision makes it out of this one with retail still being the product they want to push is if the subscription for both remains the same. The need to make sure everyone playing classic right now is able to get into retail with a click of a few buttons without a different subscription plan.
---
Why? Because Retail is their product and they'll see it as the backbone of the wow brand. They'll manage the hit classic has caused to it by gaining subscribers to retail which is exactly what they've done.
---
The play book will be wait until the numbers settle and the chaos and hype dies. Then start pushing retail. Drop a massive expansion that somehow engages the classic population and generates hype and gets everyone back into retail. Keep the classic crowd happy with a small dev team providing updates to keep them engaged. 
---
If they play this right, this whole endeavour will result in more people playing retail wow and reinvigorating the wow brand for another 5 years. That's why classic dropped when it did. Bfa was stagnant and wow was really plateaued.
---
I do this but I went herb/alch so making a mana pot or two ain't too much off my back haha
---
I don't want it. I think it would splinter vanilla too much and make gear worthless and kill guilds all over again. Let people just go at their own pace for half a decade and then maybe consider it
---
Not Monday it's a holiday in the us lol. Itll get better Tuesday
---
I, myself, do not believed that the first rag down is possible the first week, but definitely the second. The fact that they already are in Mc is quite strange for me as I expect some people to farm the hydraxian rep, consumables and rf at least for the mt. They might be able to do it it seems...
---
This is actually part of why I went with a mage this go. I want to look at the game not bars and trackers.
---
Gotta say, level 7 was rough.
---
Aren't they though? Also world firsts doesn't mean shit, I have server first level 80 warlock from wotlk, my father still calls me a loser, fat ass burden in his ass.
---
If you prefer retail then play retail, save us a que slot
---
What do you mean by wand? I'm new and confused as a mage.
---
you can just log onto Gehennas and do /who, plenty of screenshots showing that they're inside at the moment
---
That‚Äôs your opinion, not a fact. Entirely subjective. I thought TBC was great and on par with Vanilla, but thats my opinion.
---
This has nothing to do with the community. You like retail more then classic. Go play retail.
---
Bags will be lucrative at the start as demand soars and supply is limited, but over time, demand will fall and supply will rise.  
---
Profits will decrease over time, but it's a golden opportunity at least temporarily right now.
---
Vanilla had a number of raw gearchecks in different instances and that Hunter required skillbook, Calming Shot or whatever to stop enrages in MC.
---
Knowing the fastest ways to get MC capable gear, attune and get in there will let them farm the skillbook and the hard gearchecks come a bit later, but they must have a fucking massive support structure of herb/cloth/enchanting farmers.
---
Well we do have a streamer in the guild (not a big one, but big enough to make living streaming) so I think that's the reason they picked Faerlina.
---
Yeah, but that's beside the point.
---
That's hilarious considering the amount of people saying the Spanish population would be so small u wont even notice it.
---
O NEDERLAND O NEDERLAND JIJ BENT MIJN KAMPIOEEEEN
---
This!
---
People act nice when they are happy, and right now we are still in the phase where everyone is estatic that classic is here. It will die off eventually (not classic , but the extreme friendliness)

Thats exactly why people say stuff like that. To make themselves feel better about the fact that it takes them months to get to 30
---
It isn't just 'some streamer' it's the guy who reached level 60 first.   If this was some post about asmon and soda fighting then yeah sure.
---
Some good things stayed. Mythic + is a great addition to the game. Just unfortunate that the loot system is so bad right now in retail.
---
so it was lightning but you heard the thunder...?
---
uhh the rake looks a lot cooler cause it has a mane :P
---
Until they get to instances and don't know how to manage aggro.  If memory serves me, many a hunter caused a wipe by pulling too much aggro back in vanilla.
---
You can stick with your shitty action rpg, we will stick with our mmorpg.
---
Oh snap. Thank you!
---
Because you take photos of your screen instead of taking a screenshot.
---
Just figure out what you like in the game and do it your own style, don't catch up with your husband. You don't even have to play same hours, you are already sharing the hobby with him and can discuss it - it's a huge plus. Should you get more experienced, both of you will find numerous opportunities for questing/leveling together.
---
must be nice being the (wo)man of the house.

Damn, she didn‚Äôt just make fun of you? Ya lucky duck!

Feral druid for sure

Log out
---
Apparently the rest of the comments seem to share the same opinion im describing.
---
Wisp Spirit masterrace.
---
Because the average player doesn't believe it takes months to "even set foot" into molten core moron!
---
Probably more with account sharing and people farming on their behalf.
---
Think you're getting the wrong point from what I am talking about. No one aoe farms dm from what I have seen unless you have a completely different experience from mine. The dungeons I was especially talking about aoe farming are stocks and parts of sm. I could care less if you run a dung multiple times with a buddy to get the gear you need. That's great. That is the point of running a dungeon. The point I was trying to make was that getting xp from a dungeon even in vanilla was an additive, not the end all be all but that is what it has become. Because I assume from reading your post you are not aoe farming yes? You are just regular clearing?
---
It was a giant lightning strike. A tree is totally broken
---
no its not. classic doesnt show target hp.

Just like JokerdTV attempting to delete his character right after getting world first 60 people can't comprehend the sacrifices others are willing to make for the memes. These people are willing to give all.
---
If they put new models, animations or spell animations in, I'd be out. The model revamps don't stay true to the original models at all. My Dwarf Hunter on live is a stranger to me. I also hate that animations are the same across all races along with plenty of the spell animation tweaks looking like straight up ass.   
---
I tried to play Retail while waiting for Classic and it just was- Bad. Sure, they have some gorgeous new environments but all the animals are on steroids now and all the characters look like some sort of weird Pixar rip offs in the worst way possible. I can't stand the aesthetic of Retail WoW's models at all.
---
You have  a toxic low effort meme juvenile  community in every game these days .
---
Do not make the mistake thinking that community is representative of the Classic wow community we love.   That real community is busy playing, organizing themselves in guilds and discords. 
---
Ignore  Twitch,  
---
Ignore stupid public forums.
---
join a good guild and become part of us!
---
The rogue sounds like the one I‚Äôd enjoy. Reagents over buffs.
---
That's why I don't rely on guides
---
At this level slice and dice probably isn‚Äôt worth it, but later on and especially with groups, instances and raids, it‚Äôs really important to pretty much always have slice and dice up. It‚Äôs situational though so like if you think you‚Äôll get more dmg out of eviscerate, then just eviscerate.
---
But if I‚Äôm just killing mobs one after the other, I would slice n dice at the end of one mob, so I‚Äôll have it up for the next mob.
---
You have the gall to show up without 69 copper and claim you beat the game?!
---
When it comes to ergonomics, instead of buying a desk, I bought various desk modifications on amazon. An adjustable keyboard tray and a proper monitor stand. Nowadays my joints and neck sit in a more neutral position and allow me to game for hours. On top of looking super classy the upgrades cost less than a 100$
---
I also perform various excercises meant to rehabilitate my forearms when I‚Äôm waiting around for a party to form. 
---
In case I do start feeling the tendons flair up I‚Äôll wrap an ice pack around the bad forearm and play that way. Usually fixes the issue. Haven‚Äôt had to use much ice since modding my desk though.
---
Farming those is my favorite way to make money. Sold one for 200g in TBC, and then in Cata they were going for like 7k. Farmed that, the green one, and disgusting ooze pets and bought flying for my friend group.
---
I wouldve spammed /2 for G sigs for at least 30 weeks to be able to pull that off!!
---
well yeah, it accomplishes the same thing as my idea, they have a chance to spawn every 5 minutes, which could also create the exact same level of rarity. Just didn't know how it worked.
---
Yeah for 2 silver on my realm lol. I'm sitting here with just over 1 gold at level 20, fml.
---
Now this is quality content
---
There weren‚Äôt xps for BGs in vanilla
---
Too bad they spend all that effort to be best in something that is utterly meaningless.
---
This guys pretty cool! You can tell cuz he called that other guy a loser.
---
I rather see something new for classic.   Keep it in the old world, no flying, don't obsolete vanilla content.
---
Yikes on all parts on this comment
---
1: Could not have missed the point of the convo harder if you tried.
---
2: Your last comment is what I am arguing for??? I literally don't think you understand that.
---
No one thinks that.
---
Then go enjoy the game and don't look at Reddit just like 90% of the population.
---
If you're planning on streaming it to your ohone, as long as the stream software you're using supports mouse and keyboard, then it should work.
---
You will kill plenty of defias and get the bandanas along the way:
---
&gt;I can‚Äôt wait till they get world ~~first~~ after only 5 days
---
No such thing as a world first now. It happened ~13-14 years ago. Since then, the game has been theorycrafted and practiced to death on private servers. Of course people can speedrun it now. They've been doing it for a decade.
---
The dungeon grinding ruining the leveling and world frist rag grind is honestly leaving me with a bad taste in my mouth. If I wanted to grind dungeons to no end I would be playing retail. I did 1-40 dungeon grinding and I was about to quit the game because of how fucking boring it is. I have all the respect to apes and it's fine that they are doing it, but fuck blizzard for keeping this in, I don't care how "blizzlike" it is.
---
Can't wait for people to be 60 and we can leave this shit behind us.
---
He is just another streamer, just happens to be good at speed running wow leveling.
---
Nah, didn't you get the memo? 
---
Bigglesworth is Alliance only realm!
---
ofc they're going to pretend now that they're wrong and pserver people have dominated so far.
---
Yep, retail is worse than bad
---
I love how the people who lived and breathed private servers are the ones being rewarded. I noticed the method guild had from what it looks like - a big production value budget. That isn't enough vs the people who spent enormous amounts of time on northdale, lightshope and nos :P
---
Queue times for my server are down to about an hour, I can live with that. You? You pray Blizz makes new realms and makes free xfers to them.
---
I preferres the boar charge all the way until bangladesh at 40. It‚Äôs so good in pvp to keep people in place.
---
This is why I play a priest. Love finding people dying and turning the tide of battle for them.
---
Shut the fuck up
---
&gt; So why do I want it?
---
i dont know that much but probably when you get two weapons with to-hit effects, lots of proc chances

This is perfection

You can't have your cake and eat it too. Activision can't get all the hate if blizzard gets all the love.
---
"You think you want [classic] but you don't" was blizzard.
---
I tried it. I‚Äôm the same. Like the lore and storytelling. The art is nice and they build awesome landscapes. The mechanics felt fresh from WoW which was the only MMO I‚Äôd ever played. But my friends never got on board and that‚Äôs the real reason to play MMOs.
---
Just go Netherwind, will be filled soon enough more than 51.978‚Ä¨ players in queue in the full servers atm according to wowhead... People will move out if they actually want to play
---
If I know shaman multiboxers, it's to make a chain heal pentagram

Hilariously, that video was propaganda about how Eviscerate did non-scaling flat damage.  Because of this, Rogues were falling behind in endgame content as their most powerful finisher did less and less relative damage while most other classes progressed with drops.  Most people weren't sympathetic to changing it, though, because "fuck Rogues."
---
So the video reframed it as "Look at how OP Rogues are!  They can kill people while naked!  Imagine how powerful he'd be with gear!"  Most people didn't know that Eviscerate being flat damage meant he wouldn't scale much with gear, they just saw a naked Rogue killing people and screamed for change.

I was just about to ask what addons you have OP
---
Your screen looks beautiful, or are you on a Mac (high retina/5k)
---
A few people that really understood their class and build could do that.
---
Most people just gimped the fuck out of themselves and were better off sticking to the cookie cutter builds.
---
That said, if being able to read icy veins gets me a raid slot over someone with the DPS of a magikarp I'm okay with that.
---
I‚Äôm not sure exactly when the change happened but for a while in vanilla normal 5 man instances could be done in raid form. Maybe the change happened in a later patch?
---
 Nice
---
And she looks much better in classic, although nothing beats her warcraft model
---
It isnt racism, but he is stereotyping. The dude isnt wrong though.
---
Nope, you can farm the rep for elementals in the world or farm the trash. You can totally get through the rep gate week 1.
---
I accidentally got honoured before I set foot inside because I farmed lots of elementals in sithilus while leveling... As well as taking some time before starting raiding.
---
My workschedule has been perfekt for classic launch, being able to play between 06-14 has worked out well.
---
Oh of course. Even the most cursory balance pass is far more work than Blizzard would ever be willing to commit, and it's not what the majority wanted anyway. This is all just a little thought experiment/opinion piece of what I personally would enjoy more.
---
But let's ask the question anyway, *why* would allowing hybrid classes to be more viable in specific roles be a bad thing? Because then everyone would only play them? I think that's ridiculous. It is perfectly viable right now in retail wow to do all druid raids. Do people do this? Sometimes, but it's still a novelty. For the most part, people play what they enjoy.
---
Let's take feral druid as an easy example. Making feral a competitive dps spec would be a simple change. "While in cat form, druids no longer gain attack power from strength, but gain additional attack power from agility."
---
"But druids are the only class with a bres!" I hear the purists say. "Druid dps *has* to be bad or the game will be nothing but druids!"
---
Well, over the years of retail development, Blizzard actually found a pretty elegant solution to this problem. A raidwide shared bres pool. Personally, I think that mechanic is perfectly reasonable and fair, and would nip that whole issue in the bud pretty well.'
---
Jeez, sorry for rambling so much at you, I guess I had more to say on the subject than I thought. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.
---
I've noticed the same thing but on horde, locks seem to be everywhere, I don't know if it's confirmation bias but I seem to see more locks than even rogues which surprised me
---
Haha shating
---
I understand what you are saying, its just bitter people being bitter, and there was a fair share of classic hate before. I'm just happy people got what they want, but i don't want retail to suffer because of it.
---
If you hated bfa lvling youll really hate classic lvling lol. Such a good game tho overall
---
WoW wasn't the fix.  I think finally giving up control and taking my hands off the wheel was the fix.
---
Pick up the quests, kill mobs in area to level and hope you get the drops needed to complete the quests for some bonus XP. 
---
If you outlevel the area before completing the quests and really don't want to go back then abandon quest then I guess, I was lucky enough to get the drops after a few rotations in most quests.
---
Used in a Rogue quest.

---
Meanwhile I gleefully stare down at his corpse. Ah, one less yolo blizzard to worry about.
---
They can reset trash I believe so it's a matter of time.
---
Yeah I myself think it's tedious. It's not something I like to do at all. At 60 it's fun to play but the lvl process in classic is not fun for me at least. 15 years back it was ok because they needed some kind of timegating to develop content. Today it's just boring.
---
Jesus christ i hope Trump starts a war you get drafted in.
---
In vanilla dungeons could be run with 10 . That is how it was in 1.12
---
No one reallt actually  role plays the minute-to-minute leveling
---
Because you are interested enough to try it out?
---
Cool detail
---
Not at all. What is says is there have already been a ton of changes to classic that the "no change community" has accepted or tacitly agreed to.
---
The sentence no changes is absolute. So these things can not coexist. But yet they do. Meaning one of them must be wrong.
---
The only time this sentence is true is that you are a no changer who believes in absolutely none of the changes that have been made and thus I think you represent a small minority of the no-change community
---
So, in conclusion, knowingly making a contradictory statement I find dumb ya.
---
As a level 7 warlock what‚Äôs the best/most efficient way for me to get a wand?
---
I'm the stupidity in my party... Warrior and mage fighting the same target, and then there's me crying for help as I run from a group of murlocs I accidentally got too close to...
---
I am the other way around. If I see somebody wearing cool gear in the game I know that player is actually wearing it rather than applying some skin onto an otherwise ugly piece of trash gear.
---
Probably still the Method hate-jerk going on, lol. I really doubt Method cares about actually getting WF in classic. They just came off a WF from retail. One boss in retail raids has more mechanics than every boss in MC lol. Not trying to diminish APES, obviously they've done this a ton though. Method puts a ton of prep into WF's on retail, same as I'm sure APES has done.
---
You‚Äôre very welcome! Feel free to reach out to me if you need any other macro help.
---
They  will just  farm  the rep in 1-2 days
---
Thank you.
---
Never said I loved Blizzard, just stating fact.  If they didn't think it would make money, we would not have it.
---
all the cathedral 10 mans on my realm were hitting 30-35k xp/h. Our 5 man doing cathedral was pulling 50-60k. :) get better
---
16s unless enchanting mats have exploded on your server, in which case take up enchanting and disenchant for riches.
---
Man. I would need more mouse room.
---
Why the fuck don't I look this cool
---
World firsts do matter they happend 14-15 years ago. Speed running something is not the same as getting world first. They'll be server first.
---
How can they get so many no lifers in one place lol.
---
Doubtful the first Rags kill will be tonight but next week is almost a sure bet.  IIRC you need the heads of four bosses from MC as a part of the quest chain to get the Aqual Quintessence.  And they're only good for one flame douse.  So they'd need multiple people to have this (and multiple kills of these bosses).  Which is not today.  It's also doubtful they have the reuseable version b/c that requires rep with the hydraxian waterlords and even then the cooldown is one hour so they'd need multiple people to have this already.
---
But grats to them!
---
hole up a SEX, Lemme get muh gin
---
Can confirm. My friend from that friends guild is confirming what undead is confirming
---
You just ignored half of the world by gender, another half of it by country(probably more because of population differences) and another half by age... So yeah, an average joe probably has no idea what wow is or knows its a pc game at best.
---
It doesn't work anymore cause Paladins used it as a bug and could deal stupid amounts of damage.
---
However you couldn't get exp, quest drops, or quest credit in raids.
---
Impressive.
---
&gt; At 20+, switch over to succubus for her better raw DPS (without reliance on mana like Imp).
---
You don't get succubus until 28?
---
This guide has you switch to succubus at 30.

---
But is it likely the mass majority speak English? I just remember how awful it was to play WoW when the majory of your group only spoke Spanish.
---
The night watch in duskwood is pretty Game of Thronesie
---
It‚Äôs still there but it can be done in such a way that you grind rep off certain elementals out in the world prior to 60. Then you get the quests to kill bosses and then finally you can get the waters. It can be done first week.
---
The quest log is usually pretty good at saying where to go. Makes it a lot more engaging to have to read the log than just having an arrow point you where to go.
---
I just wowhead the ones that make no sense.
---
Just wait one week. Seriously. Seven days and you'll be fine.
---
My honored what?
---
There was a raid xp penalty in vanilla.  Not sure about money but the xp was.
---
How much are those on ah right now?
---
Boar pets have a taunt that always works
---
I think so too. I probably got extremely lucky finding him from the first layer I got invited to after discovering he wasn't in my initial layer. It was only a matter of seconds if I made it into the place before he hits 60 lol. I just used our SM groups "food break" like this for shits and giggles. Respect to the broadcaster himself and all, peace lol. ps. 40lvl warrior PoV: [https://clips.twitch.tv/FunnySoftHareRuleFive](https://clips.twitch.tv/FunnySoftHareRuleFive)
---
So you ran a dungeon with 10 people?
---
You anti-SJWs sure do trigger easily. Sorry man, your racism isn't "logical" just because you think it's true. Saying "Chinese people are cheats the same way black people are black" is a pretty fucking loaded statement.
---
Okay? So anything that, in your mind, doesn't compare to vanilla isn't worth mentioning? 
---
Vanilla is good in some ways, and terrible, so terrible in others. Legion is, in much the same way good in some aspects of the game and worse in others. 
---
What strikes me as odd is how people raise Vanilla to the skies, when in truth, there are certain ways to play the game that isn't even viable. There's an entire shapeshift for druids that isn't even ever touched because it's seen as so bad, it's hardly even worth talking about...
---
MISS
---
Must be different in classic because I tried to name my pet Blizzard in BfA for my hunter "Activizion" and it wouldn't let me. 
---
Happy this guy got it!
---
Minus that weapon, I‚Äôm wearing the same exact gear.
---
I feel the same way you do about the lore, but I believe we‚Äôre the ones with the unpopular opinion.
---
Already answered this in other comments see below to read them. 
---
Also, I never said I would quit the game over this nor did I say this was a massive issue. Was more just something to talk about. 
---
Also, do you find it ironic that the guy calling me a baby in a post seems to be the most outraged over anyone just talking about changing a game we play online?
---
Why would method care? Method is getting paid to play WoW, and these guys took a week vacation from work to play WoW. Sounds like method is doing fine.
---
yeah this guy just made up a random scenario that we get ownd in, not how it actually goes tho lol
---
Paladin quest required you to take the enchanted feed to dire maul and feed the horse after the tree boss in DM West
---
Games hard amirite?
---
Vanilla actually had a really good lfg addon. I forgot its name but it basically scanned Gen chat and lookingforgroup chat and aggregated it in an easy to read window.
---
lol everything is meaningless
---
A hope?
---
A chance..
---
Damn! I've seen a lot of Dwarf priests that look like this
---
Why? It improves gameplay by providing clearcut directions to your objective. Why would you not want to know where an objective is?
---
There‚Äôs just something missing from it. It‚Äôs not a bad game, I just found it to be hollow and depressing for some reason. Yes, the color palette does not help.
---
Yeah but it was all over in about 15mins and you had to wait a patch to get the next 15min part.
---
Farm gear, rep, gold. get rank 14.
---
Same. I grinded my unarmed skill to 95 today. I like skilling weapon types.
---
I've been playing since vanilla but idk wtf toxic behavior this game has brought out in people
---
Me a as a hunter trying the best I can. 
---
Make sure to try and save the healer if the tank is caught with his pants down.
---
Ohgee is one of the ones that made me roll mage 
---
https://youtu.be/mRWwcyx3m1k
---
https://youtu.be/DET22trX5zM
---
I can relate, I had my first experience healing in RFC, there was a shaman who refused to take off Rockbiter, continually pulling aggro off the tank.
---
At first I did my best to keep the two of them up, the mage had given me plenty of conjured water, bless his soul. Eventually though, when he didn't stop, I just stopped healing him.
---
Watching him get Goomba Stomped was a very cathartic experience, I will admit to that. Is this what healers are supposed to feel like? Because I like it.
---
Imagine the confusion when someone yells Blizzard in raid during Saph?! Lol.
---
No u /spit
---
WoW classic has a lot of things that Vanilla WoW didn't like transparent, reflective water. If you go back far enough it didn't even have weather effects. The thing that still amuses me to this day is that the sun and shadows don't move.
---
Did you win a loot roll or how did you get it?
---
At the top there's Eu.battle.net just change it to NA.battle.net to get the account stuff idk about launcher
---
Sounds like a lot of the same issues I took with ESO. Just bit the bullet and started my subscription to WoW so we‚Äôll see how this goes!
---
I literally no longer care what items are named anymore because i'll forever be transmogged to my t10 set and nobody else has their plain armor on either. Show me a picture of many vanilla items and I can tell you what that person's wearing without even having to inspect.
---
Also, another main point to think about it more simplistically is should level 2 wolfs drop the best gear in the game. Probably not. Why because it is a bad game design. Should dungeons which are not meant for giving xp give the best xp in the game probably not. So as you can see this argument in literally only 1 way has a fun/utility aspect to it. So this argument really has little to nothing to do with "peoples fun is wrong"
---
Any moron can search for the guild and then [change the text at the bottom](https://i.imgur.com/xZ14JxV.png), this is not proof at all. Why wouldn't you also show a shot of the Who panel showing the zone?
---
I call bullshit, or at least for more proof.
---
I can fully agree with a barber at least for hair styles and color.
---
I think he needs to Lok on the na page .. maybe Google on it .
---
I know there is a buzzard help page on it .. I'm not home or I would look
---
I had an idea like this where you simply add new servers for each expansion
---
Those servers do not include any old content. Once you hit max level on the previous expansion you can copy your characters from the previous one or make a new character who starts at the base level to start that expansion's content
---
So for example once you hit level 60 on Classic you unlock a TBC server. On a TBC server there is only Outland, the intro cinematic explains what's going on as it swoops through Blasted Lands and through the portal where you start at the stairs of destiny at level 58. You cannot go to old Azeroth, Kara, Azuremyst, and Eversong would have a portals in Shattrath. A draenei or blood elf character would have to complete their starting zones and once they complete it will be bumped to 58 and dropped in Outland. A copied character will retain major items they already had (mounts, armor, stuff like that, no gold) and will be bumped to 58 if they were lower or stay level 59 or 60 if above

Only time I've been rezzed my ghost was literally right there...didn't even think to ask.

Are you high, just trolling or what? Also what reason would I have to lie about getting the succubus so early?
---
There is a plethora of wrong information because of private servers. I‚Äôm tanking 5 mans as a holy paladin like it‚Äôs cake. Fun times guys! Explore those classes with depth !
---
Edit: spelling
---
118 times and no proc? The chances of that are insanely low. That's .8 ^ 118.
---
He would AoE farm large groups of mobs. Then rather than wait 5 min (or whatever it is) for them to respawn naturally, he would get invited to different layers (basically like a parallel universe) where those mobs were already spawned, eliminating the need to wait.
---
Getting a wand asap is a massive help. The wand is the key to zero downtime.
---
It's very effective more often than not. I prefer it over just kicking them for being dumb. This way they can learn.
---
I think they used to have a model like that in China for a while. I‚Äôd be in favour of more options, just as long as they keep the ones they already have.
---
Wow. My queue time was on average 3-5 hours
---
The idea is great, but not realistic. It would divide the classic community.
---
I got so annoyed in the Barrens reading people talking about what they should do next in classic. Like at least wait until all phases are released and people are sick of naxx.
---
Great Barrens reply "You guys don't know what's going to happen because your names not Michael Blizzard."

---
No :((
---
To be fair I try to invite anyone I can. It makes doing the quest so much faster when 5 people are able to tag mobs at once.
---
Lots of people did it. Even more people knew you could do it simply by being curious enough to try. Was common knowledge in my classic experience
---
No. It's very difficult to do with Orc as well.
---
The goal is to trade 1:1 with a slow weapon, but what actually happens is that you trade attacks, and then the mob will get a second attack on you before you can actually exit melee range in most situations now, as they hit you from a very long range.
---
I've been actually trying to test this on live classic, so this isn't just speculation, and I know how the technique is supposed to work. For what its worth, it also makes "Earthbind Kiting" with Shaman not very effective too, which I've also tested.

I'm running Ryzen 1700 + RX480 and seeing these freezes... my fps is locked at 100, so i'm not seeing it drop like that - just feels like everything gets stuck for a moment and input lags.
---
Jokes on you. I‚Äôm gonna take so long to level to 60 that by that time phase 2 will have dropped
---
I mean however you enjoy the game, I guess.
---
'twas burning crusade actually.
---
Normally not hard to find out in a server's subreddit / discord. The info won't ever come from Blizzard.
---
Wow that's great lol
---
It's really simple. Classic is overhyped and retail is getting more hate atm because of bandwagon people whether either side actually agrees. Personally I'm on the classic side because bfa is unrewarding in all aspects and benthic gear is a big feelsbad, I'm done with it until classic is shut down or if a truly great back to roots expansion.

Yes sir!
---
Copyright is fucked anyway. You can't steal something that doesn't exist anymore, Nostalrius was simply providing a service that Blizzard wasn't.
---
Yes, that's a Blizzard problem. It's unreasonable to tell people to pay $15 a month to play a 15 year old game that we were already getting for free. Nobody in their right mind would pay $15 for some random PS2 game but yet we're supposed to do that every month for this shit. Give me my private servers back.

Meanwhile I'm slowly selling deviate delight 2 stacks and making a killing.

People balk at the price of a 20 stack but will drop a few silver on a 2 stack.

Made about 2 gold per hour so far.

Thank you Minkelz, never heard of either of these before!

So much this.  Threat is controlled by dps.  You break it; you bought it.  And you can spend the time you‚Äôre running back thinking about what you did, because I‚Äôm a druid and my rezzes are for tanks only.

Australian barrens chat is absolutely amazing. I have never seen such prolific use of the word c\*nt in an online game and it's glorious.

Apparently people can use layering to farm hydrax rep so it sort of affects world firsts.
---
I used to have mages go all out dps after i get 1 or 2 sunders. If the warrior knows right skill rotation nothing can pull aggro.
---
I've never seen your meme on here, but 99% of the memes are low effort by the standards of the rules. If the mods here want to have a hard-on for removing posts and mine gets removed, I'll be more than happy to leave the subreddit just like I left r/wow. Communities that have overzealous rules ironically have the shittiest and most redundant posts.
---
To be honest, I legit feel this way reading some of the queue posts, I didn't plagiarize yours. Most humor if not said by one person will be said by someone else. Thoughts are never original, at least ones that resonate with other people.
---
Gotcha. Super excited to get started. I know we'll never top the meters, but shamans make everyone elses' lives so much easier with all of their support. Plus multi windfury prots in PvP &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
---
Why is faster attacking pet better then, if damage was normalized?
---
So good dude. Soooo fucking good.
---
Absolutely
---
Lvl 13 warr, died probs 30 times today. I just die to most stupidest of places, like end of cave that crawls with mobs.
---
It's very nice to see people but they may as well be NPCs because getting anyone to talk or group is like pulling teeth.
---
I keep hearing about this might need to try it out.
---
Absolutely dungeons should be the best xp in the game what the hell are you talking about. They tick all the boxes for increased xp gains:
---
Requires more players (xp literally has group bonuses)
---
The content requires organised play (as in, the dungeons will kill you because they are hard)
---
The content has bosses which *have* mechanics (bosses should be worth more xp to kill, as they are bosses, rares in the world give increased xp)
---
Most if not all the mobs are elite (increasing xp yield)
---
Dungeons are a significant time commitment (40-60 minutes+)
---
Dungeons have quests associated with them, increasing xp yield further
---
They are concentrated dens of enemies (a gnoll camp is worth more xp than a lone bear)
---
Your argument of "dungeons should not be worth more xp because they aren't designed to be" is backwards. They ARE designed around being worth more xp.
---
The joys of being a healer in classic wow! UI can cover you‚Äôre entire screen. If you die to standing in fire, just demand a B-Rez.
---
it was \^\^
---
Warriors are consistently good at end game but are tough to level. Druids are the opposite. If you like healing, resto is viable but Druids didn‚Äôt really become the powerhouse they are until TBC. They are very much playable but comparing to warriors in vanilla is rough.
---
Thanks, been looking for a QuickStart guide like this.

Thanks dude!
---
Are they at ragnaros? Can you skip other bosses? I really can‚Äôt remember
---
The real question you need to be asking is what will happen come Phase 2 when layering is removed and there's 20k+ people trying to login.
---
Black Dragonscale gear is really good for hunters and enhancement shamans when you're starting MC because it has fire resist. People paid good money for it back in 2005.
---
Nice! I played on a train ride in France today. Wasn‚Äôt too bad, some severe lag spikes but got to level and quest
---
If someone does this to me more than once then you better believe I'm following them and putting recklessness on every mob they attack.
---
Lanetime warrior pvp vids. They were art.
---
Rank 14 is in Phase 2.
---
Aw thanks buddy, i'm on it. I've reported 8 of them just today and 3 yesterday.
---
What‚Äôs your /played though? Level 30 seems pretty high for right now
---
It‚Äôs something that you‚Äôre born into
---
for most people it would take months to level to 60 so yeah I think it takes months to step into MC
---
Yo! You play Horde on Gehennas, right? I saw you running to the cleft of shadow just about an hour ago.
---
He isn't, they also terrorize and control a lot of online games as well.  When Atlas first launched they had Galleons within hours because they were just duping a bunch of shit and because of that they were able to just terrorize everyone.
---
It's definitely not more fun to do, but undoubtedly results in more dps since all you do is add free melee swings whilst keeping the same wand speed.
---
Assuming Blizz doesn't offer char transfers and/or guild transfers...it's only going to get worse on those servers.  Sure, people will roll off but I don't think it's going to be that much.  I fully expect classic to have more active/sustained accounts than retail has just b/c it's such a better game.
---
I can't wait for layering to be removed.
---
\&gt;Every retail shitter : No OnE WiLl KiLl RaG BeFoRe FiRsT ReSet

I'm not salty at you, I'm salty at the mods for being inconsistent. They should either leave these posts alone, or remove all of them in a timely manner.
---
Those rewards look like crap Im better off paying for nicer ones in town
---
You got literally 0 xp in raids?
---
I see what you mean, theres a setting under graphics where it's (classic) and it has the OG graphics if you prefer. 
---
Between that and the Quality of Life changes, Classic WoW is infinitely more "blizzlike" than any private server.
---
Im on alliance Kirtonos. Looks good, always med/high and never long queues. Lots of friendly people
---
That link is not updated for classic .. but if he starts a us starting edition then pays a sub he should be able to download classic .. he can buy game time of the us store once done
---
Thank you, I‚Äôll give this a look over and forward it to my friends to see if it helps.
---
This guy is basically the equivelant of the guy who stands on the corner screaming judgement day is coming, the end is nigh.
---
I feel for you. I'm warrior. I'd murder for swipe. People have no idea how to play classic apparently &gt;.&lt; mages are the worst. Before I'm even in contact with the mobs to start using AoE then run oom before anything dies. Meanwhile the pull is fucked and aggro is all over the place. Worst, healers keep enabling them by healing them. Just let them bite the dust.
---
But we also have very limited raid potential. So that sucks as most raids will take like 2 tops. But then you can just solo mara at cap and make bank for your other characters that can actually raid.
---
Uhh how would that even work? If you stay on the same server it would be like playing classic when bc came out. It would ruin classic content when I could go get 61 gear and dominate world pvp.
---
Now all of China knows you're here!
---
Any time let me know how it goes üòä
---
I think a subscription model for a game is not good. The best is if the game goes f2p. The market right now is f2p games. Alot of games get their money through a vip system or something like alot of games or a battlepas system like fortnite etc
---
Remember to get those first points in wand spec and Spirit Tap for quick and easy solo leveling üòÅ

Very nice.

Thankfully no queue times yet!

Queues are fine or nonexistent on several servers. Just don‚Äôt play on one of the servers that stay full if you‚Äôre that worried about queue times
---
people forget the huge rag nerf that allowed the first kill to happen. i dont know which patch classic is running but rag was a literal cockblock until the nerf
---
Same here actually but this time my rls went horde so I joined them. Getting alot of hate messages from my old alliance buddies. But this is my first time playing horde so it's all "new" to me.
---
I've tried the fun leveling games people made to make it harder like iron man and some of my own I made even but never got hooked like classic had
---
I never actually played in real classic but being physically unable to have the option to get good gear and lots of money from the start and being excited over a white gear upgrade makes me feel like I'm a noob at the game again 
---
Even after mop they made it stupid easy to get greens everywhere from nearly every quest so it's not as slow as classic was
---
You missed blue foreign letters ?
---
25 of them online at L60 in MC right now. Who are the other 15? PuGs?
---
Hamstring kiting.

You shouldn't just stand there and trade hits

This is so wholesome ‚ù§
---
100g!?  In classic?  Shit I know its a trap for *100g* I'm still tempted to pm this guy.
---
Because I was going for week 1 rag, but no accomplishment is worth this shit.
---
100% agree. Although it makes you feel very useful putting in so much effort.
---
Sub 10 sucks ass on a lot of classes. I.e. hunters don‚Äôt even get their pet until then which is the whole point of the class. You just gotta do whatever to scrape by by the early levels.
---
*Laughs in Feign Death*
---
They are killing him right now, he's bellow 50%
---
Method make a big deal out of being the best, hosting races, first to 60/rag etc and they've been blown the fuck out by people most players have never heard of (unless you're aware of the private server scene and the top players in it).  
---
I don't think they'll be pissed but it's a pretty sad look for them when their dedicated streamers/racers are being destroyed on every front. But they deserve it for sponsoring players who couldn't care less about WoW and plan to quit the instant the race is over.
---
R14 before p2? Yeah about that...
---
Sounds like a challenge.
---
Nolifing a video game for 14+ hours a day for a week straight is pretty hardcore.
---
method on suicide watch lol
---
YOU got the name! Which server?
---
Personally I dont think its that impressive compared to back then. Having 10+ years of practice isnt as amazing as doing it pretty much blind especially when you consider how limited resources were back in the day, theres like all this info now, multiple guides on how to do things, it lessens the achievement by a ton.  
---
These people are just retreading old ground, its not that amazing.
---
Earth shock has high threat
---
TBC and Wrath were probably the best iterations of the classes.  Rose timted goggles aside, druids without res is pretty bad, as is sub rogue without shadowstep.  Warlock is great, but seed of corruption will be missed.  SoC in BC was the perfect skill for all situations.
---
That said, I would not want Classic to transition into BC.  I would rather they just open up a BC server in the same vein as Classic, and give people the option to move on or not.
---
Wot is this.

I was on parse with them until I decided it wasn't worth it. The "professional" scene is vital for any competitive game, and it being broken by this dungeon crap is a big blow.

I can't tell what your wearing, I have no way to gauge your power level, seeing those shiny ass t3 shoulders and saying "wow I want those, those look so good" is gone now too for the most part. There's alot of reasons why transmog is bad. Alot of reasons why it's nice too.
---
Some progression guilds I've been in had rules about your character name.
---
That shaman one got me.
---
You sir will be a good priest, lol.
---
Is it even possible to grind the rep this fast?
---
EDIT: I forgot the one-use essence at honored, for some reason I thought you had to be revered for essences.
---
yes it was, but they toned it down from 5 to 2
---
Benediction has been great
---
Where is the proof that this is not a private server
---
I'm a single guy playing after work about 4~5 hours daily. I level doing whatever quest while leveling up professions (farming mats myself) and doing dungeons and RP whenever.
---
my priest hit level 20 yesterday.
---
not everyone is focused on speed leveling some people just want to enjoy the game in their own way.
---
Not open until phase 3.
---
Bigglesworth ftw, longest queue i had was 20 min
---
Looks like layering is heavily abusable and you underestimated the power of no lifers.
---
Full guild is already in MC clearing. Rag prolly dies tomorrow while Method isn't even level capped.
---
AH on my server had lesser for like 5-6 silver. Especially early on wand is more throughout when you factor in pushback. It‚Äôs worth taking a detour to go grab one early as soon as you can afford it.
---
there is none, just type /console and then the command line
---
I don‚Äôt play a Paladin but I‚Äôm good with macros. What do you want this to do?
---
What is a VOD?
---
Premieres 8pm tonight!

&lt;APES&gt; just killed him =)
---
Oh he dead
---
You get put on your guilds layer, but if you join someones group from another layer then you switch layers. This isn't rocket science.
---
They wiped
---
Lock pets absolutely can tag mobs in vanilla/classic.
---
They just downed him.
---
what the fuck
---
nice
---
No, it's not.
---
Yes!!! in 2 minutes, u dont think that is amazing?
---
Scattershot before I applied my first sunder. That's what I think of now when I see hunters :D
---
Copyright still exists on any work until 70 years after the creators *death.* That service, which was an earlier version of an *existing IP btw,* is still owned by blizzard. Those laws don't go poof because you're angry you have to cut out two whole McDonald's meals a month to play your game. 
---
And judging by how popular it is, plenty of people would pay it. They ARE paying it.

Absolutely most insane display of mechanics I have ever seen by the mages. Frostbolt &gt; Frostbolt &gt; Frostbolt
