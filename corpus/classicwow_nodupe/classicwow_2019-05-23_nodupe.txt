It is tho? Or at least thats what blizz said. If you know more then blizz then thats impressive

Nah, guild mate of mine is currently in - meanwhile I'm stuck at creating my character.
---
Same here
---
Yeah, I'm seeing a lot of posts here by people who don't seem to get what a stress test is. There are a lot of people who seem to think beta access is just a tourist lookyloo early access themepark.
---
Well we have a even higher ping to get to the servers. I kinda expected something similar. Keep on trying in a few hours we will be able to join.
---
I guess so, i'm checking since an hour ago and didnt find any EU player logged in
---
I've been stuck in character creation for the last 20mins lol
---
Phew you sound more and more like a tool. I wonder really whose closer to the childhood. Looking at you, you're probably in your 20s and never even touched vanilla...
---

---
Either way, since you are still just twisting around the words to fit your narritive i'll just call it a night. People like you are the reason why Blizzard has gone to shit. You're fucking dumb and you don't even realize it. Don't get hit by a parked car, mate. You look like the kinda fella that manages to do exactly that.
---
same
---
^This   
---
Only thing that makes sense, unless Blizzard gave them special access that let them log on (seems doubtful).
---
Still 1 hour and no luck boys !!!!

What a joke. How can you stress test a server when you cant even code up the login server right?
---
its an hour into the 2 hour test and i havent even seen character creation
---
Vael's also high on the list because there's no real way to kill him without some deaths

same for me... stuck on creating character (EU, Germany)

You're disappointed because you misunderstood the point of the test?
---
Yeah that what I was thinking of pvp. Also all edgy kids roll undead so maybe there is change hex wont get nerfed..
---
Its just pve mostly, I think overall berserkin might be more lifesafer than wotf. Maybe wotf slightly better early months.
---
I do 80% pve so.. But yeah troll it is.

I'm on EU, still stuck at character creation, can't get in

[removed]
---
I'm giving up soon. It's clear that Blizzard is not going to allow me past character creation screen tonight.
---
Good man/woman, I'm in the same circle of chaos. We gotta suffer through this so live goes well.
---
Can only imagine when Naxx gets released..
---
If you've been chilling in that screen for more than like 15 minutes, the server is locked. No new characters can be created.
---
Did said guild mate have access to the beta prior to today? As in, has he been granted beta access rather than just during the stress test? From what I've gathered, it appears if only those with prior access has been able to connect and create a character so far.
---
&gt;tanking suboptimally as a druid while leveling
---
In what world does a Druid tank suboptimally while leveling? If anything Druids have it easier tanking during leveling because their tank and leveling DPS specs are pretty much the same.
---
No matter what you do, you will have a tough time getting a tank spot in raids, for sure. There are always too many tanks in raids and not enough in dungeons. You will tank in dungeons no problem no matter which class; for raiding, you're going to have to decide between Fury War or Resto Druid. 
---
Unless you want to heal, and then the above is all out the window.
---
If that was your point, all that tells me is people like yourself are complaining because someone can play the game better than you. Yes, influence and social aspects are part of massively multiplayer online games.

That doesn't mean they need more people to do this. A controlled enviroment might be simply better instead of an overpopulated one. With a thousand tickets on the same issue that's simply wasting time.
---
And who sad they needed 40man to test the raids? This can be simply done by 1 dev, just like they did with Dead Mines.

It's more about testing the architecture. I have vendors I support at work who have been in business for decades who will have a tiny update and everything breaks
---
I've called it a night its 1am and I'm getting nowhere sucks that I'll miss out on what ever event the gms had in mind
---
Then I guess you havent watched him in the past 3 years?
---
still cant get in, says server is locked

Misleading as fuck. Like 4 of those expansions were super close. Ironically, BC/MoP were the best 2 expansion by far and they sold the fewest copies.  
---
People went to try WoD/Legion/BFA because they kept promising a return to the basics. Same as Cata, in fact. SINCE WotLK, every expansion (except MoP) has been Blizzard promising a return to the basics. Remember everyone in Cata saying "I cant wait because dungeons will be hard again and epics will be epic again!"
---
If you got it, guess what you are probably on a layer and release could be this crowded. If each layer has 3k people on it, guess how many players per starting zone that is.... still too many. What we'll need for a smooth start is probably layering and early zone sharding within the layer. Or they need to crank down the max people per layer for the first day or two. Be lucky you got in, I still have not successfully created a character.
---
Now the ST server is ‚Äúoffline‚Äù...
---
Yup. Same for me. Still have a hope though :D
---
When I click back to realm list it shows offline, might be part of the problem. I mean we are stress testing and doing our part.
---
People just want somewhere to complain dude it‚Äôs not that deep
---
same.
---
üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
Gonna keep trying, it'll unlock eventually and hopefully then I'll get in :)
---
IM JUST DOING MY PART DAMMIT!
---
havent even gotten that far, just made second queue. 4000 people...
---
Real status.....locked.  Doing my part.
---
Any time you set up a new set of servers you have to stress test. This could be anything from old code to a network provider issue.
---
Fatboss guide next week!
---
This is such a dumb argument. Most people on twitch watch streams for the gameplay, not the streamer. Asmon got 100k viewers streaming Classic WoW because he happened to be the first stream in the directory, if he decided to transition to OSRS the next day, he would hardly have a 5th of that viewer count.
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 180, you Sicilian schmuck. If I did a 360, I‚Äôd turn completely around and end up right back where I started.‚Äù
---
So what you're saying is, the stress test is doing it's job?  
---
you realise logging in and character creation etc are apart of the stress test, when thousands of people are trying to do the same thing, not just in game stress testing.
---
Seriously.... been here for 20min.
---
&gt; Did said guild mate have access to the beta prior to today?
---
He did indeed.
---
amazn
---
world first lol, pretty sure this happened in 2004 ya idjits
---
Same. Started in 2005, no invite :( I got into the stress test but I‚Äôm at work sooooo
---
I mean, is saying that he doesn't want to participate in the problem the same thing as whining about it?
---
Yes.
---
I guess that makes sense. Mostly just bummed I couldn‚Äôt even create a character. Whatever. August it is
---
manlet spotted

NA is locked out as well

The number of people that don't get this blows my mind.

Although, I kinda like my GM's (joking) theory:  There is no actual in game stress test...they just need to test login servers, but are just SAYING we can login and get to 5 as a fake carrot on a stick b/c if they said they just wanted people to spam login no one would.

---
Haha, I finally got in and can design my mage!!!... Wait, what does *Character creation timed out* mean, and why does it pop up 2 minutes after I click *Accept*?
---
Am I in hell?
---
Also EU, Character creation timed out for around 40 min now
---
You're doing a lot of non questing if it takes you 10+ hours to ding 60 from 59 lol.
---
You're better off disconnecting and then re-connecting again. at least you're stressing that way. It's not hard to get to that screen.
---
it's just beta people in general, and yes a lot of those are streamers
---
Either we are just more people trying to log in on the eu, or US has better servers, because US are getting in just fine, but i havent been able to log in yet and play for 1 hour and 3 minutes so far.
---
I agree but the mob gonna spam you with downvotes for calling them out like thisüòÇ
---
MmoS aRE DeAd
---
What we are seeing right now is literally the definition of hype. This means absolutely nothing. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Lets see what the numbers look like 6 months from now.
---
Fake. You can‚Äôt loot something if you‚Äôre not targeting it
---
Fucking bullshit.
---
Getting to Realm List - It's locked.
---
No idea if that's regional.
---
I finally gave up. I only have so much WoW time tonight so... :(
---
You have no context at all dude lol. The guy originally said everyone who think he should hang with the girl is thirsty AF. So just because I think he should hang with the girl, you equate that to me saying it will ruin the relationship? Gtfo you little shit lol. I literally said it could be people who value healthy relationships who would opt for hanging with the girl, not necessarily ‚Äúthirsty af‚Äù.
---
"LOL OMG WE COULD GO BEFORE CLASS"
---
yeah got to character creation twice and never further always gets stuck there
---
does it matter if we pick wow1 or wow3?. I haven't been able to find info on this
---
We still have shitposting friend, they can't take that away from us
---
Languishing in queue is part of the stress test.
---
They will take the info they need to from these to ensure the queue and servers are stable on launch so when you do get in you stay in.
---
You might have missed the post before it was deleted here, but it was just a guy asking about the server status "locked" and if that meant the test was over. He was genuinely just seeking information, and had a bunch of smartasses respond with "This is the point of a stress test" rather than read and answer his question. 
---
He wasn't complaining.
---
Stress test invite isn‚Äôt the same as beta invite by the way
---
Character creation timed out! Gaaaaaahhhh
---
It's only streamers online
---
Mine is showing offline now
---
yet all the big streamers are conveniently in and playing :thinking:
---
Do I back out and try again or keep spamming "Accept"?
---
 Asmon had the locked status earlier on stream but got in with other people
---
I was able to 2 man it with an enhancement shammy (I was a priest), I was the only one raid geared too.
---
Grow up
---
it's not, the tank can't hit the target at all, everything is a miss/resist, but the healers heals aren't, so guess who gets all the threat.
---
I tried to log in countless times and never got past the character creation screen. I gave up when the relam was decleared to be offline but streamers were still able to play just fine. I am in EU.
---
&gt;Due to extreme load, this is temporarily being shown to everyone as a logged out user would see it
---
Straight from the website too. Forums are done
---
You are correct in that ilvl is a poor indicator of quality in Classic WoW, and indeed in BC and LK too. Quality is determined by all of:
---
\- ilvl (total stat budget)
---
\- ideal stats (+heal, +spell, +agi, whatever is good)
---
\- weight of those stats (heavy +heal, +hit, whatever)
---
\- use/passive effect (these can be amazing)
---
It can definitely be the case that you wear a lower ilvl item that has excellent stats, or covers a big chunk of +hit or has an great effect.
---
It's also the case that you might wear different gear for different fights. Tanks can gear for threat or mitigation, healers can gear for throughput or regen, DPS might fiddle around with +hit and damage to find the optimal balance depending on the items they have.
---
So it's also definitely the case that you can't judge someone by the ilvl of their gear., and it takes a bit of thought to gear yourself well.
---
server full or locked, congrats to all the streamers and their stupid army of followers. Not like they already have full beta access, nah they had to ruin it for everyone else.
---
Hi, /u/abedagi
---
I have two experiences with druid tanking: we had a well geared druid in BWL in vanilla, held threat well, took little damage. And then I had a Druid tank on pserver in BFD. That guy took a bunch of damage but held threat. Could heal him well enough as enhance shaman though. Might have been gear, level, and pserver mobs being overtuned. I think in classic, druid tank will be pretty viable.
---
Not saying you have to play that but it‚Äôs a good option. Problem might be that most people might expect you to raid as a healer. Don‚Äôt know if that is something you care about
---
Yeah I'm not mad about not being able to get in. I'm mad that all the streamers got in and no one else can.
---
I understand stress testing. I just wanted to know if I should relog or keep trying accepting character creation.
---
&gt;he‚Äôs a nobody 
---
Wow. The arrogance.
---
people like you man...............
---
I wish it was anomalous
---
Server's been offline for me.  I gave up 30 minutes ago, try every 15.  
---
It's not happening.  I'll just wait til release.
---
I logged in while the server was "locked." Stuck at character creation now.
---
the email i got said i can play until thursday. 
---
 The *World of Warcraft Classic* Closed Beta realms will be down for the duration of the test. Once the stress test period is over, you‚Äôll be able to continue playing on the stress test realm (up to level 5) until Thursday, May 23.
---
Are Brits still in the EU? I thought they left.
---
I was at work... I hate they waited until the literal day before to send out invites.
---
Oh well maybe I'll get into the next one.
---
It does less damage and you can tank has fury or arms. You could still level prot but you won't be has efficient.
---
No it isn‚Äôt, people who have actual beta invites have 3 servers to choose from, beta pvp, beta pve, and stress test
---
Stress test
---
Right. And non-streamers can't even create a character, I'm stuck on character creation and nothing :(
---
Yea this was a let down, can't even be part of the stress test
---
I mean the whole don't care about wow but just the streamer is a false statement. Asmon is at 80k rn, you're telling me that he's always at 80k even without classic?
---
Haha, just waiting on this queue like everyone else.
---
https://i.imgur.com/eHZgkJ2.gifv
---
I dont know ? Ask blizzard :D if it would be for no use they would close those to.
---
I was just joking with you my dude. Was supposed to be a touch of classic nostalgia.
---
Kill me
---
Haha I guess it is, I had totally forgot
---
Well, I‚Äôm stressed.  So I guess they passed the test.
---
Maybe this is intentional?
---
hey this isn't a complaint about the stress test
---
LOL I literally posted to a discord IH ave and was like "look I'm back in vanilla for sure!" :D
---
Pepperidge farms remembers. 
---
And yes on Illidan we 100 percent called it VC, even before Dire Maul was a thing
---
how does this counter anything? everyone said it will explode for first few months
---
Gave me goosebumps.
---
oh well. :D i'm good either way. thanks for being that guy
---
of course. streamer privilege.
---
I think you have time now hahaha
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
No, you're in a server that's being ripped apart at the seams by all of the traffic.
---
I'm just amused at the login attempts, I keep getting to a new problem. Which is fine, didn't expect to play. I now get to character select and try to create, the button doesn't do anything, then it says creation timeout. Tried reloggong, now the server shows offline. Gonna keep trying for testing purposes.
---
Does anyone know where those participating in the stress test might go to see if Blizzard‚Äôs server team is trying to communicate with those trying to get in? I am guessing somewhere on bnet. If anyone knows please post answer
---
Deadmines came before Dire Maul, and it was called DM before Dire Maul even existed.
---
Furthermore, Dire Maul should never just be called Dire Maul, it needs to be specified (West, East, North, Tribute), so DM:W, DM:E, DM:N, and DM:Tribute (or just Tribute) works when referring to Dire Maul.
---
A snapshot of what is popular on Twitch at one moment would be an absolutely terrible way to gauge the lasting popularity of a game. Lots of games put up huge Twitch/streamer numbers for a short period then die off.
---
This is the stress test.
---
I got in after the first big wave of streamers. 
---
I dont stream, I'm a nobody, but have been playing off and on since the original WoW beta in 2004 through now. I dont take this opportunity for granted and am doing my part to make sure the game is good to go for everyone come launch
---
I‚Äôd pay good money to watch a raid of undead spawn camp him
---
This was such a letdown from blizzard for players who got the invite but can't even test it. They should make up for this with more stress tests or extend it longer. Not fait to people who came back who to want to test this
---
Looks like anybody who was in the real beta has had no issues, but i've literally been trying for an hour and 10 minutes now non-stop sitting here and have not been able to get in, I am not in the real beta
---
Yes, but the distribution of the available power on the item is not fixed like it is in retail. In Classic it is possible to have a high ilvl gear piece with 6 Int and 10 Stam, and a lower ilvl gear pice that has 9 int 5 stam. If you are a mage you will probably take the lower ilvl gear since you get more damage out of it.
---
The thing is testing the login servers wasn't the whole point of the stress test. A portion of it probably was but a large part of the point of the stress test was to test the 1-5 leveling zones under a large infux of people. Thats why there is a level cap. They want to know how many people is the threshold for a new layer, how many layers can they fit on one server. 
---
Instead we have a bunch of people rushing to get on to run around and race to AQ40
---
Yes, most people are, it's a stress test.
---
2004 account. Got invite on first day.
---
It's frustrating but at the same time it feels like the night before Christmas as a kid.  I'm tempted to put some Skatman or Sandstorm for shits and giggles as we used to play it while progressing on BWL.

Depends.  I'm in the same situation you're in.  If you're asking whether or not you'll be able to get any quality play-time in the remaining 1 hour, the answer is probably, no.  On the other hand, this is all part of what a stress-test is.  By doing your part in destroying Blizz's servers, you expose the weaknesses in their servers.  Hopefully, the CS team can use this info to make improvements for the official launch.

Dan Mleef, this was brought up about a year ago in a certain priv server that starts with Kr. Is that where you heard this?

But I don't understand, why are the servers already offline ? Wasn't it supposed to be up for a few more hours ?
---
Thanks!
---
I was expecting a joke. Did I miss something or this guy just a large blue cunt?
---
But it will die in 2 months after release. RemindME! 6 months "Classic is Dead"
---
You are though. LMAO why do you think you can't connect? Servers are stressed
---
Dude they sucked so much ass until the last like month or two when we got divine storm. Paladins where God awful in arenas and only did ok in BGs as heals. 
---
Now there is always exceptions but either I sucked or just didnt do well. As for the last month or two, ret paladins where gods and it was amazing
---
It's a stress test. This was always a likely result.
---
Kinda sounds like you care
---
&gt;poker
---
Oh man, this was the first thing that came to mind reading the 1st post.
---
I remember that addon and playing it during downtimes on boss's or while waiting for people/corpse runs/wtv.
---
So after a raid, people where not only farming for repairs/mats BUT to pay their poker debts, it was hilarious.
---
Yeah I'm off. It's 1am here I can't stay up all night... :|
---
Yeah, They all get in SOMEHOW
---
How could you be possibly mad at this? They are testing *something* whatever it is. This is not made for your enjoyment.
---
Got it.
---
Installed it.
---
Logged in... server full, approx. wait time 4 mins.
---
Almost there... disconnected.
---
After several attempts I get in only to find the server is offline, and when it is online, it's locked.
---
This has been going on for the last hour. There's only 1 hour of stress test left.
---
FML
---
wish I could get in....
---
Just got kicked from queue for 30 minutes and when i finally got in the character creation timed out for about 20 minutes before kicking me again.
---
Ahhh, hours long queue times. This really is vanilla
---
It certainly is, for both parties.
---
I see profesional streamers more often than not with a wife or girlfriend. Also with IRL streaming we get to see guys like asmongold go out and hang out with more friends than I‚Äôve ever had (many times with friends he made THROUGH streaming). Asmongold just took like a two month break from streaming. I can use other streamers as example but asmon is the main topic on this thread so I stuck with it. 
---
All that being said, I‚Äôm unsure of the point you‚Äôre trying to get at. You have to play a lot of video games? well yeah... guess there‚Äôs worse things to be ‚Äúon the clock‚Äù doing. Anyways, my original comment was merely trying to highlight that talent =\= personality
---
so it was a stress test but only for people already in beta.. cool.
---
What version should it be?
---
All the important people got into it to create the hype on Twitch. No need for the rest of us to join in.
---
I hope the hype dies and all the people that werent prepared leave leaving us with the people willing to spend 6hours to clear a lvl 25 dung
---
It's a stress test, we can't let more people in the servers might break!
---
Stay strong! We are doing our part!
---
Same here...We just doing our job!
---
I am logging in and it is literally reading the server is offline even though I see streamers playing. Not sure how this works but coming back later feels right. [Offline Server](https://imgur.com/a/O5Bew7D)
---
Never watched a live stream before in my life. Been tunning into Venruki a lot these past few days, really enjoying watching him try stuff like tun SM at lvl 30.
---
I'm just too sad to even watch them, I was waiting for this stress test and i got nothing, still stuck at character screen
---
I hope this is helping. If the servers are locked and character creation time outs are expected then that isn't providing any new information to them. &gt;.&lt;
---
how is the realm offline but people are still streaming it?
---

Stop complaining. This is what the stress test was about.
---
I know I was definitely an asshole to a lot of people back then. I was also in high school.  I work with high schoolers now, and I know many of them just have bad attitudes and put negative things out on the Internet, since they can hide behind a screen with little to no repercussion. I was certainly one of them.  
---
Don‚Äôt worry about how you were back then. That was then and this is now. We can all work towards making the classic community positive, wholesome, and helpful.  I have high hopes!
---
I hope they all declare early what servers they are playing on so we can avoid them.
---
No idea, but I see it as offline as well.

Nothing better than ganking gankers as a gnome.
---
Leveling is easier on Alliance, but Horde is the 'pvp faction'. Undead Rogue is best for WotF, but Gnome Rogues are also decent in PvP as most people are *still* too stupid to tab target enemies and they're harder to click as the smallest race. In BG/Group PvP? Anything small.  
---
I use to stir up trouble in Darkshire(?) back in the day on an Orc Hunter, the first contested zone for Alliance before STV if I remember correctly. STV/Outside Booty Bay and Tarren Mill were the PvP hot spots back in the day

---
Streamers don't have control or "Priority" of getting into the game. There are some that are running into the same problems as us. People that are in got lucky.
---
Finally a place where our tears can form a [lake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R9gVc9ggZg) together =)
---
Stress test is working as intended.
---
Character creation timed out each time I got into the server, now its been offline or locked for the past 15-20 minutes.
---
offline
---
Been in character creation for a bit but unable to create anything...too afraid to hit back and lose the progress I've made...also want to reset because maybe if I turn it off and on again for the 15th time it will work this time
---
Been spamming to get in since 4, still no luck
---
Yeah it's completely full, streamer privilege only. They got in with their follower army and took all the spots for people that actually want to play and not do some dumb ass death run. 
---
ULTRA SALT ACTIVATED
---
Catastrophe?  It's a stress test
---
Tfw you complain about server issues when stress tests are literally to cause server issues.
---
Open beta... but WHY? Isn't it better to play so called "final version"? Like calm the fuck down. We all know that the only reason you want access to beta is because you are eager to play it. Stop pissing in pants from impatience and accept the fact that product is not finished, you are not the hub of the universe, you are not a VIP, you have to wait.
---
Anyone else stuck on ‚Äúcharacter creation timed out‚Äù
---
Barely anyone is trying to log in anymore since the server is locked. I can see the servers being stressed for the first half hour, but now? 
---
Not at all.
---
That was a really poor decision on your part
---
Wonder why it's showing offline while the streamers are apparently on line.
---
Is it possible to do if you sold your account?
---
Price to pay to look good.
---
why do people call them toons?
---
Nah they will just say stress test is finished thank you for testing!
---
Thought we were going to stress test the actual server. Not just the login server.
---
is the test over? only like 15 in queue but servers always offline when i try to get in. spent 90 minutes hitting the queue so not sure if i should keep trying?
---
Don‚Äôt think you can gank in Westfall, sadly. I‚Äôve had some good fights though, where *they* attacked *me*.
---
And people are watching a stress test. Literally just logging on people are this excited.
---
I tried to enter many times earlier and couldn't and now it just appears offline or locked when it's online, anyone with the same issue?
---
THESE COCKSUCKERS HAVE HAD HOW MANY DAMN YEARS TO GET THIS RIGHT
---
Wouldn't call it a catastrophe. Im guessing part of it on their end is seeing how best to handle the flow of players with a queue and how fast they can allow players to enter while keeping stability
---
So what would you say equals views on twitch? Cause it kinda looks like you‚Äôre criticizing his personality, which others (clearly not you) may find entertainment in.
---
ok, 40mins more of logging in. No problem :)
---
I think the most frustrating part of all of this is watching the twitch streamers have absolutely no issues getting online. =\
---
I've been stuck in character selection screen for about 30 minutes. A message saying "Chatacter creation has timed out." shows up about every 30 seconds.
---
HOW DID EVERY LARGE WOW STREAMER GET IN.
---
ASMON, SODA, MIZKIF, ESFAND, ZERO, QUINN, TIPS, TOWELLIE, AND STAYSAFE. 
---
WAY TO JEBAIT ME WITH A CHANCE TO PLAY ON THE STRESS TEST SERVER AND NOT GET BACK THE REALM SELECT SCREEN.
---
You poor summer child. You will get disconnected from the character selection screen. The server is offline currently.
---
I hope you‚Äôre putting polarized glasses on their precious undeveloped eyes
---
You're kidding*, than this*, really shows*, your taste*, cultural knowledge*, social intelligence*, possess*.  Yikes that hurt to read.
---
Been getting Character Creation Timed Out for about half an hour now.
---
**TY BASED ADMINS**
---
Where is my blizz mod shill privilege? I cant even get past char creation!
---
yes
---
&gt; be ahead of streamers in queue
---
&gt; get kicked
---
&gt; get back in at same time as them,
---
&gt; get stuck in character creation for the next HOUR
---
&gt; kicked again
---
You can really tell it‚Äôs the FIRST stress test, lol
---
No catastrophe here, working as intended.
---
Haha, said the same thing myself. Reliving the glory days indeed.
---
And more world first hogger to come
---
What server/guild?  My brother and I played with an Aussie guild and he had had also gotten about halfway through Naxx before TBC launched.
---
This just feels like an exclusive event for Soda and Asmongold, and we were just testing the login servers lmao
---
So that‚Äôs why your post was removed then, because it‚Äôs baseless.
---
I just made a legitimate post asking if it's normal that the server appears offline for me, it got deleted lol. @Spearmints thanks for making a post about rants I guess.   
---
I simply wanted to know if blizzard announced anything like locking additional loggers for a certain time.
---
I guess from other comments I'm not the only one.
---
Just sad. I get that this is a stress test, but what were they expecting? That not even half of us would try to log in? Just sad
---
yeah they do, its BS imo
---
It wouldn't be WoW if people weren't raging like Blizzard just fucked their wife.
---
Yes it does, I'm watching one now while I wait lol
---
Nobody was *tricked*, people deluded themselves into thinking they‚Äôd get something that was *never* promised
---
I just want to generate a file with all my system settings for August!!!!
---
***TIME TO DELIVER A PIZZA BALL***
---
No amount of testing will ever prepare them for releases. 15 years of the same old confirms this.
---
Oh man. It's like your attitude is straight outta 2004. #Nochange I guess.
---
I'm so harmed. DM is Diremaul!!!!!
---
The server status keeps switching between locked and offline but I am watching streamers on playing, so its not offline.......
---
character creation locked for an hour and half solid
---
Dumbass, bye.
---
Well. That fucking sucks. They give beta invites away to streamers who weren't ~~alive~~ playing during Classic, and those of us who have been playing since the beginning get left out.
---
https://i.imgur.com/aOJHnLz.gif
---
Was there for 20+ min, then got kicked. Now the server is Offline again at Realm Selection :/
---
Yup
---
Has anyone who "only" has access to the stress test been able to login with a character? From what I've gathered, it appears if only those with beta access prior to today that has been able to enter the realm so far.
---
It doesn't really matter whether this is intentional or not, as long as Blizzard is aware. It's a stress test and that's exactly what we're doing, but I can't say that I wouldn't be disappointed if we weren't allowed to play.
---
Same here, just keeps jumping between "Locked" and "Offline."
---
They're not offline. Streamers are still playing.
---
I waited and wasted over an hour to try and get in to the classic stress test and yes I know repeatedly trying to log in is helping blizzard figure things out.
---
I know it's a bit of fun but what I am mostly bitter about is the streamers making the testing event something for themselves, rather than what it is actually released for. Upon release of the actual servers nobody is going to run to AQ so there is no actual result for blizzard here. All those hundreds of slots are taken up leaving genuine players who didn't get in to beta and actually want to play and test (because the streamers did so bad at it) without a spot to play.
---
The beta testing server has already become some kind of streamer meta best in slot level 30 crap and already there have been competitions organised in a beta ???? Blizzard did a great job releasing the servers but the greedy streamers took it waaay out of what it should have been.
---
I just hope that I can create the character name I would like on August without this much issues. I probably won't be trying to log into stress testing servers. Rant over.
---
Yep had Character creation timed out for about 40mins then dc'd and have been sitting at the offline realmlist the rest of the time.
---
When a Classic queue screen is better content than Retail.
---
Its the....uhhhhh.....popularity?
---
That was Vanilla this is classic brah....
---
&gt;Why is every streamer mad about it? Why are tons of other people mad about it?
---
I'd say the same to them. 
---
&gt; How can you be surprised that I'm annoyed that the game itself  
---
It's not the game. It's a stress test. Just be thankful this is happening now and not at launch. 
---
I just don't like negative reactions to stuff like this because I think these stress tests are extremely important, and I wouldn't want to risk Blizzard thinking that it would hurt the hype for the game if they do them a lot.
---
Yup same.
---
Commenting an opinion doesn't explicitly imply caring. I do think it's shitty of them to handle the beta in this way though and thus my comments.
---
Even if I did get an closed beta invite I still wouldn't play it for a couple reasons 
---
1) I've been playing Vanilla on private servers since around 2014 in addition to playing retail Vanilla starting back in 2005. I don't want to get burned out on it and I'm fine waiting till Aug. 
---
2) Currently playing the new ESO expansion and the plan is to stick with that until Classic.
---
did that for 30 mins or more. didnt pay off
---
After being stuck in the character creation screen for an hour and getting the same error message over and over again I decided to restart. Now the server is just being shown as offline to me...
---
I'm not exactly mad. After all this is what the stress test is supposedto be about, right? I guess I'll just go watch that balding guy instead.
---
Subbed since 06, bought 15th anniversary box, was opted into Classic the moment the option became available. Only invited to stress test and I cant play. Oh but the streamers and guys with beta access who have been playing for what, like 2 weeks now, have priority to get in. Such a cuck move. I get that it's a stress test, supposed to be like this, but come on...I cant even make a fucking character.
---
Maybe if Mint Chocolate Chip and Butter Pecan didnt exist.
---
Haha same
---
Pretty much falls into what I‚Äôm saying. I‚Äôd call what your talking about ‚ÄúPersonality‚Äù.
---
Mine says offline. 
---
Just keep trying to log in, this is what the stress test is about, seeing how the system handles all this traffic at once.
---
this streamer prio is fucking bullshit lol
---
worlds also flat.
---
Quality post thank you
---
They locked them after it filled up, so no one else is getting in tonight.
---
Just give up.
---
Did anyone from EU manage to get into the server? Been trying since it came up here and i'm now getting a queue of 50 each time I launch, and when it retrieves the realm list the server is offline.
---
I can‚Äôt wait til this toon gets cap and we get intricate raid doodles
---
have you been hitting "cancel" and relogging in? or waiting at the "Realm Selection" screen?
---
T U R B O S A L T
---
No, paid for shot at beta invite since requires active sub. Stress test just happen to come up, which I quit after an hour of queues.
---
All I can say, I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one üòÇ
---
I used to work at EB Games and would just grab em as needed. Very convenient. I don't think we got discounts on them unlesss we made a ''mistake'' ringing each other up. One of my coworkers was oblivious and would apply employee discount under his ID to things he wasn't supposed to all the time, actually making a mistake. I made him ring me up every time
---
O fuck, is it time!!!? I played on a private server for a few months just to check the wow itch....it is there and strong, I plan on playing the rerelease with my wife, time to build a second pc.
---
Europeon don't know the difference between Then and Than or what?
---
well leveling AS a prot warrior stinks, like the other guy said, you can tank with arms.
---
why you shouldnt level a warrior with the intention of going prot at 60? there is an over abundance of raid tanks, and you only need 2 in one raid, so you either have to be better than the others, run your own guild/raid, or be lucky to find a spot.
---
Yep. Made my Warlock and can‚Äôt actually start. She‚Äôs a very pretty undead though. Glad I can at least play with the character creator.
---
Yo is this fresh pasta?
---
Troll post or not, by doing that you're not affecting Blizzard in anyway but only the Streamer. Blizzard doesn't care if you're subbed to a Streamer or not.      
---
If you want to show Blizzard then boycott Classic and all Blizzard games entirely. Throw out your computer while you're at it. That will show them.
---
As the other guy said, you can tank as arms or fury with the right talents and playstyle (and healer lol)
---
More dmg while being slightly less tanky, yet still able to survive is most efficient. It's likely not as fun either to level as prot.
---
Raiding end game  you will be *da bell of da bawl*
---
Yeah didn't live up to the hype to stay up till 3am (for us eu players) but at least it will mean the next stress test is smoother. Hopefully they do more if they still have these problems.
---
Lol let's just all go on a twitch boy cott. Hit em in the wallet boys. Cancel subs until august.
---
Wotf is great.  Life saver when you need it.  But that's not all the time,  and it's on a cooldown.
---
I regret restarting, now i'm also in the same offline boat
---
The server will be up for a day even though the stress test was only two hours.
---
#NO FUN ALLOWED
---
&gt;Most definetly true
---
ahh the good ol' Reddit Dev.
---
&gt;Been subbed since 06
---
So almost TBC.
---
&gt; was opted in within a minute of it coming up.
---
Well it's not First Come First Serve.
---
&gt; Also bought the 15th anniversary box which was a limited sale.
---
Congratulations, you got your product for that - it didn't include Classic Beta.
---
&gt;unplayable for probably 80%
---
It's absolutely no where near 80%, that's some wild confirmation bias.
---
People are upset that they're enjoying the game.
---
For example: 
---
&gt;Instead we have all these fucking neckbeards like asmongold running to silithus so they can do some low level PVP.
---
&gt;Fucking stupid if you ask me
---
I've tried it - make no mistake. It's just not for me. I'll make the video anyways though.
---
Youve been invited to participate staring at the offline server that's technically lying to you!
---
ok cool thanks for the info i might just hop off to retail for a while then. glad i can still try after the 2 hour window. been playing for nearly 15 years non stop would be nice to get a chance to try the beta haha.
---
They don't care about what you want. You did your job by subscribing to try logging in for 2 hours. That was your reward. Now let streamers have their fun
---
First I got stuck at "retrieving realm list" and then disconnects
---
Then I got to the character select and creation but it kept giving me "Character creation timed out"
---
Now the realm is showing up as offline.
---
Good stress test, blizz. :|
---
Seems to me power leveling services took about 4 days, so I'd say yes it's possible.
---
Lol calm down you entitled twat.
---
Exact same here.  Ah well, they got the stress data they needed, at least.
---
That would be your authenticator code
---
[That's what these tests are for!](https://youtu.be/ZyideP8H08c?t=29)
---
&gt; How about you address the immediate concern that the server says "offline" and even if you make it past then you cant even make a character?
---
Shut the fuck up and stop embarrassing yourself. That's the most common stress test feature: checking the system response in case of failure and make sure nothing crashes.
---
When you're seeing the "offline" message it's not because the system is broken, it's because it's being broken on purpose to see what happens then and how the system recovers from that. Same for all the other "errors" you're so mad about. It's normal, everyday stuff for any test environment.
---
Don't encourage people to roll a main that they won't enjoy due to the horrific DPS.
---
the one time they showed as locked i was able to select the server and log in anyway. now they show as offline (logged out as I got fed up of dominos lua errors)
---
I dont think it blows up a lot more than that. I dont think that matters though. We can be pretty certain about WoW Classic having a healthy sized community for years.
---
If you check the streams, it seems to be Europeans that can't get in. US players are streaming away merrily.
---
Yeah this shit is pissing me off................
---
Nice, all the streamers who are in the beta get to do some dumb run to AQ in the stress test, while us plebs with stress test access get a "server offline" screen. Thank you Blizzard, very cool. 
---
I'm not salty, I swear!
---
the parameters he provided leave him with those 3 three options though
---
The entire point is to see where the server's limits are, so naturally the login queues are going to be lax. Assuming they also want to try out layering. Servers aren't really anything you "figure out" by any point really.
---
the famed community of classic wow where everyone joins their favorite streamer‚Äôs army
---
Same
---
This is the fucked up part. Who cares if they can run to AQ. We need to stress the starter zones because they're going to be a disaster on Day 1.
---
Hi, /u/Lothric
---
Right? that's the question I'm asking all the time. I'm just sad and disappointed :( Plebs can't get in at all
---
Hundreds of people in one area are precisely the reason for stress tests. It's extremely important, and they're the ones bringing those people, and they're the ones bringing publicity.
---
There are thousands of people in right now, but it's showing offline for me too.
---
Don't worry, we'll be bored of Classic in 3 months, after watching all the streamers explore/experience/spoil the entire game for us.
---
People planed their day around this. RIP
---
I find it very unlikely that their account has been given some sort of priority access, it does however appear to be the case that most (if not all) with prior access to the beta, including content creators, have been able to login, while those who only have access to the stress test haven't made it further than the character creation screen.
---
Really, I had thought that I had read that the bat was closed over the stress test, may be wrong.
---
The only difference is that when the game actually launches a large chunk of the people currently watching these guys on twitch will be playing the game instead. I‚Äôve never watched twitch before in my life before this past week and won‚Äôt watch again once I can play in Azeroth myself
---
Right? it's a BETA stress test. It's not meant to be fully playable.
---
From user Raelissa on Blizzard Forums:  
---
"I‚Äôm in, and about 10 minutes ago there was a server message saying they knew a lot of people were stuck at realm select and they were hunting down the issue."
---
Lmao I was ahead of both and got kicked out.
---
Can't tell if troll or not, but if so, How do you think Blizzard knows everyone in a streamer's Fanbase? Lol
---
Bruh, me too.
---
That and logging in are the REAL tips we need!
---
EU servers are dead, US running fine. We don't count, clearly.
---
Why? The stress test seems to be functioning as intended.
---
This is testing my patience
---
FACT: Blizzard servers are unable to handle the capacity expected, they rely on excuses like 'we have to revert the current tech from retail'. 
---
FACT: They are intentionally not putting anyone else in to prevent this from becoming apparent.
---
Yea thats what happened to me.
---
I get its a stress test but i was in character creation before asmon was even thru the queue and he gets in fine and i get locked out for an hour. I guess its kinda unfair that i got into the server fine but character creation was where i got shafted
---
Get a invite to the stress test can't even play this must what getting cucked feels like.
---
I mean, it is a good stress test. This is the exact purpose of a stress test. To knock all this stuff out now so there is a smooth launch.
---
Dude, its free promotion, the game makes more money, meaning longer support, also more people to play with. lmao
---
Right now, i don't give a flying fuck about goddamn streamers. The SOBs got on and get to show off during the stress test and the rest of us are locked out. Not stress-test disconnection, but server is locked.  I don't even get the reward of goofing around in an incredibly crowded starting area that I was looking forward to after slamming the login server. I don't even get to create a character.
---
So fuck this guy, Assmongolid, and the rest of them with a 10' pole.
---
Blizzard is without any question the biggest clusterfuck in gaming.
---
Unreal.
---
anyone that did that is brain dead
---
There is a ton of loyal players that is in playing right now.
---
Me too. I guess that stress test is over for non-streamers. Good luck in the future lol
---
Right? Why even invite me to the fucking stress test if all im going to do is stare at a server that says offline? Sitting here logging in and out for the last hour and sometimes I could get it to say locked but nope now it has been offline for me for quite some time. So now what? I'm supposed to have a giant BLUE BALLED fucking sack until august? wow...
---
Its not shady, they are likely just using it as a way to limit the number of people that can get in
---
the stress test was only supposed to last 2 hours but if you made a character you could play til tomorrow we have 30 minutes left of the stress test so what do the people who couldn't get in and make a character do about the next 24 hours?
---
Please post somewhere everyone can see it, in this comment or in the OP that the servers are locked now and you can't log on.  
---
That is basic important info.  Your moderation is preventing people from posting the most important info right now.  Since we can't make a thread telling people the server is locked, please post that info in this comment I am replying to, or in the OP.
---
Yeah, that's not the case.
---
There's a ton of people on right now.  I get that it sucks a lot of people can't get on, but that's kind of the point.
---
US here, haven't even been able to see the character creation screen.
---
I had the exact same situation. I think at least a few thousand others did too. Sucks that it says offline when there are currently a few thousand in right now
---
Also wondering, let me know if yours ever changes to "Low" or "Online" or whatever. Mine was jumping from "Locked" to "Offline" but now just sitting at "Offline."
---
Like i say it is better than demonshear no doubt, but its not as easy to get. You will spend a significant amount of money/time investing in a weapon that will become average in phase 2 and useless in phase 3.
---
Its your choice if you wanna be the king of phase 1 with arcanite but i would just go demonshear and farm for lionheart/titanic leggings/mount.
---
They should have just called today the "Streamers' Stress Test" so us lessers could get the picture earlier.
---
Imagine saying this is "cheating" when the race never had any rules LUL
---
Taking things like these personally isnt helping your mindset in the longrun :3
---
I got to character creation once, but I couldn't actually make a character.  Eventually (10 min or so) it kicked me out.
---
Hey man, that's definitely a fair point. I just don't think EVERYONE who wants to play Classic wants to minmax and will only have fun if their DPS numbers are high. Do you know what I mean? Sometimes it's more fun to just play the race/class/lore that you enjoy. That's just my opinion though!
---
https://i.gyazo.com/7909e5318b2f93e04ea0ac85dd7b3177.png 
---
this is why their inclusion is important
---
Well I logged in the minute it was up but I only got to character creation screen. Now it says offline.. I guess EU is at a disadvantage here
---
I think they flagged streamers accounts to login with priority. I watched it happen real-time.
---
xD
---
Where you getting this info?
---
Technically I was already subscribed for retail, too bad my internet isn't good enough to watch the streamers without tons of buffering and skips :(
---
It's a nice login screen.  I've been looking at it for quite awhile and it's very nice.
---
Same here, I am going through the early game leveling and profession grind so I am not as lost on release. It is surprising how much you forget and remember after 10+ years. I completely forgot that you had to keep pets fed as a hunter for example and kept losing them when they got too hungry or if I ran out of the food they eat. I don't plan on going too far though since I want to re-experience the game on my permanent character on a permanent server.
---
They are testing the layering, announced in the realm chat, so probably the second layer is off but the first is up.
---
Nope. I have beta (I‚Äôm a nobody, but have been a nobody on and off since 2004/5) and can‚Äôt get in either.
---
Cry more, lol
---
I'm just sad that being a non-streamer sucks way too much, I was so hyped for this stress test :(
---
(pinging /u/Gerzy_CZ, since this is a followup reply to myself)
---
And now that we've seen the first hour and a half of the stress test, it confirms a lot of what I said: the login servers needed testing, since they obviously couldn't hold up to even non-peak-time numbers. This would have been even worse of a mess if they had tried to do a peak weekend time. And one of the primary goals seems to be testing layering: https://i.redd.it/if70lohytuz21.png.
---
Shitty mods here won't let anyone post the fact that:  
---
The server is locked for now. There is no way to log on.  
---
Until they unlock the server, you can't log on.
---
"streamer only event", its full of non-streamers. Just because seven big names got in and you didn't doesn't mean its a "streamer only event".
---
That‚Äôs what I do. When I was 23 I had a credit score just over 800.
---
This is some sketchy ass shit dude.
---
Did you have access to the beta prior to today? If my hunch is correct, it appears as if only those who've been granted "full" beta access, meaning not just the stress test, are also those that have been able to make it past the character creation screen.
---
1.5 hours in, started at 4:01, haven't even made it to loading screen once, but still holding strong
---
Yep im starting to think this too........
---
Lol wasn't trying to start anything just think it's funny he put like a full paragraph of info and all the horde healing classes are named lmao just ignore me pretend I'm invisibur
---
Started logging in around 655EST, always had a queue (never saw more than 2900)  
---
Queues only took around 5 minutes.  
---
After the queues, I was waiting at the server select screen (showed Offline) multiple times. Each time, I logged out and logged back in.   
---
After around 30 minutes of this, I was finally able to get to a character creation screen.   
---
Multiple attempts to create a character were met with "Character creation timed out"  
---
Did that for about a half hour.   
---
Occasionally I would be brought to the character select screen and the server said "Locked" on population. Clicking on it would instantly disconnect me.   
---
From 8-the time of writing this (830EST) I would log in, be in a small Queue (like 10 people), then be met with the server select screen showing servers offline.   
---
Am constantly re-logging and repeating this to see if the server comes up.
---
Its a joke mate
---
you don't think testing running hundred of people across zones isn't somewhat valuable information to gather?
---
Don't encourage people to roll a main they won't enjoy just because it's "suboptimal."
---
I had a druid on private servers that I geared out to tank, and it was a great deal of fun, but it was a tremendous amount of work to only be able to offtank in raids at the most - it was also a huge effort to prove myself to a guild for them to invest raid gear and time in me.
---
The odd specs make great alts, but if you want to raid and not feel like you've wasted months on a character no one wants in their group. Roll one of the viable specs, and make a fun alt.
---
I agree with you. I'm here to play with my friends and just overall goof off. I don't care about the numbers or endgame. Already decided on playing a ret pally or enh shaman depending on which faction the rest of my group decides on going.

Me too. I'm feeling bitter about not even getting to create a character and the server is locked after doing all that login queue stress testing. But the fucking streamers get to play. Fuck 'em. Won't ever watch them anyway, but now, I hope everyone griefs their characters on Classic.
---
Except that they are bringing those people OUT of the starter zones into silithis and shit rather than actually mass spamming one area of the game
---
Damn, saw that I had the beta when I woke up this morning but had commitments to other games to keep up with all day, it‚Äôd totally blow ass if I‚Äôve missed the opportunity :(

And now they're doing a Hogger invasion in all the start zones without us :(
---
**Your** = a possessive adjective. It shows possession, that something belongs to the person you are talking to. e.g. This is not my pen, it is **your** pen.
---
**You're** = You are. It is a contraction (or short way of writing). e.g. You're amazing  = You are amazing
---
Pissed that the "streamers" decided to hijack a stress test for some stupid race. Ideally this event was meant to simulate launch by testing login functions, character creation, and the dynamics of starting zones with hundreds of players. Instead, they have a cash money prize for some race, raking in views and profiting off this mess. Kinda messed up in my opinion.
---
You know, I don't really buy the whole streamer privilege thing but I honestly can't think of a way that they managed to get in while so many people can't without Blizzards help. Someone was saying they think that only accounts that had access to the beta before the stress test got past the character create screen, anyone who only had access to the stress test able to disprove this?
---
Yeah, cause the person that made this thread sounds like the type of person who goes out and socialises with people. Man has genuine issues.
---
Yeah Blizzard can seriously fuck right off after they just completely wasted over an hour and a half of my time. I'll not bother with any more of this beta bullshit.
---
wew lad
---
For people saying that Streamers are getting Priority, Staysafe is currently at server select like the rest of us.
---

---
The quote from blizzard: 
---
&gt; We expect to put a lot of people in the starting zones, though, and we‚Äôre looking forward to seeing what you all do as we test the servers under crowded conditions. 
---
And what do you think it would look like if the servers were to do poorly under these conditions? Maybe crash? Maybe go offline? They tested it, and obviously they needed the test. Go play a private server if you're that desperate.
---
streamers conveniently had no issues getting in though. hmm.
---
I think this was a thing in beta or early patches. Not in 1.12

---
Yeah, not enough people realize that this *is the point*.
---
Keep increasing player numbers until stuff breaks. Stress it.
---
Everything working A-OK is not the purpose here. The purpose is to grind the gears and find out what the limits are. The point is to break it.
---
Mine was Esfand. I was at character creation, and receiving the character creation error. He comes in two minutes later and gets right in.
---
At the least they just took down the realmlist server.
---
Yeahhhh my friend had that one! From badlands right?
---
When is blizzard gonna hook this guy up with beta access
---
Well i made this reintroducing mission first which you get dropped into you bag.. first thing i noticed they stripped me of all my skills and i only had holy casts left. Then i made the same stupid shit 4 times to get thrall back from another plane. 
---
Which was ok .. but repetetive and easy.
---
Ohh boy and then i went into pandaria.. 
---
Like the flying airship was not the weirdest part i knew it from wotlk.. but then flying as a copilot in a attackhelicopter shooting a gatling gun weirded me the fuck out.
---
Even done that.. Started the first quest and noticed... wait iam only using 2 casts over and over and over and there is 0 threat or a interesting story going on while it seems a weird vietnam story is going on in WoW of all places... i just quit right there.
---
Pisses me off too, but the logic makes sense. If you can press a button and have twitch showing content instead of 2 hours of logging in and bad vibes why would you not do that?
---
Exactly the kind of response I expected lmao
---
Make sure to post your guild name so I can at least enjoy the inevitable disaster.
---
Did he relog beforehand?
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Corpse_running

It says here you needed to relog in Vanilla for this to work.
---
Lmao I think the concept of "early access" games has ruined people. People don't view Beta as a *testing tool for the benefit of the developers*, they see it as a "pay to play for my own entertainment before other people" option
---
Pretty sure it was a success. The entire point was to gauge what kind of load they'd be dealing with.
---
It'll exist for 26 hours. It might be offline for 20 hours.
---
Remember the post with  **The Virgin Min-Maxer vs The Chad Casual** ?

---
This is the whole purpose of the stress test. Or do you prefer to have this shit on release instead?
---
I can't even get into the server.
---
Staysafe is currently locked out like the rest of us.
---
Basically it feels like everyone who was invited to the "stress test" that wasn't a part of the closed beta was never meant to get in. Instead, we were baited into thinking we were going to get in, but we were really just here to test the strength of the servers while the streamers and closed beta people got back in to the game they'd already been playing.
---
Testing doesn¬¥t matter on a PR event.
---
the technology just isn't there
---
Woah, an hour and a half of your life wasted? Like the same hour and a half that would've been wasted anyways into a character that will be deleted? How will you ever recover?
---
You're gonna have a hard time when classic goes live being this big of a baby.

That‚Äôs awesome, man. I honestly might try out a Shadow Priest. I know they‚Äôre not horrible, but they‚Äôre also not likely to top the meters. I just love the feeling of playing one and I think they‚Äôre fun to level as. I‚Äôm also a PVP rat and they can be really fun in PVP.
---
If you enjoyed the video, I hope you‚Äôll consider subscribing! Lots more to come.
---
Got stuck at character creation, never once made it past. I tried to go out of character screen after failing to create my toon several times then couldn‚Äôt get back in to the server at all :(
---
isnt that the point then? for the realm to have problems?
---
shit man ur right
---
You all can post your hate, but look at the truth. All the streamers got on. They are not even testing the starting areas. They are playing an arrange war to draw in views instead of testing. If the rest of us just were invited to only test the log on servers while the closed beta testers (a.k.a. streamers), it is pretty bad and a poor thing to do.
---
Well I'm relieved. I was worried it would be hard to create a pink-haired female gnome. Obviously that passed the stress test.
---
Server just went down for everyone, staysafe has been playing for the last hour.
---
Is that the cool event they had announced for the two hours mark. 
---
It is so pog, I have offline realm but I am having so much fun thinking of playing since last week.
---
Right.  They could have done that by doing an email poll.
---
It's weird because a guildie and I are in.. got humans to level 5, then deleted and rolled undead and leveling those (just took the servers down).. but a bunch of other guildies have been trying to login and keep getting server locked or offline.

Lol it's not! Server is down for streamers too xD
---
They are bringing hoggers to every starting zone!!!! Mini raid boss battles commencing!
---
I was making my char when they were still in queue, needless to say I never got to log in, I was kicked to a locked server.
---
Seems high from what I recall.
---
You're right.  I suppose there is always a silver lining to everything .
---
Uhh what better way to stress the servers than concentrating a ton of people in one spot?
---
This is a great point and one that I meant to make when I mentioned alt-aholism. Damn it. What alt do you think you‚Äôll make this time around? And what‚Äôre you going to main?

Time isn't wasted when you're enjoying a game, you useless goon.
---
Popular streamers getting priority access to the beta?! UNHEARD OF!
---
dude it's free marketing for blizzard, obv they're gonna give popular streamers. I dont see an issue with that at all
---
LOL so that's where he went! He led a bunch of us lvl 1 Humans into Duskwood where we all died, then he disappeared. The only thing left of him was his companion Sharding.
---
This sub gets so salty over streamers... Like yeah, blizzard is going to prioritize free marketing. Does this surprise anyone?? Cause it really shouldn't. Also, they should give it to streamers because it's the best alternative for those who wouldn't get in anyways. You guys gotta chill
---
I see, thanks
---
For some of us, getting into the stress test will be our only chance at seeing the beta, even if it's level capped at 5. Of course we're gonna be upset and disappointed if all we could see of it was a queue and then constant disconnects and if you're lucky, a character creation screen. As a result of that, we should be allowed to express our sadness and disappointment here.
---
YES we are stress testing. YES this is what we opted in for and YES it is to be expected- but so is our disappointment. I'm tired of people who are only expressing their disappointment just to have smartasses comment shit like "iT'S a sTrEsS tEsT duHhHh" like of course we KNOW THAT. We just want to share our grief and disappointment.
---
I mean, streamers who have been playing for a week and will get to play after this really needed to have the stress test to themselves?
---
Fuck this. :(
---
To be fair getting the streamers in with massive raids following them is definitely gonna stress the servers
---
Issues just happened for soda.
---
This is simply not true; it depended on your server and perhaps your faction. I know for a fact on Daggerspine-US in vanilla the common name was VC as an alliance player. No one ever said DM (which is a different instance)
---
Yeah, probably everyone who is on the actual beta have priority in the login queues. Us stress test plebs are just there to fill in the ranks so to speak.
---
Currently getting no servers available error after working through queue. How long does a server restart take?
---
my zone is gettin played
---
No kidding. Imagine losing your shit over not being able to log in during a *stress test* three months before launch.
---
An email poll wouldnt provide any useful information
---
:(
---
Some actual feedback.   
---
I am running on a mac. When actually getting through the character creation screen to the character selection screen, there was no background. It wasnt until I clicked create a character that the background showed up. This continued to happen the one or two more times I made it to the character selection screen.
---
Yes I too would expect a sarcastic response if I was to start shit posting in a thread unrelated to the main post. I am glad to see you were capable of predicting this. Good luck on the next test, im sure you can get that grade up next time buddy!
---
where did they specify if you made a character, the server is supposed to be on for 26 hours. you will be able to log in when its back online
---
Fuck me, you‚Äôre autistic.
---
It was talked about and might have been in the beta or something but it was never implemented in the live game.
---
yuppp feels like a big let down, i don't mind helping test  but shit i feel cheated by not even getting to make a toon. Well every streamer gets in
---
Lmao awesome
---
Yeah let me save this comment right here.

About fifteen minutes ago when I got home from work. I‚Äôm getting a mix of ‚Äúno servers available‚Äù and a server list with no servers up. 
---
If it matters: client is 1.13.2 (30406) Beta x64 (5/10/19) on a mac
---
Try again around midnight, EST, and I bet you will get in.
---
My thoughts as well. And even if it was for the free advertisement, the 2 hours window could have at least let us in.. Pretty upsetting honestly.
---
*downvotes but doesnt have a response*
---
I don't even get server select at this point, just ''no realms are currently available'' found and then I just get DCed
---
Was he able to log back in? How was it?
---
I like how the mail stated that we could play up to level 5. 
---
Didn't get to do anything than trying to connect to the server for 2 hours, couldn't even create a character. What a waste of my time
---
I mean, no?  But I'm also not the type to spend extra money on something that solves a niche problem when I already have something that serves a broader purpose, if it's it's more cumbersome.
---
Really, the easiest solution is when I travel, I just being my Switch with me, it fits in a cargo pocket.  Beat that weight and ease of carrying.
---
is it over already?
---
Aye. Maybe I‚Äôm not as upset since I am in beta, but I‚Äôm just repeatedly logging in and seeing the stress test server either offline or not there at all.
---
100%. because I have queued before soda and somehow he zipped past me LULW love the equality
---
Wrong

"Hey Jim, do you see what I see?"

\-"Sure thin, Joe. Starting zones are doing just fine. Perfect for release."

Great job Blizz! Really great job.

It would be easy for us to start together but the issue beyond that is faction. I'm Hardline alliance. No room for horde in my life.
---
Big Facts
---
This is possibly the most enraging part of this test.
---
To be fair, it's two buttons. In a tough situation, you DI a rezzer.
---
Conspiracy theory on the forums:    
---
&gt; I am told from a reliable source that stress testers were given certain numbers. Group 1 able to fully go through, group 2 was able to create characters but not get through. Group 3 was only able to get to realm selection before being forced to back to login servers. This was done purposely for the testing.
---
&gt;So if you were not given the correct group, you would never get to play during test hours. Once all this is done testing, they will let everyone play until tomorrow.
---
Rest in peace any chance of playing This time around
---
It was merely a bunch of people "racing" with streamers compared to how many could actually fit in starting zones.
---
Agreed! I probably should‚Äôve added in that last line. I tried to get that idea across with the idea of fun vs being accepted by a raiding guild. Maybe I didn‚Äôt articulate that correctly - I‚Äôll mention that in the next video!
---
If you liked the video, I hope you‚Äôll consider subscribing. A lot more content to come!
---
That was all on purpose, I have to beliefe this. If ND unironically had a better start and more stable servers than the big B that would be laughable.
---
i didnt even get in.
---
Ah okay, its probably because you weren't trying from the start then. At the beginning I was in a queue for so long (after clicking the server the second it became green) that the server filled before I was able to get on
---
1. No one is owed access to the beta
---
2. Boycotting the streamers will do nothing to make blizzard to open the beta and will only harm the streamers
---
3. It's just a game you can wait for 3 months for it to come out you're not going to die so step away from your keyboard and stop hyperventilating for a bit
---
Not massive raids. Only a couple hundred people even made it in. this test has been a disaster.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt hurt, honestly.  Some people are just garbage in general, and would likely throw it back in your face, but you‚Äôd be the bigger person by giving it an attempt.  Honestly, I‚Äôll bet most people have matured and would be warm about it. Just my thoughts.
---
tfw no e-mail or option on client
---
tfw doesn't matter anyway since the servers are dead
---
Were people having problems?  I got in about 7:45 and got to level 5 on a Tauren Warrior.

Agreed, I just spent two hours watching a movie and cycling in and out stressing the server. Figured worst case movie and testing, best case movie and classic lol.
---
Babies just destroy all your money
---
I have beta access couldn‚Äôt get in, but my roommate did and he doesn‚Äôt have beta. It‚Äôs seems completely random.
---
"classic first" should really be the only valid label
---
None of this shit happening now is world first
---
Not really when they are spreading out over a ton of zones.
---
Shit I just did that thrall quest 2 days ago leveling my mage, I understand why you quit now lol
---
the 500 posts complaining
---
The answer is definitely yes, for both PvE and PvP. It will be the strongest weapon for 2h fury PvE and for arms PvP besides an epic that will be difficult to get. If you are interested in learning more, I created a guide about fury warrior pre-BiS gearing and specs. You can find it at  [https://classicwow.live/guides/484/phase-1-fury-warrior-end-game-starter-guide-specs-and-pre-bis](https://classicwow.live/guides/484/phase-1-fury-warrior-end-game-starter-guide-specs-and-pre-bis)
---
eh the first rule of testing is the users aren't wrong. this is probably valid data for servers with streamers either way  
---
its all a test. not meant to be perfect

There is no longer a stress test showing for me (beta acct).
---
Might be gone for good, not sure.  Maybe they cut all the beta people out.
---
Has ANY stress test exclusive player been able to create a character tonight?  Anyone here able to speak to this?
---
The point was to test the game servers under load.
---
&gt;[We expect to put a lot of people in the starting zones, though, and we‚Äôre looking forward to seeing what you all do as we test the servers under crowded conditions.](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-stress-test-1/178282)
---
Login servers aren't game servers.
---
That's probably why they wanted sharding and now trying to set up layering. The Classic is big.
---
Go on with your day peasant. I don‚Äôt think wow classic is your type of game if ypy like LoL btw :)
---
I was stuck at realm selection for an hour, then got through to character select. That's bull.
---
If this is true I might‚Äôve been group 2 since I could get into creation but kept getting timed out.
---
As far as classic goes the priest is a more powerful healer with various spells, the paladin is a hybrid supporter - and as far as classic goes has only 2 healing spells.
---
I dont mind streamers getting benefits on a beta. Its good PR for the game. But if they can skip queue on release I would be salty about it.
---
Wow, we got so Jebaited... Ur totally right. Nice wording blizzard trick everyone to thinking we can maybe play for a minute or two.
---
Nobody : 
---
Streamers : ''let's do the complete opposite Blizzard wants us to do during the stress test''
---
Right? I specifically recall looking at the white weapons in TB that were 1 or 2g and my mind boggling at getting that money.
---
I've been at server select with server offline for about 15 minutes.
---
It‚Äôs all good, man. I honestly got really frustrated when I saw I didn‚Äôt even get into the stress test. My account is quite old and I thought I‚Äôd at least make it into that. We just have to keep our fingers crossed.
---
On the bright side, if we never get in, we won‚Äôt be burnt out at all on launch day. The hype will have built up all summer!
---
If you liked any of my thoughts in the video, I hope you‚Äôll consider subscribing. I like your passion for the game and it‚Äôd be cool to continue hearing from you.
---
Hope mods don't remove a poll version! Thank you for this.
---
^(And thank you mods, I know i'm salty but you are definitely still having quite the flipping time with all this)
---
Hm, looks like the vast majority made it all the way to character creation. I think this poll will tell us more after the focus period is finished and some more of the folks that got in can participate.
---
 Think people are more upset that streamers have priority accounts.
---
They got booted too.
---
All streamers ingame and i can‚Äôt even pass the realm list
---
damn you're so salty, you take this shit too seriously it's just entertainment
---
The realm has been completely removed from the realmlist for me now, but I got to the character select at best before timing out over and over during the 2 hour period.
---
Sounds like you're a bit confused about the difference between "fact" and "salty opinion I pulled out of my ass".
---
Remember when apex beat Fortnite for 2 weeks straight and now has less viewers than PUBG?
---
I get it's working as intended. But dear god I hope 300 person cap on the server before the log in server crashes indefinitely is not "working as intended" at launch. MAYBE 300 people actually got in today.... maybe...
---
What? The literally couldn't handle the limited amount of people that were invited to the stress test, clearly they aren't ready for the actual launch.
---
I was there! =D

In the old days, we were faced with Pay2win games, now we have to worry about Influence2win games.  This stress test taught one key thing, influencers get a special set of code rules for them.  So I hope we will be given server choices were we can choose a server where we will not be 2nd class citizens.  Don't get me wrong, influencers are great and fun to watch, but when the game  has special code to allow you to bypass queues what other code is in there?  Easier drops? Easier bosses?   Easier pvp?
---
.
---
The Stress test was very instructional.
---
Holy Pala has far less tools and largely uses only a few spells, all which are similar.
---
They are however better in PvP. If the choice is between Priest and Paladin, then whether PvP matters to you, should weigh your decision accordingly.
---
Definitely fireball with that one
---
Dont forge i was gone for years ( end of wotlk right before arthas was  raidable ) .. its terrible. I dont even get how you can enjoy it later on at least as a holy priest.. i wont just push two buttons over and over until i reach 120 with 0 effort.
---
What's DI?
---
I genuinely don‚Äôt understand why beta invitees were part of the stress test. It‚Äôs really frustrating. I have not received an invite to either. The footage in the video is from an old 1.12 source you‚Äôre probably familiar with.
---
Asmongold literally got his start with the persona of being a complete cunt. I mean he also still has the persona of being a complete cunt but still
---
I guess the stress test is successful because I got home from work at 5:30 and have been trying to log in ever since to no avail.
---
One time I got to the realm list and saw that the server was offline. Then was booted to the login screen. Since then I've only gotten the "Retrieving realm list" at best.
---
Let's hope they actually learn something from this test and beef things up for August, because they're going to get MORE interest, not less.
---
So it will be just like the authentic vanilla experience. perfect.
---
Final rank. 9 if I recall correctly.
---
Yeah just now but they were playing for a good 30-40 min
---
Annnnnnnd you no longer have time for video games.
---
All realms are down now, nobody is playing.
---
I can‚Äôt imagine having this take. It‚Äôs a stress test the actual goal is to crash everything so you can fix it. A stress test that didn‚Äôt have these problems would be a large waste of time.
---
Probably pre-raid BIS if you're an Orc until Bonereaver's Edge or Spinal Reaver.
---
Oof, one stream I was watching had his YT Channel name already taken, but he's not a "streamer", he makes crispy tech and gaming vids on tubes but he tossed up the stream for folks.
---
Was laughing at the meltdowns on here and the official forum a tad when folks were tossing out hot takes and swearing at Blizz.
---
Did talk a bit about data collection for the stress test since he's a developer, too. Non-Blizz but it was a unique take. Then just shot the shit with chat the whole stream about other games, Vanilla stuff, etc. Laid back.
---
I've been trying since the exact moment the server became green on the listing almost 2 hours ago. Yea, some of us have been having problems.
---
Oh true. Stay safe my friend.
---
Works perfectly for me on Mac. No bug.
---
Tried to login for 2 hours straight.. Didn't get in even once FeelsBadMan :(
---
It would explain why the streamers happened to get in, at the least
---
Warlock - Rank 10 Sbolt
---
Nice
---
I love how the servers went to "Offline" when all of the streamers got in, yet they were still playing. Lul
---
S A T U R N V R O C K E T S A L T
---
Seems plausible kinda tbh.
---
Unfollowing is not gonna do shit, other people got in it wasn't just streamers.
---
Hi, /u/MasterGun95
---
Haha, that's a solid game plan. Probably a good idea to plan ahead like that for the official debut in August too. Gotta manage our expectations.
---
haha that's an awesome pet name
---
Ah, See i thought he was talking about tome exclusive skills.
---
Yes many of my guildies were able to log in and play (one of which is a prominent streamer and the other isn't). I have both and was only able to get to the server locked screen.
---
So that's not it.
---
...why is everyone naked?
---
*"Draw me like one of your Forsaken girls"*
---
If nothing, it teaches us 3 things about Blizz/WoW
---
1. They have truly learned nothing in 15 years
---
2. Fanbois will always defend their poor decisions
---
3. Conclusion: Classic may actually be quite authentic.
---
So the thing is that it's a *stress* test.
---
The point is to overload the systems. If Blizzard ran this and it was seamless, then ok good result but it's not the point.
---
The point is to discover how to break it. They've had thousands of us hammering a single realm, and of course most of us didn't get in. That was the point.

So you're saying that when meters don't matter (when the raid isn't in danger often) then druid heals go down.
---
You think there won't be level 1 hogger raids when classic releases?
---
After playing on private servers I am sure many people won't make it past level 20. The game is just so much more involved and difficult than modern MMOs/RPGs. People are just so used to fast paced leveling, plowing through horde of enemies like a super hero. Having to take your time and methodically plan out each fight just won't be down everyone's alley. For me this is what I love about the game, it makes even early game content feel epic and you feel so much more powerful when you leave an area and come back 2-3 levels higher and crush those same mobs.
---
Pssst the servers will be up until tomorrow
---
Exactly, Towelliee is the exact same.

Don't support these guys, they can fuck off back to BfA / shitty Diablo clones

Say the two idiots who chime in just to complain about people complaining.
---
Yes it was.  the Eu rules were different from the US.   
---
In essence lying to people is against the rules now but try get someone banned for telling you they are a rogue when in actual fact they are a human being playing a rogue etcvc.  it is all ridiculous but thats what happens when games companies make up rules so they can do whatever they want to their playerbase and cry baby gamers get to cry more and learn less about being responsible for their own actions and assumptions, laziness etc ina role playing game.
---
sheesh if this is the reaction to a stress test I can only imagine what launch will be like
---
this is actually pretty good. Tradechat aka panser also got in and i remember seeing clips of her kicking and screaming and shitting on classic wow cause the virtual ticket diddnt have a new pet and was instead demo access. Now shes playing classic beta and acting like she was never against it, just the community.
---
Tried for the full two hours to log on. I was never successful. The server was either displayed as offline to me (while others were able to play); or I would time out at the character creation.
---
I'm sure as hell not a streamer but here I am. [https://imgur.com/fjPkuHm](https://imgur.com/fjPkuHm)
---
This is obviously a projection. Pitty your parents...
---
It was a stress test. hundreds of people got in... it was only ONE server, so its obvious not everyone gets in... infact most people didnt get in at all. 
---
Who cares? it was a stress test, they tested with hundreds of players on a single server... they also did some layering as evident from ingame system messages and the server didnt crash during it as far as streams were.
---
So dont be frustrated, its not beta its a stress test... stress for servers, they got just that.
---
You cant be that mad about a stress test that lasted for 2 hours... remember, beta, PTR, alpha... every one of those is optional and you are not entitled to get it for being subscriber or beta applier.
---
Ive been subbed to beta program since forever and literally the only beta i ever got in was WoD... and that was the beta everyone got in if you pre-order the expac or something.
---
From a min-max standpoint, healing meters won't matter because the raid will stay alive regardless
---
pretty pathetic publicity stunt honestly if this was a real stress test it did it's trick it made me extremely stressed :)
---
FULL RAGE BAR GOTTA SPEND THAT!
---
I still remember trying to figure out why WoW wouldn‚Äôt launch without crashing and got into a heated joking match about using your head... to hit things.
---
To be fair, his icon was the D3 Monk.
---
You must be new to betas.
---
Since legion beta, streamers have priority login. It helps them save on advertising.
---
Chill out it's a stress test...why people are getting frustrated about is ridiculous.  The whole purpose of the beta was for blizz to do shit like this.  It's totally expected!  The game isn't even out yet so be grateful blizz even chose you to participate.  There are people out there who would give the left nut (or clit) to even play the beta for 5 minutes.  Just chill...
---
Have you even looked at twitch? The two biggest streamers, Asmon and Soda, aren't playing. Just like everyone else.
---
Don't think I've ever seen a stress test help tbh, launch is always a nightmare regardless
---
You have no idea what they've learned without seeing the data. My guess is they've noticed some issues in the character creation
---
Underrated comment
---
I fully expect absolute annihilation of the servers...again.
---
Fucking seriously? Come on man
---
I know it was a test and I'm happy to help out regardless, but hearing that after getting to the character select screen makes me both annoyed that I was so close but also sad that I never had a chance to begin with. :,(
---
honestly
---
Mage depends heavily on aoe farm capabilities.
---
Rogue is slower than warrior.
---
Lots of difference between all the other classes you didn't mention. Priest and druid fx. is quite fast.
---
It's the true authentic experience.
---
The bitter truth is that yes, these streamers are free publicity for Blizzard. And who doesn't love free publicity? Still, they could have handled this with a bit more grace.
---
Alot of people say this unironically, they are retarded
---
Don't see the big deal. People's opinions change all the time and they seem to genuinely be enjoying it.
---
they looked forward to see what people would do!!!! streamers didnt fail the test, they did as they expected them to
---
Money sure is one hell of a motivator for some people huh
---
&gt; it puts more eyes on the game and will ultimately bring in new players. new players mean a stronger and hopefully more lasting community.
---
Not to mention increasing the possibility of Classic Burning Crusade and Classic Wrath Of The Lich King.  Their development is directly tied to Classic Vanilla's success.
---
honestly think you're on point here
---
It's a test, what we're your expectations? A huge middle finger? You're helping them get this right for launch...
---
It's full of people that already have access to the closed beta. ALL we wanted to do was login an experience first-hand the fluidity of the new client/settings and combat. 
---
But no. Streamers and the other in-crowd that has beta access got priority ONCE AGAIN.
---
First of all, this was like a week ago why are you even on this thread. Second, being relatable gets views. A lot of WoW players can relate to him because he is a slob who still lives with his parents, very unhealthy physique, and toxic. Along with any other things you may think about. He doesn't have much personality besides being a shut-in and spending his life playing a video game instead of achieving something meaningful; which is very relatable to a lot of wow players. From what I've seen he just sits there and does pretty much the same as any other Wow streamer and occasionally has a stupid look on his face as he mouth breathes.
---
Not complaining. Laughing. Laughing very, very hard.
---
I would be curious to know how many people were invited to the stress test. In two hours, I managed to get to the character creation screen, but every time I tried to create a character, I got the timeout message. I wish they would have excluded people who already had the beta, letting others have a chance, especially since the streamers basically flooded the servers with their viewers.
---
Next tweet:
---
"more unrelated: how do you extinguish a room full of burning computer hardware? #notstresstestatall"
---
"extremely unrelated: can the families of deceased server engineers sue you, if they died due to a freak server-starts-burning-accident during their probationary period? #needlegaladvice"
---
You are literally what‚Äôs wrong with the stress test
---
It's pretty much an open secret that people don't want a beta invite to actually test a game.
---
I hear you. My brother stayed up until 3 AM and didn't even get into champ creation :/
---
Ah well, all for a greater cause :)
---
It's correct. There was a patch long ago that said it was minimum of 10g, but it turned out to be incorrect. So assuming they go with the old code as it was, it will be 15g.
---
&gt;Sadly the most popular are streamers who can't do 3rd grade maths 
---
 ü§î Nah your not mad at all.
---
Wait until you see tanks dual-wielding against raid bosses.  Because that is a thing on Private servers, and will almost certainly be a thing in Classic.
---
You have been chosen! The claaaawwwww....
---
At least you died to those guys and not the login screen boss
---
I think Asmongold is a pretty cool guy Kapp
---
Why did you spend 3 hours trying to log in?
---
Just go do something productive
---
You all sound like Spergs hating on streamers.
---
I have a beta acct, so I was also included in the stress test. Same issues experienced as many others regarding retrieving realms, queue times and disconnects upon finishing queues. Most of the time I saw the server as Locked or Offline, however I was eventually able to get in (briefly) to create a character. I killed a few boars before it came down again (now seemingly for good).
---
ITT: Entitled spoilt brats who have NO idea what a stress test is...
---
Absolute morons.
---
Linked it to Sodapoppin and he currently has it up, sounds like he might try it out.
---
Nice work!
---
Offline for days...PepeHands
---
This is also what tribe said on stream today, bis for PvE and PvP for orcs at the beginning of the game
---
ASMON IS BALD
---
Even though I should have received closed beta in the first place, I got stress test invite instead only to stopped at character creation and not get in. I get that prolly the point was the login servers but this is just a huge slap in the face of even bothering to tell us you cap it at lvl 5.
---
they were... servers  down now so of course they aren't right now....
---
To bad they let the server run for another 24 hours eh? Huge middlefinger there.. not.
---
Listen to what I‚Äôm telling you.  There was no patch that made it so you couldn‚Äôt get up there. You could get up there in cata with heroic leap shown here:
---
https://youtu.be/wn5WsYiT4
---
And even if it DID zone you in it would take you to the start.
---
There is no patch to change this because it has always been like this.
---
You obviously don‚Äôt understand on instances work.
---
i havent played for almost 3 months, activated my sub last week, now ive got the beta server/stress test option in the wow bnet window :)
---
started in mop !
---
Hi, /u/InfinityPlusSeven
---
Yeah THOUSANDS of non streamers around us but the 20 streamers are the focus of course lol
---
This made me laugh so damn hard.
---
Oh no, is his band of retards gonna take away my fake internet points?
---
Made it in game only to be disconnected after a few minutes. Have yet to make it back in again.
---
probably very well, considering hundreds of players got in in a very short amount of time.
---
Yeah, seems to be the same with my guild mates.
---
i know they didn't learn anything about what happens when the servers are under stress because they didn't put the servers under any stress
---
didnt recieve any emails tho!
---
Only streamers will ever get to play classic wow. The rest of us just have to watch them enjoy the experience we've been waiting for.
---
I do, they demonized the classic fanbase for years, trying to stop us from having what we want, since they're in with Blizz they suddenly all support it nowadays.
---
people stayed up until 3am (EU) and never got past char screen
---
Place 1 ready to pick server... DISCONNECTED while streamers got in no problem
---
yeah its fine to be against something, admit you were wrong and that you are enjoying it instead of acting like you supported it the whole time xD
---
afaik aq20 drops the highest eviscerate rank
---
Then they shouldn't have prioritized streamers and those that already had beta access. Should've been all randoms but Blizzard is retarded.
---
imagine having fun
---
i doubt im getting in lol
---
Oh yeah, I didn‚Äôt mean exclusively for Orcs. You are right
---
Anyone else stuck on character creation?
---
I guarantee you that every single person who posts strictly to either whine about or mock people for being upset about *anything ever* is younger, on average, than anyone genuinely upset.
---
Not really crying, but ok?
---
There are like 20 streamers in total, they are not filling up the servers on their own. Think before you type such nonsense. They might have gotten flagged to get ahead, but that hardly changes anything in the grand scope of things. There were so many many MANY other people online. You just drew the shortest straw. Doesnt really matter if you had gotten in since there would be nothing to test or do. THIS WAS A STRESS TEST ffs.
---
why? you did your part in the stress test. Not everyone is gonna get in on a single server... dont have false hope to play a game in a mere stress test. Release in 3 months, just wait and there will be more than 1 server everyone is going to try and login.
---
Don't you think that if they wanted to test stress of starting areas, they would have just locked you to that area?
---
YOU PLAY THE GAME TO TEST IT
---
HELLO ASMONGOLD! REMEMBER TOO USE UR TWITCH PRIME GUYS!!!!
---
Yes, making sure the login servers can handle a massive amount of logins isn't important at all for launch.
---
Its obviously a joke my dude. Context clues yadda yadda
---
Mordhau? It's fun as hell. No microtransactions either.
---
Then you came far my friend!

Wahhhh
---
Not hating on streamers.
---
There was more than 3000 (Guessing) online, and only like 2-4 raid groups running there.
---
Just wanted to create a Meme. :)
---
This guy gets it.
---
I think its clear no one reads the text:
---
&gt; **The** ***World of Warcraft Classic*** **Closed Beta realms will be down for the duration of the test**. Once the stress test period is over, you‚Äôll be able to continue playing on the stress test realm (up to level 5) until Thursday, May 23.
---
wow look at all those streamers! /s pls don't hate me for a joke when everyones salty
---
Funniest thing is some of you actually think this. Soda and Asmon have a race to the gates of AQ, they couldn't log in, by the time they got in, there was a player in Mulgore as an Undead. That WASN'T a streamer!!!! You all are fucking retarded
---
I'm not a streamer, I get to the realm select screen.
---
Saddest thing is that that's what vanilla community is going to be. People expect vanilla to be less toxic than retail without realizing that retail players are going to come to Vanilla lol.
---
It's the best thing you can get for PVP, and arguably the best for PVE (with the DW equivalent being almost as expensive anyway). But demonshear is quite fucking good in 1.12 and almost worth just using instead since it's easy to get.
---
common sense doesn't work on these guys. They just want a reason to hate streamers
---
'hurrdurr i was only kidding' doesnt work in stickied topics guys. they are actually locking everything else posted about the  stress test. is that a joke too
---
haHAA
---
I keep getting *"character creation timed out".*
---
True, it may not have been that critical. However, since these test are meant to prepare for launch, you should test them in launch conditions, or else what‚Äôs the point?
---
Welcome to reddit :D
---
Welp i'm here to tell you that if you had to work through the stress test you didn't miss anything. It was a bunch of people crammed at a "select server" screen while the twitch streamers got in with little issues.
---
all of us
---
are you a streamer lol
---
I'm a 30 year old man child tyvm
---
Or the quick healers can focus on triage while the druids put on the efficient heals.
---
You don't heal for meters, you heal to save the raid from dying. This means healing efficiently which means utilizing every classes strengths to its fullest. 
---
Sniping heals as quick as you can means losing efficiency (having less mana near the end of the fight while your druids will have too much).
---
It's interesting how people are so focused on pure hps meters which don't matter nearly as much as dps meters or overhealing meters
---
Woah dude.
---
stress test
---
Seriously, if you are going to send blizzard angry mails, try to rally forums to unsub from streamers, and overall be a crybaby about not getting to play properly on ***a stress test server capped at level 5*** then just go download a god damn private server.
---
agreed. Though warlocks are unfortunately quite behind hunters on a fresh launch simply due to how effing slow they are in the beginning.

Hey there I am! I have the star!!!

This wasn‚Äôt a failure, it worked exactly as intended.  The point was to put as much stress on the servers as possible.

That‚Äôs exactly what happened.

I wish every girl in my life was fan service
---
Who gives a fuck, it was a level 5 cap to test stress on the servers. If you want to play classic till the release, go on as private server
---
I‚Äôve told this story a few times, but one night I spent 2 hours with this priest trying to get a VC group together.   We never got the group together, but had a good time in Wesfall killing shit and talking. Next day I was talking wow with some friends and found out the priest I had played with was my friend Brad.

Small world indeed

Grown ass adults literally crying over a stress test of a beta...

hey man poe beats the garbage they call diablo 3 any day of the week
---
Hear me out, logging in and getting booted repeatedly ***is*** the stress test.
---
Fuck you Asmon, i know you are reading this and you haven't played in 5 years OMEGA
---
Is it an open stress test? Last I checked it wasn't. Hence it being limited.
---
They sent out a limited amount of invites. People who have the beta access + additional invites. This number was probably calculated by systems administrators to test the functionally of the one server cluster in order to gauge the amount of server space they will need come launch. Obviously, judging by the issues, they didn't estimate correctly.
---
Ofcourse, they aren't launching with ONE server. That would be moronic.
---

its so funny

Closed beta is good for streamers, so good luck convincing any streamer to join your cause.   Not that it would matter anyway, because blizzard isn‚Äôt taking orders from streamers.
---
asmongold saying he has more play time then everyone here, gee almost like he gets PAID to play WoW daily for 12 hours.
---
Make a new poll with same choices but with one set as "I have beta access and got to xx" and "I only got stress test invite and got to xx" so we can see if anyone with stress test only got in-game.
---
Well, that would be testing the servers so.. yep.

Someone please post of they get past "Accept" to create a character.

You can get that far, but can't get past that (my and others experience).

I am a nobody and my queues jumped around too, I'd say I had an easier time to get in than most streamers.

---
Did you repeatedly hit "Accept" on character creation, or did it just work the first time?
---
Being a streamer has nothing to do with getting into the stress test though. That's all luck at this point
---
&gt;The real testers among us are simply sheep who are there to test the queue.
---
Yes, that's what you are when you choose to participate in a stress test. We're basically a more realistic version of a botnet for Blizzard to use to test, and if you aren't happy with that you shouldn't even try.
---
nah, not being a streamer, I was in the test.
---
I love this
---
Oh my flipping god guys its a STRESS TEST you don't even get enough time to LEVEL, why does this matter so much to you guys!!

I quit my job and divorced my wife to play in this stress test
---
Oh look asmon JUST logs in meanwhile I'm at off line and or locked
---
Never. You must be one of those steamer/s
---
Now paint the etching with blue glow-in-the-dark paint and then bust that bad boy out at the next next club you‚Äôre at with blacklight.
---
Fuck, I got disconnected on character select and now the stress test is offline.
---
Jesus Murphy, what if we never come down?
---
I was so excited, waited so long then I finally got hope when I got to character selection screen. Didn't work and gave up, wasted 3 hours of my day.
---
k
---
I can't imagine flooding an entire zone with hundreds or thousands of people is a good thing. I do recall some streamers getting banned by Blizzard in the past for doing that. It's kinda like finding toilet paper on sale at the store, buying all of it, then leaving none for others. It's good for the store's business, but not for others that need it.
---
blizzard employees traveled back in time to give the streamers privelged acess its sure that blizzard wants us lower citizen to suffer
---
Rogue and warrior are hard to play but in terms of keybinds they by far the least demanding.
---
show us where the streamer hurt you
---
Yeh thats why asmongold is playing right now on a server we cant access lol
---
Iam not salty but streamer get priv its just a fact.
---
oh shit was that you!?!?
---
Dude these people are proving free advertisement. Does that not click for you?
---
After spending like 15 minutes mocking all of us for claiming they were getting priority. The cocksucker literally went and made a tinfoil hat.
---
"Note that anyone with an active subscription to any of our games will automatically be excluded from consideration" What? So asmongold/sodapoppin wouldnt get in anymore cause they got an active WoW sub?
---
While I'm no tinfoil hat enthusiast, we can't just pretend that it's coincidence that all major streamers have gotten in to play the stress test.  I don't really have a problem with it, it's marketing for Blizz and it's not hard to believe really, but those so vehemently against it sound just as crazy as those freaking out about it.
---
So all the people that were also in game with asmon soda etc have some kind of priority? you guys are so clueless, just as bad as twitch chat.
---
When you cast the default Eagle Eye ability in Classic, it changes the icon. It's kinda like when you turn on Aspect of the Hawk, the icon changes and when you use that button again, it turns off Aspect of the Hawk.
---
So it changes from "cast Eagle Eye when I press Q" to "turn off Eagle Eye when I press Q." So what the macro does is always makes it say, "cast Eagle Eye when I press Q even when I have Eagle Eye active."
---
That's the best way I can explain it lol.
---
Remember how the "influencers" were all invited to some secret summit a week ago?
---
is anybody else having trouble logging in?
---
I poisoned their water supply, burned all their crops and sent a plague onto their houses just to play this stress test
---
Damn the ocean isn't as salty as this thread. But seriously  though, streamers definitely have priority.
---
Guys.
---
Streamers get prior because they actually bring in extra revenue. Most of you all spent the last 10 years not playing WoW and screaming your heads off on Private servers.
---
Its a stress-test, afaik, they intend to test the limits of the servers, so you are litterally complaining that the test did its job?
---
Lol- fool ...I got away with if for over 5 years .  don't underestimate the stupidity and greed of people.  
---
I used to rob one person of months of mats, have chat full of scam whines about me and be robbing someone else...
---
If people were encouraged to create strong guilds where crafters did their business within the guilds keeping the guild strong v other guilds and not whoring out rare recipes etc to anyone with gold to pay .. the game would be better.
---
If you were there you all know how tough it was to get Epics and all the roll rotations that went on in the Raid groups so there was some element of fairness, plus all the raid leaders lying to people and giving gear to their mates etc etc ....noo one afaik was ever banned etc for lying to Raid members that they would get the next epic for their class that dropped but even in EU blizzard decided it was a bigger crime to rob some lazy bastards herbs etc or send a cash on delivery mail dressed up as a free mount or some quest reward etc ...
---
Took the mages to go after certain hackers or bots that ran for month upon month is same spots whilst letting little Billy cry about being ripped off by someone playing a bad guy quite legitimately in the context of a Role Playing game.  
---
But you are right .. the community should be responsible for policing and it could do it if a majority of people played towards that aim.
---
In some respects Blizzard EU probably gave up trying to see if proper in game policing could develop.. because back then MMORPGS were very much a brave new world and what happened in virtual worlds was as much a social experiment as it was a game (for many old or interested enough to see them for what they were)
---
They had views because people were around (or awake) to try to get to play for themselves.  
---
  
---
That makes your point pretty moot? They have been streaming actual beta for a while now.
---
If you ever thought it wouldn't be like this you're an idiot, this is the games industry, get used to this shit.
---
lmao i just watched the top 2 streamers create a character and load the starting zone
---
just make a better server 4head
---
This killed my hype. I don't care I didn't get into beta, I got the stress test, only to realize all to late they never meant to let us play and test it. If they had said your testing log in fine sure. But now I feel a touch used. And the streamers trying to play it off like they don't have priority or it's all about the view, nah that's not community that's false gods, And it's gonna become toxic.
---
Annnnd realm offline
---
hahahahahaha
---
After having defeated the endless disconnect boss, now it's character creation timing out over and over. But lucky for us every streamer can create and play at their own whim. :thinking:
---
Sweet...we tied our game and now im drinking beers with the boys. Sounds like I made the right choice.
---
i sitll cant even get in at all
---
"We have successfully invited all the streamers to Beta, and fuck you regular players, you get nothing, thank you."
---
Basically. I mean, I don't blame them, It's pretty obvious why all the streamers got the golden ticket to the game.
---
I love it, so many babies here
---
Time to raid Blizzard offices.
---
What part of the term "STRESS TEST" do you not understand ?
---
Whoever is posting the alerts... They need about 200 more of that guy.
---
I‚Äôm surprised you could type this with asmongolds dick in your hand
---
I'm in the character creation screen but it just times out.
---
All the people with the full beta accounts can actually get past the character creation screen while the stress people can't.
---
Those of you who are so upset, what were you planning on doing if you did get in?
---
Been sitting here trying to create a character for minutes, then Asmond and Annie is able to create new characters on first try.
---
Some YouTuber did some questionable DPS testing and SPriest didn't do too bad, however you will have to be try-hard to be mediocre at best. Still, it's hard enough to fill 40 slots, so you can probably make it happen if that's what you want to do.
---
Look how mad Asmonbronze got at losing a several duels. Imagine him after 3-4 HOURS of straight murder every time he rezzes.
---
What about the thousands of other people following him? priority also? you guys are so mad lol
---
I feel like it's more that they are giving preferential access to the people already in the beta. Has anyone who is ***only** in the stress test actually made a char and logged in?
---
I bet most that got left out of the server are from EU since beta server is in US.
---
Yeah, wow. I checked and saw they were all offline for a bit. Thought that meant the test was just fully over. But yeah, they're all still playing. Starting new characters, right now.
---
I'm trying not to be salty about this experience, but it's been a letdown for sure.
---
Thanks captain obvious. For future reference, don't make assumptions about what you think people may or may not be aware of.
---
Hey, me and my brother are going to be taking a week off work to race to as high a level as we can. It will be a PVP server, him a warrior me a shaman. We'd love to have an AOE class join us.
---
Comment histories are public. You're welcome to look for yourself.
---
How are so many people falling for this lol
---
I got the "Character creation timed out" error before Soda or Asmongold even got in. 
---
Sorry for your narrative.
---
dumb question, but I'm assuming you're level 5 on stress test when you did it? if so that could make sense?
---
Yeah free promo for blizz. Well ive done my part and stress tested the servers... 
---
But watch this happen again on launch i gurantee it. Not angry or anything.. its just what will happen for sure.
---
It just shows that Blizzard cares more about the small amount of publicity than the loyal fanbase in whos face they shut the door at.
---
There aren't other servers that are online.
---
So it it "crying" that you're confused about, then? Do you know what that is?
---
Why? That is just insanely naive and/or dumb.

hahahah yea

man get over yourself idiot
---
I WAS THERE
---
the login servers are the same as they've always been, they're as tested as they're gonna get
---
classic doesn't have some brand new unique login servers that need testing, it's the exact same stuff BFA uses
---
Seems like the server is locked again
---
"Note that anyone with an active subscription to any of our games will automatically be excluded from consideration" 
---
Looks like they wanna get people who don't normally play WoW to expand exposure. Good move.
---
I fondly remember all the good times leveling with my friends down in Orc Camp.
---
which is what made classic possible. get lost
---
Are you a time traveller or something?
---
I mean, I don't think it's going to die out either but a page of twitch streams three months before launch means absolutely nothing
---
I dont know iam only stress test and furthest was char creation.
---
I doubt all they wanted was to see if the login boss could be beaten..
---
Wow streamers are sad individuals.
---
Wow what an idiot, i bet nobody loves you
---
How many streamers are there? How many people got into the server. You make it sound like streamers are the majority of the players who were logged in...
---
Actually the community cried for classic while the majority of streamers hated the idea
---
I think people for some reason believe they are entitled to a fair queue (they aren't), and that streamers take up thousands of spots on a server all by themselves (they don't).
---
Yes I am, especially since they haven't said anything since and NOBODY could get on for the first fourth of the time allotted to the test.
---
What part of the term "STRESS TEST" do you not understand ? It supposed to be full of queue people and a bunch of people online and they want to crash the server to STRESS THEM to see what is the max... etc.. Source: Software engineer do this kind of stuff for my clients all the time ffs, so shut up about things you dont understand
---
:)
---
how else are you supposed to roleplay when you first experienced vanilla wow smh
---
The people with full beta access can get past the character creation easily...watching streamers do it consistently.
---
they test other aspects of the game

i get the feeling this is just a stress test of the login servers! but hey, getting to see the old login screen is good enough for me ^:)
---
a true Reddit galaxy brain. incredible.
---
Here's my issue. After the servers come back up from the layering fix. I get stuck on character creation error. I am watching sodapoppin while doing this to see what else is happening. I casually watch him close the client down reopen it and then gets into the server with 0 issue. Creates a character with 0 issue and then proceeds to login with 0 issues. How is this even remotely not priority for streamers?
---
Wow I shouldn't have just watched that. This is bullshit. Why give streamers priority when they already have beta access.  Man I thought tonight was gonna be fondly remembered and now I just feel like eric andre. LET ME INNNNN!!!
---
It's ironic to see them prioritize the very people that will later on destroy servers...
---
and yet theres other ppl on there too? get over it idiot
---
It's too bad my internet isn't good enough to watch em without buffering and skipping and 160p quality. Sure not a ton of people have that issue I guess, but gosh dang it I refuse to stop trying to log in
---
This is fake if the "Cleavage and toxicity" didn't clue you in.
---
So why are all the streamers allowed in while I'm not?
---
my argument is that the streamers took too many people out of the starting zones. the point of the stress test was to keep everyone in the starting zone and test out what would happen with the people who got in. People who couldn't play isnt the issue, the issue is the test didn't get accomplished data because people had bets on who could get once place quicker.
---
Got a big nope here.  Same as everyone else..get to character creation and time out.
---
Maybe in a support ticket they'll pause it for 2 months and you can have already paid for 2 months of Classic

There‚Äôs so much salt in here lol. Its a stress test that lasted what. 2 hours? And you somehow make drama and rage about not being able to experience lvl 1-5. Stop crying about that you waited hours to try and get in, that is your own choice. Blizzard most likely got what they needed during the first test, dont be so high on yourself with your egocentric views.
---
This makes the most sense
---
This is obviously fake. GTFO
---
I, for one, find the queue screen to be an authentic recreation of my time in Vanilla. A++
---
I fully support this, all I want to do in classic now is camp streamers.
---
Don't confuse Beta with Stress Test. I can't believe you don't see the irony in complaining about overloaded servers during a server stress test.
---
Hi, /u/vachi_
---
Yeah, I loathe when people act like the beta "counts". Beta's like a private server. Wait until it goes live, everyone has access, and let's see who can do what.
---
You dont seem to understand the definition of spam. Just because you want to post and whine about your experience (that thousands of others are having) doesnt make yours or anyone elses posts less spammy.
---
I get it. People are mad and want to vent their frustrations on something. No one needs a million posts about the same issues we are all having.
---
Asmengold says there is no streamer privilege meanwhile every streamer is online i can't even make a character
---
What happened ?

Holy shock counts as a 3rd heal, sorta.

Proof of streamer bullshit

I'll test it out whenever the fudgesicle I get to log in! :D
---
For anyone who didn't know, a select group of people received stress test invite emails, but the automated flagging system hit an error due to more than one PTR account. The Dev's made a post telling everyone to open a CS ticket and have them remove the PTR accounts; and that they would re-run the invites so the accounts would be flagged.
---
It turns out that was a catastrophe because everyone who did exactly that was not able to have their accounts flagged for access because the re-run code only flagged accounts that still had more than one PTR.
---
 Most of us waiting around the forums for the entire span of the stress test, unable to download the client, until Vrakthris locked the thread and said too bad you aren't going to get access.
---
The full drama is here: [https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/received-stress-test-email-no-access/179242/1093](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/received-stress-test-email-no-access/179242/1093)
---
I think the sad part is, this issues was said nearly 20 hours before the stress test launched and nothing was done to address it. We didn't even get confirmation that the PTR bug didn't or won't prevent us from regular beta or future stress test access. 
---
Thanks Blizzard! See you in June!
---
Yeah. I didnt get in at all either... infact ive been in the beta program since forever and never gotten selected. Am i mad? not at all, i did my part in the stress test trying to login and now i guess ill just wait mere 3 months and get to play the real thing with a grin on my face. :P
---
This entitlement thing has been a thing since forever..... i remember since ages past playing on PTR and for some reason people dont understand that PTR is completely optional and you are not paying to play it.
---
Exactly the same thing with alpha/beta.
---
Imagine being mad about free things. :D
---
Lmao Asmon literally just logged in and created a character with no struggle at all, while there's people who have been trying to do so for hours now.
---
The streamers are beta testers. If they have a privilege it's because they're beta testers. Right now, from what I'm seeing, a lot of people are in. So I don't know why people have to be this fucking salty about it. First it was just testing the logins, the servers kept getting restarted, it wasn't supposed to let people through. Now it's opening the gate, flooding the starting zones. Now it's testing how the servers handle that strain. 
---
Stop complaining and go be useful and stress test, when you've been chosen. You'll get to play the damn game once it's out, stress/beta testing is NOT a right, and it is NOT a privilege, it's an obligation that you're expected to help out with, if you were chosen.
---
Expressing disappointment and is all well and good (and tbh, the purpose of this thread is to keep it contained), but some are taking their venting a bit too far. imagine form blizz perspective. They are genuinely trying to make this game good, and they obviously want to bring the community into this effort, but if every time they listen, all they get if "FU BLIZZ U WASTE MY 2 HOURS OF MY LIFE U SUC FU IM NEVER TOUCHING THIS BETA TRAINWRECK AGAIN", how can that be motivating to keep us included? how is that even useful for the game? how is this attitude going to benefit the community as a whole?
---
I believe this is the main reason for the disconnect between Retail devs and its playerbase. Lets not make it a part of classic!
---
Character creation timed out?
---
&gt; All those hundreds of slots are taken up leaving genuine players who didn't get in to beta and actually want to play and test (because the streamers did so bad at it) without a spot to play.

What's the picture from?

Getting playtime is not the goal of a stresstest...
---
GOT IN. KEEP TRYING AT CHAR SCREEN.
---
It ruins it imo. Whats the point in the streamers even playing classic wow if theyre going to accept trades of full green gear for free and gold constantly, how the fuck is that the genuine wow experience? Asmon was so proud of doing deadmines, when like 15 mins before someone traded him 5 pieces of greens way better than his current gear, It's like wow congrats you did it with ease, using someone elses items.
---
Bamboozled. How sad is the state of gaming today that you actually believed it up until then.
---
2 1/2 hours, still can't create one.
---
HOGGER!
---
That's right, but it doesn't invalidate my point.
---
Let's say there are 20 popular WoW streamers. If those 20 streamers were replaced by 20 of the &gt;100000 people trying to get in, then yes, 20 more players would fairly be able to play.
---
**BUT** \~100000 players would still not be able to log in **AND** they would not be able to see the stress test live on stream. If streamers are able to play, those players can see the test live.
---
Have not had a single successful login attempt since it opened.
---
I got to admit I'm pretty disappointed overall. Giving people who have had all week to play and will get to play for months yet, priority, is kind of disgusting.
---
Asmon's soundtrack for the stress test has been aces.
---
Not streamers exclusively, but seems to be those already in the Beta, not those that got the Stress Test only.
---
I got to character creation this time. After two hours. Progress. Still timing out
---
So were a shitload of other people that weren't streaming...
---
The commentors is just messing around
---
No layering looks awesome guys, but maybe we could split the server to those that want it vs those that don't. Because I wouldn't want to play through that shit.
---
That's what I did but I'm not hopeful
---
when you formulate it it's actually mind blowing - people are actually mad about not being able to participate in a stress test part of a beta of a game that was released 15 years ago.

Kinda of tarnishes the image more unless they say yes, the full beta people are supposed to get in for x reason rather than having us all guess/conjecture.
---
looks like a lot of plebian stress testers
---
Man, there is no way they're going to let only streamers in at launch, unless I read you wrong and the thing you're expecting to happen again is instability, in which case: no shit. There was never any chance it wouldn't be rocky on day one, that's just the nature of it.

Very evident that the permanent beta accounts got priority. In fact, I wonder if ANY only stress test accounts got into the game at all.

I'm sure the devs wanted everyone to get in. No doubt. Hopefully next stress test they fix these issues so we get a smoother launch at live!

Ah..cough, cough...go back to the basement. /s

Dude iam not salty. Look at my other comments. Iam loggin in and in and in while i write this comment.

Im mainly upset that we dont even get to get pass character creation : (

they did
---
Isnt that the point of stress tests? to overload the servers.
---
Congratz you did your part now stop being entitled, you  were never paying to play stress tests or betas anyway... its completely optional to everyone. Just like PTR is and has always been.
---
I didn't expect to play and have a smooth run to level 5 but I did expect to be able to log in and participate in the in game stress tests, rather than the login screen ones . If I knew that, I wouldn't have waited .
---
it's fucking bullshit and i refuse to be treated like a 2nd class citizen. really putting a bad taste in my mouth, we'll see if i still want to play when it finally comes out.
---
did u just spam or what
---
This is after the 2 hour limited stress test. Not sure what they're doing now.
---
So do the babies crying that a stress test is a stress test and that there is "obvious streamer privilege" ( which if that existed, i would support it anyways because Im not dense about business) see that how full the starting zones are? lol they must all be streamers!

Boycott Streamers Pepega
---
you won't get past it, unless they turn the server online.  I tried 20x to make a character.
---
It was always DM to me, until I switched to Alliance and everyone called it VC.
---
If it does, it means they had far more people trying to play than they planned for/were allocated resources for by the powers that be. I see it as a good thing in the long run as it sends a message to the right people when they ask the dev team why things aren‚Äôt working properly.

Either way, the salt is entertaining and I do sincerely hope people are just shitposting for fun

It let you make a character?  Anyone else?

I really do not understand how you cannot follow the context of this conversation. The original comment was that the people who were upset about the stress test were kids. I responded that the people who were criticizing people for being upset were more likely to be young, because that's what young people do. You responded to that with a post saying that either I or people generally had the right to be upset but not to criticize streamers for it. I replied to you saying that I also think its silly, but don't need to vocalize that, as an adult, supporting my previous statement. 
---
Somehow that confused you.
---
Let me ask you something, because you're clearly in the camp that is bothered by this, are you a day over 21? I'd bet not. Answer honestly. I'm not judging you. I'm just pointing out the difference between the things that young people care about.
---
72% of people are wrong. DM is For email sheesh
---
What, with all the other random people they were in with?  
---
Holy crap, get a grip.
---
Narcos from Netflix.
---
Do you think Omar would have been running with the streamers and not say anything if he had a problem with it?
---
ima noob to classic why RFC or VC?
---
For sure. I definitely agree with you on that point. Transmog was a fun thing as a concept but in practice it really did destroy that part of the community aspect.
---
That is exactly how far I got. I got super excited when I was able to make my very first WoW character over again, which I made 2 weeks before The Burning Crusade came out. Then I got the time out popup. I was sad but I can wait until August 27th to really do it.
---
üôèüèª
---
Gonna need a Dr. in Stats to understand half of it though.
---
I'm not a streamer but I had existing beta access, and I think that has a lot to do with it. All the streamers had beta already too.
---
????????
---
He just editted the HTML to change that bottom text part, and screenshot it
---
retarded post
---
It's only going to make classic bigger in August. It's a good thing.
---
I was only invited to the Stress test and was able to make a character after the 2 hour period ended.
---
The character creation beta test has been real fun guys.
---
I mean, that's literally what a stress test is.
---
Just to be clear - I understand the benefits that Blizzard gets from these streamers, and that they work hard to be in the position that they are in, I just have a big problem with corporate pandering.  I pay the same $15 and have put my time into the game and past betas. Im probably going to get downvoted to hell for this post but I wanted this video to be public.
---
Yep.     
---
And then they ask why they didn't get invited to the beta... this... this is why...
---
It was C'thun
---
oh NOOOOO what will you DOOOO
---
If your life is so sad that a stress test with a time limit and lvl cap of 5 is twisting your brain you should seek professional help
---
I bet hes a streammer.
---
At least you guys got in to the stress test. I‚Äôm just sitting here wishing I could create a level 5. *feelsbadman*
---
Yeah I think that's how that undead mage won. Surprised no one seems to have googled it lol or knew beforehand.
---
Possible it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúpriority‚Äù but a problem with the access flagging. If new wave invitees can‚Äôt get in and actual beta invitees did, that tells me there‚Äôs something wrong with the access granted to the new wave.
---
There is not bias.
---
No shit. The stress test part of it is just 2 hours, but the realm is up for a whole day. 
---
From the blue post:
---
&gt; We‚Äôll be performing our first stress test for WoW Classic on Wednesday, May 22, from 4:00 ‚Äì 6:00 p.m. PDT.
---
&gt; We‚Äôll be actively monitoring the server, sending server messages, etc. during the 4:00 ‚Äì 6:00 p.m. PDT period and it‚Äôs important to have as many people as possible log in during this window!
---
Then:
---
&gt; The stress test realm itself will be available until Thursday, May 23 (becoming unavailable around 6:00pm PDT).
---
They obviously want to give a chance for all the people invited to actually be able play the thing.

same feeling
---
someone else posted before you
---
Who cares, look at the streams more people than streamers lmao. This test goes on for 24hrs
---
The point of a beta is symbiotic. Gamers get an earlier build to play and the company gets more data to improve the game before launch. If Blizzard just wants QA employees they can open their wallets and pay for some.
---
..have you seen how many people there are?
---
Sounds like Ally hogwash to me
---
LET ME INNNNN
---
But, but. That was supposed to be me!
---
BabyRage
---
I heard that streamers not on good terms with blizzard did not get invited yet, but this is a different topic - yes, it makes all the sense ever that streamers will get beta. It's useful to blizzard, it's useful to the streamers. The beta is not for people to play the game early, it's there for people to test, try as many things and report anything they think might be a bug. Having streamers with big followings as beta testers is the only logical choice, they know they'll spend a LOT of time doing just that, testing. They will have an army of followers who got in the beta, doing the same thing.
---
I did not mean you, btw, I meant people being salty and toxic as goddamn fuck everywhere. 
---
I'm very disappointed at the community being so awful about things before the game is even out. That's not in the spirit of classic.
---
Yeah, I was wondering what happened to it. :o
---
No the p servers don't feel smooth, but when I log into bfa in the same old areas, they feel smooth as butter
---
Are you expecting people to be mad at Blizzard over this? If they didn't whitelist streamers then no one would get to see the stress test period. I want the streamers to get in rather than another random 30 people so people can actually watch the stress test.

Bro the streamers are literally 1&lt; % of the players playing the stress test. Just think dude jesus.

Hey I played on Akama Horde as well! Was the shaman‚Äôs name Dranchetty by any chance?

There's thousands of notable streamers?

I tried for like 15min. They are trolling though. They have like 8 hoggers going around the gnome/dwarf starting zone killing everyone lol.
---
My favourite part is the part where it says ‚ÄúCharacter creation timed out.‚Äù
---
Did people seriously expect to "play" for this stress test? Its not the beta, its a stress test. I heard a lot of complaints about how Blizz "dropped the ball," and they felt left out of being able to get to level 5.... I thought it would be cool to see the zones but it quickly became apparent that their main goal was to test the max capacity of the servers and layers...
---
I got in to character creation minutes before any of the bigger streamers. I was stuck on character creation for 20 minutes until getting disconnected and then it was back to queue/disconnects/character creation. 
---
I was quicker than streamers by minutes once again when it went up again. I've been stuck on character creation for an hour now. Actually so fucking pissed and angry. Fuck this shit
---
Show me some love and upvote üíï
---
the vanilla p server naust doesn't feel smooth, but when I log into bfa in the same old areas, they feel smooth as butter. I had both clients open to check, and the p server just feels choppy
---
That's what she said
---
Wow those are only streamers out there.
---
You're a fucking idiot.
---
Is this you?
---
You sound like a bitch no offense.
---
The stress server test ends at 7 pm but they said you can still play until tomorrow. Is that right?
---
good point bro better delete all of them and go back to posting asmongold for 900 upvotes.
---
this is going to get deleted too becareful
---
Yes, the people who sat at character creatio , had it time out but still got in
---
I don‚Äôt get the point of this. We all know/knew they have priority in these situations and it makes perfect sense.
---
&gt;true testers
---
so what does a true tester do?
---
Very glad to hear that, it seems like the main thing blizz needs to work on is the login servers.

---
how ironic how the people calling u mad are the real triggered bitches. i've been watching or listening every second of asmon's stream and this is hilarious.
---
If you linked an item that had not been seen and you moused over it it would disconnect you, or something like that.
---
If you're an extreme min-maxer and all you care about is the best possible combination, I'm just going to parrot what I've been told many times:
---
Dwarf is the best on alliance, fear ward is handy and desperate prayer is swell. It has nice casting animations. Everybody is going to be one though, so like, do you really need to? You decide.
---
On Horde Troll is for pve, because the racial is good, but undead is the best shadow priest because they get devouring plague and WotF. 
---
Now, for the "shit" races. Imo, if you like the aesthetic, go for that. Again, unless you REALLY care about the little bit of min maxing priest skills.
---
For example, I'm 99% sure I'll be a night elf priest dude. It's considered the worst priest class, their racials are useless and their priest skill is also just not good for anything. But it has an amazing fantasy, perhaps as unique, if not more, than undead priests. Instead of directly the light, the channel the glory of Elune. Come on, that's pretty epic.
---
I'm not going to disagree with you, but all of the major streamers not only got in, but seemed to get in before others. I'm not even saying that I disagree with blizzard to let them in, it just sucks
---
&gt; . If streamers are able to play, those players can see the test live.  
---
Yes, and there was _nothing_ to see out of the ordinary when you posted. It could all have been shown on the normal beta server.  
---
Right now they show off the event things, but that was not the case when you made your post.  
---
'Wow we could see a limited version of what they had been streaming for over a week' ?
---
Im a stress tester in the game. Stop being ridiculous
---
who cares really.
---
this is pathetic
---
I love you Icefoe!
---
Not worthless, we just don't matter man. Until they deem that they need more people into the beta, we will wait our turn because we don't bring as much as some other people mate.
---
They've given people who have been subbed on accounts since 2004 and big streamers who are massive influencers and draw in massive crowds with a mix of multiple other people.
---
There are currently thousands atm gathered in Northshire, that's a lot of streamers man.
---
This is just how it is. It's a beta. Live with it and stop getting so angsty over a fucking stress test and go out and get some fresh air.

2h fury warrior on horde side.
---
I dont see it that often but if you are a semi-casual player in a semi-hardcore guild the best think you can do is go 2h fury and get yourself a nightfall. The spec is overall much easier to gear than DW fury and you will still be dealing good damage while bringing utility.

I don't, but i've been trying for almost 3 hours broski

Same for like the first 2 weeks its a great idea

---
Dang I'm sorry :(. Hopefully they increase the beta invites after today.
---
True Demonshear is pure sex in this patch BUT 5% crit in low gear levels is no joke. Plus axe racial means save money on edge Mastersand can use devilsaur set :)
---
Look at that streamer favoritism! Not interacting with the regular plebs!
---
^^^^/s
---
Ima get downvoted to oblivion, but this is the purpose of the test. See how many people log into one server before shit goes sideways. Test layering. And also have some GM fun. Rather have it now than at launch.
---
That‚Äôs a tiny fragment of people currently watching their streams.
---
Wait 20-30 streamers are NOT crashing the server for everyone else? Why do they get to play... /s
---
Yeah, pservers are reverse engineered lol. They're going to have issues.
---
Classic wow on the beta is silky smooth right now.
---
Pathetic Blizzard.
---
Yes but they would be stupid to pass up the free marketing of a unique event like this
---
That makes no sense compared to mine.
---

---
We should play together man. My char name will be Scoob.
---
DM is awesome, but I'd have to say it's a strong second next to Kara *for me
---
People are so funny. Like imagine getting upset about this? A couple hour level 5 capped STRESS TEST
---
Most notable streamers already had beta access to begin with. For all intents and purposes it's possible that literally every person that had beta access got priority, it's just impossible to know for sure except with streamers.
---
I don't see even see why people have to make it about streamers, because at the end of the day it matters absolutely nothing, some people were just more unlucky than others and didn't get to be part of the testing period. For the record, I am one of the ones who didn't get in.
---

I've literally been trying to create a character for almost 3 hours. That is definitely not the problem.

That isn‚Äôt proof lol

---
yeah who cares a company that wants to earn your dollar treats you like a piece of shit if you don't have a large twitch following.
---
If you want to stream and play the game the way they do - go for it. I don‚Äôt find it enjoyable. Answering lame questions and acting a certain way to gain fans and have a little extra privilege like getting into a stress test or some bull shit. 
---
Complain to your girlfriend about how you‚Äôre being treated unfair, not us.
---
just got a reply from a youtuber who said he just tested it and it still works but is a little different, supposedly... INTERESTING. i asked him to make a video, but HMMMM......

let me know how it works!

I finally got in. I think they're constantly adding new layers so everyone can get in.

I'm sure they're 100% perfect and can't be improved, yes.

Have you ever even seen wotlk sylvanas? lol It's a belf with white hair that has gray skin.  She looked absolutely nothing like Sylvanas.
---
I agree, and the whole concept of min-maxing Classic content is getting ridiculous. I have no problem with people who get joy from doing the theorycrafting and enjoy the min-max playstyle, but when it seeps into the meta and gates others from getting joy out of playing non-optimal races/classes/specs it's sad. Those guilds are going to clear dungeons within days of release, and would probably be able to do it with everyone being the "wrong" races because the content is honestly not difficult enough to warrant those extremes.
---
Perfect example here -- the World First Atiesh was assembled by a NE Priest.
---
I don't even play bfa you brainlet
---
He has streamer server armour though
---
alright you have the right to have no social standards. not like we live in a society or anything.
---
Good. Maybe the people should actually stress test instead of following streamers into dead zones. Just a crazy thought though.
---
You kidding we didn't get to make a character at all. All the streamers did and then the rest are the lucky ones.
---
those hundreds are those who had access to the beta before this test. Buddy on discord who was lucky enough to get into the real beta was able to log in without any real delay. He even closed to desktop and made another character before the rest of us made it through the queue. He did this while half of us were already in the queue.
---
The only way to test this streamer thing is to find a notable streamer who didn't get normal beta access but got stress test access.
---
The only priority here is to the people who already had normal beta access.
---
so are you bitching about people bitching? jw
---
They were trying to meet up in the same zone....
---
I think its reasonable for people who have spent 3+ hours trying to log in, without success, to be a little salty.
---
So if you've ever played World of Warcraft before, you'll know that you can only create characters on a locked realm if you already have one on that realm, yes?
---
Imagine being salty about other people salty... oh god am I salty now?! DOES IT END?!
---
It's full of people that already have access to the closed beta. ALL we wanted to do was login an experience first-hand the fluidity of the new client/settings and combat.

---
Yeah I've been reading those comments.  Figured that was going to happen.  I would have kept trying anyways.
---
Apparently not.
---
I agree, but I think part of the problem is that people believe Blizz lied to them with the ‚Äúlvl a character to lvl 5‚Äù talk when they couldn‚Äôt even get past the realm list page. This could hurt blizz when the next stress test comes up, there might not be as many people willing to spend a couple hours stress testing.
---
Yep C‚ÄôThun is totally gonna be in Elwynn forest on launch. Totally intentional. Man, *what a shit launch this was*.
---
So I fell asleep (got home from work very tired) and woke up saying oooooh boy hope I didn't miss it. I saw the server locked but could connect anyway and started creating my character. First time rolling Alliance in Classic and first time going Human. "Character Creation Timed Out" Shit I guess I missed it. Come here to see that almost everyone else got the same issue even when the server was not locked. Not that sad anymore.
---
I was just saying I wanted to be invited so that maybe, perhaps, I wouldn‚Äôt be one of the 25% of players who didn‚Äôt get any invite whatsoever lol.
---
That's just untrue. I had a great time watching hundreds of gnomes run to AQ
---
Daily reminder swedish neets living in basements hosting the server off their Dads electricity  can handle 12k pop servers without stutter
---
Wow the crybabies are getting out of hand...mod please, lol.
---
I had almost 3 hours of character creation timeouts, and then 2 mins after a blue post announcing the end of the test I was able to connect immediately...
---
Yeah man I can‚Äôt believe blizzard is testing new server tech in their self-labeled ‚Äúlet‚Äôs test new server tech‚Äù beta.
---
I was there but I didn't see this. Layering is wonky atm.

Same for me. Gave up and went back to live :( hopefully get invited to something else and get s other chance to try it.

We reading the same thing? They literally said it isn't random and not on a first come first served basis.

:-( and I‚Äôm just sitting here without and invite :-(

you made a reddit post 5 years ago, and i think a lot of people are getting upset because they are 25+ years old and they were told they'd be able to play tonight for a couple hours but spent their entire block of free time after work staring at a log in screen. That's not what I expected at least, I thought i'd at least be able to make a character and log in for a bit.

100% agree, like they had every box checked for issues off the bat.

Login, character creation, logging in, servers sometimes dying, having a shit ton of people in a zone, and testing layering.

Like that seems absolutely PERFECT

we already knew this ?

A shame that would really hurt the warrior's personal dps. Especially considering how much that Nightfall is actually one of the better weapons for a Ret paladin. (Especially a properly geared Paladin that gets plenty of spell damage)
---
Yeah, I vaguely remember that AtlasLoot had some kind if warning or feature so that you don't link/hover over items that your server hasn't seen yet.

I think she streams to Facebook now, that might have a bit to do with it üòÇ

Nope completely wrong - learn how the regrowth build works in the new meta. Priests do not put out more throughput it than a regrowth Druid is your entire example is wrong (X &gt; Y). Regrowth cast by a properly spec‚Äôd Druid hits harder than flash heal and has a sub-GCD cast time. Regrowth druids do not get sniped.
---
Let  me know if it can handle it

I was making fun of people saying Blizzard was clearly favouring streamers then I saw this. They definitely were. They were clearly watching the prominent streams lmao

Do I need to relog or do I just keep trying to hit accept when it gives me 'Character creation timed out'?

I'd probably log in to play classic wow :)
---
Seriously tho, I think Asmon and Esfand have good content and I enjoy watching them play the beta.  And if i wanted to play I can log into ND right now.  But to say streamer's don't get preferential treatment is a complete fraud.  Not arguing whether it's right or wrong, just arguing that it exists.
---
Well 3 hours now, and i'm still trying to log in. Sorry if I believe this stuff
---
I only got into the Stress test and was able to get on...
---
Senior developer of WoW. He was there when the original game was released and he almost locked himself for a few weeks to fit the original vanilla client into the Legion one. Thus, making Classic possible.
---
How many of them were in the real Beta though?
---
Are you just being obtuse or what?
---
How was that timed so well lmao
---
FUCKING TYPO
---
Mods please make an official stickied post saying you're ONLY ALLOWED to post about what the streamers do on the streamers and not allowed to make any other threads. That will clear up a lot of confusion and save me from wasting my time. THanks a lot.
---
And I don't see why every streamer got the beta invite but not the real original players from 2005.
---
"50, 50.. 50" How do you know It's 50? There's probably way more streamers, contributers, etc who got into beta 1st day.
---
I think they're ignoring it, cause they wanted to play more than anything but iunno
---
Go shave your neck beard and go outside a little.
---
Dramatic much?
---
If you think that you or anyone else should get access over the guys who are sitting publicity then i want what you're smoking.
---
Until recently I was 100% going to be an undead priest.    My friend was going to be an orc warrior so I rolled a troll priest during the beta to play with him, little did I know that this one simple action would open my eyes to the awesomeness that is the toll priest.
---
I played since November 2004, however I did not realize that in addition to the racial traits, priest also get racial specific spells.
---
[This link](https://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/5fp5ky/which_priest_is_more_powerful_troll_or_undead/)  explains it much better than I could, however for my personal goals in the game the troll racials/race specific spells  combined with the health generation was enough to win me over... I will miss will of the forsaken though üò¢
---
I dont get it.
---
I just slapped something heavy on my Enter key
---
Hi, /u/Sydarmx
---
I kinda waited for that :D
---
ICH WILL UNREAL TOURNAMENT SPIEHLN !!!
---
Btw schon gewusst das es nur ein act is? Die leute haben dem kleinen damals das leben zu h√∂lle gemacht weil sie dachten es sei echt :(
---
I'm about to wipe on that boss
---
It's never going to be f2p, It comes with retail subscription
---
He didn't say just them got in. But they get in first try every time. Create as many characters first try. They clearly have priority.
---
Congrats.  
---
A feat that is impossible to recreate in any other environment than on the max level 5 stress test was viewed by tens of thousands who kept trying to get in and wanted something to do meanwhile.  
---
Becaue you are arguing that this was impossible to do anywhere else. Wtf dude.
---
Ragnaros just got spawned. THIS IS INSANE. 
---
I love Blizzard so much for doing this for our community, they truly care. üíñ
---
It's a stress test, this is exactly what it is for. To test thousands of people trying to create a character, login and play in starting zones all at once. Their system and infrastructure have never handled it before so they needed to see where they failed and then learn about it.  
---
I have no idea why anyone is complaining. Would you rather this happen now or on launch day?
---
I don't mind it at all, just think it's bullshit that streamers have priority queue
---
huh if that isn't in the game then Paladin and warrior will most definitely be the best for maintaining nightfall. I imagine a properly geared Retadin with a bunch of spell damage + should actually be a decent member of the dps team.
---
Dude, the "stress test" was a test for server stability and layering. Logically speaking, they tested just that with how badly the servers were stressed. If they wanted people to not go past the starting zone, they would've put a literal invisible wall. The GM even was running with Asmongold in the front. Calm down.
---
It was your bad. Good for admitting it.
---
&gt; and to like and subscribe for more water.
---
dont ever do that or you'll end up an *influencer*
---
Im here right now, he‚Äôs fucking everyone up lol
---
Well, if you have the time, try to make gold in Live. At least get some tokens out of it, if you can.
---
*autistic screeching noises*
---
"Character creation timed out."
---
Has anyone gotten past this, or should I just go to bed?
---
and at least we get to see it on someones stream
---
As the title indicates, that's not all they saw
---
Perhaps, at least from my perspective, huge failures have been the only thing to get things moving. Not going to claim I know what it‚Äôs like in the war room during MMO launches, but I imagine it‚Äôs a different kind of challenging from an ops perspective since you are getting peak load from the minute you go live. 
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I really hope launch goes off without too many issues. I just think that if it does have major issues, internally it gives the PMs some ammunition to correct it faster. Bad PR is something everyone understands from top to bottom
---
I‚Äôd would have loved to be a fly on the wall at Blizz today to see what sub-system they were testing. It‚Äôs a shame that people over reacted the way they did.
---
Character creation timed out. Been trying to login since 4:00 and haven‚Äôt gotten in lol
---
But layering isn‚Äôt suppose to remove anyone. It just fills up the next server when 1 is full. They even stressed the point that you wouldn‚Äôt see people phasing like this. So... are they doing it wrong?
---
I think I may have to roll a paladin in Classic would love to be a Spell Focused Retadin wielding Nightfall.
---
The Eye of C'thun spawned too :( I got to see none of it
---
Except for Ret pallies
---
this is witrh layering enabled, I'd rather wait in a queue thank you very much
---
It's an option in the settings...
---
Spell ranks are in the beta.
---
Wow, you need to breath and take a break man.
---
5 persons out of 500000 got in before you! Blizzard hate you! Fucking crybabies, lmao.
---
My guild is planning a week one Rag kill, so I'll be using every advantage I can get.
---
Imagine hating streamers for doing their job
---
Skarm Tank is pretty good if you want to tank. He talks about warriors and druids

I can't believe I wasn't able to witness all the fun firsthand due to this. I really hope the next two stress tests have as much blizzy-fun in them, as i'm sure they'll have the issues toned down. I just won't forget about this. I was expecting a WoD Launch, but I wasn't expecting one where some people got special VIP passes.
---
Samwise Didier! haha. WC3 icon xD
---
So did I it is just luck.
---
Who gives a fuck if blizzard chooses streamers over hardcore fans? You wanna play classic, go download a private server.... it‚Äôll give you the same if not a better experience than the beta that will be reset constantly until release.
---
Hi, /u/DinocosDemon
---
C‚Äôthun and Onyxia were spawned outside SW gates.
---
Free marketing? You could argue they hurt their relationship with the community more than their free marketing is worth, first this then they announce they're adding sharding and lfg. Not looking good.
---
Wouldn't assie's pick the NA server with the least lag/closer to you? So basically there was a NA server all assie's would play on?
---

---
No problem, sometimes you have to do that even if you're not in the wrong.
---
I have been at this stage for 2.5 hours now (with occasional disconnects and server off line periods). I'm refusing to give up but I would call myself a little bit of an idiot.
---
They need to stop catering to streamers. Also if they wanted to stress the servers then they wouldn‚Äôt lock them
---
Why would you? Just do the same dungeons and raids over and over?
---
I wiped on that boss. May give it another go early in the morning.
---
3 hours, still trying to log in.

I gotta say, Omar being there, and Rag vs Onyxia was AMAZING. 
---
Incredible job Blizzard. You guys are awesome.
---
Sweet, I'll give it 20 more minutes then
---
theres still a little bit of old blizzard left in there after all &lt;3
---
It's 5 in the morning here
---
To when?
---
The real joke is streamers having nearly zero issues.
---
Yeah thats sadly just how it is. Were getting old. Some kickstarters i follow are the last place i can seek escaping the current crowd. I just hope when some get finished the masses will stay away i really do hope that. But they are designed in a way that they are only really interesting to oldtimers like me aswell. Already people come into the alpha see the grpahics go roflmao and refund. 
---
I hope it stays that way tbh.
---
Really left a bad taste in my mouth for Blizzard.
---
I dont know if I ever got the chance to do Karazan. I quit playing about a week after BC expansion, and then only played again breifly during Cata.
---
I'd come and see if I could log in, my internet isn't good enough for a 160p live stream without buffering and skips.
---
This. People are mad they arent able to play simple as that. I don't understand it either. I will just be happy if I do on the off chance get in. Definitely didnt go into this 100% expecting to just log on and play.

---
The sense of entitlement is unreal.  I worry for the mental health of some of these people.
---
No, but apparently they can all easily log on, and play. if 100% people could log on easily you wouldn't be whining about the people whining about it. Most people here are grinding their teeth, while streamers wait 5 minutes tops and start streaming. It's not that 5 levels of WOW actually matter, it just feels bad to be treated like garbage because you don't stream, and you know that. So don't pretend like it was ever equal.
---
I swear to fucking god I spent 3+ hours of my life testing your god damn login servers blizzard, I better fucking see a beta invite.
---
Yeah, not enough people are thinking of things from Blizzard‚Äôs POV. Who would you rather get in first, one of the thousands regular people trying to get in, or somebody streaming to thousands of people.
---
Still can't even make a character and the streamers are going back to beta HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM

It's pretty lame to invite an assload of EU players and not let a single one in and prio everyone else over them, which is the whole issue (not not getting in)

lad
---
Omar is the best!!
---
Inn progress pic
---
I was actually implying when retail goes f2p.. you know cause they lost 10% of player base recently and when numbers like that come out the "wow is dead" and "f2p incoming" comments start up
---
That was the point, dude.
---
That was pretty fun.  Got to zerg Hogger, see Rag and Golemagg.
---
There is no priority for streamers, there is a priority for people who already had a beta acces, thats nearly the same, but its not the same
---
Yeah exactly its literally marketing 101 lol
---
In Durotar, it was many hoggers basically oneshotting newbs in the starting area.
---
In Northshire Abbey, things got fun.
---
Guess im a streamer now because i got in.
---
Testing was supposed to be complete over an hour ago
---
I had around 20 Sylvanases and loads of undead running around
---
see this like 50 times a day on 4chan
---
They should summon an army of Hogger clones.
---
Lol there were 6 hoggers at the exit gate of the undead starting area killing anyone that tried to pass
---
I'm not a steamer.  But I played classic.  Got in first day.
---
classic denial, someone who just wants to whine and whine
---
you don't know it was thousands there is no way to verify the numbers able to get in and play.
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure they're just testing everything for the stress test
---
They did say they evaluated a number of factors including game time. Sounds more like you got unlucky and decided to make a blanket statement that applies to everyone. Unless you mean to say that literally every person who played back in 2005 should have had priority over everyone else in which case I'd say that's pretty damn selfish, and does not make a lot of sense from a testing perspective.
---
I don't know if it's 50, maybe it's less, maybe it's more. But then again, you are working off of a probability as well so I guess we're even on that point. If someone had a list of all streamers that have beta I guess we'd have better numbers to operate on, but I sincerely doubt there are more than 60 to 70. Even if you count all the popular youtube content creators and streamers together that focuses on WoW content you'd still most likely only look at around 35-40.
---
you spam shadowbolt with almost all warlock pve rotations.
---
dont worry tho. 50% of the fight will be banishing mobs or doing something else. the other half will be spamming shadowbolt. its not as boring as you think
---
Sorry cuckold. You only get to access the beta if you're an official streamer. If you're a normal peasant you just get to enter the character creation screen for 3 hours.
---
Isn't it obvious?
---
Logic must be lost on you. You assume the vanilla players made beta... Wrong. I played in Vanilla
---
and I got in the beta, so did my coworker.
---
I assume there be a lot more OG vanilla players than streamers on the beta especially considering a number of those streamers PLAYED VANILLA.... soooo, wtf you talkin bout.
---
With this beta they will simultaneously gain publicity, get veteran perspective and guarantee free access to a platform where players who didn't make the beta can still observe and scrutinize at the very least.
---
God damn I wish I was right there with ya buddy
---
they did, in all of the starting areas
---
Can't wait for people to see this and get triggered. This was amazing.
---
hunter or warrior are by far the 2 best
---
It was a planned restart/shutdown. They spawned a lot of bosses in all layers of Elwynn Forest, you pretty much need a restart to get rid of all that.
---
there was a restart announcement
---
Normal beta servers are back up. They had been down for the stress test.
---
Check your client logs. We never had the chance of ever logging in, god damn lied to.

If you played on Firetree then maybe it was me üòé
---
it was a stress test, why would you go on if you weren't planning on staying and testing the server anyways?
---
You won't. Get over it quickly. Just get pumped for the official release. No reason to get pissed. It only bothers you, and nobody else cares that much.
---
Breath friend. You would never have been satisfied from it anyway.
---
But the whole point is to test this situation for you to not be "treated like garbage" at the actual release. I just don't understand why people are upset the first stress test "catastrophe". This is the whole point.
---
People are way too narrow minded to think that this is the case. They'd rather just throw tantrums like 5 year olds over not being able to play for 2 hours.
---
OK so is it over?
---
Oh right. Well i still don't think it will ever be f2p. Micro transactions in the game isnt anywhere near vital enough, only thing is gold/tokens really.
---
yes, those 20 streamer slots blocked up the entire queue. Be happy that you were able to at least witness it on stream, because otherwise you wouldn't be able to see it at all.
---
Yeah that's the biggest difference. I had issues making the character, but once the character got made there was no issue getting in
---
Hi, /u/zyyklon
---
Must have been luck that every single streamer got in 100% of the time, every time they tried.
---
Yup, luck.
---
so the stress test is not for playing ? just for logg in test ?
---
Yeah that was pretty cool
---
First character was a paladin. My sole job when I started raiding was buffing and out of combat rezzing.
---
Pretty sure that the whole ‚Äòbeing far enough away from the action and not being put in combat‚Äô isn‚Äôt a thing in 1.12, so buffing is the only tedious thing to worry about.
---
Prepare to lose at least one bag to symbols of kings lol
---
To be fair the private server community was fucking horrible. Everyone was accusing everyone of being a shill for server x y and z. Everyone told everyone of how they weren't real vanilla players. 
---
It was kind of a shit show.
---
Salt, and astroturf
---
Literally didn't even get that far.
---
We should! NA Easy server most likely, DM me your Battlenet
---
I never got in and tried for hours. Hopefully everybody in the same position as me gave Blizz valuable data points. It would have been nice to test things out and run around for a bit, feel like I was a part of the action, but I guess it wasn't in the cards. Nuts.
---
Post screen please. Blizz said they stay up for way longer lol
---
I didn't stop trying for the full 2 hours. I got as far as designing my character and hitting "Create" only to get a message that said I'd disconnected from the character creation. So I hit create every few seconds until it finally kicked me off. After that it just showed the server as "Offline".
---
And after you finally get in, stuck making a character.
---
AH, right - thanks for the update. Lucky for the ones who got in I guess - I'm gonna try again.
---
Yeah like when we do stress tests at work we WISH we could get a fraction of these issues to show up.
---
Horde side didn't get anything, just Hogger
---
what a bunch of cry babies on here
---
what am i happy to witness exactly? spoiler alert: you can go play classic wow RIGHT NOW on dozens of hugely populated servers.
---
People who are 'invited' to the stress test and then locked out have validity to their complaints. Seeing people get in who are logging in after them is frustrating. I didn't opt in for the beta but I can understand the frustration. Transparency from Blizzard about this kind of thing would be nice.
---
This was a stress test meant for testing the servers, of course there was going to be massive issues. This wasn't for fun, this was work. You could've only gotten to level 5 in a zone filled with so many players you couldn't really do anything.
---
No. No one said [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]
---
I am taking some deep breaths after that 3 hour wait, its really sad to see that it is over. I don't get it though, they said that the servers would stay up until late tomorrow?
---
You could literally see it lol. I saw a few hundred in the Human starting area alone.
---
Meme doesn‚Äôt make sense 1/10.
---
We weren't given Oceanic region servers for quite a time after launch of Vanilla. It also didn't really matter which server in NA you connected to either, you were at 300+MS the whole time. Difference between 300 and 400 is negligible.
---
Sure buddy. Tell you what, why don't you make your character on the realm/faction of Sodapoppin or Asmon. I'll make a note to come back here in 18 months and see how you feel about streamer servers.
---
Damn it really is though. Have you ever heard someone call something cringy irl?
---
He looked so happy in that moment. It actually made me smile. You realize in such moments how those guys actually care about the game.
---
its for testing, playing can just be a side effect
---
when there are 15k+ people in line and 10 people show up with TV crews filming them I'm not gonna be mad if they go first.
---
Well.... the Beta PvE/PvP servers are back up.
---
I try to log in, after all the stress test server hilarity...
---
And.... Hit Enter World on my dwarf warrior....
---
Takes forever to load....
---
Character Not Found.
---
Okay so... did they wipe? Because.... yeah. My character shows there, but says 'character not found' when I try to log into him.
---
And not telling people beforehand that this was the case was a really shitty thing to do.
---
yup spent all my time at the character creation screen. all i kept getting was character creation timed out.
---
&gt; Breath friend
---
See the thing is, you literally have no idea who I am. But I know who you are, because you rushed here to defend a streamer.
---
You're just some mindless asmon drone that spams autistic memes and emotes over and over. 
---
So please keep projecting your worthless life. It's quite entertaining.
---
its just statistics, thousands of people got in, 8 streamers are in those thousands and now its privilege.
---
Bet you feel fuckin stupid now looking at an offline server.
---
not the same at all. your comparison is literally retarded.
---
By the comments I see here I'm pretty sure they hate streamers too
---
I thought the Stress Test goes until Friday thats what the bluepost said hm weird
---
To be fair, The Orville kicks ass
---
Yes just try to log in 100 times and be stressed...As expected good testing Blizz
---
From what i've heard, C'thun, Ragnaros, Sylvanas, multiple random raid bosses fighting each other, Kazzak. I really wish I didn't spend 3 hours sitting here trying to log in just to hear about what I missed. But at least they got a ton of useufl information out of us sad people
---
Damn all 6 people on the game really gonna be in for a surprise.
---
I had fun
---
How mentally unstable are you?
---
Your "think"? You either saw it or didnt....
---
Poor you, little baby.
---
There was a limited number of people they could obviously support. They are trying to build hype for the game, and having streamers show this to over 150K people is more important than your whiny ass getting in.
---
Meanwhile i cant log in lmao.
---
Lame as fuck.
---
I too was unable to create a character all night :(
---
Thats good to know, glad someone did. Sadly testing is now over, so I missed out on all the fun. I'll have to hop on in the morning to at least play around at level 5. How long did it take you to hop on?
---
people rage too much lol
---
They're restarting the server, they said. A lot of people were in there playing, including me. The server was working pretty well near the end so hopefully when it comes back up, it'll be a fun time.
---
I was, yes. I'm going to check some old videos and see if it matches. I'm probably just suffering an aging brain.
---
Unfortunately, it's not a virtue I possess...
---
the server will be up until tomorrow. it's restarting right now to clean up all the random mob/bosses they spawned in the starting zones.
---
I'm pretty annoyed that I did that. They could have tested load on the login servers a lot of ways that didn't involve wasting everyone's time.
---
Youre in the wrong thread
---
Until Thursday the 23rd @ 6PM PDT
---
Druid because the class fantasy is way cooler imo
---
This pretty much confirms that layering is just sharding, with a couple tweaks to it and a different name to placate people. You don't "accidentally" code cross-server grouping, but you might accidentally leave it in.
---
We were there :) but naw tbh, Im just hoping that the stress testers get an invite for the beta or something...now that the beta invites are winding down
---
they didn't lol, I saw literally thousand of players on the server. Doubt they were all twitch streamers with a large following.
---
But did u actually manage to create character and log in and play?
---
OK sweet since i couldn't play i was panicking that id missed it
---
This was a 100% successful stress test. You are a moron if you don't agree.
---
Asmongold has been our champion and you should embrace him. I got in and I am not a streamer.
---
lol. i dont give a fuck about playing the beta or not. i don't like in-your-face favoritism. 
---
what blizz should do: normal beta test; obviously make exceptions for streamers.
---
not: LOL streamers first bro, fuck off normal losers.
---
in the [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) Settings -&gt; Game Settings -&gt; WoW Classic (Beta &amp; Stress Test)

Then once in game, just hit the \~ like in most games.

Hi, /u/CorvixYT
---
Except nobody got mad, look at the comment chain.
---
kk ^^,
---
Thats lvl 60 money for a quest like that. You shouldn't be hitting a gold before lvl 10+
---
seeing 100 people might seem big but that doesn't mean it's actually thousands 
---
I'm just saying claiming thousands where in playing is a bit of an exaggeration that has no bases in fact.

They are solid at tanking, even being optimal for certain encounters.
---
They are solid healers; you can find competitive guild raid parses where a Druid is top of healing meter (even though healing meter is deceptive).

They can do *okay* DPS (in top 10, above Hunters, Shadow Priests, and meme specs like Ret and Balance) with powershifting and Manual Crowd Pummelers.

I'm a random person who got in, account is from day 1 2004 :)
---
This has legitimately been the most fun I've had in the game in years
---
How did you find your logs i want to check mine out

---
From what I understand,
---
Once a layer is filled then those players stay and all new players in the area will go into a new layer. You shouldn‚Äôt see players activity disappear from sight.
---
"plan to play"
---
I'm not going to pay 15bucks for an inferior version of something  I can play for free, vs better players. Not gonna be fun to sit in que vs randoms all day and get that one good game a day.
---
Should have just watched asmondgolds stream...

---
There was way more people than I've ever seen on beta, so I assume so.
---
*15 years
---
I had 20Mbit back in 2004-2005 at my home :)
---
Likely just midlife-crisis and jealousy, nothing to see here!
---
I was leveling in Northshire Valley, but there was quite a bit of competition for kills. I made it to level 2 in about an hour, but 45 minutes or so of that, the server was very laggy. So it wasn't all that bad, but it was competitive. I completed one quest before giving up on questing because so many people were killing the kobolds.
---
can you link to tweet
---
The class fantasy is good, I agree. I love my druid, he overtook my priest for main in WotLK.
---
Amazing
---
Gotta love how the mods deleted any and all post from Asmongold's stream in favor of this.
---
It's a god damn screenshot. I don't care about the Karma, but I hate mods that take shit too far to the point of letting their personal opinions change how they mod. 
---
You guys are a little too salty about the streamers.
---
Except nobody was mad, look at the comment chain. I get your point but the guy you are replying to is not the right person to vent to.
---
It took ~2.5 hours. I got in when right when they restarted with the Hogger raids.
---
In the [battle.net](https://battle.net) launcher go to "Options" in your classic stress test (or any game actually) and click "Game Settings". Find the game again and enable arguments, type `-console` into the box, and log in! You can open the console by pressing `\`` or `~`
---
I got in by the end.
---
I mean I like streamers, but it does seem weird to give them priority in a stress test
---
Are they scared of looking bad if a streamer can't get in to character creation? I thought that's the point of a stress test
---
You can't mobtag in the current version of the beta. 
---
Mob tagging was a thing in wow until wotlk. It's something I personally used many times with help from friends to get characters up quickly. We also used this in dungeons with the kick/invite. It would be really sad if this didn't make it in to the game, don't really have time to get all the alts I wanted if this is the case, also no changes or whatever. Bring it back
---
Very true! Move along people!
---
Why was the OCE stress test during working hours for AU/NZ?
---
Its in the beta directory in the logs folder 
---
its the client one
---
Good lookin VC drawing there.
---
oh wah go play on a pserver, ffs grow up 
---
fuck off sperg losers
---
Yikes.
---
I want to check mine as well
---
that was 30 minutes ago
---
Ah lucky! Gratz on getting on
---
We were bamboozled. They wanted to test how the server would handle what essentially is a DDOS attack from many people who attempt logging in at the same time. They didnt crash. Stress test successful and our time wasted.
---
At least we know for next time though.  Don't bother if you don't already have a beta invite.  That's the message Blizzard sent today and everyone will hear it loud and clear.
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeer
---
Yes, at 9:03 PM. I wasn't able to get past the character creation screen until then.
---
Will you shut the hell up you whiner? This is an excellent thing for Classic WoW, and only helps.
---
This is literally the best thing Blizzard could have asked for in a Stress Test. You're an idiot.
---
Didn't even see this as a negative message. Thought it was meant like "Classic is gonna steal my life so might as well kill myself now" kinda deal.
---
How to see your logs?
---
You wouldnt be playing classic if not for in some part to streamers.
---
I got in and swung a hammer at C‚Äôthun and Rag. No beta. No stream. No vanilla account. EU. It worked after hooking up Ethernet for the login process and trying to get in as soon as they would come back up.
---
I have several friends whos account dates back to vanilla. None of them have received beta invites.
---
Is there a way to see past logs because all i see is 5/22 19:18:12.883  Client Initialize.
---
every person bitching about a streamer is such a pussy lol. you guys are such fucking man children. there's more important things in life than one stress test. also, they got tons of people on the same server, so that tests stress well no? you guys are pathetic

To anyone who is legitimately mad: It's a STRESS TEST. What did you expect?
---
Well there will be other stress tests. This was just 1/3.
---
I think there's much more than can be settled on an internet forum at play here
---
I think it's cause level was capped at 5, so the xp got turned to gold. So that's why you got 27 silver.
---
Its basically a shard but you don't really get shifted in and out of it. Once a layer is full they fill the next one so you are always with your layers players. I don't recall exactly how partying works, but I'm pretty certain thats the only time you switch layers.
---
This is my recollection, I could be wrong though.

Do we know if stress test server is coming back online. i believe the blue post said server would be up for about 24 hours.
---
/r/iamverysophicated
---
it was an NA/EU test
---
Lmao. A blatant attempt at trying to gain an audience by showing that Asmon got in while you couldn't.  
---
Move along. Nothing to see here.
---
would rather stick my face in deep fryer than have him as the champion of Vanilla WoW :)
---
kk ty for response :)
---
Didn‚Äôt have beta access. Got in and played a good bit. Not a streamer. Was the first priest to lvl 5.
---
thank you, i dont truly understand this backlash and retardation from reddit...oh wait its reddit.
---
I saw around 4-5 layers. There was onyxia fighting baron geddon and Bolvar. Another had Ragnaros standing pretty and a couple of molten giants.
---
There were thousands of people in the stress test. Are they all steamers?
---
The layering? Well yeah, of course it'll be there. It probably won't be as laggy though.
---
Paladin is EZ mode healer. There won't be enough that you won't get an automatic raid invite.
---
&gt; Layering is wonky atm.
---
It's not wonky... that's exactly how it's supposed to work. You see different things in different layers. Hence why people aren't fond of it
---
What if they don‚Äôt?
---
Comparing twitch streamers to pro athletes is a weak argument.
---
They want it to substitute a beta they‚Äôre mad they didn‚Äôt get invited to. It‚Äôs stupid
---
Same way people watch multiple different shows/streamers/sports. People like different stuff.
---
You're probably right. I better just give it a little while, then try again.
---
You can literally run the logs yourself. Go try it.
---
Jori the NE druid with toasted gear xD
---
/salute
---
I would love this. Why follow the game to ruin with the same mistakes? It's an opportunity to do it better.
---
I mean, stick to similar lore beats, but keep it old school in philosophy.
---
HERE HERE!
---
Imagine being this clown
---
Yeah. I think they said that because of the Hogger/raid bosses that they were going to have to unscrew everything up. That could be why it's taking longer. I'm guessing you'll be able to get in once it's back up since most people will have logged out after the event ended.
---
You missed the next message
---
"Probably"
---
Stfu no you didn‚Äôt.  This is literally the FIRST time anybody has ever mentioned this.  Extremely original thought here.
---
screenshot?
---
It is in your wow installation folder, in classic beta, logs, client.log  
---
Many people are reporting it, whatever it means is another question.   
---
I could connect once by the end of the session and my client log only shows one line:    
---
5/22 22:08:12.858  Client Initialize.
---
Small world :)
---
Could be the server knowing it has too many people on it and won't try to connect ya.
---
If this is true it kind of makes sense. I mean why wouldn't they need to test all the login attempts? I was in the same boat and not even mad... as long as what I was doing is useful to them.
---
Oh of course, I was there for the WoD launch, the insanity from that is unforgettable. But for WoD I was at least able to beat the tidal wave to log in, wasn't so lucky here with my instant-click the second it became green
---
If it makes you feel any better, I'm in the same boat. I had some sold auctions sitting on beta, I want my 10 silver, damnit!
---
they didnt. i got stress test only and got in just as often as anybody.
---
idk, ppl always said rogues were the top tier pvp class in vanilla. But I heard that AQ fucked that a bit. Maybe Blizzard is doing same thing all over again like on retail, buffing other classes so op ones seem nerfed
---
No way people are actually complaining about that... looked like a blast!
---
I don't think Outland or these other places ruined the fun. With each iteration they increased the quality of life and content, mainly with regard to community feedback. We wanted to move faster, we wanted to fly, we wanted to get to raids faster, we wanted 5 mans to be fast corridors. In the end, these design changes and quality of life upgrades turned it into a machine. A lot of us lost the fun.
---
If they create a separate timeline, they'll eventually go back to all the things we think we want. Every class will be the same with a color swap, lose their uniqueness. We'll be porting to 5 mans and speed running them. We'll have regular and heroic versions.
---
I think in 14 years, it will be the same as current retail, with some slightly different lore and different cash transaction pets. I might be wrong, but I'm not too optimistic of the idea.

A variation of cold blood and preparation. 21/3/27, 21/8/22 
---
Depending what weapons you use.
---
You get the most utility with prep and have still ok damage with cb eviscerate as it‚Äôs normalised.
---
I wouldn't mind it as long as they still just offered the base classic version.  It would kind of defeat the purpose of getting classic servers if they just started making new content since it would at some point no longer really be classic.
---
That said, I think the chances of Blizz doing something like this is actually zero.  If classic is really successful then TBC, Wrath, etc. servers aren't out of the question, but all the new content will most likely be for the current version of the game.
---
Quoting OP
---
&gt; The Classic Azeroth could evolve differently (e.g. Northrend, Pandaria, Outland, etc wouldn't exist).
---
This isn't my post. Was in a forum thread I saw. Was seeing if this was true.
---
Didn't we already get a different timeline with Warlords of Draenor?
---
Nah mate
---
I haven‚Äôt seen him that happy in a long time
---
Please tell me this is assmonfoolsgold.
---
It should be on the right hand side and has a box to check that says use subreddit style
---
well, later on he found me.... you know the rest
---
Apparently they expected to play early access, which isn‚Äôt a thing for WoW
---
I think the only such changes I'd be okay with is the addition of zones that existed on the map but were unfinished.
---
Pre-cata gilneas, twilight highlands, hyjal, etc. And at the same time I wouldn't want any content more advanced than naxx. I always felt the aq and bwl tiers of difficulty was underexplored, so maybe that
---
I played rogue all the way through Naxx. I never felt gimped ever. Stealth and stun lock work at all gear levels.
---
Which they never really achieved. There was just a trail of lvl 1s in every zone from
---
The start until ungoro basically.
---
Yeah, that's why it's called a STRESS test u moron. They're stressing their resources to find out how much they can perform under load.
---
They didnt.
---
It actually is there. But to believe that it genuinely means the client never really tried to connect is truly next-level tinfoil hattery.
---
Waaaay too soon, Executus.
---
Isn't the guy in that video who was complaining about not getting in also a streamer?
---
Why watch anything when i can just do it myself, it's a retarded argument lmao.
---
You Horde scum.
---
The Alliance shall prevail!
---
It's in classic beta &gt; Logs &gt; Client.log
---
Think of the money they made with resubs just to dangle the carrot ...
---
TOLD YOU MOTHER FUCKERS SHARDING WAS IN THE GAME
---
I did not get beta invite, only stress test. I was able to log in and create a paladin. I got him to level 5, and then went to go nostalgia trip in westfall. 
---
I got d/c'ed a lot, waited in queue for an offline realm a lot, but in total for the 2 hours I was logged in and playing for a little over 1 hour.
---
Reddit is so dumb with its conspiracy theories. Some people got through, some didn't, lots of things broke. THAT'S THE POINT OF THE STRESS TEST. 
---
I guess I got special privileges streaming it to my 5 viewers....
---
Check your log file. Blizzard scammed us.
---
[https://ibb.co/R9Wm1kZ](https://ibb.co/R9Wm1kZ)
---
Wait are they killing everyone lmao?
---
Layers don't matter when 90% of the people trying to log in can't
---
I know this has been probably said 10000 times but
---
The whole point of a stress test is to see how well the servers cope with the large amount of people logging in and creating characters to see how the servers are affected by the influx/outflux of data
---
# This wasn‚Äôt a server for play testing
---
Thats what a normal beta is for people.
---
I was able to get in and I have those things in my logs.
---
Well shit, by the time I got the stress test issue with 2 PTR accounts fixed, I was too late as it was hosted during working hours here in OCE.  
---
And now I've had my OTHER PTR account removed AND my stress test account removed, but I guess that was going to happen anyway. Still miffed about not getting into beta.
---
Just tested it, untrue
---
Entitled Boomers at their finest.
---
did you go swords, or daggers?
---
Yeah I'm surprised only us 2 alliance made the trek to Mulgore. Great minds think alike! Haha!
---
Best of luck with the rest of beta testing! Cya around Azeroth in the future!
---
It‚Äôs fine I‚Äôm just at work right now missing it all
---
there were like 4 hoggers guarding the narrow exit to deathknell lol
---
Stfu
---
Glad I got to help in the test, hopefully this will lead to a smooth launch. NGL, a beta invite would be pretty sweet for us stress testers :)
---
Leann dude so harsh.
---
Bad bot
---
If you are in EU the server will be taken down in the early morning hours of the 24th. That's in the evening on the 23rd for the west coast of the US.
---
&gt;The closed beta realms will soon be available again for those testers.
---
But doesn't that part mean the closed beta realms, not the stress test? Closed beta realms are now up but the stress test realm isn't and he didni't mention anything about it other than it should continue being available.
---
Oh, I'm assuming you have sufficient IT knowledge to tell blizzard how to test their servers?
---
Yeah there were complaints on the forums-it was really sad
---
IMO Its more akin to having to pay $15 to be let into the starbucks, getting there waiting in line, and then having some guy with a camera crew cut ahead of you multiple times. Not supporting either  argument just that that analogy is closer to what may (or may not) be happening lol
---
Yeah for me it only shows initialize now and destroy client. I logged in a few times since the server is showing offline again but thanks. Nice to know for the future.
---
Thanks =)
---
BiS for all classes: Getting past the character creation screen.

---
Why?
---
Break out the Dwarf Priests/Tremor Totems.
---
It could be interesting seeing a WotLK without all the facerolling, allowing cookie-cutter talents and adding some new talents to the talent tree.
---
Allowing only raid geared ppl to faceroll dungeons, Ulduar with a longer timeframe and Argent campain inserted soon into the game more like a part of the campain instead of a plugged addon.
---
FOTM was not a good call, maybe another addiction to the game keeping the balance between casters and melee.
---
agreed, its essentially a sycophant guild
---
Stfu streamers were a very small percentage.
---
Only streamers like Rat-man and his cronies.
---
have you considered that phrase may not mean exactly what you think it means?
---
That is slightly extreme.
---
&gt; No commitment, no discipline, no respect for the "customers" and actively searching for drama instead of avoiding it.
---
aka good content
---
tfw people don't understand it's not about the streamer, but the people watching them. It's a sureshot way to interact with tens of thousands of classics fans instantly.
---
If I were to assume ( with my dev experience) it still simulates the log in but doesn‚Äôt allow connection. Which would be another factor on live servers so still a part of ‚Äústress test‚Äù
---
I got stuck on character creation, I‚Äôm used to being disappointed with them at this point though
---
Is she using deep breath more frequently this patch?
---
this is the most retarded comment ive ever read lmao
---
The tide pods and the chewing lmfao
---
Don't worry about it. I just spent 3 hours logging into a character creation screen that would time out and then they would lock the realm. It was a waste of time.
---
Unless this Blizzard employee just doesn't know, the Stress realm will be available for the next 24 hours:  https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-stress-test-1-ending-info/180228   
---
However, it may be offline right now. Hopefully they will keep it up so we can log in.
---
that's 800 people not thousands which you're claiming you can't claim it was thousands without verifiable proof of the actual numbers of players able to log in and play.
---
people could get in to play but I wouldn't claim it was THOUSANDS lol
---
Stfu streamers made up a very small percentage of people that got in.
---
I just think that were occuring stress test issues.
---
You didn't miss anything, the oceanic players who got invited weren't able to log in
---
It's definitely wonky. For the brief period of time I was in game I was fighting trolls in the cave in dwarf starting zone and it put me into another phase mid combat and the mob I was fighting disappeared and new mobs spawned and other players spawned who weren't there before.
---
I spent the entire time trying to log in. Never saw the light of Azeroth...
---
But streamers got in fine sooo... Thanks?
---
I'd love to see classic branch off in its own direction, but the game dies again for me the day the level cap raises beyond 60. That's where existing raid content starts to become invalidated (because you can just level past it and get greens better than raid epics).
---
just...  wow dude.  This is mine:
---
5/22 21:38:36.682  Client Initialize.
---

---
5/22 22:38:19.668  Client Destroy
---
So dirty.  I wasted over an hour on something that was never going to work.
---
I have felt the same. If they just made the never finished zones alternate leveling zones for existing level ranges while keeping the feel of Vanilla and not incorporating any power creep, I don‚Äôt see the problem. Bring on the NoChanges downvoters and attackers.
---
Then why did they mention leveling up to 5 in the email?
---
doesn't seem to be anything fucky i'm seeing
---
Initial Hotfixes: Fake Connect 
---
in people's logs from years ago asking for support
---
Properbly
---
&gt; ahead of him by 300 then he jumps through the queue and logins in while im still 100.
---
The position in queue doesn't update with every time it decreases. When you're several thousand out, it's easily jumping several hundred at a time. It only starts counting quickly (jumping 20-30 per tick, and much more frequently) once you're down under 100th or so.
---
I remember ragnaros in the very late beta of original vanilla. It was something like a month? Before launch. 
---
I think it was up for like 10 minutes...man i wish i had thought to take screens to compare lol.
---
So have strategy guides. And especially "lingo charts."
---
The only option on the right hand side that I see is Community Options drop-down, and Community Theme. And that is checked on.
---
It would be interesting for them to incorporate an f2p version to draw more players in but I doubt they would ever make retail f2p because of the paid expansions and future expansions. Obviously OSRS is the best comparison but they're able to do it because of the various skills in the game.
---
&gt; Unless this Blizzard employee just doesn't know
---
He knows.
---
I know that, I‚Äôm still disappointed I couldn‚Äôt join the thousands of people that did get in.
---
What? The said it would be up following the stress test until 6pm on Thursday. 
---
"The World of Warcraft Classic Closed Beta realms will be down for the duration of the test. Once the stress test period is over, you‚Äôll be able to continue playing on the stress test realm (up to level 5) until Thursday, May 23."
---
Seriously. Who is this guy? A good graphics card is more important than formula for your baby
---
Same for me.
---
I'm ready to see where this adventure goes next!
---
I have never been this glad to play on the EU servers. EU streamers with more than a hundred viewers can be counted on one hand.
---
seriously i dont particularly like streamers but since the beta came out its awesome its feeding my hype so im not going crazy over no content about the game i love. i dont want to go into beta and test bugs or put time into a temp char id just play a server for that. chill out people were getting it in 3 months sit back and watch better people play in the meantime lol.
---
Honestly, what were you expecting?
---
I agree, streamers are free advertisement, it makes sense to allow them to play, but I wanted to play too. The point is the email we got about the stress test said we can stress test up to level 5 and that the servers will remain up for 24 hours. Both of these appear to be outright lies at the time of this post. particularly with the rumors going around that only a 1/3rd of the actual invite pool was confirmed to be let in, and the remaining 2/3rds were 'fake connects'. I would've preferred an email saying we're stress testing the login and character create screens only, I would've been happy to test that for 1-2 hours, instead of waiting up to 4 hours with the hope of logging in, and the constant disappointment when I don't.
---
What server was it, mine was also full of aussies but it was more a medium sized server (Firetree)
---
soda is the vanilla god, gtfo
---
Kruxar is a dope name
---
Big if  true.
---
People will always find something to complain about. Never ceases to amaze me at the mental gymnastics some people try to pull because they are upset. Take a deep breath, calm down and realize you are literally acting like a child that spilled their milk
---
I agree.
---
TIL every person that plays WoW, also has a degree in IT.

---
Surprised you guys are supporting the kid and not telling OP to abort it after this past week
---
When there is 3000 people online and you change the layer size to 200 (just throwing out numbers) then it would naturally remove people. The devs used the ingame announce feature to say they were about to activate/change layers around and it might do funky stuff.
---
goood for you
---
I'm a software dev. I'm not sure I'd jump to conclusions on it. It could be that part of the hotfix process requires a "fake" connection of some kind. "fake" is certainly a bad term to use, may mean something like a local simulated connection to test whether the patch applied correctly. Like a local unit test.
---
Definitely joking about all the whiney bitch posts when they made this. The sarcasm is so thick I can't breathe

Not all of them...
---
Then we are in agreement.
---
To justify their reasoning: the guy that cuts the line shares his coffee with 100k other people. You would go back in your basement and drink all of it alone. So yeah I completely agree with prioritising streamers. 
---
But anyway you should get out for a minute breathe in and out. All good.
---
Gnomed. Hard.
---
We were told we would be able to level 1-5. Lol get outta here with that bs.
---
From Blizzard e-mail I got:
---
" ***Play up to level 5*** *and help us make sure we can provide the best experience possible when World of Warcraft Classic launches August 27, 2019.* "
---
So those of you saying the point of a stress test is to test login and character creation I say, fine, you can make that argument. But the e-mail that was sent out should have said so:
---
"*Please help us stress test the servers by logging in and trying to create a character multiple times for three hours. You won't be able to actually play but we appreciate if you keep spamming the login screen.*"
---
If you played other MMO's like BDO, essentially the layer is like a different server that fills up and then the spill over will go to layer 2, and so on. However if invited into a party, the person that receives the invite will be transferred into the party leaders layer, that seems the only way to manually decide what layer you will be in. Unfortunately, this isnt ideal, but will be needed, as the first week it will be almost impossible except for Hunters to make it through the starting zones without it.
---
Leveling up to 5 would provide almost no data in terms whats already been tested in the beta since it has been out. 
---
If the stress test was for play testing, the cap would of been higher.
---
They‚Äôre not gathering data for the thousands people they let in for levels 1-5 ...
---
Okay I admit, I am a steamer not sure how you knew that..
---
‚ÄúWhat do you mean you can‚Äôt?‚Äù - White people
---
I probably had more fun not being invited to beta/stress and just watching the streams in chaos than people probably did attempting to log in who got stress test access lol
---
Yeah, I'm a little salty about that. Streamers have made out like bandits with this whole Classic business, basically royalty.
---
Amen.
---
Along with thousands of others. 
---
You were unlucky, sorry.
---
I don't see why it wouldn't be a part of the game. I'm looking forward to it :)
---
They don't have to be though. Giving content creators priority on a queue is not under FTC since he is not sponsored by them or being paid to be an ambassador.
---
We were played. They never intended for us to log in even though I got to character creation screen multiple times before streamers got in and they had no issues.
---
VanCleef
---
How'd the servers handle it?
---
Yes because clearly you are the only one who matters. Get over yourself.
---
I was actually the first one he killed lol. (Sorry for the Asmongold commentary in the background)
---

---
Alright tinfoil hat off I guess.
---
Can you link said clips of her kicking and screaming?
---
Absolutely. 
---
I remember when my guild first downed a *heroic* boss and one of my fellow healers went "I dunno how I won, don't get it at all" right after the kill because he topped meters by 1% when he was oom and we still had juice
---
Very unpleasant mentality. Didn't mind when he left
---
After playing the Beta stress test I logged out and tried to log onto retail.  I found that [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) thinks I need to download all 48 gigs of retail again, even though my data folder is still well beyond big enough to have all of the retail and ptr files in it.
---
Since they're focusing on people who were there at release, it's not surprising you haven't gotten an invite yet.
---
Just get that shit sorted out before kids man. Lol.
---
in its nerfed version yes.
---
In another similar thread someone who did get in showed logs and they had this ‚Äúfake connect‚Äù in there
---
Cmon, it wouldn‚Äôt be this easy to prove
---
Who the fuck is this
---
Make it primarily a bar with the uniqueness of having small section that is cyber-cafe-like.
---
Not to mention this sub was literally justifying layering by saying the game will die out in 2 months and they'll get rid of it
---
So what is it?
---
And also during method world first race and during the first like day or so of BFA launch. It will no doubt be #1 on twitch when classic launches properly as well
---
You have anger problems
---
old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/
---
Enjoy :)
---
Yea it's been offline for a while now. Maybe 45 minutes or something?
---
It was at least 15 minutes after it had started and my back is to the majority of the people. It was ridiculously packed when it first launched.
---
she streams on facebook not twitch so idk if they have vods but i saw it on youtube in a video someone put together, no clue who made it but il see if i can dig it up.

Anyone who reads more into it and relates it to actual connecting to the game/login servers should maybe just step away from the computer for a bit.
---
I doubt streamers had that large of an impact, they are more of an advertising asset for Blizz. If anything it was the Nostalrius team and the private server community that started the ball rolling.
---
If you haven't experienced the game before and you don't want spoilers, I would suggest not watching streams. However, this game is old and very well-known, so spoilers are probably inevitable.
---
Got Kazzak and he murdered everyone at once and game crashed. I did not even get to screenshot it.
---
looking back the title definitely reads like a post about to say some people bullied a girl into killing herself
---
Yeah, I am sometimes embarassed by how spoiled the community for WoW has become.
---
It makes me thin, WoD and BFA aren't that bad after-all. It just that those of us on the fence read all the negative comments and it brainwashes them a bit.
---
Well, yeag WoD and BFA aren't that good but they are no means a disaster.
---
Yeah, well I agreed first.
---
Looks like their resources perform very well for streamers.
---
We will find out this data more in depth after classic launch, as I am creating a hall of fame for the first ones to hit 60 with all classes across all realms.  [https://www.joanasworld.com/fastest.htm](https://www.joanasworld.com/fastest.htm)
---
He just disappeared after saying hello. It wasn't until the end of stress test that they spawned bosses and Omar was messing around in Northshire Abbey.
---
Ah so they have confirmed that? It won't be the disgusting 1 hit macro it once was?
---
Is not knowing what a Molten Giant is, a meme or something?
---
she is a shill for blizzard
---
I got in first day, not a streamer.  (Not sure if I count as a d1 account, I have two wow accounts tied to my battle.net, one started in TBC, the other started on day one but was banned near the end of vanilla for botting).
---
This entire sub did when they announced layering
---
"Guys it's fine!!! really it's fine!!! the hype will die after 2 months and they will remove layers! no worries!"
---
Now they're back to this
---
Oh boy I am excited for you.
---
The gameplay is WAY slower than current WoW so just prepare yourself for that. The best thing about classic wow is that it feels like everything matters. You arent just blowing through content at the speed of light.
---
best stress test picture :D
---
they were testing stuff, it's supposed to never phase you
---
I was at work and only able to follow a bit of the drama. Am I right in assuming the test servers are offline right now even though they said they would be up till tomorrow? (trying to get in but getting offline server and no server avail)
---
Huh, interesting. Would certainly explain why I couldn't get past the character creation boss.
---

Are you stress test only, or do you have full beta?
---
its called being salty also dont reply to me anymore thanks
---
Teacher says I'm special.
---
Doctor says I'm special.
---
Mama told me to shut up.
---
So?
---
Server 1 follows existing expansion progressions.
---
Server 2 follows new content.
---
Server 3 stays Classic forever and just gets reset every 2 years.
---
They restarted the servers after spawning all those bosses. Said they should be back up "soon."
---
I don‚Äôt remember the entire sub saying that at all, actually quite the opposite, so back to what? yea, they will be removing layering after launch phase.   Blizzard has stated this already..Also how is that classic dying after two months?
---
The cheese stands alone
---
Well servers are now complelty gone .. i start to think the 24 hours after are a bamboozle. At least it will be way less then 24 hours.
---
And then get ganked by the hordes of people following them around.
---
CTRL+R for FPS counter.
---
Thank you, god damn.
---
IDK what you're talking about. That's clearly a screenshot from the beta....
---
I'm sure you do. We'll find out in the coming days how many people tried, and how many people got in. It's my opinion that a tiny fraction got in judging from the resulting salt.
---
Oh right I get it x) forgot that eagle eye would "untoggle" like that.
---
You should be less salty. It's not good for you :)
---
[Didn't even realize I streamed.](https://i.imgur.com/HL4iW5l.jpg)
---
gonna be tough camping "them" when them = streamer + 100 peons following everywhere
---
Or they could just release TBC, followed by WotLK.  Hell, I‚Äôd play Cata too. Then they can reboot Classic and do it all again.   That‚Äôs like 16 years from now.  Hope to god there are better alternatives by then.
---
Clip chimp. Took him another 90 seconds to realize what happened. Looks like he's triggered here but he thought it was hilarious
---
The reason is that they're being watched and shareholders don't want their product to look bad, so they give them priority to make sure they successfully log in. There's the actual reason.
---
Did you hold his hand? Inquiring minds want to know.
---
Amazing!
---
I think that‚Äôs what killed it more than QoL. It was that each expansion invalidated everything before and all that grinding...worthless.
---
To be fair that‚Äôs exactly what some companies are using the ‚Äúearly access‚Äù label for
---
for eu its friday
---
I may have to play in the EU from NA just to avoid that sort of shit.
---
Maybe. I managed to get log in and back out multiple times and I'm not a streamer. (I do have beta access though).
---
What we need is TBC and Wrath gear design introduced to vanilla. Or completely new gear
---
Both are good choices, but I would go shaman for WF awesomeness.
---
Warriors have a weakness in mobility, EB totem helps a lot not wasting rage on hamstring or timing it.
---
Problem with shamans are that the class is hard to master and a lot of people sit on the mediocrity of enhancement waiting for a WF proc.
---
The problem with drood/war is war has low mobility and drood excels @ it, you can leave but your war will stay, also drood stealth is nulled.
---
Thank you so much, I had no idea if there was one!
---
You win the troll of the day award nicely done 10/10.
---
You aren't certain of anything you are assuming things. I was getting Character creation has timed out messages too but then I finally got in. You are not correct here
---
What about the other thousands of players logged in running to AQ gates? streamer priority or white privilege?
---
Ayy Alliance Lightbringer squad
---
Wait.... he got beta and we just got stuck trying to select a character for 4 hours?! WTF not fair!!! 
---
/s
---
Oh let me call this person an idiot bcuz 2 years ago he said he doenst like wow classic
---
still offline =(
---
This sub praised Venruki for changing his mind and having fun. It's about him shit talking vanilla and the people who wanted it then acting as if it never happened when Classic comes out and there's loads of hype. 
---
It's just completely disingenuous and distasteful
---
Imagine telling people to imagine stuff.
---
#DIS IS BIAS!!!!!!!!
---
This is getting laughably stupid. I hope Asmongold only does it more now.
---
A lot of people are saying beta testers were prioritized for the stress. Time for a straw poll, are you solely a stress tester or both, and did you get in?
---
I wuz there :3
---
how long does this take
---
In
---
And Lt. Dan kicked you in the nuts with his magic legs.
---
you people cry over the stupidest shit
---
enhancement should of been taken care of more I believe
---
It's on boys and girls!
---
its back up, im in game
---
So this guy complaining has the same issues as thousands of others (BECAUSE ITS A STRESS TEST MORONS). Asmongold successfully got into the stress test also like thousands of others...people are emotional and can't think straight lol
---
It's his sense of humor. Try lightening up a bit
---
Honestly though, I saw this too. Streamers were able to get in while I was stuck on character creation timing out. There was nothing wrong with my internet and I don't have an older computer by any means.
---
I was responding to the OP's idea, you're proposing something completely different and saying it's not mutually exclusive... like wtf.
---
Also I think your idea is terrible but, again, no point in arguing about it as I was responding to something different.
---
They could have written an email that just says you can play to level 3 and it doesn't make a difference. The fact being it was a stress test to see how the servers could handle a large load of people. But ya know "The email said!"
---
Lmao nobody was forming DM groups in SW in vanilla.
---
Hi, /u/TogarTheGreat
---
DOTS DOTS DOTS!
---
Ya because this is totally an unprecedented event, holy shit it's basically like he killed a puppy live! Literally no one cares, shut up
---
Yup it's back up
---
Having played from Vanilla, I can't say that I wouldn't follow this path. However, I would probably stop at WoTLK.
---
Go deal with it elsewhere?
---
I was honored.
---
OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
---
What the fuck is wrong with you?
---
Its back up but I still get the same Character Creation error :(
---
can you link some of the new WoW content creators? I have not paid attention to those creators as much over the years since I don't focus on WoW like that anymore. If there are new creators out that focus on WoW like they did back then I am all focused on them as I am focused on the old creators.
---
Neck brainless ape
---
Theres a level of overlap between this subreddit and toxic communities like 4chan &amp; the_donald judging by the types of memes and bullshit posted here. Exactly the type of people who obsess over the streamer celebs they supposedly hate so much.
---
Since the first mention of wow classic I've been thinking which class I would play. I've never enjoyed having more than two classes or spec switching.  
---
Considered warrior, rogue, mage, hunter, warlock and ele shaman.  I got to thinking, kind of want to to heal.  Never healed in wow, started in wotlk.  Hell, I've never even made a priest.  
---
That being said, I am really looking forward to making a healer. Most likely alliance, but if shaman is fun I'll go horde. 
---
I've been able to read a lot about resto druid.  Not s tier in heals but definitely viable member to have in all groups.  But really curious on holy pally, both priest heal specs, and resto shaman.   
---
Holy pally is a blessing bot?   All she does is rebuff people?   I couldn't find a lot about her.  
---
What makes priest so desirable asides dwarf fear Ward?  
---
And completely opinion orientated, is resto shaman fun?  If I wanted to try hard the meters is the class to do it?
---
I‚Äôm not within the theory of everyone else and I‚Äôm not looking into it further. However based on how the game/client updates I dont actually believe it has much to do with hotfixes unless it‚Äôs modifying config files
---
to when WoW was number one on twitch during Wrath Cata and BC
---
This has to feel so fucking cool for Asmon. They chose him out of thousands. 
---
Made me smile so big. Classic WoW is really back.
---
What's the nerf beside no trinket stacking?
---
Wait, doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúpriority‚Äù mean locking everybody else out of the stress test, change stress test to streamers only get to run around locked to level 5 max, and change all of classic to streamer only? /s
---
PTR had an actual patch update during the stress test
---
Mate, what people are complaining about is that streamers dont face any problem to log in. Obviously some people will make it in to the game, but what are the odds that basically every big streamer can instantly get in the game without any problem?
---
he got in instantly while other people were stuck at login
---
Same.
---
halfway through, I thought she was your daughter....
---
Just open up twitch and start streaming and you'll get in instantly.
---
My old guildie in vanilla told me that he got teleported by a GM to GM island, let him run around. Then ported him back to Org, he said the GM told him "Your guildies won't believe you". We never knew if it was true or not.
---
Stress test up!
---
Of course they are gonna invite streamers before inviting random retards that have a active sub. Streamers can make or break a game, They can help generate massive amounts of subsciptions.
---
Im not angry over it, but i am frustrated, and its for the reason that you specified.
---
Obviously some people (those with full beta access) were able to get in just fine.  This wasnt some big issue with the servers completely melting down or whatever.
---
Maybe it was just something accidental or whatever that they couldnt get fixed, but when theres *NO* communication about that....well, it looks really bad, especially for people that spent hours trying to get in.
---
I kind of expected a rough night.  lots of lag, not being able to accomplish anything because of all the people, crashes, wait times, etc.
---
This is something entirely different, though.  This is just flat out "lol, waste a few hours of your time and get *nothing* for it".  Even if i couldnt do quests, hogger raids, whatever...just being able to get in game and look around would have been satisfying.  Sitting on a few screens just trying to connect all night really felt like a kick in the nads, again...especially with NO communication.
---
Im also wondering what they expect to happen on the next stress test.  Its going to be summer, a lot of people wont be on the computer as much, and if someone has the option of participating in the test vs doing something outside on a nice summer night, wtf do they think those people are going to do after this experience?
---
tl;dr: Not mad, just disappointed.  Expected issues, didnt expect to not even get to log in and see a character.  Really would have hoped for more than....what, 1-2 blue posts worth of communication.
---
Didn‚Äôt even know twitch was around so long ago
---
so basically, now they wanna close it off after making people resub trying to get an invite to the beta, now they wanna stop sending invites.
---
"we have your money now, no invites are going out unless youre 'a big time streamer' and all that! come on ninja and co"
---
so bullshit.
---
Yeh
---
Okay Towlliee def I don‚Äôt like but Quinn really isn‚Äôt that bad, a lot of his crap is an act 
---
No need to act like this regardless, they are still people making a living doing what they love
---
thats the biggest one. it hurt the dmg a ton not being able to stack toep and zhc
---
I forgot how big that head was. I can't believe I fit it in my bag.
---
Stress test only.
---
you cant give someone advice with such little information, it would be pushing your own personal bias. he needs to give more info before anyone can help him
---
It‚Äôs a conspiracy. Now I know how those guys on ancient aliens feel when nobody believes them.
---
Im open to playing alliance, what composition did you had in mind with Mage and Druid?
---
Maybe we can do...
---
Double Mage
---
Double Druid
---
Druid and Warlock
---
Druid and Paladin
---
Some of these build were metion on his 2nd video but its long so ill provide timestamps.

Let people feel emotions yo. You aren't a moron for being frustrated about not being able to play. It's normal.
---
The people coming in and putting everyone down need to learn some empathy.
---
hey man, retarded people are still people, they're mostly normal, but who are we to say who's normal or not, since there's almost no such thing as normal, like hey, do you know norman normal? that kids show, I sure as hell do and what about dexter's laboratory, ey? Enter at your own peril, past the bolted door, where impossible things may happen, that the world's never seen befoah! In dexter's laboratory lives the smartest boy you've ever seen, but deedee blows his experiments to smithereens. there is doom and gloom when things go boom in dexter's laaaabuh! I wish mandark had more episodes or that the show would make a comeback. no new fancy 3d stuff or whatever, just exactly the old way. like courage the cowardly dog, you know courage? he's a dog! I like dogs, they're really nice, except when they bite you, god, I hate that, but you know what's worse than gettin' bitten by a dog? Moosestopm, god damn, that shit hurts for a year and a half, it's basically a big deer stomping on your head for a couple of hours, you know, nothing fancy, just a little bit of tap dance. Also if you want to read something more retarded, try reading the last birthday card that you got from your parents.
---
Look, I get it, 30 streamers really are more important than 30 randoms so people can watch the stream when they're not in. It's about making it better for the release, I get all that.
---
It doesn't change the fact that it would have been fun to play, but I never stood a chance, even though I logged in at the exact opening time.
---
Server looks to be up, but I'm still having the same issue as earlier with timed out character creation.
---
I might be misremembering but it was during cata and usually in the top 5 at any time during the day
---
Prot Warrior offtank thats already in the raid. You dont lose a DPS slot for this, it is the only viable raid spot for Nightfall.
---
Nightfalls benefit is strongly misconceived by people who see 15% spell damage and think "wow, thats a lot!" You lose a DPSer by including a Nightfall user, which means that person is going to have to compensate for the lose of a normal DPSer. At 100% uptime, with an average 13 casters, youd get 195% of the average Caster DPSer in gains. Thats with 100% uptime, which will literally never happen. With the average PPM, its like 1/5th of the time on a good day, which means youre only gaining about 44% of the average casters DPS, which means its up to the Nightfall user to compensate for that 56% shortfall. Hunters will never accomplish that, Paladins and Shaman might barely in MC with a Nightfall, but without ever upgrading their weapons, wont after that. Theres also a great many fights where this doesnt work or youll have less uptime because of fight mechanics; Magmadarr, Garr, Geddon, Shazz, Golemagg, Ragnaros, Onyxia, Razorgore, Nef, Skeram, Sartura, Huhu, Twin Emps, Ouro, C'Thun, sorry Im not an expert on Naxx, so I wont get into that.
---
As for whats the least bad? Shaman have an extra totem, so they buff a bit more damage. Keep in mind, you cant just say "thats an extra WF totem!" Its not, because the NF Shaman is the "extra" totem, you would have full WF on your melee whether you had a NF shaman or not. So really, its more like gaining a Tranquil Air Totem, which, again, isnt simply 20% extra DPS to 4 casters, theres really no predicting just how much DPS that 20% less threat wil give them, but its always going to be much less than that. Enh Shaman also have almost no gear itemization, they effectively dont scale at all throughout raids and get worse very fast as raiding gets deeper.
---
Paladin is the next least bad, the extra buff doesnt make a difference because you take enough Paladin healers to raid anyways and the Auras are a very marginal buff most fights outside of the tank groups. Paladin gear does scale a lot better because they effectively have the same gear Warriors do, but practically, you would never give a Paladin that gear until your Warriors had it already.
---
Hunter is by far the worst, you get more uptime, but effectively do near 0 damage,
---
You realise that vanilla came out 14+ years ago yeh? No one is getting world 1sts lol.
---
I‚Äôd actually really enjoy separate expansion servers!
---
Holy shit, i was able to make a toon
---
Finally made a character successfully just now
---
That's her beta model. It even says it in your link.
---
4 hours later, I'm finally able to make a toon.
---
WE IN THERE BABY
---
Did it work?
---
I think this is what would be best. I know a lot of people would love TBC, but I think flying has proven to ruin world immersion and sense of continuity. I just want the world to feel more alive than what flying does to it. Not to mention the possibilities that an alternate timeline would offer! What if big decisive events played out differently! Also let's keep simpler stats wise, no lvl 70 for example. Just keep adding more viable gear options to classes. Paladins never tanked enough? Add gear with skills or just new skills to make that possible. There's a whole breadth of game-design available here to keep the essence of Vanilla throughout Classic's progression.
---
I actually have that sufficient knowledge because my love of Blizzard games encouraged me to go into Software Engineering. It definitely would have been more expensive than inviting everyone and only letting in a portion of the invited though.
---
I get why they did it this way, that doesn't mean it wasn't a waste of of our time.
---
The eyebeam alone would still have wiped them all
---
Can you point out where I was wrong?
---
Nothing more that that cucks followers. Dont like it, go deal with it elsewhere.
---
&gt;Could it be because the dungeon was the first one Alliance typically did when leveling, so no one had devised a naming convention  
---
Ya probably.  From the very start of my server (2004) people calling it 'VC' and I never actually heard "DM" until the 3rd server I played and it sounded so wrong.  I think different servers had different experiences with their naming.  All I know is on my 1st/2nd servers, if you spammed trade chat with "lf2m DM" you'd get people messaging you "wth is DM"?
---
Just curious, what is considered good at the game for you?
---
Never said being disappointed isn't okay. I would be too, but looking at the thousands of others on the servers it was more about being unlucky than anything. Let's just hope release goes better. Please keep participating in the stress tests to make that happen.
---
Though now im stuck at 90% load screen...
---
I didnt say you were wrong, I told you to shutup
---
Hilarious considering you said earlier that you have played DotA, League, and HoN before others even knew about it. It's just not there because your toxicity was fucking obvious and had to get removed.
---
Seriously, do some introspecting man, it's really apparent.
---
"Play up to level 5 and help us make sure we can provide the best experience possible when World of Warcraft Classic launches August 27, 2019."
---
/had two giant CRTs back in vanilla
---
Top of my head? Selenium, or whatever load testing framework they already use. I guarantee they already did that, and that they already knew this would happen.
---
In vanilla on my server it was VC.
---
You said thats not what we are getting. What are we getting then?
---
When my PvP flag timed out after 5 min, I was removed from my party and instead of all the kobolds in the cave being dead, I got ganked by 5 rogue Kobolds popping out of nowhere and killing me. Back in the cave, ressed and died again for pulling 2 mobs on half HP. Third time I ressed on top of the cave.
---
I do believe it was also to help starting zones out since there will be so many people trying to tag the same mob, but that may be what you mean about over pop.
---
I was in for more time than asmon
---
You assume that you will be easily able to tell which layer you are on.
---
There is way too much that we don't know about layering that, while these kinds of concerns are valid, it is way too early to say that blizz hasn't already thought of it without people even trying to test to see if these kinds of abuse are even possible.
---
You know what's not good for you? Holding shit in and not venting it out.
---
Runes for sure were P2W, I've said that above even. I just think it's silly to call champions p2w because you ain't going to get far with shit skill and a whole champion list. Plus the game is free, they need to support themselves somehow.

Different timeline or did we go back in time to alter the timeline to be what we have now.

I luckily got in and played to level 4 before servers went down. Enjoyed my childhood again. But I can now wait until August 27th.

We are not getting the original layering, that is what I was referring to. The title of your post.
---
Man this is some boomer level shit.
---
Abilities replacing lower ranks is only for Warrior and Rogue, its not physical abilities, its rage and energy use abilities, ie. Heroic Strike costs 15 Rage for every rank, wheras different ranks of Wing Clip cost different amounts of mana, so you get all the ranks, same applies to Raptor Strike and Mongoose Bite, as well as Stormstrike.

A stress test is a test of flooding the servers to see a what capacity the server becomes unstable and how it handles it. 
---
That is all you were invited to test this is also the reason you had a level 5 cap so everyone would occupy the same landmasses to try and see what happens.
---
This wasnt a beta test but you assumed it would act as one, sadly it was probably poorly communitcated to you what you would be testing or you just assumed you were doing more then blizzard wanted you to. ( to repeat it again, All they wanted was for you to try and log in with the servers under stress)
---
Woah!! First time gold and silver
---
quit complaining.  you think the hundred other players surrounding asmongold were all streamers too?
---
I can't wait!!!  [Method Venruki's "I was WRONG about CLASSIC WOW"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k5K4a-teWo&amp;fbclid=IwAR0ieJmak_2gNCkcREhLXfJzP-bpwNXlBDV7vT5lIDE9zZCwyiRsimjgOi8) on YouTube explains why classic is so amazing, contrary to the popular belief that it's "just nostalgia".
---
Also how many people do you think are going to be able to ‚Äúfarm rare mats‚Äù and abuse this system in the first 2-3 weeks, like .00001% of the playerbase?  Most of us will be lvl 10-20
---
final
---
Thanks dude, this made my day hahahaha.
---
no
---
Same :/
---
Yea holy fuck man, keep getting "world server is down"
---
Fucking game. Of course it won't come out til August either.
---
Fucking paid for a sub and didn't even get invited to this fuck you blizzard ruined everything
---
Go donate to him if you love him so much :)
---
That only means that Blizzurd has plotted this out since early on to keep certain players out on purpose!!
---
Playing as a popular streamer would have to be absolutely hellish. The constant harassment would be bonkers and rolling on a PvP server would be impossible. I doubt they'll be able to have any enjoyment of the game at all until they hit max level and can just instance and raid.
---
Bold claim. Prove it?
---
Who else remembers when we all thought vanilla gear models were amazingly designed?  Pepperidge farm remembers.
---
The lie detector test determined..... that was a lie.
---
The first sentence of your post?
---
Thank you! I'm sad that I had to scroll this far down to find this... News and positive memes have been good, but all the shitty elitist gatekeeping in this sub has genuinely made me less excited for Classic. :/
---
We wouldn't have to explore continents in the Lore. We might end up fighting a battle in the twisting nether or reforging the bonds that make up the Horde and Alliance.
---
And yet all the streamers have no trouble getting in. Blatant preferential treatment to the blizzard cucks
---
Oh boy, it finally worked. Character creation boss slain after just four hours. Time go get some sleep now &gt;.&gt;
---
Hi, /u/Sensitive_nob
---
Oh neat, here comes the fake news media.
---
Not politics but memes. The memes using wojaks, 30 year old boomers, zoomer kid, etc
---

---

---
The OP for that post mods /r/TheSuperiorSex
---
I'm generalizing but people like that are from toxic af communities and will contribute their toxicity and cancer memes here.
---
What part of "deal with it elsewhere" did you not understand?
---
Not a streamer and I got in
---
He spells You with a u. Do you really need to ask that question? lol
---
Were you in the beta or did you get invited just for stress test? i feel its more of a beta privilege thing as most of the people who couldn't get it only got sress invite.
---
Like BfA too.
---
I dont think the business trying/testing something really changes anything. The point of the analogy was to draw a similarity between being cut in line by a celeb IRL and a streamer being let in ahead of the queues (Again, not saying that was the case) wasn't it? 
---
Now its a different case if the business was advertising a celebrity appearance but in the case its more like they showed up for coffee same as you and then just walked ahead of you
---
In a stress test there's no guarantee of service.
---
I mean it makes sense to let Streamers in. Just because we made it in doesn't mean they don't have something making it easier. 
---
Top 20 streamers all made it in when it was actually up, yet 80% of my guildies with stress beta couldn't.
---
I mean it only helps the game flourish by having streamers market it so I am all for it. I just think it is naive to think they wouldn't have a system in place to facilitate their access. 
---
Selenium is a browser automation tool, and you can sit there and act like you can automate thousands of people trying to login to a server at once across different latency, regions, and more but you totally know more than a company that makes billions.
---
Isn't it just that beta testers had priority and not streamers?    
---
Seemed like everyone who had beta invites before the stress test were able to log in. Only people who had problems were people invited only for the stress test.
---
Aw man. I'm sad I missed it now.
---
I think some accounts were flagged and some weren't. I was stuck at character creation for 3 hours. When they took the server down after the test was over and brought then back online I could make a character instantly.
---
boys can we do coffee bean instead? starbucks makin‚Äô me gassy these days

Flashback to the original 2004 WoW login catastrophe meme for those who remember [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wvlCSTOQNk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wvlCSTOQNk)
---
Now onto the loading screen boss.
---
Bashing a game relentlessly and then changing your tune when it gets popular is disgusting.
---
Imagine imagining.
---
Finally able to make a character but getting "World server is down" after a long loading screen
---
I just don't remember what was nerfed by when lol.
---
You paid for a one month sub for a chance to get invited to the beta and get mad when you aren‚Äôt? Not everyone gets to get in dude.
---
The same could be said for any of the wow streams. Besides Quinn only started playing like 3 years ago.
---
If they got the point where they dropped in spawns of enemies (like hogger) into Northshire, I don't think they were disappointed with the test. This is what they were going for.
---
You're right... let me just check my email again:
---
"Install now and get ready to rush our test realm as soon as it opens at 4:00pm PDT Wednesday, May 22, until 6:00pm PDT . Play up to level 5 and help us make sure we can provide the best experience possible when World of Warcraft Classic launches August 27, 2019."
---
ah see that would be some information I did not have. Thank you
---
Yeah man. I have excellent computer and internet connection via direct Ethernet, no WiFi. Very low latency and never disconnects. I was one of the first to enter when the realm came online but was thoroughly unsuccessful for the entire 2 hour stress test. Feels conspiracy man.
---
When even streamers get higher priority than employees LUL
---
so you cant clip, you don't know how to do it, you deleted the it?
---
God I hate blizzard shills. GTFO
---
They just turned on their streams to get in
---
Well, that is the point of a stress test. 
---
Also, isn‚Äôt this the experience everyone who was angry about layering wanted?
---
All three secondary professions are important, especially having first aid. Having the best food buff for your level is almost like an extra item in terms of stamina and spirit (both crucial for warrior).
---
For primaries, I'd recommend two gathering professions to start. Skinning and mine/herb is common - provides lots of stuff to vendor for extra gold. I think it would be rare to craft gear that you keep for more than a level, at least until endgame. You want to make sure you can drop the 90g for your mount right at 40.
---
At 30, ask some friends to help you with the Whirlwind Axe quest. IIRC it's a level 42 item, and I see warriors using it even into their late 40s. It's an amazing power spike.
---
Learn to hamstring kite - Kargoz has a good guide on this. It can be as much as 2/3 less damage taken; the idea being, you use hamstring to kite the mob back and forth. You're swinging a 3.6+ weapon while their attack speed is much faster, but you trade one of their weak hits for one of your normal hits.
---
Warriors are tough. Try to stay at least a level up from the mobs you're killing. Just like any other class you will have to grind at some point. (I recommend swamp jags/whelplings in Swamp of Sorrows)
---
Good luck
---
Quick question for people watching streams : How many streamers did NOT get in?
---
&gt;save all the good memes from 4chan
---
&gt;wait 3-4 days
---
&gt;post it on reddit for internetpoints
---
I think youre missing the point. Vanilla wow should be left vanilla. Although blizzard mentioned they would make some minor changes, adding new gear or even changing the appearance of existing gear is a HUGE change. It would no longer be 'vanilla'.
---
I haven't watched a stream since I got my Beta invite and don't plan to again.
---
He needs nerfs. Unkillable at the moment.
---
I hate everything about what you're saying.
---
were?  
---
  I still think they're incredible, they got way too overdesigned and instead of having a ton of good sets, you had maybe 2-3 good ones out of the entire tier.
---
For a sub that talks about the sense of community being Vanillas best quality, streamers sure are getting a lot of hate for there community run event.
---
true, good point.
---
Server is probably full again
---
It let me make a toon too. I‚Äôm getting world server is down though.
---
They also brought stitches thrall onyxia and Ragnaros
---
Yes you absolutely can, and as I said I literally guarantee that they did. It would be insane not to.
---
This is the whole point of this stress test.  They need to hammer this new system to see how it responds so they can fine tune it. 
---
The intent is that for the most part the majority of people will ideally never notice any kind of phasing. 
---
The layering is supposed to be until the playerbase disperses over the game world and slowly stripping the layers away until there is no more layering. 
---
Its wonky right now for a reason.
---
Patch 1.5
---
&gt;Spirit Guides in Battlegrounds will now resurrect your last Imp, Voidwalker, Succubus or Felhunter. If the Doomguard or Infernal were the last active pet or the previous pet was killed before the Warlock, an Imp will be summoned.
---
Yeah the ZG trinkets were nerfed in 1.10, but it's still pretty strong even if you can't stack trinkets anymore.
---
It‚Äôs high pop and pvp is full pop. It‚Äôs a difference but it‚Äôs not ‚Äúhardly anyone‚Äù
---
yeah i thought this aswell
---
Those memes aren‚Äôt inherently bad, just the way they are used *can* be.
---
I do completely agree that the behavior has overlap.
---
Well, they are monitoring the server. This week a blue post used a YouTube VOD of a stream to demonstrate that the damage of a certain mob was correct compared to the original WoW. 
---
There's a lot of test going on that is not public. They keep the population low because the besta test is not a server to handle high population. As they can, they will increase and send more beta invites. This stress test is intended to test various aspects of the official server that is going live in Aug. 
---
How you are not feel as a valued customer based in a beta invite? We are almost in June, the live serve comes in August. Just wait as everyone is waiting for years.
---
Yeah definitely generalizing there...not everyone from 4chan comes from /pol/ and tbh who really unironically likes Asmongold anyway?
---
You‚Äôd imagine if he was invited sooner he‚Äôd be playing and no ones reported beta invites since Monday, so I‚Äôm thinking he did something sus for the access
---
Preventing tens of thousands of people from making characters is technically a "big event".

The sense of entitlement is real...

Ayyy what guild were you in? Trying to think of all the big guilds that used to be there.
---
IDK tyrande was like 90% head.
---
He never defends blizzard he points out the shitty arguments the op is making. . .
---
I'm not saying they have to ("would be nice"), but not being transparent has its consequences with the community. Maybe they are ok with all of this backlash and frustration.
---
Remotr, it's actually a decent free remote desktop app. Can setup onscreen keybinds really easily.
---
Yup same
---
Oh same here.  I still think most T2 sets are the best looking in the game, even with their low quality (by today's standards) models.
---
The sense of entitlement for beta/stress test access is too real on this sub.
---
I was able to create and actually play an orc but I wanted to be a human so I logged, deleted, created a human, and now it says world server down
---
You fail to realize that layering fixes an issue that sharding does not. After a few months populations will plummet as all of the tourists and casuals leave. By layering you can dynamically raise and lower how many people are on the server as a whole. This means that at the start when there's 6-10k on a server, you won't have 5 hour queue. It also means that when the hype dies down, Blizzard can make sure they don't have to do something awful like mergers. Layering is not perfect, but we know so little about how it works that we can't say for sure it'll be as easily exploitable as some people believe.
---
At least I got the name I wanted!

Hey you know the server will be around until tomorrow right?

You are a nobody and Blizzard doesn't owe you anything.

We must insist that Blizzard re-release this beta test as ‚ÄúWoW Classic Beta Stress Test‚Äù classic so that players can relive the glory once again. No changes.

Definitely not the right meme format
---
I know what you were responding.  You were saying "I hate your idea, OP, because I want to play this way, not that way."  And I said, "You can play your way while he plays his way.  They don't have to be mutually exclusive."  
---
I understand basic reading comprehension, and can follow a conversation sometimes.  This was actually one of those times.  
---
All you wanted to do was show up on the internet and tell someone their idea was stupid because you didn't agree with it.  Well good job internet kid.  Good job.
---
I love the thirty year old boomer memes because it's one of the few memes I relate to, and I imagine lots of people on classic wow are around the same age and feel the same way. I don't understand how that means that we are literal boomers obsessed with building the wall or 4chan neets.
---
I think it‚Äôs a joke. Not sure; Poe‚Äôs Law is an absolute.
---
I'm sure warr/druid is strong too, warr with any healer is good. It kinda just depends what u wanna play . I'm pretty deadset on those two classes, only alternative would be hunter but idk I plan to lvl that as my alt and learn it slowly as I'm unfamiliar with the pet mechanics etc from vanilla 
---
Druid 1-5 sucks but after that it's fine so having a second person would be nice . Mage I have to drink pretty much after every other mob pull but I could make us food and water and polys are always nice.
---
But that's not even true, go watch the vods. All the streamers had issues at different points.
---
PS: Servers are back up :) The stress test is 2 hours, but they'll be up for 24 hours.
---
Are you sure? I distinctly heard someone say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]
---
Same here, at least I have my character now
---
Give it to me or I'll gank you.
---
I kinda want to see someone play Classic 1-60 and raid entirely from their mobile now
---
Ahhh yeah, but wasnt it Victor Nefarous or something? (Should have googled it before posting)
---
BLIZZARD JUST REMOVE LOADING SCREENS. THIS IS A SIMPLE FIX.
---
This guy literally flames blizzard 24 hours a day on twitter like a 10 year old and gets beta ROFL
---
Not sure who Elvis Frits is, but he seems like a cool guy
---
Same even though server pop went from Low to Medium since I've been trying. Guess I'll start streaming
---
Has it occurred to you that you can see the streamers playing because, they're streaming, so you can see them? There are tons of others in the closed beta that people don't see bc there not online to see.. and got to play while others just joining the stress test couldn't get in.. just seems like simple logic to me. Maybe I'm over thinking it.
---
If you plan on adding more content you have to increase power level and raid difficulty at some point, otherwise you get stagnation. Say you have naxx out for like 3-6 months before you add more content or the next expansion. A lot of people will be maxing out their gear by then. Part of how raiding works is that when the new tier comes out, you kind of have to gear up as you progress. If you cap power level at naxx level, any new gear won't be as impactful as the gear you got from naxx already, discouraging gear progression in that new content. Sure it won't matter as much to the people who are lagging behind and haven't gotten to farming naxx but the hardcore players will get bored easily.
---
I for one don't really know if I want TBC/WOTLK exactly as they were at this point. Because some of the things that we see as causing the current design philosophy problems in retail originated in those expansions (WOTLK moreso with tiered raids, dungeon finder, in-game content microtransactions, achievements but flying in particular was a hefty blow to world interaction)
---
Not this again.
---
I can't say that this was the easiest thing to do, so I'd imagine it taking ages but yeah it'd be cool to see!
---
I'm tempted to buy a bluetooth keyboard and mouse and see how well it works.
---
Stop
---
like people are making this argument but its mostly a strawman, people are really just angry that prio exists at all. not a single EU player on any forum I could find reported getting in. huge bait wasting hours of time when we never even had a chance; would have been nice to get some transparency here

I truly hope people like you stay away from all games in general. Before you make a deal with it elsewhere copy pasta, try it yourself. Those other pixels you are telling you hope die are still real people that are trying to deal with the stresses of life by escaping into a different state of mind. Toxicity does nothing but breed more toxicity.
---
Lots of people seem to have the mentality that the stress test was some sort of demo for them to play to level 5 when, shocker, it was to stress the servers
---
One time I even rekt a guy in a duel with my tankadin. This warrior was outside Orgrimmar pwning everyone and offering 100g to anyone who could beat him, which nobody could.
---
I was terribad at PvP but I was in full raid epix so I took a shot and he beat himself to death on my massive tankiness. He didn't pay up and complained that it wasn't fair because he thought I was Holy and played it wrong. To be fair, I think I was one of maybe two or three level 70 protadins on the server, Horde side, so we weren't exactly common.
---
me 2, idk why ppl are qqing. I got in after the resets, like streamers and all other ppl.
---
U got omar in there too poggers

wait what was a year ago
---
Same here. At least I got past the character creation! Have people been able to get in recently or has it just been like this generally?
---
Tbh I feel like an idiot for wasting so much time trying to log in a fucking video game
---
Do you have beta access or just stress test access? It seems like beta player get priority somehow.
---
Space bar keybind because it isn't classic unless you're jumping everywhere.
---
Of all the online games i have ever played since StarCraft in 1998, Vanilla WoW was the one i enjoyed the most. 
---
Everything you did meant something, from finding a Epic World BOE, Downing Rag for the first time, fighting off other guilds at Azuregos/Kazzak or just running around the World finding people to fight.
---
Was great, i hope classic WoW is able to fill that void thats been missing for 12ish years.
---
In twitch's case i think WoW could really stay up at the top if they are able to give people a sense of purpose within the game as well as making it a great game to hang out in with friends/family.
---
wow he made it into a level 5 stress test, amazing

Of course but I have a right to be mad when all 10 of my friends get in and I get the dick

Literally thousands of non-streamers get Beta access and all you focus on is a handful of streamers. Yes streamers and content creators get priority over you specifically because they give Blizzard free ads. You on the other hand, bring nothing.

this was happening all day up to the stress test launch. Your theory actually sounds pretty plausible and a lot of us in that thread just assumed as it got closer (even though we got invites ) we weren't going to be getting in.

Have you ever experienced a launch?  You'll have hundreds running around competing for level 1 mobs.  Multiple zones is correct though, 6 zones.

Uhh, there being a lot of people on the server doesn't tell you how many were trying to get in...as others have said, previous access seemed to give priority, meh whatever.

You got the ignorant part right.

Nah, not everyone, I'm still 3 classes away, no /s.

If anything like Parsec, pretty good. Only issue I've had with using a mouse is right click doesn't work at all but everything I've found says that's an android issue. I've been too lazy to remap things for the camera look though.
---
Used parsec for lotro, ESO and a bit of WoW. It's not "cloud gaming" but I'm still a little leery of blizzard  going a little overboard with their TOS changed.
---
Don't bother, it's so much more authentic to have 10k players simultaneously hating on each other while they wait to get a quest NPC that's on a 10 minute respawn timer. /s
---
There seems to be an abundance of people who never got past the character creation screen. It‚Äôs not a coincidence. These accounts were never meant to access the server. They were flagged for fake connection

Is it just me or does it seem like the devs are having more fun than usual, too?

I agree with you that it doesn't mean that anyone who manages to chuckle or relate to the meme must be a toxic incel. I admitted I was generalizing.
---
But you can't deny that the main audience and generator of these types of memes are commonly members of toxic communities mentioned previously.
---
Are you an idiot? There were 5,000 people tryi g to get I  the game and the purpose of the stress test is not to make you happy. It is to get as many people as possible to try to log in at the same time, then monitor and adjust. You being able to play the game has absolutely nothing to do with this test.

The hate is so unwarranted and stupid, honestly I can‚Äôt believe these losers

You're just looking for negativity because you're a dick.

I think topping it was cathartic. I put my name in the vanilla friends list. I don't expect anyone to write me with nice things to say, but maybe I can apologize to someone

Relogging was a mistake.  It worked tho, quest mobs are over packed but I wanted to go say hi to the Dark Lady.

You should deal with it by seeking therapy.

Could probably figure out a way to rebind right click to a regular key instead of being a "click", then rebind in remotr for right click to be that key. Bit of a weird work around but I could see it working.

Glad it's not just me
---
And I logged in and made a character on my first try. Guess what? It's a fucking load test and some people will not be able to log in, just as those streamers could not get in at times when I was in
---
3 hours of spamming accept. ;-;
---
They've already stated layering will be completely disabled/removed when the phases are done one way or the other. 
---
No need to get the pitchforks until there's a good reason to do so.
---
This is producing way too much good content
---
Only real abbreviation is van queef
---
I think there should be some middle ground between retail and wow on release. Although I'm not a classic wow diehard or anything so I understand why fans would have problems with that.
---
WTF? You playing was not the goal of this test
---
I was just commenting about how I think there is a bit of an overlap of those kinds of communities in this subreddit. 
---
Memes about "chads" and toxic hate for popular internet celebrities and how victimized they are. Sounds pretty familiar.
---
Yea, and if someone was mad at me, I would say I deserved that, too
---
Just calling it now :)
---
[You really pissed the kids off this time, OP.](https://i.imgur.com/snjOE1s.png)
---
Got in. Killed a few mins, brought back memories and loved logged off. Can't wait to start playing this for real again in August. The wait is real.
---
Esfand failed to get in multiple times before he got through.
---
Well. Never was able to get in but that's okay. Hope blizzard was able to get alot of information from my constant attempts!
---
This publicity is fine, the point is how streamers are being listened to by devs and games are built around streamers. The hype they bring to any new game make sells and nobody cares if it last after a influencer switchs game.
---
I do have to agree that current retail is fairly streamlined, and geared towards relatively quick and easy progression and rewards.
---
That being said, if that style of play isn't for you, don't play Classic servers, and yes, don't push for them to be like current servers. That isn't the point. Mind you, a lot of people doing the bitching never played Classic WoW (some might have, but I know so many who haven't), so they aren't able to make a fair amd accurate comparison, or give the kind of input needed to make the Classic servers reminiscent/on-the-nose.
---
This is just my opinion. I remember playing Classic from launch, and beta. I remember the hard grinds, and running to dungeons to die a million times. I remember killing what seemed like a bazillion animals for hours on end just to complete a quest. That's Classic for ya.
---
Your post has a very valid point.
---
You also need to keep in mind we'll have 2 more stress tests, granted if it's anything like this we may not get much playing time, but may have another chance. At least have characters created now which seemed like half the struggle this time around.
---
Let's be real it has its consequences with THIS SR and the heavy anti-streamer anti-content creator babble.
---
What beta?
---
No, they didn't.
---
I'm in the beta, and the [client log shows exactly that same entry](https://imgur.com/csjU5z7)... followed by the character entering the game world. The reason the log ends where it does is because the client's connection attempt to the server likely times out.
---
One, that's not a useful metric. Two, are people really stupid enough to think that Blizzard would log a fake connection to a log that anyone could read?
---
C'mon.
---
Don't believe all the conspiratorial rubbish you see on the forums.
---
Horde is always the worst.
---
 You also need to keep in mind we'll have 2 more stress tests, granted if it's anything like this we may not get much playing time, but may have another chance. At least have characters created now which seemed like half the struggle this time around.
---
I can't hate on these people though.  I appreciate when someone can take new information and change their opinion.  I can't hate because I don't really know if they are actually enjoying in now that they are playing or if they are doing it just for views, for that reason I just don't watch.
---
Those who have the beta were all on this stress test since the others were offline
---
THIS  
---
IS  
---
CLASSIC!
---
Good. You are not needed. What is needed are people that actually fucking understand what a stress test is
---
I was just now able to create a character, but then I couldn't log in. World server down. Oh well. I did my duty and tried to log in for 4.5 hours. I'll see it in August. Late, late August. *Sobs*
---
Holy shit dude you're right!
---
If they knew we were never getting in it could be called login server test lol.
---
&gt;Once the stress test period is over, you‚Äôll be able to continue playing on the stress test realm (up to level 5) until Thursday, May 23.
---
From the stress test invitation email sent to those invited.
---
I honestly cant believe the effort in all of these keep it up man
---
I‚Äôm glad they got to play the game even more! /s
---
Seems legit.
---

I mean, you can play to level 5 in a zone saturated with hundreds of people, you would really only get to see the starter zone more than actually "play" anything.
---
Hearing him talk sarcastically about his ‚Äústreamer privilege‚Äù and hearing his remarks about him being better than everyone else really turned me off. I used to like watching his streams but his viewcount has risen to number 1 and it‚Äôs clearly going to his head. I don‚Äôt know why anyone would pay money to subscribe or donate to him.  He‚Äôs number 1 but for the wrong reason
---
That or streamer guilds become the only dominant guilds.
---
What're you blueballed for anyways? We're you that excited to stand in a starter zone lol
---
That‚Äôs all it took?
---
Honestly i'm down for warrior if u druid. honestly any combo can work. For me, its more about availability. This is my discord  
---
007#1267
---
 u can hit me up and feel free sharing your play schedule
---
I had a little blip on it and it was exactly the way I remember it being. And it was glorious! I enjoyed it so much! It's outstanding and pure proper wow as it should be. They should keep it as is. It's everything everyone has been asking for.
---
I'm enjoying the authentic world server down experience lol
---
::cries in gutterspeek::
---
I think you mean "proof this one guy got in but another guy did not get in".
---
1.12 Ragnaros dies.
---
damn look at all those streamers!
---
All I did was ask a question, do you take everything as a personal attack?
---
what middle ground? like flying mount, or pet battle, or LFD?
---
Don't listen to all these guys, they're trying to fool you. It's Upper Blackrock Spire.
---
Then was was the point in emphasizing the 2 hours?
---
Venruki came out and admitted he was wrong in a formal YT video. Personally, I couldn't care less about streamers but it means a lot when any individual can admit they're wrong.
---
If he's genuinely enjoying it, say so. Promote Classic WoW. If he dislikes it, why bother playing it aside from it being a disingenuous cash grab.
---

Why fireball rank one?
---
Be happy you got invited while the rest of us die from depression
---
I understand, but what I am saying is that THIS poster is clearly wrongly insinuating that VC was called VC because Dire Maul came out and replaced VC as DM, but as we have heard (and seen) from multiple sources and players, Deadmines was called VC by players long before Dire Maul. 
---
At the end of the day, this is very much a server-based thing. My server (NA - Bleeding Hollow) called it VC, and the 2 times I saw someone call it DM they had their heads chewed off by people in chat ‚Äúa little low for Dire Maul, don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù And so on...
---
Naxx you don't need like a full bag of consumables per run? How is this nonsense? He's concerned about tier 3, so I'm letting him know it's a ridiculous amount of consumables he'll need for naxx
---
There will be world firsts for Classic.  The old records will stand, but this is a new iteration of the game, not an exact clone.  The itemization is different, the patches and hotfixes won't be exact, it is a different game meaning there will be new world firsts specifically for Classic.
---
Yes me too, Eu And no Beta, but it took a while when it was instant for beta testers, i'm pretty sure you did struggle to log in even if you succeed get in.
---
That's hilarious
---
Fuck yeah man, me too. Small victories!
---
hahaha thats funny you cant lie
---
Where is my no invite option? :)
---
There's a vast gulf between changing ones opinion and following the money. They're all fucking leeches and it's disgusting
---
I honestly didn't check enough to notice. I was mostly trying to hit any enemy and then C'Thun was spawned in Northshire and it went downhill (in a good way) from there.
---
After tonight, I look at asmon the way a rogue looks at an oom mage.
---
That South Park episode didn‚Äôt just come out of nowhere. These are true basement dwellers my dude
---
Modern problems require modern solutions
---
Dude, weren‚Äôt you shitting on Classic like 3 weeks ago?
---
There are services (I just found out parsec offers it too) that let you remote into, say,a remote server farm where the game is installed in a cloud/virtual environment and those are bannable. Because they can't tell if you're trying to, say, bypass anti-cheat software that way.
---
But things like RDP, moonlight etc, come off your own pc and theoretically should be fine.
---
I might try remotr just in case they want to count the parsec desktop client on my own personal PC that I connect to against me
---
Haha look at this fucking epic gamer here. Are they oppressing you? Aww.
---
He's essentially Classic Wow Jesus.
---
Well I am  level 22 human keyboard warrior. Currently no guild or guildmates. I have the debuff depression and overfed which have no timer.
---
anyone else still getting the World Server down issue?
---
I subbed :( but even if I don‚Äôt get to play I‚Äôm glad Blizzard can actually see that their sub count has tripled because of classic wow. That right there is enough reason to resub.
---
He is genuinely enjoying it, just have to watch his streams I guess. He didn't put together a formal video but he's talked about the topic multiple times.
---
They wanted a more focused stress test where more people are logging in?
---
You don't even need to be popular. My friend streamed us playing Nostalrius at like 3am a couple times and that was enough for dudes to start ganking and following us even though only like 11 people were watching.
---
People do not have the slightest ue what is done to do a load test. Your clients were being used to simulate specific scenarios. You were not invited to play, you were invited to test the login servers and processes.
---
This hit home.
---
so no giffer's privilege?!
---
this world has gone to the dogs
---
I'd only be open to new content after like 3 or 4 years from now....even then maybe i'll have changed my mind by that time *shrug*.
---
It's VC
---
yes. At least now I can make characters, but I can't log into them.
---
Vs rogues it helps to break stealth incase they vanish or such
---
It multiplies damage with every target it hits - it would have wiped a shitload of them
---
To have the maximum amount of people during those time for the actual test? :p
---
You may be right. I just saw a friend of mine try to get in the entire stress period and fail but every streamer got in. Just feels really defeating to the average gamer. 
---
Also, my wife and I dig your content. She's a prot pally too.
---
Thank you Omar. Someone had to do it.
---
No shit, they said that you needed to have an active sub to get in.
---
non-streamers outnumbered streamers 100 to 1, but the whiners need narratives.
---
Well good to know im not alone. Tried to get in since it started and that kept stopping me
---
"Do you want to know more?"
---
No we dont want your middle ground. We have been playing the game for years as it was and loving it. Who decides the middle ground? How far do you go? Better to just leave it as it was, that is what we want.
---
People joining this subreddit in the last month or two are the problem. Classic is supposed to be an authentic vanilla experience. If you dont want that its pretty simple, go away.
---
Middle ground isn't classic.  Classic is no heirlooms, no flying, mounts at 40/60, no dungeon finder etc.
---
I laughed and then felt bad the way one does after eating junk food. Encouraging low quality, low effort submissions will be bad for this sub's health in the long term.
---
Looking forward to easily pwning these scrubs in PvP since they don't have the capacity for rational thought
---
I was able to get in without too much trouble and I also have this in my logs, I think people are reading too far into this.
---
Yep it was mandatory in PvP casters had a hard time dealing with it and until ZG came out the only source of 1.0 attack speed and was camped pretty heavily
---
yes exactly
---
Spreading false information is cancer
---
Also Power Infusion / Arcane Power no longer stack.
---
No need to white knight for streamers friend
---
I am not in the lvl 30 beta, I was just in for the stress test
---
that is private server authentic, not Vanilla Authentic.
---
Vanilla authentic was an unplayable mess of lag, dcs, server crashes and queues, with about 2500 people spread across 6 zones, trying to talk to NPCs who couldn't respond and all sorts of other non-sense.
---
Pretty much exactly what the stress-test looked like. So it's very good they're working out THAT mess of kinks right now, a few months in advance.
---
You might be right about it, although from the sounds of it the character creation point was the block for many. That pointed to a problem somewhere between the authentication server and login to be placed in a layer.
---
Still likely a useful test for them.
---
Offline &gt; Locked &gt; Offline &gt; Locked &gt; Offline &gt; Locked &gt; Offline
---
The existence of Zul'Gurub and Dire Maul conflicts with your argument. Those were both *below* the highest tiers of content when they released, and they saw plenty of interest. Even high-end raiders went back to Dire Maul for some of the niche loot and quest rewards.
---
Just smaller things to help streamline the leveling experience a bit. I personally wouldn't mind a few hours taken off the grind.
---
Got this clip from Un'Goro. Pretty hilarious to watch: https://clips.twitch.tv/GoodYawningSquidDatSheffy
---
not gear from the following expantions, but maybe new items made for classic, not too powerful or powercreep-y, just alternatives for more builds to emerge.
---
i feel somewhere down the line, they will have to do something to keep the playerbase interested, but probly not before 2 years.
---
This was before the 2 hour mark. After they shut down servers they clearly removed the streamer prio because I actualy got in before soda. But the first 2 hour. streamers 100% had prio.
---
Just saying there‚Äôs a lot of stress testers with the exact same story. And coincidentally all the beta testers got straight in...
---
If your erection lasts for over 4 original classic-inspired expansions, contact your priest.
---
lol.  i was being sarcastic buddy.  My point being 1.12 nerfed everything to shit.
---
Ironically while streaming.
---
Wow, look at all those streamers ! Insane!
---
Anyone else getting tired of steamers?
---
What you're arguing for is *horizontal* progression and not vertical progression, which is an awesome way of adding content to MMOs, but unfortunately many players scoff at the idea and complain about a lack of power gain from tier to tier.
---
It seems you are the one who can't seem to understand stuff man, no need for being mad.
---
Right, you can have some content that is below the current tier, you can't have **all** the new content be below or equal to the current tier.
---
yeah i still am
---
I guess they didn't see [this](https://youtu.be/HOAFpWVxZfU?t=98) when they sent out her invite
---
she's a piece of shit lol
---
Initial Hotfixes: Fake Connect
---
one thing that will really help streamline the levelling experience is just don't bother creating a classic character and just level in bfa :)
---
Do you go around instigating arguments just to tell the people you bugged to fuck off?

Its a brutal side effect of letting in every streamer. Report every Streamer to the IRS.

yeah, it's the person who doesn't forgive you for you bullying them that is "garbage in general", you're the good person because you apologized 15 years later
---
Original dev privilege!!! REEEEEEEEE

yeeeeeeeeeep

Yeah I'd just rather they speak in keks and burs in game than post about virgins vs chads in /r/classicwow hah

One does not simply melee a black widow with Benediction.
---
Hi, /u/Fucking_fuck_fucking
---
Created a character without a hitch, get to a loading screen, the bar goes up to near full, stops, then I get "World Server Down" after a few minutes of waiting. Seems like this is widespread right now? Hoping to be able to get in at some point and actually test it out...
---
Calm down Blizzard isn‚Äôt going to hire you for white knighting on reddit
---
this test is indeed stressful.
---
mission accomplished, i guess :P
---
The server is online now, FYI.  A ton of us got on.
---
Apologies, there just seems to be a weird amount of misinformation running around. Have a great evening :)
---
This type of mentality is pure garbage. its shit like this that resulted in blizz having to resurrect a 15 yr old game because they feel entitled to everyone's money and dont have to work for it. people just bend over and take it up the ass because of the brand.
---
I got alternate name A! Though to be fair, expecting a 4 letter common name not to be taken is hoping for much.
---
same here
---
Shitpost
---
You seem to be thinking Lotus isn't a unique spawn
---
It is
---
I tried...I tried to ignore the rambling but it got the best of me. Sorry only got through about two paragraphs.
---
After creating my character and starting the game, my loading screen halts at 90%.  
---
No stress test for me I suppose :(
---
Oh boy..
---
I bet Omar has been wanting to do that for a long time
---
I hope someone sets up a tracking page to keep tabs on where the streamer zergs go, I really hope we can find a nice server with a regular community.
---
ok
---
Ditto.
---
Wait till the first person gets banned for camping a streamer
---
You're not special for submitting this and "educating" people. They obviously wanted to stress test the game and the layering feature, not stress test the login server. Especially after Blizzard teased a special event for people who stuck around to the end of the test. It doesn't help the situation that there's footage of streamers getting in instantly.
---
He has always been this way. Wierd that this turned you off. Just dont take what he says to serious :D
---
Isn't that the true spirit of @asmongold and McConnell?
---
It hit top during bfa launch as well
---
Oh hey an Irish streamer, rare sight.
---
Dia Duit!
---
holy paladins spend a large portion of their time blessing, yeah, but they are a top tier healer in and out of pvp, they almost never go oom, very straight forward.
---
priests have the biggest healer toolkit, they can aoe, they have a HoT, they have an instant shield, they have dispels, they got it all. They are the staple healer.
---
try harding the meter would be paladin &gt; priest &gt; shaman imo, but meters are kinda shitty because someone who is overhealing heaps and misplaying might top them.
---
I did eventually get in. Just shitposting while I waited lol
---
Underrated name too
---
yep
---
Yeah no I‚Äôm not interested in corporate yuppie family friendly streamers. You‚Äôre more than welcome to go watch ninja if you‚Äôd like
---
doesn't sound like a ton, but thanks for the update! Keep em comin!
---
what a fucking shit show, why even bar-graph that?
---
Shhh, doesnt fit the narrative
---
Nice!! I was absolutely bare minimum for the longest time unfortunately since I was like 13 and didn‚Äôt know what I was doing so I never had a real presence on the realm.
---
You guys care way too much about this. Standing around in a starting area for a short stress test isn‚Äôt something to get jealous over.
---
thanks kyle
---
Why do you feel that way? Did something happen to you?
---
Alright so... You understand that layering is not zone specific right? And thus it doesn't matter where in the world people are in order to test SERVER WIDE layering, right?
---
Not only that, but people went back to the starting zones later anyway so it's a non-issue.
---
The email said otherwise
---
All these people trying to get in right now while im about to head off to work, damn. Good luck to yall and ill try to catch up tonight with streams and posts.
---
I played day one and did the whole midnight release thing for TBC and WoTLK. 
---
There were more people in the starting zone today than I remember being there when the game was first released, although I think I was at school during the day so for vanilla didn't start until I got home in the afternoon.
---
Now that is funny.
---
This title is epic bro :)
---
You've got it backwards - twitch chat is barrens 2.0.
---
Tried for and hour and a half starting at 4 and could not even make a character.  I get back 3 hours after the stress period is over and I finally make a character and then it says "World Unavailable" lol this is a joke.  Here's to hoping they fix this bull shit before launch.
---
Hi, /u/Venne1139
---
Sal the legend blesses us with his words yet again. Praised be!
---
Saved. Wow this is beautiful. Thank you.
---
Congrats man! I just became a dad on January 16th. I am extremely excited for classic, but the truth is, once the baby comes your time to play goes out the window!! Atleast if you are doing the dad thing right. Get ready for super late nights playing and sleepless mornings Haha.
---
If there somehow was a vote, mine would land on making a character copy to a fresh TBC server. And you even get to keep your Main on the Vanilla only servers. However, that would break up the whole community on the Vanilla servers. So whoever gets to decide this have to think hard and long about it first! :)
---
PS. And please let us finish Naxx this time before announcing TBC :D
---
Farthest I got was the character creation screen, but every time I tried to hit accept nothing would happen for a moment and I would get slapped with ‚Äúcharacter creation timed out‚Äù.
---
"battle for azeroth" the most pvp centric cover and story... allows you to "choose" wether you want to get ganked for minimal rewards.... lol.. 200iq bliz
---
How do I get into the stress test? I mean I don't see an option to launch "stress test classic wow" or something on my launch options...
---
Imagine.
---
It‚Äôs a huge difference, full isn‚Äôt a cap anymore, so it hit that descriptor and kept going. Aka it hit ‚Äúfull‚Äù when PvE was at ‚ÄúLow‚Äù but there is no descriptor further than ‚Äúfull‚Äù so it gives the illusion that the population is close. It‚Äôs not.
---
No im gonna play classic because I think I'll enjoy it more but thanks for the advice!
---
You have to admit some of us are masochists who like to grind 80000 zebras for their freaking hooves and that's ok.  It also makes it ok when you scream so loud you wake up your roommate when you get that first epic.  Work for the rewards is what makes classic so great for many of us.
---
Hoes Mad
---
There's a person I work with who I met last year. Turns out we played wow at the same time on the same server back in late vanilla and TBC. 
---
So random.
---
can we get it verified?
---
Aye
---
I actually meant in game, but you know, spergs gonna sperg.
---
It's almost like they're testing the capacity of the servers or something
---
No item you can buy from vendor restores as much hp and mana as the Alterac manna biscuit. It doesnt make it cheap for that. But the best thing would be to tip a mage to make you food. You can  get twice as much for half the price.
---
Can anyone explain why he is so popular? I saw some of his stream and it was him taking himself seriously in a sort of joking way. I don‚Äôt watch a lot of streams but it wasn‚Äôt that great? Am I missing something or am I just a douche without humor?
---
*puts hand on 600lb retail wow player*
---
I..it‚Äôs afraid...
---
Is there a reason why they do this?
---
My hubby got in but I'm stuck on world server down.  I'm trying not to be bitter but it's hard!
---
Subtle brag was not so subtle
---
Blackrock was big with Aussies at first
---
repugnant: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClIB0kliYk7voHub72oXpQ small but growing fast, seems a bit shy. Focuses on gold farming and grinding mostly, says he wants to livestream.
---
Frost: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwvBlnNJoP8EEUnR3laqbGg
---
Guides, news etc, bit clickbaity but he posts in the subreddit a lot. Not sure what hes doing in the future
---
Blackrock Foundry was an exception in WoD. Those tier sets were some the best the game has seen.
---
I‚Äôm guessing blizzard went home for the night and basically said fuck all y‚Äôall non streamers
---
Separate yourself from a corporate product.
---
I agree man I unfollowed Asmongold after today
---
Just hit level 5 on my warrior, but things with the server started to bug out after that. I tried going in Org and every NPC was gone, was teleported back to the entrance of Org and got "Transfer Aborted". No mobs/enemies would spawn and I kept getting teleported back to Org, even if relog. 
---
However the game is absolutely incredible. I love seeing white crits (hit for 40 on my Orc Warrior, felt like I deleted the scorpion). Warrior feels great, and the game feels...right. In a way, I feel like the movement is smoother than it was? Could just be my imagination or perhaps the engine is just smoother so it feels better client side? 
---
If you haven't gotten on yet, I hope you get the chance. We are going home.
---
Hang on... People were using voice chat in UBRS?
---
Serious data centers have sprinklers in case of fire.
---
Idk it even says the name on the corner
---
Unique opinion
---
They are very gear dependant yes.
---
Is this Alexensual? Lmao
---
He's a biggun. I spotted him and then realized that was a human at his knee.
---
I hated Asmond when I first started watching him, but after I realize he drips sarcasm like 90% of the time I love him. I laugh out loud more watching his streams than any other streamer besides maybe QTpie, who has a similar sense of humor
---
Gee willakerz I wonder why they chose him specifically billy.
---
So you hate crybabies and what exactly do you think you're doing? You're just as bad as they are, just with added smugness. Just move on with your day what are these novels you guys write lol.
---
Blizzard went home after the streamer test session hopefully tomorrow we will be able to play
---
I only disagree with you on the paladin. Ret paladins have been getting a lot more theory crafting now that we know mechanics better.
---
Basically Ret paladins going for spell damage on their gear to boost their damage. It apparently should be able to turn them into a teir 2 dps. They won't top charts but they should easily be worth bringing for utility while also bringing respectable dps. And they use different gear then the warrior.
---
(In fact they don't even really use warrior gear since they want spell plate)
---
Well, people were told play to level 5, not stare at a login screen for two hours. From the invite email:
---
&gt; Play up to level 5 and help us make sure we can provide the best experience possible when World of Warcraft Classic launches August 27, 2019.
---
Looks like Blizzard don't understand the purpose of a closed beta either when they made sure every single streamer got an invite to build hype rather than test the game.
---
Game isn't even out yet, do you even think before posting OP?
---
Stop having fun 4Head
---
Yeahwhat kolyhoyl said, as a warlock your main rotation is always shadowbolt spam, regardless of spec.
---
They are fucking us right now. Hour 5 of getting baited
---
Yea your personal dps would be higher. but the dps from your casters getting buffed overrides it by a decent margin
---
I had stresstest invite but since I am in EU and had to work all day and night I choose sleep before WoW so I haven't seen anything. Sounds like they need a few more stress tests to tune the servers though.
---
&gt; with the server started to bug out after that. I tried going in Org and every NPC was gone, was teleported back to the entrance of Org and got "Transfer Aborted". No mobs/enemies would spawn and I kept getting teleported back to Org, ev
---
It is invite only, and I believe you can only get invited if you have an active subscription
---
I wouldn't (and didn't) deny that this test is still probably very useful for Blizzard, especially given the huge number of players participating. The biggest advantage to this test was by far and away the publicity, though, and Blizzard knew this.  
---
Layers are the Classic equivalent to phases and shards a la BFA, so I don't see how that applies to log in issues.
---
Yeah, same thing happened to me. :( I just wanted to see Org!
---
I have an active subscription :(

I was just trying to articulate the feeling I had simply watching the test tonight in another thread. I gave up. This picture does a good job of what I was getting at though. I played to 120 in retail last year and the only thing that mattered were ilvls and mythic. Where was the magic? Where was the fun? 
---
I think tonight highlighted how much Blizzard's heart needs to be in it, for classic to be successful.
---
Again, did they hurt you? Can you articulate why you hate them? I‚Äôll agree though, it‚Äôs a pretty obvious gimmick of a stream and McConnel is a joke but damn man. Ignore them... You‚Äôll feel better.
---
Take your upvote.
---
You are not owed anything, especially from a fucking beta.
---
Just play retail, seems like it could suit you? If people like you got the chance to influence the direction, they might as well could scrap the whole project.
---
It‚Äôs funny watching these sell outs do a 180 once they saw how many viewers playing classic would get them.
---
I wish I could upvote this a thousand times. This was a STRESS TEST, this was not meant to provide a satisfying gameplay experience, only to provide Blizzard with metrics to provide a stable launch. People need to get over themselves.
---
Yeah it's happening to me too. At least i was able to get to level 5 before the servers went down.
---
The comment section in every possible platform: quit having fun!!!
---
this guy gettts it
---
This is what people were told in the email:
---
&gt; Play up to level 5 and help us make sure we can provide the best experience possible when World of Warcraft Classic launches August 27, 2019....Once the stress test period is over, you‚Äôll be able to continue playing on the stress test realm (up to level 5) until Thursday, May 23.
---
Anyone else stuck on the 90% loading done boss?
---
It's still just a chance like the beta
---
&gt; Dont like it, go deal with it elsewhere.
---
He says, choosing to voice his discontent about a streamer in a thread about the streamer.
---
Same thing happened to me.
---
lol k
---
In the Battle.net app, select World of Warcraft, then in "Region/Account" select "Beta &amp; Stress Test: WoW Classic".
---
If you haven't downloaded the classic client, it will need to download then.  It's 3.2GB.
---
I agree.  Scroll past them and find a smaller streamer to support.
---
Why is it when people get enraged over simple shit like being lumped in with dipshits they always have the burning need to say the most predicable shit like "I love how jealous you are"?
---
The 5 or 10 streamers are not the ones preventing you from "playing"
---
Asking the real questions xD
---
Blizzard told people what they were supposed to be testing. "Play up to level 5 and help us make sure we can provide the best experience possible when World of Warcraft Classic launches August 27, 2019."
---
Dia is Muire Duit!
---
I did, I was able to run around in Tirisfal and get killed by Hoggers until the server was reset.
---
You play any Pservers? I been trying some classes out just like 1-10 remembering all the little things changed since vanilla
---
I don‚Äôt care if he vapes I just can‚Äôt watch the dude cause he‚Äôs clueless and whenever someone has a different opinion he just spergs out on them
---
I don't care about not being able to make a character and log into the world.
---
But it's bullshit streamers got preferential treatment.
---
:( i was going to sw to see it before heading over to westfall, now i cant log back in with any toons. ah well, i hope they get this layering stuff straight or abandon it before the release.
---
Thank you brave gamer
---
Must have exploded then. Explains why I couldn‚Äôt create a character.
---
&gt;him taking himself seriously in a sort of joking way
---
This is his entire thing. He's a self centered ass who just wants classic. It's almost impressive how often I realize he's trolling way too late, as much as I hate to admit it. But I've definitely noticed every word he says is intended to illicit a reaction from chat. He's engaging chat more than he's playing the game in most cases.
---
I watch him (and sometimes enjoy him) in spite of my disdain for how he's so damn popular. Your sense of humor is probably fine.
---
yup, cities are bugged to hell right now.  i cant get back in.  dont worry its not you its the servers
---
Imagine seeing someone make a basic ass joke that doesn't pain you in the most glorious godly light and instead of laughing at yourself like a grown fucking adult you get enraged and defensive and post predicable lines like "imagine being salty".
---
Yep. Goodbye Wednesday night gaming session. Back to work tomorrow with nothing accomplished tonight. Oh well.
---
But don't worry there are two more! Oh and great news!!! Blue post said earlier that they are "rapidly decaying" invites to the beta!
---
So it doesn't matter if you opted in immediately and played long ago or have had an active sub for years... you'll still NOT get invited to the beta so you can just be forced to watch streamers that will nitpick at launch :)
---
I also got world server down :)
---
lol got enough NaCl?
---
I don't think they got preferential treatment just luck of the draw, I remember this happening during retail launches if you get in fast af somehow you have a connection that will allow you to log in instantly with no wait on the loading screen. I will say this though we will find out if they did get preferential treatment during launch, if they get to bypass q's that is completely fucked
---
You can plat August 27.
---
So wait until then or quit the game entirely.
---
Either one won't impact anything at all.
---
Yikes, she‚Äôs a fucking retard. Though that‚Äôs a given whenever anybody uses the word toxic unironically to describe someone.
---
It's bullshit people think this is an actual thing
---

When Soda logged in it was insane. They started layering and you could definitely see people slowly disappearing.
---
do you have beta?
---
There's only maybe 4 or 5 I think need to be avoided, the rest I bet you wouldnt even know were there but your best bet is an RP server.
---
Dude that's just weird. What does rest of the world have to do with it? So make a separate stress tests? I know Blizzard never cared about EU players but cmon, I'm going to work now. Imagine if I played at 2 AM.
---
Also why would you not trust PR guys? I mean they're still a goddamn Blizzard, they know more than any of us. If they say something, that's probably true. Logically speaking they'll probably look at the other times too, I never said they wouldn't, but still they said something so I assume it's true.
---
When aq40 launched is right when I started playing, I started raiding right around the time max dropped.  My guild (Quantum) cleared about halfway through AQ40 and then BC dropped which killed our momentum
---
Yep. Still going strong.
---
You had to get invited.
---
The salt from the stress test has been 1000x more entertaining than the test itself. I didn't have too much trouble connecting and I promise you didn't really miss anything.
---
I see, but 16 slots for 40 people is still small. I don't think warlocks will be given those slots.
---
&gt;Hearing him talk sarcastically about his ‚Äústreamer privilege‚Äù and hearing his remarks about him being better than everyone else really turned me off
---
I thought this kind of stuff was why people watch him in the first place.
---
I watched soda try and fail to get in for about a half hour.
---
Not a bad idea. I played on an RP PVP back in the day.
---
upper black rock spire
---
All I know about her was when she sperged out over Breath of the Wild being too hard. I seem to remember in her video she mentioned Hestu's maraca quest didn't give enough information to complete.
---
Have been stuck on it for like an hour
---
Hi, /u/TrashDaddy_
---
probably doesn't mean what you think it means
---
Retail streamers are fucked. There should probably be two categories.
---
is there any way to see when it comes back up with out spamming enter world? I don't want to make the problem worse... or wait is that what I should be doing since it's a stress test? or wait is the test over lol... much confuse
---
kill your fucking self
---
It‚Äôs what you deserve for playing Alliance.
---
yeah me too
---
Can't let people just enjoy things i guess ://
---
same, enough is enough
---
The only problem I see so far is where are you gonna get the money for level 2 training when you get to sw :)
---
NOOOOOOOOO
---
Who gives a fuck
---
Art works says otherwise
---
I wonder how many years before a TBC Classic.
---
So.. with intent to molest?
---
[me on august 27th](http://is2.4chan.org/gif/1558584500287.webm)
---
I was in Evil Cookies which became TnA
---
they definitely had priority, no one is saying only streamers could get in
---
Thank you for doing your part! If anyone was present in 2004 launch, multiple your 2 hours wasted by 2-5 days. Servers were dropping left and right that first week!
---
Is that because Britain left?
---
Nope, sadly.
---
You don't need to say opinion before stating your opinion
---
Yikes dude, chill out. Are you seriously being triggered by the word 'toxic'?
---
I have this in my logs and I didn't have too much trouble getting in. People are reading way too far into this.
---
ok but difference is that Blizzard is flat out not letting us in - the capacity is there and available
---
same, sad boy hours
---
Explain to me how the majority of people couldn't get in, yet the top 10 classic wow streamers all got in?
---
I'd love to see your math on that. I don't think that's accurate. By "live" you mean BFA, correct?
---
No, this bizarre humble brag really doesn't need to be here.
---
Imagine if someone from EU actually stayed awake at 2 AM to help Blizzard and then he gets told by people here to stop crying and being a moron.
---
Not that I know of unfortunately. Some people are in, but say its all messed up.
---
Well i dunno if twitch will differentiate and add a separate icon.
---
Hey we can create characters at least, which is nice. :-)
---
I totally agree with you. No clue what is going on with everyone acting like Blizzard is out to get them by not inviting them to the beta. And somehow not getting access to an exclusive test realm for a game that isn't out yet is the end of the world.
---
I'm completely lost. If people want to play Vanilla, the private servers are still up. But realistically, I think people are just upset that they didn't get something that other people did.
---
Pretty sure the serious ones just flood the room with halon gas to kill the fire.
---
OMAR COMIN
---
It was last February, I think? It was whenever they put in scaling. It‚Äôs accurate, because I did it.
---
Every other player you meet while War Mode is on is pvp flagged.
---
Then he's not *clearly wrong* if it's a server-based thing. Yep, tons of people have stated that their server called it VC before Dire Maul came out, but others have stated the opposite as well. In some people's experience, based on which server they played, the blue was right, and in others' experience the blue was wrong.  
---
It's like saying that a bunch of Europeans have chimed in about the sport being called football, and it's always been called football by their friends and family, so anybody who calls it soccer is clearly wrong. Meanwhile some Americans are chiming in the exact same sentiment but for soccer. So who's right and who is clearly wrong? Should we decide that the majority is correct and the minority is incorrect? No, it's a region-based thing. Like a server-based thing.
---
This is the correct answer.
---
Hey its this post
---
Hi, /u/Aerospine79
---
No, it‚Äôs just a filter for snowflakes
---
You can login on August 27th.
---
Who caresssssss
---
I remember looking for VC groups on NA servers in 2004.
---
What a cluster fuck this has been. I understand the "stress test" being  related to login servers, and that's why i hopelessly tried to get past character creation for 2 fucking hours. But then, I do the reasonable thing, I take a break, take care of some chores, come back 5 HOURS after the start of the stress test, and now the world servers are down? I mean, did the devs turn the stress server off when they hit the lights on their way out of the office? What a disappointment. Here's to the next stress test... right?
---
=(
---
Its free marketing and makes perfect sense that its a thing. Not sure why people are denying it. Still pissed I'm not in though.
---
What lengths do I have to go to in order to play on an EU server? I'd rather have 200 ping and raid at 8am than deal with a major streamer.
---
No.
---
Saying shit like "hold your tongue next time" and "people crying" isn't the way to deliver a meaningful message that the audience you appear to be targeting here is actually going to pay attention to. It just makes you look like a smug asshole, and that alone is enough to make them scoff off your entire message, no matter how legitimate it may be.
---
No one is saying only streamers got in, they definitely had priority though. You wouldnt be saying that if you spent 2 hours trying to log in. Not that I did after the first 30 minutes I gave up.
---
"Find somebody who looks at you the way Asmongold looks at Ragnaros"
---
At level 30? No
---
Why? So that you can win internet points for being a negative crybaby?
---
you are correct, boomers are the generation that spawned from the returning GI's from WW2 and causing a population spike. 'Boomers' are ~70
---
The people I am referring to are making immature comments to others with no intention other than to create more problems.
---
What I was trying to do was call out both sides of those people to get them to realize that they are being just as absurd as they think the other is. There's no point to throwing insults without the intention to change someone's motives.
---
She always deep breaths more
---
We know we always get the shaft it‚Äôs aight. Better than being filthy Alliance.
---
Apologies if it wasn't but the question came off rather passive aggressive to me
---
people who had beta access besides  the stress test were given priority all those streamers had beta acess.
---
TBC in 18 months, WotLK in 36.
---
itd be nice if blizzard just announced it to not be working so we wouldnt waste our time guessing.
---
Ignore those guys!  It's Black Rock Spire (Upper).
---
Streamer privilege is 100% a thing and you're blind if you don't see it.
---
Thing is, I don't blame them for that because that's just how it works nowadays.
---
I'm just annoyed that I was led to believe I'd be able to play and help "stress test" 5 hours ago.
---
cope
---
No for pointing out an obvious overlooked flaw that none of blizz fan bois even seems to have considered.
---
Fuck yeah.  We weren't cavemen back then!
---
Does the name matter? i thought they were wiping multiple betas, and names were even further wiped when release?
---
I know this is probably copypasta but that spelling physically hurts me
---
I just wish they would stop saying shit like "releases summer 2019" Classic releases when summer is well and over, if you have kids and are in college we will have no solid free time to play it non stop for a week or two. Just be real with your customers. Ive subbed since vanilla and because my sub lapsed a couple times I didnt get that cool "perma sub" statue they released. If you want to release something during a specific date be honest. I think alot of people myself included were hoping for an early or late july release.
---
The only one that got in to the stress test out of 7 people in our discord was the guy who already had beta access
---
Why do you care? Stress test was only to lvl 5. It's not like you missed out on much, other than stress testing the servers.
---
You present a good point. Watching Asmon‚Äôs stream once they started layering he had no clue what layer he was on. The only way he could figure it out was seeing a cycle of Ragnaros, Thrall, and C‚Äôthun.
---
Without these massive figures running around, he seriously didn‚Äôt know what layer he was on.
---
Why would anyone mistype W as V? The keys aren't even close to each other.
---
The moment you're spotted, you're going to find yourself disconnected and squelched.  Besides, that assumes they'll roll on PvP servers.  On a pvp server a single dedicated guild could force a streamer off a server by stream sniping them constantly.  A hoard of newbs isn't going to stand a chance against an organized group of 40 hardcore pvpers.
---
I meam there is no starcraft 1 vanilla and starcarft 1 remastered so by that logic...
---
What used to happen is not so important to me as what will happen now.
---
You will have to type 'LF tank and heals Deadmines level X+' or something today, based on what happens on private servers.  You could type VC and hope it will weed out some of the less knowledgeable people.
---
Wow that was a fast meme
---
Well done.
---
maybe it's my computer, but I get loading screens no matter the distance
---
U right
---
NaH
---
Same for me I even deleted the character hoping that would resolve it.
---
You're right, and I edited what I wrote to take out those things and hopefully make it sound less smug.
---
Downvote me you cowards "you think you want [to]... but trust me, you don't"
---
its a month before summer ends tho
---
tinfoil hat off, sure, but keep the whetstone handy for the pitchfork
---
Ah yeah sorry forgot about that one. Was missing something.
---
Special viewer numbers means special privileges.
---
The fact that you sound genuinely stressed after a stress test means it worked great. The game doesn't come out until August 26/27. You got into the stress test to *test*, not play.
---
That's gold.
---
You can clearly see people rather watch classic than the Retail garbage  
---
People raiding Mythic Nonsense in Retail get barely viewers while every classic stream even if he just stands there and does nothing gets more viewers.  
---
People want to play and watch classic especially those that go for progression and realm 1sts.  
---
My grandma can clear everything in BfA but someone going for the Classic Raids and Rank 14?Thats something interesting to actually play and see.  
---
There is no LFD and LFR nonsense for the casuals to see the content or be part of it so they have to watch it in streams.
---
No one button pressing to get all the fat loot while doing nothing at all for it.
---
I‚Äôm not a conspiracy theorist by any means, but you‚Äôre foolish to think this isn‚Äôt a thing. 
---
It makes logical business sense for Blizz to do what they can to accommodate streamers during this process. 
---
They‚Äôre essentially free PR for Classic, ease of use for them means positive reactions on their stream. The trickle down effect is real, especially considering that most of the top streams on twitch the past few days have been Classic.
---
&gt; I just wish they would stop saying shit like "releases summer 2019"
---
but, they're releasing on August 27th.
---
&gt; Classic releases when summer is well and over
---
summer ends at the end of September.
---
This is going to sound snarky, but it‚Äôs not intended to. If and when I actually make it in to the game, I will post some details.
---
Gold
---
lmao, i know, right? it was literally just until level 5. you'd be able to, what, complete a few quests, go raid Hogger and then logout? maybe you could level up Fishing to 75.
---
keep it up, these are so good
---
https://youtu.be/UmtuRRhtGQw
---
I could kill a few level 1s before I leave darn
---
You've gotta be trolling. Well done on "getting" me I suppose, since it took me damn long to catch on. There's no way your arguing this in good faith though.
---
I meant max level
---
no one in the US would say Aug 27 is a whole month before summer ends.  it's the end of summer.   
---
people don't use scientific definitions of summer when they use the word.  Summer is June, July and August.
---
im doing it randomly. While I want to play I am not so die hard about it that I have to keep trying for hours. I try like 2 times then move on and maybe try again in a few hours XD
---
I know stress test means its testing things to the max and honestly am not surprised by this level of crashing and server kicks etc.
---
Oh shit that's awesome
---
They were joking
---
&gt;test, I confirmed it was present in my log file as well. Fake Connect? What the heck is going on?
---
Yeah because the hundreds of other players around the streamers were also streamers. You've cracked the case! Get this man a reward.
---
So true, hitting enter and watching everyone else experience the fun :'(
---
You're getting downvoted cause of the weird hateboner this sub has for streamers. Keep up the good work dude, you're by far the most consistent wow streamer out there and your chill streams are super relaxing to watch. 
---
Dissenting opinion from the mainframe so direct your downvotes to the left please
---
They were for catch up.
---
Maybe that‚Äôs what the want. DDOS attacks are exactly like thousands of people attempting to login to a server at the same time. They might be seeing if the server has the functionality to stagger players and halt new players from spamming it, thus, creating a DDOS attack.
---
Dude, I didn‚Äôt even get into the stress, so I really don‚Äôt want to hear any of y‚Äôall bitching.
---
Haha it‚Äôs gold
---
He doesn't scream, but he'll shit on your opinion because it differs. The man cracked open like 6 random EU IPA's one day and had a beer testing taste while shitting on peoples opinions.
---
Also stuck here and eventually end with a "World Server Is Down"
---
Ok I figured there was some correlation between baby boomers and boomers. 
---
Except it seems like now boomers have been chnaged to 30 yr old+ perhaps. Or maybe that is the joke.
---
Then zoomers i have never heard of till now. Being generation z and replacing the b with the z in boomers to make zoomer.

Retail runs 70-80 FPS on a AMD Ryzen 3 Radeon graphics laptop, on fair settings. So I assume classic would run better with lower poly models
---
‚ÄúGet ready to rush our test realm‚Äù (if you get in) ‚ÄúPlay up to level 5...‚Äù
---
...dude we lost the race this time. Lol it‚Äôs fine.
---
Any fix?
---
Yes people do. Classic is releasing in summer. As a business you don‚Äôt speak in slang when talking about official releases and such. 
---
End of August is summer. It‚Äôs not fucking hard.
---
It's literally called a stress test, and every server has a limit. They're not going to invite the entire player base at once, because the server wouldn't be stressed, it would be KOA.
---
It's maxed level 5, overpacked areas meant to lag the game up. Is that really enjoyable?
---
does it cost anything to get into the beta?
---
Why would Fire Mage need to be changed? I am no expert on Mages at all, but from what I know they are the go-to spec starting with AQ
---
Yeah, the difference between Drek'Thar and Vanndar shows the big imbalance in AV was not just in the minds of the players.
---
Also it's weird to see Ossirian there.  Why him, among all the bosses?  He can only kill 20 guys at a time and once you learn the fight, it's not that hard to execute.
---
Blizz could always just add a global cool down of some sort after each layer swap??
---
You know that post isn't real right?
---
he gave his opinion as you gave yours. move on. Welcome to the internet. you did not like his negativity view/opinion yet you toss out your negativity unto him.

Why do you feel that way? Did something happen to you? Do you go around instigating arguments just to tell the people you have issues with to fuck off?

see how that works?

good bot
---
take my upvote
---
I didn't stress test, I was a ping from an IP trying to access their SSO, when they had already decided a limit. If I was offered to stress test a car by driving it down the street, and instead the door was locked and i kept yanking the handle, i would just like to know, I'm not driving that fucking car, so stop try to open the door. you know?
---
I've been trying to log in for 5.5 hours now. Not happening
---
First 5 minutes on stress test after it died down and I joined a group of 5 people and we talked for 15 minutes while fighting for tigers and talking. It was a great time that I haven't experience in a while, and it was just a 1-5 stress test.
---
i was able to get on in one of the layers during C'Thun and Rag. now i can't get into Dun Murough starting zone. nooooooo
---
Nice, did you record it all? I'd love to check it out :). What was the hardest part of it?
---
It's not whiteknighting. It is trying to explain what a loss treat is to a bunch of people that would rather bitch and complain than understand what they are doing
---
Yes, you're right.
---
June is the middle ground between now and July, which is the month before classic. June would be a good indicator of investment.
---
?
---
please cast bubble on this poor snowflake. Seems he's lost his way in the world wide web.
---
This x100. I watched soda and asmond both struggle multiple times trying to log in.
---
I'd watch that stream.
---
Yup, but most of the beta testers are streamer or influencers anyways, Shroud got invited
---
My anecdotal experience - stress test only, and got in for the last 20-30 minutes.  Wasn‚Äôt able to complete character creation until after the servers went down after the streamer AQ race.
---
The other guy is Golemagg the Incinerator
---
Just post your guild name man you can show him how dumb he is with your server first
---
Yes I can feel your anger. Tell me more about how mad you were about issues you had during a stress test.
---
are you talking about beta or stress test realm
---
Some of it, a lot of clips of random stuff out on twitch. I would have been back on it, but I‚Äôm not subbed so I‚Äôve got to wait for Classic and run a timer so I can keep my belt.
---
The hardest part was motherfuckers tip-requesting live to win for 16 hours straight. The chat was pretty helpful in keeping me sane, and I DID accidentally kill a skeleton and a wasp.
---
I was expecting everyone to have the same opportunities, and not special treatment given to some.
---
Getting? Yes, a lot of us are tired of streamers.
---
The released date is bad. All the fanboys sugar coat it but its bad. I'd rather they release what they got now and patch it before phase 2.
---
I couldn‚Äôt get in today because it was going crazy. I wanted to check this as well in those high populated zones and seeing how my computer runs. I have a fairly nice gaming laptop and get around 80-90fps on max  (not raid obviously) so wasn‚Äôt concerned on if I can run, just more the difference
---
RNG!? In my Classic!?
---
Any chance you have a 1920x1080 image? :P That's a beautiful shot.
---
Thought the stress test was over hours ago
---
I think you might be right honestly. It's a bit sketchy to be betting everything on the servers staying the same population after the second phase. Is it likely that's a safe bet? Sure. Certain? Nope.
---
Imagininining.
---
I just don't understand how you've been able to get in and do all that yet I still get a "World server is Down" message.  Guess I'll have to wait till August
---
If you think it's not, then you're insane. It was extremely obvious. As everyone else was struggling to get through queues and create characters, we watched the most popular streamers immediately login and make characters.
---
That's the point of the stress tests. There is a reason they're called stress tests and they're doing at least 3 of them.
---
You would be right if this was a one off or something, but this whole sub has been a toxic shit-on-streamer fest out of jealously that they have access to the game. Couple this with the fact that most people here are a generation older than the streamer culture, it‚Äôs clear why there‚Äôs such negativity. This is actually a funny post, but it‚Äôs honestly sad how big the hateful circlejerk is, considering that the vanilla community is one of the older ones.

It‚Äôs a stress test. They are figuring out how to optimize their servers to handle hundreds of thousands, of not millions of players. They needed people to slam their login servers, thank you for helping test. You will be ok.
---
Oh snap, a boomer has appeared!
---
I see myself in this picture!
---
It's not the cities. I'm trying to log in on new characters.
---
haha I can just imagine it.
---
another random fact from bullshit land, where's the source lol?
---
I mean I would have rather not gotten in then gotten the invite and then wasted my night trying to play something I was invited to.
---
I am really struggling what sever to play on as I dont want to get dicked by any aussie streamers
---
Maybe working on retail wow was so shitty he gave life to classic so he wouldn't have to suffer anymore
---
Snowflakes? What are you 12?
---
Are you serious? When he was dueling with Mcconnel he said countless times he was bad AF and was trying to get better. He's clearly sarcastic when he says he is better than everyone.
---
*Shakes fist in anger*
---
took a 3 hour break from trying to log in. finally can get to character creation and now i keep getting world server down as well &gt;&lt;
---
Holy crap. You knew this would be a risk when getting a stress test invite. It‚Äôs called the fucking stress test.....
---
Hopefully not too long. I want to reroll my BE Paladin and go to Kara. Class balance was on point in BC.
---
That was the original before everyone bailed to Tichondrius and Frostmourne. From memory one of the aus gaming magazines was behind the unofficial Aussie server movement?
---
They mentioned that they'd be doing this as a test. Also, way to go Tips "That's Crazy" Out for the brilliant commentary yet again.
---
this is gold. I just can't stand asmond
---
I spent 1 hour in character creation then I went to sleep.
---
There's people in similar threads on this sub reporting that this "Fake Connect" is in their logs and they got in. So it's not like the game is pretending to connect. Which dev would write "fake connect" into the code so that it logs into the users log file? That'd be really stupid.
---
if anyone is just "trying to help blizzard" then trying to log in and failing is good enough. that's the point of the fucking stress tests
---
So this is a separate issue which specifically references Raptor Strike - however, I think (1) and (3) in OP are working as intended for 1.12. To my knowledge auto-shot and auto-attack are not combined into one action at this stage of the game.
---
best post
---
How is the world server still down though
---
This is insane!
---
Hi, /u/MechanicalCuff
---
I created a new character and it's bugged too. Maybe trying to load the new one into the bugged orgimmar layer
---
There are also two definitions of summer: meteorological and solar. Meteorological summer ends September 1st.
---
I can't get past the loading screen. Can make a character, though. Oh well, I still got some intense feels from even logging in.
---
I don't sorry, I snapped this right before I got kicked off the server so I didn't have a chance to get a full screen shot. :(
---
You're so stupid. "I got in before soda therefore they removed the fake streamer prio that I made up" 
---
dude, seriously?
---
Right, that's exactly what I'd like to see. Stuff along the same lines as existing tiers, but with different sets for more niche builds. Heck, one of the biggest and most memorable challenges they added to the game was the Scarab Lord quest line, and that wasn't even an actual raid tier.
---
lol great stuff
---
Yes a stress test that allows you to level to 5 and have time to play after the 2 hour test window which has been down since the two hour test window ended. Why advertise getting to play at all if that won‚Äôt even happen.
---
Original wow stress test I'm 2004 ended with summoning internals in capital cities until everything crashed.
---
Didn't want to say "Unpopular opinion" in case it wasn't that unpopular. Figured I'd leave it up to the comments to see if it was or not
---
&gt; Who else remembers when we all thought vanilla gear models were amazingly designed?
---
I'm guessing you didn't play a hunter. T3 was the only good looking set, and the hunter epic quest staff was the starter night elf druid weapon model with a green glow.
---
Thanks man, you right, i'm just ranting mostly. Just bummed out, just miss the game. I know i'll get downvoted for this thread, was just hoping after the two hour stress we'd at least have some active server to get a taste of the game.
---
Oh my freaking god.  
---
Esfand just posted his log files. Here's what they say:  
---

It‚Äôs hard for me to wrap my head around the priorities of such people.
---
Have you given thought that the stress test failed? For all you know Blizzard is freaking out right now.
---
yea i got to play it. took forever to level out of the undead starting zone due to soo many people
---
Log in, not try to log in. Maybe try and understand what you're reading next time. And I don't watch streams so I couldn't tell you what was going on. So you basically fail at snark on every possible level. Better luck next time, champ.
---
XxxToxic\_flamerkid420xxX would like to have a word with you
---
You could have always.....done something else.
---
You're welcome, and that's not my name but thanks for guessing anyway
---
"Completely unrelated: how do you remove electronic shrapnel from a grown man's skull?"
---
Dang, thanks dude. GL out there
---
Lol
---
Do you understand what a stress test is for?
---
It's not about server population, it's about zone population, and only the launch of the server will have the entire server population in just a few zones.
---
Afterwards you can tweak the population limit to keep things balanced.
---
Yikes
---
You're right, that was some bad wording on my behalf. I know they are great dungeon tanks. The suboptimally gets added in my head because I know they have an even harder time getting into raids as a tank. 
---
But you have basically confirmed what I was expecting. For raiding it's a choice between fury or resto, and I'll pick healing over DPS any time :)
---
Another point for druid!
---
I just go into the file and launch "WowB" and it goes straight to the WoW login screen.
---
That's funny, then in the other thread someone tells me the point of fucking stress test is not staying on the login screen and crashing up servers. Make up your minds people finally.
---
Still, what does it have to do with that people get called morons for literally only saying they can't login?
---
Hello staysafe?
---
Keep banging at it! Happened to me four times, now watching the intro movie finally!
---
Just got in! Try now!
---
I know you're salty and I understand why. But they said summer, and its being released during summer. Summer does not mean your specific vacation time. I wish the would have released it around the time my local monsoon starts, but yoi cant have everything
---
U have a grace period to log back on zzzZzz
---
Still the case for you guys? I thought I had some settings fucked up, so tried to reinstall.
---
They can handle it, they just disagree with it.
---
Finally got in for the first time just now
---
"up to level 5" meaning possibly level 1 because you can't even log in. "UP TO..."
---
can confirm, im in boys
---
I made a topic about this on the forums. Maybe post there to explain your situation? https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/stress-test-main-cities-bugged-layers/180481
---
My main question is if main cities have their own layer and we will see phasing walking in and out of them on launch.
---
That's pretty cool
---
Or not. 
---
Can we seriously stop this shit? 
---
You want buffs to the game, and balance, and tweaks, retail is there for that. 
---
What part of ‚Äúauthentic vanilla experience‚Äù do you people *NOT* get?
---
Still playable for 24 hours
---
Streamers should not be the center of attentiwrong on from a dev perspective. It's wrong and make the normal player base feel like the are fck all.
---
Definitely if it's a boy, for that Big Dick Energy
---
Good job, that's all they needed.
---
entitled idiot.
---
Haha I agree with you, I had access but never made it past the realm selection screen. I'm still happy to have had a chance but! Looking forward to August :)
---
I just don‚Äôt understand how a third person mmo would even work in VR.
---
Oh god dammit I literally just gave up and got in bed lol 
---
Enjoy!
---
Summer implies vacation time, not ‚Äúwe‚Äôll just say we‚Äôre releasing in summer so people can expect to play non stop, and therefore generate hype‚Äù. I actually wish they‚Äôd make level 1-20 (for example) available this summer holiday.
---
I probably have put sprinklers in quotes, as there are other methods. But they have something to deal with it.
---
So far, the stress test is the funnest thing I've done in WoW since probably mid-ICC in Wrath nearly a decade ago.  
---
C'thun? Ragnaros? Onyxia? GM running around as a huge human?  
---
So fun. SO fun.
---
Streamers gonna stream. Blizzard took back control with the raid bosses at the end. Pretty sure they got what they wanted. Not a big deal.
---
It's because these fucking streamers get privileges over normal players that are just bullshit. The biggest advocates for WoW Classic weren't the streamers, yet they get in immediately while normal people wait in the queue only to be kicked out.
---
What does Shroud have to do with anything. He plays WoW.
---
I might try out wow classic is it out and how hard is it for a new player?
---
I mean it's not exactly like the Bill Murray story, he could have just taken screenshots and you would've believed him right away.
---
I finally made it in. My guess is the server is simply full, there is just no UI element that tells us that specially, instead we get "Unable to create character" and "World server is down" when really the server is just at capacity.
---
It actually worked to reinstall, might be a coinsidence tho.
---
Just wait till it actually releases. Then you will see what disaster every single WoW related boards will look like. If blizzard allows the community to have ANY say on this game's future, its over.
---
those are the same game, one is remastered. classic and retail are not the same game.
---
Twisting Nether represent
---
It's caused by new monitors and FoV settings
---
Lol this guy thinks you'll be able to play on August 27th. Just kidding just kidding
---
(Not really)
---
Tinfoil hat, troll, delusional? I have a hard time understanding most posts on this sub nowadays...
---
You can do naxx fine with a normal amount of consumables, it takes far less time than 30 hours to finance them ( more like 3 hours)  and by the time people get to naxx they are experienced raiders and often already have a decent supply in reserve.   Going absolute nuts on them is for most people / guilds only done when they hit a new troublesome boss or in the server first race at the very start
---
Yeah sitting mashing accept for 3 hrs straight was not the best way to spend my night. Never got in just the same disconnect over and over.
---
There has been so much twich talk on the beta so far but I think it will calm down on release. At least I hope so. Had to have  people explain monkas and pegas to me when running rfc.
---
The great thing about RP realms is that the player skill level skews a bit lower, so if you're halfway decent, it's easy to find a raid spot. That and the fact that these raids are absolute jokes mechanic wise compared to modern WoW or FFXIV.
---
Kind of funky to ride the coat tails of something you wanted to fail for money.
---
Yeah we had patchwork on my layer and then onyxia rag and one other
---
Didn't he have an in-game race with Asmongold? Meanwhile, other people can't get past the character creation screen. I completely understand why people would be frustrated when hit with "That's what you were meant to be testing!"
---
How dare someone be happy or excited what a fuckin NERD
---
Its just you, there is a video of a guy who tests stuff and compares values of wow, he recorded the times he needed to get from A to B on a specific route, it was roughly the same +-1 second or less.
---
He explained that its because of 16:9 view compared to old 4:3 and in general some improvements to make characters look more smooth while moving which might make you think its faster.
---
But its not.
---
No, i didnt say i enjoyed BfA.
---
I also didnt mention that the size of the portion of the playerbase that buy black market gold matters.
---
Buying tokens for gold has 0 negative impact on the economy or your experience of the game.
---
Selling tokens for gold has 0 negative impact on the economy or your experience of the game.
---
All of this because the people who buy tokens for money and sell for gold already buy gold from gold sellers. And the people who would buy tokens from other players for gold would otherwise just be sitting on the gold doing nothing with it - so in either case you wont experience any difference.
---
The overall amount of gold available between all players on the server will still always be the same. The price of items will stay the same (except maybe the absolute rarest items, they would increase in price). The only difference is that some people would be able to pay for their game time with gold.
---
I dont prefer a random draw. Since I didnt get in I enjoy watching the streams. I wouldnt enjoy reading posts on Reddit. The sub is more toxic than Twitch chat and that is saying something.
---
That's what a stress test is testing bro
---
Honestly, that seems highly likely. I don't even dislike Asmongold from the videos I've seen. But if an organized raid of pvpers were going after him and his zerg, how could you not want in on that pvp? That just sounds fun
---
On Stormreaver Alliance my experience was that it started out DM very early, but quickly moved to VC.  Once groups started wiping like crazy at the boat, and groups were just looking for a few to finish off VC, it ended up being called VC by default.
---
-
---
A lot of people mention Dire Maul as having separate parts, but it was never really a consideration for me or people I knew.  If someone was LFM DM, they we were damn we going to do the entire thing because it sucked getting over there.
---
I'm able to log back into the character that entered orgimmar now... looks like it's fixed
---
The difficulty in vanilla was way ramped up, at least compared to when I played wotlk, because it was impossible to have relevant and good gear.
---
In vanilla I gave up on my warrior in stranglethorn vale somewhere in the 40s I think. I couldn't get the whirlwind axe because the quest was brutally hard and I didn't really have anyone to help. It became so difficult to level and was so gruelling. If I accidently aggroed a second mob I was toast.
---
And I had the max appropriate first aid, tanked instances (which wasn't that difficult), did professions, and used the auction house frequently. Although tanking wasn't difficult, finding a group was. It took hours to put together a 5 man group using LFG, and another half an hour at least for everyone to get to the entrance. If you were lucky you could get portals, but a lot of the time that wasn't possible. 
---
Vanilla was difficult for all the wrong reasons, not because you had to use your skills well or something. By wotlk, all these terrible issues were fixed and the game felt easier. But really it was just a much more streamlined and playable game. In vanilla you would find cloth gear with strength etc, none of it was itemized correctly. This increased the difficulty obviously but, again, for the wrong reasons. By wotlk you received decent, well itemized gear for your class from quests and didn't have to wear weird strength/stamina cloth gear as a warrior anymore.
---
The things that made vanilla more difficult were NOT fun imo. I raided ICC in wotlk, I've beaten dark souls, I'm fine with challenges. Those types of difficulty are fun because you need to git gud, learn your skills/class and you get to see improvement. But that's not how vanilla was at all. We'll see how it goes...
---
[Mirror!](https://doa.cloud/s/cYW9s4dZQKcSboL) 
---
It was. The stress test server will be up for, I think, another 20 hours
---
Its because of streamers dude /s
---
They could have been more upfront and honest. The email was bait unless the second statement is true then I hope the subsequent waves of stress tests go smoother.
---
Either way the realm is up now, go make your toon and level it to 5 in 35 minutes lol.
---
I would say wotlk was pretty damn good too.
---
Was about to go to bed and I'm in-who needs sleep anyway lol
---
Every comment here is so min-maxy. I just wanted to put in my two bits as a casual player in vanilla, playing warlock, mage, and warrior. Warlock was by far my favorite!!! Leveling and sometimes tanking 5 man dungeons with my pet was great fun, as were battlegrounds. If you spend a lot of time soloing content, then playing a warlock offers a ton of opportunity for that. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be over represented, there are enough downsides ( mobility, hit rating) that a lot of those with an interest in playing casters will choose mage instead.
---
So you're not a fan of sarcasm at all? Because I seriously hope you didn't take anything he said seriously.
---
World of Warcraft is a Feeling
---
Specifically, the feeling of not having sex.
---
I feel like this community should be happy about this but like 90% is actually hating on streamers.
---
I thought it meant cleavage as in melee cleave.
---
I must be getting old faster than I thought...
---
You missed 3 hours of spamming accept on a dc char creation screen wondering what you're doing with your life.
---
Did someone say....
---
It's a small world after all
---
Most people also confuse everyone being clueless noobs with vanilla being "difficult."
---
"get ready for a classic summer" is pretty slang and ambiguous
---
To those gettting triggered by world first: It is obviously a joke. When Classic goes live you will see many more of these posts.
---
Literally just jealousy.
---
I will have his babies
---
Exactly what your invite was. 
---
Basically the Stress Test invite was only a ticket onto a traffic jam on highway while those with the actual Beta access were in the fast lane. Some were lucky to get through, most were not but the aim wasn't to play, it was to push the server load and break it if possible.
---
I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre thinking this trough.if he gets a beta key, there won‚Äôt be any awesome drawings anymore.
---
So after some testing I can confirm its 100% the wand killing an enemy causing my game to crash.
---
Vanilla wow is so much more than the "difficulty."
---
It's the pride that you had for yourself, your guild, and your faction. It was the networking and sense of community that we had, the adventures we had with other people. It was the real sense of accomplishment when you hit that next level, when you finally saved up enough gold to buy your mount at 40. All of the congratulations you got when you hit 60, and that badass feeling of getting your epic mount. It was a happy feeling you got inside when you said "ding!" For many it was the game that shaped their outlook and opinion on currently released games. For some it was a chance to be somebody, because there were nobody in there real life. 
---
It sounds stupid and cliche, but my brother and I were raised in a broken home, we bonded over this game through vanilla, taking turns every hour and wishing we could just play together at the same time. I can say with confidence that we would not be as close as we are now without it.
---
Go ahead and downvote me, talk all the shit you want, I'm just happy I get to play vanilla with my brother.
---
Right, I mean, what the fuck is a ‚Äúpoggers‚Äù?
---
Was so ready to believe. So ready to RAGE!
---
I understand people shitting on streamer culture as it's quickly reaching jonestown cult levels of ignorance, but if people are shitting on it just because they are jealous of streamers having priority access then that's just kinda retarded. Of course blizz wants streamers to have priority access. What better way to stoke interest in the game?
---
Waste of a invite lul.
---
Love the dedication
---
No doubt. I'm actually really impressed by the way Blizzard handled this. It feels like the old team is back.
---
Sadly there is a little thing called sleep if you have to work the next day. It sounded like a really fun time. :(
---
True, he wasn't the brightest bulb, so I wouldn't put it past him if he had no idea how to do that. He used to stack spirit because he said it made his energy as a rogue regen faster - simpler times they were
---
And the third definition: connotative. This is what he's arguing in favor of, saying most people use this one. And I wouldn't disagree, people usually use the connotative definition of just about every single word.
---
you're home.
---
Muh toxicity
---
You should really try out poe. It's honestly such a good game. Get a grip on how things work and then in 2 weeks start playing the new season which makes things even better!
---
I think it's amusing that streamers were running races, devs were spawning in raid bosses, and everyone was having a blast playing to level 5 like the invitation email told them to, but if anyone complains about missing out on the fun, they get hit with "You don't know what a stress test is!"
---
I said hundredS. With an S. In one layer alone. The login queues were in the thousands. Why is it so hard to believe? It really is not an exaggeration.
---
He can play fine off stream you bungoloid
---
Couldn't stay awake. Probably got about 15 attempts in becore sleep took me.
---
lol don't be so sour... thru thos streamers 60,000+ "normal player base" got to experience the stress test vicariously thru them.
---
No, they're saying streamers had priority so that they were more likely to get in than all those other people who managed to make it through.
---
The same could be said for /r/wow
---
How does it refute the idea that streamers were given priority?
---
I'm not expecting anyone to belive me; 
---
But I played Vanilla wow long before TBC came out, and vividly remember a GM summoning worldbosses "Swimming" around in the air long before flying mounts existed, and summoning worldbosses into Goldshire.
---
It looks like they brought some of the old GM's back, and it is glorious.
---
I won't be respeccing due to the cost.
---
50g Cap with a monthly decay of 5, 10 gold min.
---
It's basically college debt if you are not going to be farming, so you better make a farming char if you intend to swap a lot or you team up with someone (If you are a healer) to run dungeons.
---
you do know you can zoom into first person, right?
---
And if you think people won't find them anyway, streaming or not, you're stupider than you're already acting.
---
I would never recommend any kind of change that would change the spirit of the game such as balance/class changes, LF dungeon/raid, arenas, etc. 
---
Let's say you were to isolate one mob - Hogger. 
---
In Vanilla, let's say that the average player died to Hogger 2 times while soloing prior to completion. By comparison, let's say that the average player in Classic died to Hogger 0.5 times while soloing prior to completion. In that case, was the Vanilla experience really recreated? Technically, yes. But the spirit of the game (sense of difficulty and subsequent feeling of accomplishment) has changed, due to the decrease in "difficulty" relative to average player skill and knowledge/accessibility. 
---
So, while generally true, I don't think "recreating the Vanilla experience" and tweaking HP/damage values are inherently antagonistic.
---
Stop guessing. My account was created at EU vanilla launch and I dont really stream. Still got in.
---
imagine trying to kill rag as a fire mage, noob.
---
God damn that's clever
---
classic wow has found their mod ash
---
That's not what people were told in the invitation emails.
---
Anathaema is shadow, this is Benediction.
---
I bet they're gonna make layers really small because of this
---
OOOOOOOOoooooooooo
---
Damn dude. I'd been looking around this sub and was amazed at just how viciously angry and ready to believe conspiracies people are, without really being to understand why, but I think you've encapsulated the nature of it perfectly. Everything lines up.
---
The scary part is that in theory, the Classic Wow community should on average skew older (and hopefully more mature?) than most gaming communities, but I haven't followed the community for any game in years which comes across this badly. Deeply sad.
---
But on the positive side, in the beta itself people have been super friendly, so it's at least not representative of those in game right now.
---
You can log in now if you haven‚Äôt tried

---
Don't Make Me Get My Main
---
People expected to log in and play to level 5 like the invitation email told them to. Streamers were doing races and other gimmicks, and devs were spawning in raid bosses, so let's not pretend it was a strictly-business, no-fun-allowed stress test and that nobody missed out on a special event.
---
I've just done the same, didn't die either!
---
Ah, cause that happened with Soda when he plays off stream. Oh wait, no. He said it was fine.
---
Bungoloid.
---
Same for the first day of the Beta and during Asmons DM run.
---
Get this man a job at Blizzard.
---
I agree with you, and I do think that most people will enjoy the game regardless. But I think part of that sense of accomplishment comes from the "difficulty" of the game. After the times you had to rez at the graveyard or run your way back to the instance, finally being able to get over that hump is really satisfying. 
---
So I personally don't think we should completely ignore the difference in difficulty with regards to the average situation of today's player.
---
Wtf..I'm some random from downunder and I got in everytime..stfu with the salt
---
OK guess I should join in then. GODDAMNIT BLIZZ! I waited a DECADE for this shit game and you FUCKED US. I literally payed my money for a chance at the beta, that you clearly stated would not guarantee me entry, AND I DIDNT GET IT! And now there‚Äôs this shit show of a mini beta that sucks, and I STILL didn‚Äôt get in. Obligatory fuck streamers.
---
Just stop trolling... No changes -&gt; as few changes as possible to recreate a very close and authentic experience to bring 2005 back for people who liked it the most.
---
If you want changes, play retail. It is stupid to even think about "Hey MC Bosses were too simple, can blizzard just add some extra and new abilities to make the content fresh and exciting for vanilla players again? I think this would capture the spirit of NOCHANGES really good!"
---
At this point its trolling, you arent recreating something if you change it here and there for your liking, you either get it how it was or aint getting it at all.
---
Congrats dude!
---
More like 5% which is sizable enough to break the economy.
---
Doesn't bother me, I'll be the 5%
---
What do you expect. Most of the player base here didn't grow up with streamers, and normally just ignore the fact that streamers exist. 
---
Now every streamer, that we previously didn't know existed gets preferential treatment and gets to play the beta while we are not.
---
I got in straight away bro..
---
At the end of the day its a stress test where you can only get to level 5. Who fucking cares if you get access or not. You can still play when it releases.
---
And anyone in the I subed just to get a chance at beta access club is fucking retarded. Paying hard earned cash just for a slim chance is a rediculous and irresponsible use of money unless your filthy rich.
---
You really can‚Äôt understand why? The ‚Äúauthentic vanilla experience‚Äù is a core philosophy of this sub.
---
Streamers didn‚Äôt exist back then. One player did not command a legion of followers, very artificially affecting the world. It‚Äôs really no surprise why people want nothing to do with them
---
I‚Äôm not aloneü§ù
---
Can anyone confirm if there was sharding going on? And if so, how much sharding were they doing? Not even sure if this is the proper topic to ask this question. Seen posts of people actually leveling. So...I dunno. Just curious
---
It hasn‚Äôt even been 2 years since the announcement... and the game isn‚Äôt out yet... so again 3 years for this... what?
---
DIE ASMON!!!!
---
Even more will never play the game. Glad we‚Äôre all out here with these hot takes.
---
there might have been an update or something not sure. haven't had issues on my end
---
August is late summer, according to the calender the world's uses.
---
What you ment to say was, you thought they ment during the summer holidays. Which was never the case.
---
I hope twitch dies and streamers go away. Fuck all of this shit.
---
Sure, but not getting in also isn't the end of the world. The whole point was to stress test, and part of that means some people wouldn't be able to get in.
---
This is correct. It was the same during the Blizzcon demo.

This accounts take place after BC. I believe there were no death knights during BC.
---
Damn you must really suck then
---
Jk lol don't hate me
---
Lol the ending.
---
Thanks for the reply, I feel more calm about my choice!
---
I prefer the looks of Female Trolls over Undead Females. And I really like Beserking as a CD.
---
Though if the Ivory Raptor isn't obtainable at all I might just consider Undead. The other Troll epic mounts are just so ugly. :(
---
More shitty wojak edits, straight from /v/. The death of fucking comedy.
---
I got to level five. However there is a quest from the dwarf starting area where you deliver a mug of hot brew but you get 16 silver for the turn in and 27 silver for the return quest which seems super bugged on how much you should get.
---
Like you thought you could actually play and level during a STRESS TEST? Lol
---
im a socially adjusted millennial with a job so i dont watch streams, but hardcore anti-streamer posts stink of thinly veiled jealousy. let the zoomers enjoy themselves who gives a shit?
---
also, lol @ "buttfuck your servers economy". what does that even mean? no one even knows how the IRL economy works so the idea that we understand the cause-effect of economics in an unregulated virtual world is nonsense.
---
I used /who 17-22 and just asked people near westfall. Did this for all dungeons tbh.
---
Scrubs... Dm is dire maul
---
This.
---
I really hope they throw in a few Oceanic/AU servers at launch so I don't have to deal with any streaming BS (and actually have a ping time under 500ms)
---
They just have to crank it up. What's the point of a stress test if they were sure it was gonna be smooth?
---
The email was not bait, fucking moron. It's a STRESS TEST you fucking inbred twat.
---
This is cringe
---
I was Marlee, the healer. You're welcome!!! I had a ton of fun.
---
Sarcasm?
---
I can relate with everything you stated here, but I think this goes back to the "well Classic wasn't difficult, it was just time consuming, getting 40 people together, etc." argument. 
---
While true, I don't think we should ignore the differences in today's player that will ultimately impact the average player experience. I copied my other comment below as an example. I just have the concern that Classic may not be able to replicate the satisfaction of achievement that was there during Vanilla due without tweaking the difficulty of the game. 
---
In Vanilla, let's say that the average player died to Hogger 2 times while soloing prior to completion. By comparison, let's say that the average player in Classic died to Hogger 0.5 times while soloing prior to completion. In that case, was the Vanilla experience really recreated? Technically, yes. But the spirit of the game (sense of difficulty and subsequent feeling of accomplishment) has changed, due to the decrease in "difficulty" relative to average player skill and knowledge/accessibility.
---
&gt; There's literally a thousand people sitting in Northshire Abbey alone and people are still convinced YeAh BuT sTrEaMeRs GeT PrIoRiTy as if there's a grand conspiracy against us normies.
---
This argument keeps coming up, and I don't understand why people think it refutes the idea that streamers had priority logins or the fact that all the major streamers managed to get in and play. All it means is some other people managed to get through regardless.
---
You're the real mvp
---
2019 and you still out here recording audio with a potato. This ain‚Äôt it.
---
Stockades should have been the RFC equivalent :(
---
 Why? why in the fucking world would streamers have login priority on a stress test realm where the idea is to simulate launch day. It does not make any fucking sense.
---
Now if you guys were saying streamers got priority access on the first day of beta maybe you might have some sort of theory going except for the fact other players were on at the same time and they were nobodies, hell you guys probably did bitch about that what the fuck am I thinking.
---
When I played vanilla in early 05 every one called it VC. At least they did on wisperwind. Not sure about other servers but that is my experience and I know it‚Äôs not everyone‚Äôs.
---
You've eliminated the possibility of streamers having preferential treatment while everyone else around them won a dice toss in your mind.  
---
Streamers made up 0.1% of the population (top streamers even less) on the stress test, yet *all* of them got in the first time without a hitch, relogged instantly through multiple disconnects, and created new characters instantly. I'm not saying the players around them weren't given this special access as well, but they weren't hand selected for it like all of the popular names were. Even if they were hand selected, how do you propose this choice was made? Probably if they had prior beta access (which every big streamer was given by hand). Otherwise it was log-in attempt speed (first come first serve) or pure RNG for the hundreds of randoms.
---
He's definitely an arpg streamer.  You really do notice a difference in mannerisms between different types of streamers just because they've been doing specific things for many hours.
---
I also liked Quinn's PoE streams if only for the spergage.
---
I didn't know who he was until, 2-3 months ago and I've been sub/playing since beta in 2004. I'm 36 so maybe that why but anyway, I like the sarcasm he bring but the knowledge of the game is what intrigued me. During xmog comp he just look at the model of an item and can literally say when and who drop it. I still need to go to wowhead to find my way ogrimmar.
---
And I dont think his ego is the cause of his attitude, he's just like that and used to love that game. Also take 2 min to read chat, 95% of the comment are retarded, tell me you wouldn't be sarcastic too?
---
OP reminds me of the Navy Seal Copypasta
---
Same on wisperwind
---
[Mirror!](https://doa.cloud/s/3WYn9c9HecYnSEs) 
---
"soon buddy"
---
&gt;we never even had a chance. not a single chance at all.
---
I saw plenty of europeans in the stress test. The time of day might've also played a part in the fact that you didn't see many EU players report getting in on the foruns.
---
I dont know why but actually start to fall asleep while reading it. Terribly long and boring I think. Probabaly just full of stuff we have already read in the sub multiple times.
---
He is quite charismatic. I can¬¥t watch most streamers more than a hour before I get kind of annoyed but this never happens with him.
---
If I would play retail and had to respec for 60.000 Gold every time I want to change my talents I would as well just level up another character rather than farming all that gold every time (dont know if on retail 60k even is a lot or not... probably just peanuts...)
---
The people who get beta access would be in favour of a completely random draw, everyone else will complain that Blizzard should have used a choosing method more favourable to them. You can't win, but making sure our favorite streamers get access is nice consolation for those of us unlucky enough not to get beta access.
---
A small percentage of players in a mad rush of thousands who always got in to record their streams. You're bolstering the argument, and you don't even realize it.
---
On my resto druid I would be travel form and mounting around collecting herbs. I'd be alch too, making consumables for myself or selling them. That was my gold driver.
---
Naw 2h fury will get close to 100% uptime with his regular rot and the occasional hamstring spam if flurry drops off or the debuff happens to fall off before a new proc.
---
so if normal everyday players were in, and it just so happened asmongold got in, then he must have a login priority? Then why the fuck are you hoes acting like some bitches.
---
Happy cake day.
---
All you have to know is you will be in the same layer with teh same group.
---
As soon as you know that, you know you can abuse it. 
---
How SWTOR handled it was just sending everyone to the leader's instance.
---
Random, leader, whatever. Abusable
---
I think I left for work 5 minutes before OP got in. Damn it, at least I did the sensible thing and didn't stay up late to test the login screen lol.
---
My layer had rag spawn
---
Thanks, this took some serious Paint skills.
---
beautiful
---
50g isn‚Äôt a lot IF you spend time farming. Back in vanilla I‚Äôd dedicate 1 evening (4-5hrs) just farming and could make 400-500g. This more than covered any respeccing and funding new alts.
---
It‚Äôs not difficult to earn gold if you work at it. Herbing/alchemy makes good gold for healers, if they spend the time farming the mats. 
---
Skinning can make good gold, farming rugged leather kits for Darkmoon faire hand ins. The yetis in winterspring are great for this. Also burning stepps dragonkin for black dragon scales for FR gear.
---
Mining makes great gold for folk leveling eng for pvp.
---
Enchanting is great too, folk always need weapons and gear enchanted, doing DM tribute runs can make 100-150g an hour. 
---
It all comes down to whether you have the gold. If not, then you need to pick a spec and stick with it.
---
Yes. Hes sharing his response. It was so good that he made a post about his own response to a sub. Lol
---
Imagine imagining so much
---
I don‚Äôt understand how you‚Äôve been able to be on that long
---
why not just make small servers and merge them if the pop drops?
---
i dont want 10k people on my server aanyways.
---
Omar did not kill anyone. The gravity did. Check the logs for proof.
---
I'm not suggesting new abilities mechanics/etc. and I would never recommend any kind of change that would change the spirit of the game such as balance/class changes, LF dungeon/raid, arenas, etc.
---
I've made my point in other comments so I feel like a broken record but you can't ignore the differences in player experience. The average time to 60 will be significantly lower than it was. The average number of PvE deaths on the way to 60 will be significantly lower than what it was. 
---
This, in my opinion, will alter the overall player feeling and sense of accomplishment in the game. Making tweaks to Dmg/HP of mobs would not change the way the game is played while recreating a player experience much closer to that of Vanilla.
---
My man. Take this upvote
---
I am the mentioned huntard lel
---
I'm flattered my dude. I don't really post like ever but I'd totally post about how you sat and indulged my info oversharing problem for hours. I really appreciate having someone to talk to. Thank you
---
That's still very much summer. In fact, August is where it's most summer in many of the northern region regions.
---
They don't want a million posts about the same thing so they delete
---
I feel like I really got lost on a tangent and didn't explain my point very well.
---
What I was trying to say is that what made vanilla difficult were things outside of the players control (terribly rolled gear etc).
---
If they really keep classic the same, I think it will provide the same experience as before. Leveling in vanilla was brutal at times, and increased knowledge or skill won't change that. This is because the difficulty in leveling had little to do with making sure your rotations were perfect (I.e. skill) and more to do with your terrible gear and inability to easily find groups. That is, increasing your skill did basically nothing to make the leveling easier. 
---
If they keep everything the same, people will go through a slow and painful levelling process. What I'm saying is that the issue you presented, the increased knowledge and skill of a player, won't actually make the game easier, because the difficulty never came from the lack of skill to begin with. 
---
I could see your point being convincing regarding raids, but not levelling.
---
Icefoe - when you gonna get better gear my dude, you‚Äôve been in the beta for a while now!
---
What a legend. And the troll he's a legend too
---
Care to tell me when I said that doing so is edgy?
---
Mental gymnastics normally disappear when you mature mentally, so hopefully you will soon.
---
I only got to make 1 silver in the goldshire inn taking my clothes off
---
You don't understand the argument.
---
Yeah, I got in a little bit ago now. Still odd.
---
This isn‚Äôt new. We‚Äôve known about this for quite a while now.
---
Folks like you are bolstering the argument, and you don't realize it. If there is a mad rush of thousands, yet 20 major streamers all managed to get in, that strongly suggests they were given login priority.
---
It's not, I was in the UBRS run and know the people, but that's cool to pull the "fake" card
---
I'm not really arguing that the game was difficult, difficult is a relative term. It's not very difficult for an NBA player to dunk but for a normal person it's near impossible. More importantly, the difficulty with respect to player ability has changed.
---
You haven‚Äôt seen enough asmongold videos
---
Gods, I hate these 4chan garbage memes. They're always so mean-spirited.
---
I hate snowflakes. Shoveling sucks
---
That statement in itself is an insult to the original world....of warcraft
---
This tickles something deep, deep in my memory bank, but I 80% feel like it didn't exist or was only around for a very short time. Definitely not by 1.12 though.
---
Is he stupid? Without Private Servers we would have never gotten Classic.
---
Same bro, single dad her. My three year old daughter lives with me though. Be interested in a guild like this.
---
Is this some kind of joke? They still play on EU servers
---
It means literally ,,excited as fuck"
---
i pressed 1 and melee'd him down np
---
I think just buy the base game but an EU copy?
---
How about no.
---
No changes. Retail is that way -&gt;
---
You idea is terrible and goes against the entire basis of ‚Äúauthentic vanilla experience, warts and all‚Äù.
---
You should feel bad.
---
Summer ends the first of September. So they were cutting it pretty close.
---
It totally does lol I promise I'm alive. As alive as one can be, I think I'm breathing?
---
Where do you think most memes originate from?
---
Workingasintended
---
I'll take a guess and say this is your first, this is normal mode. I managed to commit a bit of time playing with my first. Then the second came, difficulty went to heroic, managing the "keep the wife and kids happy and get play time" mechanic is a bitch. But congrats none the less!
---
I never heard him brag and demean others  seriously. He does it to esfand sarcastically and his other friends. 
---
I don't agree with this "streamer privilege" why single him out of the hundreds maybe thousands of none streamers who got in.  What's their priviledge ?!
---
Sure they hand picked a few streamers. What's wrong with that ?! They want to give a few influencers in the game scene to show others the game. They know that not everysingle person will get into the beta, so some players stream it...
---
There are players who got beta. And proceeded to bash the game and call it garbage after playing 10mins only... There is even a guy who  made a forum post in classic forums saying bfa is better and classic is ugly and stupid and he hates it. From playing it for 10 minutes. 
---
How's he better than esfand or guzu or asmon ?! They played through the cap and kept doing stuff and experimenting. I say they earned their beta access. They played the game and reported bugs and gave feedback 
---
Hell I remember I started watching asmongold on first day he got beta access. And he said he was *against classic* but he played the game and with 48 hours he loved it . He started praising the project and said he likes classic much more   than bfa.  And that was a gamble by blizzard. He was against it and he's a big streamer. If he hated classic and just kept cussing the game and making fun of it with his 70k viewers it'd so so much damage to the project. 
---
So again. This isn't priviledge. Is your *jelousy* that he got in and you didn't .
---
Suck it up  and wait like the rest of us.
---
I was contesting the notion that the pve realm had ‚Äúhardly anyone‚Äù on it. I was not asserting that the two realms had equal population.
---
Have you ever thought that maybe they give out 20k invites to active classic accounts, 10k tbc accounts, some wrath/cata/mop, and to accounts newer than legion. All with different levels of playtime, progression etc. 
---
And then they add some streamers.
---
So we are not losing beta spots, we just gain the ability to watch it.
---
I do realize that vanilla came out 15 years ago. 
---
But this isn't vanilla. This is Classic, just different enough to me to be its own thing, to me. Getting world-first (unofficial) achievements will still be a race people do.
---
I‚Äôm...what? We know how the IRL economy works. Wow server economy is much, much simpler than that
---
How long did that take? From the start of beta until now?
---
You are treated like a level 60 where the XP is converted to Silver/Gold afaik.
---
This is a absolutely dumb argument. People die less because they're more skilled. The same people that died 2 times the first time around ended up being part of the .5 people dying the 2nd time around. You can't change the game to adjust for player skill being higher. Its vanilla and that's how it should be, not artificially inflated when that just wasn't what it was.
---
Oceanic servers didn't exist for some time. And tbh most oce servers are full of some pretty annoying/toxic people
---
This is stress test for you, not for servers
---
&gt; Gods, I hate *these* 4chan garbage memes. They're always so mean-spirited.
---
It‚Äôs because they lowered the level cap to 5. In the eyes of the questing system your ‚Äúmax level‚Äù so you get the same amount of gold/silver you would as a level 60.
---
Teamspeak
---
Ventrilo
---
Wow passionate
---
I guess that part is just speculation on my part, that the average player will die less in Classic as opposed to Vanilla (to PvE causes at least). Most people probably agree with me there though. 
---
If you saw Asmon's Deadmines run the other day, they weren't outleveling the instance and were still able to clear fairly easily. This is a bit different than the average Vanilla experience where most groups probably wiped at least once or twice.
---
"Every server is going to be a streamer server"
---
Yeah most of the "drama" was from all the streamers getting in.  They seemed disproportionately able to get into the server compared to everyone else.  I don't really care if their accounts are flagged for priority.  They are advertising the product for free essentially.  However, I'm not going to no-life WoW.  When classic servers are live and there's solid evidence they do get an advantage I'd say it's unfair. I could understand a dedicated player being upset about it.
---
I just hope stress test realm bug reports actually make it to Blizz as well so I am not testing in vain.
---
Almost as much as a bot as asmongold.
---
About 2 hours, the hard part is just getting out of the valley at getting level 5 due to so much traffic with the quests. Once you are out and head to the village, it took like 20-25 minutes to peacefully level up fishing.
---
Kinda like people trying to keep weed illegal. Then eventually weed is legalized and they go prancing around all like "wow isn't this weed thing great??" And try to make money off of it. 
---
That progress and thing that made a lot of people happy happened in spite of them. So they should f off
---
Nah.
---
Nope. I'm the hunter. Can send timestamped convos with my name (Grimalkin), but if you're so set on believing that something nice can't happen, then I'm not going to waste my time lol
---
There are several guilds for working adults. So I assume there will be one, if not you can just make 'Parents of Azeroth' and bark in IronForge for members.
---
Nobody cares.
---
Blizzard tried to crash their servers and succeeded.
---
That's all this was.
---
Omar is wow classics mod ash? I'm ok with this
---
This whole sub has been toxic about every single thing under the sun since Beta came out
---
Push ups, Sit ups, and PLENTY of juice.
---
I couldnt even imagine
---
Yes it is? If it's not then you have no point. If it isnt what you are saying it has nothing to do with the stress test.  
---
People were watching streamers while trying to get to play. That just makes it sad.
---
I will refuse to join any group that call it VC on principle. It is DM.
---
maybe because it reads as a legit post if you don't happen to see 2 words????? maybe that's why
---
Ew
---
I thought it was funny but mostly because asmongold is drawn so well
---
Nahh.
---
First few levels of leatherworking can also be achieved by making light leather out of ruined leather scraps.

Handy lists tho - will be useful to refer to them to figure out what the current most economical thing to make at whatever level you're at currently.

It was a pretty cool moment.
---
Who is omar?
---
EU here. Stayed up like a monkey to help with the stress test. Ended up sleeping past 04:00 am. 
---
Got to test the login servers. Yes they don't work.
---
Kind of rude to put the stress test that late for us to begin with and double rude to not take into account the demand for login in general. Small Indy company...
---
I think I'm good, mate.
---
That's awesome
---
How about this? You have an opinion. You receive new information. You reconsider your opinion and change it. Every functioning person is or should be operating on a similar kevel.
---
your opinion as a cata player is not relevant.
---
Funny I‚Äôm reading this. I‚Äôm actually in the delivery room right now, my gf is giving birth to my child. She is high on epidural so I‚Äôm sitting here on reddit. Needless to say I missed the stress
---
Nice! I seem to remember it taking much longer to level fishing, but that might be due to having started wow during BC and the cap being higher
---
MacBook, good joke
---
I don¬¥t know her or her haters much and watched the videos as objective as possible. She repeated things from the "wall of no" like nostalgia, not enough demand and that crap but I didn¬¥t get the impression that this was her personal opinion. It sounded like the usual crap where "content maker" skim the internet for information to make a video. At the end she even said she would play it and provided a link for the Nostalrius petition. 
---
So the initial video wasn¬¥t that bad but after she got brigaded for it she took it personally and every video after that were "rants" about Vanilla. And now she is in cover up mode and denies any involvement with classic negativity. She is not really the smartest tool considering how the internet works and she has been around long enough apparently.
---
What world are you crazies from? Summer implies summer. The actual summer is mid June-mid September but if you want to go by what people mean by summer it would be June-August. It falls in there and they never promised anybody they‚Äôd be playing during their summer vacations.
---
Nope. Layers will be removed by Phase 2 at the latest. They will not have layers once the world bosses go live. Layering is to help with zone population, not server population.
---
I figured most people here could read
---
Right, but what Blizzard told people in the invitation email was to log in and "play up to level 5." They also said the servers would be available for play until tomorrow. This wasn't presented as a no-nonsense test where you'd potentially be staring at a login screen for two hours. It doesn't help that, while this was going on, ~content creators~ were streaming themselves having all sorts of fun.
---
Just hop into a private server and test all you want. It's pretty much the same deal mate.
---
On Suramar my mum got halfway through the Scepter line, but another guild (No Quarter) fucked over the entire server by opening the gates when everyone was asleep.
---
I've been binging asmongolds classic streams normally not really watching him.  
---
At first glance he can seem offensive, but 90% of it is just sarcasm in order to get a reaction out of chat, he is actually quite charismatic and plays the role of streamer incredibly well.  
---
Hes not afraid of any roles, he'll act the pro but is also fine with being the self deprecating noob when things go wrong, and generally what impressed me most is that throughout 8 to 10 hour streams his energy barely seems to deteriorate.  
---
Its quite impressive to me.  
---
I think what i appreciate most is how hes able to drag you along in his passion if you let him, this man is passionate about one thing, world of warcraft, and people with true passion can sell you anything, even if you're not into it.
---
Your new god.
---
That last bit was 100% why I loved twinking. Like I said, my group had a crazy lively 39 scene. A lot of games basically became 'who can keep the regular alive the longest'. At least 60-70% of us were twinks, abd l and we only wanted twink blood. The normies actually got ignored a lot of the time. 
---
There were assholes though, and we learned their names quick. I remember one 39 warrior that would GY camp relentlessly, only looking for regulars to kill. He was on our side (allies). but once the horde sniffed him out they'd kill him and camp our GY JUST for him. We'd sit around and watch em do it too, /laugh-ing the whole time. Everyone else got a free pass to get out of the GY.
---
Good fucking times.
---
There's speculation that some private servers have dungeon mobs tuned a bit higher than on Vanilla. For the players who enjoy their dungeon runs more on said private server, would you go tell them "retail is that way"? Doesn't really make sense. Those players are clearly chasing the Vanilla "experience", rather than chasing the specific health and damage values themselves.

I knew this was going to be the first comment. I‚Äôm at work, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm using the MacBook ;)

Yeah it was cool. It was like, 14 years ago I was sitting there watching my mum play while he was playing, then skip to the present and he and I meet through a guild getting ready for the re-launch of the same game. haha
---
There are A LOT of gaps on classic.wowhead. I've been using Vanilla-twinhead though doesn't matter cause I can't get in to anything
---
Salty crybabies are salty. To most adults summer means nothing except maybe a time they‚Äôd rather spend outside instead of gaming. I‚Äôd rather they wait as long as needed to release a solid product that‚Äôs as true to vanilla as possible with as few as possible newly created bugs
---
Give up! Just don't do it! You're dreams are impossible.
---
WOOP WOOP. 39 warrs are fucking dope.
---
The Regulators on Suramar
---
You think people are going to read that entire post word-for-word if it doesn't pertain to them????? Why would a non-streamer read all the criteria for a streamer being eligible for the beta?
---
Whoa, my character (Goetia) is in this screenshot. I ran right by and didn't even notice :(.
---
Invitation email:
---
Its because you capped the lvl so reward theat it like you were 60 converting xp to gold/silver
---
Maybe you're right, but I do think the level of satisfaction gained from completing these objectives will be a bit less than it once was. 
---
A lot of players have enjoyed playing on private servers where apparently some dungeon mobs are overtuned in comparison with the Beta, pushing them to use tactics such as CC that were always meant to be a Vanilla mechanic, and in general, creating a feeling of accomplishment on par with the Vanilla experience. I don't really see the problem in that.
---
summer ends 21-22 of semptember, on the equinox
---
Yes he is lol
---
You basically only respec if you really really want that pvp spec. It‚Äôs perfectly fine farming as a resto shaman or holy paladin or whatever,  other classes basically never have to respec unless you‚Äôre switching weapons as a rogue or going fire as a Mage or something
---
That only bolsters the argument that they got login priority.
---
Battle shout does not seem to produce any threat, regardless how many people are buffed. It should produce 50 threat per party member buffed according to blizzard's own documentation.
---
The streamers are real fans too, most of the big ones have played since vanilla.
---
Noh, nowytendz
---
He was named "Syrehue" and he was fierce!! I only died of my healer died or they were +5 people on me lol.
---
Nope priests can even solo dire maul trash at lvl 55
---
The amount of people considering September to be summer is not high. Just fyi
---
I mean if u are hearing this for the first time from this guy then ur already dogshit and just play what u want cuz it won‚Äôt matter anyways
---
Yikes, who hurt you sweetie?
---
Blizzard wrote otherwise in the email:
---
He‚Äôs using a Mac. What do you expect?
---
That‚Äôs a really terrible argument. We‚Äôve established private servers had it wrong. If there are players that wish to play the more difficult experience, they are more than welcome to do that on their private servers. 
---
I‚Äôm playing Classic to have a *faithful, and authentic Blizzard experience*.
---

The actual end of summer is sept 22. They are well within the bounds of calendar summer. Nothing ever (in the northern hemisphere) is going to call August 27 fall, nor is any company going to use what random dates people make up for seasons instead of the official dates.
---
Leveling with rogue is always fairly easy since you dont hane mana issues and you can stealth past annoying mobs.
---
If you are playing with friends any class will do :)
---
Not too sure about what specc to recommend for leveling to be honest. Im sure there are different opinions out there.
---
 If youre looking for a good time in classic, make your own specc! Its part of the fun
---
Omar be with you.

People were specifically told by Blizzard to log in and play up to level 5. They also said they'd be able to continue playing on the stress test realm until tomorrow.
---
I got to see the character creation layer a couple times
---
Yea, and WoW meant Waiting on Warhammer for like a year before it came out, and now nobody even remembers the game.
---
Look, i'm gonna play classic wow, and i don't play retail anymore. That doesn't mean you don't have to take a games popularity at the very early stages with a grain of salt.
---
The whole point of stress test is the make sure it works for launch.
---
Try doing a search of her tweets for "Vanilla" or "Classic" comes up with nothing because she deleted all her tweets to do with it LUL

Well Asmon did say he's doing a 130 hour stream to 60 so not going to be easy to do this offstream.

Pretty sure plenty do and plenty are.

Again, they do, but more importantly than what random people do, 100% of the time a professional company will use the calendar seasons when not using fiscal quarters

That's a warning telling you that copy pasting macros (particularly that contain /script or /run) from the internet is not always a good ideea without proofreading them. You can delete gold with scripts.

For exameple: You find someone advertising a macro that auto-targets stealthed characters, you copy it in, ignore the warning and click it, and what it actually does is delete 100g from your bags.
---
What made it so successful was that it was easy but time consuming. Anybody could make it through the game if they just put in the hours. In retail everyone can't complete all the content because at some point it becomes too difficult so people don't even try and just stick to LFR.

Your ID was given an access pass by chance, and the streamers were given this pass by hand. That's the definition of preferential treatment.  
---
It's like Blizzard releases a new awesome item with a 1% drop chance from the newest boss, yet Soda, Asmon, Esfand, Staysafe, Venruki, and others all loot this item on their first boss kill. You're saying you and hundreds of other randoms got this drop out of the tens of thousands that attempted it, so everyone complaining that *all* the top streamers got it should just stop being salty.
---
competition "sucked"   
---
oh my lord he's gonna be in for a rude surprise
---
If every launch has been a failure so far, then it doesn't really matter if classic launch will go smoothly or not will it? Should be stable enough after a week or two I guess
---
Think a little before writing angry-posts on Reddit. Nobody said *only* streamers got in. It's the fact they were a small percentage of the mad rush to get in, yet they all eventually made it into the game. It's statistically unlikely unless there was a priority system.
---
A guy whose viewer count is diminishing so he's jumped on the bandwagon.

 Good question. In general, higher level = more options.
---
As more spells and talents become available, the range of viable specs and classes broadens. At 19, IIRC, you basically have rogues and hunters (maybe locks?). I can't speak for 29, but at 39 you have fire/frost mages, locks, warrs, prot pallies, feral druids, enh/resto shams, holy/shad priests, and of course rogues and hunters, all of which are viable. (Where I didn't specify a spec, I couldn't remember). The gear options also open up a lot. You have some legendary shit like Pendulum of Doom and Staff of Jordan, plus a lot of really specific, hard to find green +damage gear (though i guess the latter is true at any bracket.) In general, it becomes a lot more dynamic I think. Also theres some pride in the higher investment barrier for higher level twinks. When I bought my Staff of Jordan back in the day, it cost me almost as much as my epic flying (shitty server). A pendulum of doom could easily go for 2500+ gold, but that's because they nerfed the drop rate in BC.
---
The point is that ~content creators~ always eventually got in whether they encountered any initial issues or not. As defenders are fond of pointing out, they're a small percentage of the playerbase, yet they all got in.
---
Much better on horde than Alliance due to Windfury.
---
Best QoL feature
---
More like what you prefer. Beta runs a lot better than classic on private servers.
---
Lol well you‚Äôve clearly made up your mind but I bet this won‚Äôt be the last time this topic comes up because it‚Äôs the type of change, imo, that preserves the vanilla experience more than ruins it. I‚Äôll add that it personally doesn‚Äôt bother me either way since I‚Äôll be playing for PvP. Just something I‚Äôve been thinking about.

I had no real expectations, but boy am I still disappointed

I mean it's also not unreasonable to treat everyone fairly.
---
My Bootse only died if someone looked at him the wrong way. To be fair though, if he poly'd you, that was it. Glass cannon all day every day.
---
It can be a little depressing to pay respecs. Depends on how often of course... But it does suck to let's say want to pvp as non prot, then have to tank in an hour so you need to Respec, then your raid gets cancelled... So you are either sticking prot for a bit, or paying yet again...  But you can farm it. It just gets boring farming to play the spec you want.
---
Never underestimate people who want to play video games
---
Cross realm? You don't understand how layering works do you?
---
Small Indy company
---
Yes, most setups have 4-5 priests, resulting in 8 fort buffs + ~4 groups that need spirit. So you would do 2 fort groups and 1 spirit group on average.
---
Well, Asmon currently is a hardcore wow gamer by any standard. They pretty much all have BiS gear for their level due to farming for it, and they're all communicating, and have done this run multiple times. I can't imagine a more extreme outlier for comparing to the average wow player in vanilla or in classic.
---
People who have generally played a ton of Wow will definitely die less than I did the first time I played vanilla. I'd die less this time too. I agree with you in some sense. It's just that the deaths I'll avoid this time are the ones which were genuinely dumb. Like fucking up the elevator timing in undercity (how was this even a thing).
---
But I swear to God if my luck is the same and if I played a warrior again I'd die about the same amount levelling as in vanilla. There are only so many skills, the game is not very complex outside of PvP and raiding. The skill cap in levelling is so low, you have to push like 5 buttons. People will know which talent builds are best, so probably many deaths will be spared because people will likely not trust their gut and make terrible builds. But overall, for solo players who have never played before, I'll bet it's a very similar experience to my first run in Vanilla. That is, gruelling af. Lol.
---
I actually agree with you on the game design of retail but the Vanilla content, in a way, will be even easier this time due to the increases in player ability/knowledge/accessibility. 
---
I‚Äôve brought up a lot of examples in this thread but imagine if the average player clears deadmines with no issue. It makes the experience a bit less rewarding than it was when groups would commonly wipe at least once or twice.
---

"Get ready for a Classic summer"

Yes but the problem it solves is servers being ghost towns after a month or two so it's worth it.

Thread is a bit old, but some discussion [about it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/8xzdzj/question_about_playing_on_eu_servers_on_a_us/).
---
Nah chances are they probably really enjoy the game and were just wrong about it.
---
Soda already said he was going to join the opposite faction if they choose a pvp server
---
You don't have to be a fan, if it's not your thing that's okay. In my opinion he's really good at manipulating the hype of the viewers, he knows how to react to make chat explode in Pogs or LULs depending on the situation. Can be pretty funny at times but he's more abrasive than someone like Esfand, who generally just runs a chill stream.
---
&gt; I would never recommend any kind of change that would change the spirit of the game such as balance
---
Yes you do, you recommend to "balance" the enemies stats to the modern skilllevel. I am sorry to say but if Ragnaros has a single HP more or less - as stupid as it sounds - it would no longer be classic, it would be "retail improved hardmode classic with increased stats and tougher enemies".
---
Also for people who never experienced classic at all you are taking their chance to get the original experience and you just sell them a advanced hardmode version of the game.
---
It would not recreate a closer experience to vanilla, it would create a much more difficult version of vanilla which is not the goal.
---
The idea is to copy vanilla, not to recreate vanillas content in a challenging new way.
---
We had Onyxia for wotlk, we had molten core as an event dungeon... which were just the same bosses with much higher stats. And no they didnt felt any vanilla like despite being just the same enemies with higher stats. Everything felt different, and if you change the stats of vanilla they will feel different as well.
---
Yup.
---
Check my two recent posts to see who Omar really is. Kap
---
Think a little before posting. All the major streamers got in despite the mad rush of thousands. That's improbable unless they were given priority.
---
It's not necessarily just a question of server stability, but also that at launch the entire population will be in the starting zones. It'd be unplayable. So are server queues a better answer, or layering? I'd have to go with the latter, at least you can start playing.
---
Short of some crazy event (player driven or not), that will never happen again (and if it did, you'd probably prefer to see everyone, so layering should be off).
---
Even if the game is wildly popular a year in, there won't be nonstop character creation and leveling, making progress difficult. That's why layering is at least in theory just a launch thing.
---
I guess it remains to be seen how many players will be in a layer (in practice, will you be able to progress? Or will it still be horrible until some people get past it).
---
What percentage of randoms do you think were able to get in? (My guess is less than 5%) Now what percentage of streamers above a certain viewercount do you think were able to get in? (My guess is close to 100%)
---
Anyone is entitled to change their mind based on new information and experiences but some act like their former opinions never existed which is a failure of integrity.
---
Is there a longer clip? Where does it show Omar did it? Or more of his reaction.
---
He's wishing death on others over a video game, he deserves to be shit on.
---
&gt; If you are trying to go for a 'fast levelup' - running any of these instances would be a waste of time
---
One complete run with quests you absolutely should do even in fast levelup. The "main completion quest" usually gives a huge upgrade for every class. And its nice XP too, when you combine the quest xp together.
---
Im not sure how old you are or if you maybe work in the public sector. But summer does not imply vacation time for everyone.
---
Steamwheedle Cartel, checking in.
---
I think you're forgetting one important factor though; individual player skill.
---
When you look at some of the streamers that have played the game for up to 14 years it may look easy but for a lot of players it won't be.
---
Sure for some of us it'll be easy but then again it got easy pretty fast back in 2005 too once you had figured out how the game worked.

I dont know you're being downvoted so much because you're wrong as much as you seem like a jerk the way you're saying it. People have a right to feel upset and disappointed when things dont live up to their expectations. Their frustrations are no less valid than your opinion they shouldn't be complaining. I hope you see the irony of your post and the hundred other people that posted almost this exact sentiment.
---
Anyone else find it cringey when people use quotation marks like this guy? What exactly is the point?
---
Blizzard don't need layering. But layering makes it cheaper to run servers and we all know that's what Blizzard about these days.
---
Out of the loop what happened?
---
Beta folder for beta people. You got the issue right there.
---
Only alpha males are allowed in to mate with the females. You betas are left out.
---
Thanks mate should have been clear to me that hes classic dev
---
&gt; Why? why in the fucking world would streamers have login priority on a stress test realm where the idea is to simulate launch day. It does not make any fucking sense.
---
Are you dense or something? Streamers are hype-generators for WoW Classic, and many have had professional relationships with Blizzard.
---
&gt; Now if you guys were saying streamers got priority access on the first day of beta maybe you might have some sort of theory going except for the fact other players were on at the same time and they were nobodies, hell you guys probably did bitch about that what the fuck am I thinking.
---
You still don't get it. If all the major streamers manage to get in despite the mad rush of thousands of other players, then yes, it strongly suggests they're given priority because it's improbable otherwise.
---
You guys really need to ease up on the use of the words "proof" and "evidence", they're beginning to lose their meaning.
---
Why would they make multiple servers for everyone to play when the explicit purpose of this test was to put as many people as they could into one server to test layering.
---
When you go fishing, you're bound to catch something.
---
That was FFVII

Passionate is a very nice way to see that post lol.
---
I'm feeling a little embarrassed that I spent 5 hours sitting around waiting to play a 40 minute leveling demo
---
So your saying 1m people playing day 1 and we dont need layering
---
Thats not what Credit Score is about.
---
Besides civilized countries have a lot less interest than america has. Hou want to cap it at 17 currently for a credit card. Credit cards have 2% max where I am coming from
---
Look at credit sustems of other countries before you spew bullshit like that.
---
&gt;Everything about him is obnoxious.
---
Try Esfand, he's much more chill.
---
Define organized. If you mean raid vs raid, it happens daily (probably even several times each day on a high pop server). If you mean organized by pre-arranging it. That will not happen that often, but it will depend on the server. I guess it may be more of a roleplaying server thing. Most of your PvP encounters will be ganking or 1vs1.
---
I agree Asmon is an outlier so probably not the best representation. 
---
But I would actually argue that even a new player will have an easier time than they would back in 2004. Even these new players will be using guides, tuning into streams on twitch, and watching youtube vids. 
---
So even if you controlled the comparison to new players only, I think the experience will be altered.
---
Not going to lie this was really frustrating I stayed up past 2am and I couldn‚Äôt log in, not ONCE while I could see all the streamers getting on just fine .... I‚Äôm really disappointed i didn‚Äôt get to be a part of this!
---
I can't imagine what you must be going through.
---
Calling bullshit on the idea that people in the US don't use summer as June, July and August.  No one says September is summer.
---
Yeah now that I think about it , it was before 1.12 because there was no cross realm BG's yet i recall. But I swear it was a thing, I'm like 99% sure it was, even for a short time lol
---
Sure, but they still gave streamers passes while we had to wait in an endless queue/dc loop
---
I was never in the beta, but I was around way before 1.12...so possibly then?
---
O rly?
---
All you spergs are literally just proving people like her right lol. "There is a toxic vocal minority" OMG WHAT A FUCKING RETARDED BITCH, WHAT A PIECE OF SHIT!
---
The list is a tad wrong, there's a boe drop that gives 1 int 1 spirit (or Stam) but I can't find it on the database. I know this because I had it drop for me and a friend in the test. Wish I could remember the name.
---
I was ale to login today morning (EU), but had to go to work :(
---
I agree with you on that, but I think it's also true for all games, new or old. The internet 15 years ago was a different place. That being said, I spent a ton of time in 2004 using thottbot and looking at maps to figure out quests. I looked up talent builds, guides to complete class/profession quests, watched YouTube PvP videos.
---
I just think that raising the hp or damage of enemies doesn't really add much or remedy this issue. People were free to use external resources in 2004 and still are. If people want the most pure experience they can avoid all that, just like they could in 2004. But...noone will avoid those resources because the game was so painful without them. Blizz realized this and essentially integrated similar things into the game itself. I guess I just don't feel that raising the difficulty will combat this though. I wouldn't feel like raised difficulty would give me a more similar experience of vanilla. They're both going to suck in the same way as before lol.
---
Apparently you don‚Äôt understand what a stress test is. 
---
Hint: it‚Äôs in the name
---
Yes, player skill has increased, that's kind of my point. The average classic player will be more skilled than the average Vanilla player, thereby altering the player experience. 
---
I would actually argue that even a new player will have an easier time than they would back in 2004. Even these new players will be using guides, tuning into streams on twitch, and watching youtube vids.
---
thank god im eu, we have way less WoW streamers
---
Honestly I‚Äôm not mad nor surprised streamers and previous beta testers got priority on logging in and character creation. I am a little peeved that the rest of us were not told there was a priority. I stayed up til almost 2am because I wanted to help stress test and thought that because I could see others getting in game I could too. Would it have hurt to have given us the info that we were lower priority?

Quins opinion hasn't even changed, people are just taking a single tweet and misrepresenting it. Apparently this one tweet meant quin was never going to play classic and has been shitting on it for years. This has literally never been the case. This sub really gives classic a bad look. People currently playing it are having a great time, being really nice to each other and shit. While this sub is just trying to bring everyone down, really hope these fucks aren't gonna be like this when there entitled bratty selfs finally get into classic.

I created a character a half a dozen times but never got in, I like how all the streamers that were already playing the beta made it into the stress test for "testing".
---
Delete what nonsense?
---
You might like elemental shaman. Big crits, you can heal (and do any PvE content in your pvp spec), great utility, nice quality of life stuff with early ghost wolf speed and double hearth. Reincarnate is sweet too. There are certainly concerns with Mana, though. No caster but lock can sustainably chain cast without drinking in pvp (and then you're relying on heals)
---
Just keep in mind you won't be using WF yourself. Enhancement in general is pretty terrible.
---
I'm fairly certain that the only people who got in were the ones who already had beta before. Haven't read the account of a single person yet who did not have the beta but managed to get in anyways. I have the beta and managed to get in much easier than both asmon and soda, so I don't think there is any sort of streamer privelege except for them of course already having access to the beta.

If you look at private servers for example, a lot of the values have been at least slightly off, and it's being speculated that elite mob difficulty on these servers is overtuned. Yet, most of the people who have played on private servers have celebrated the "vanilla experience" of playing on them. 
---
So I don't think it's fair to say that these are not representative of Classic. Technically, certain dungeons can be more difficult on a private server than they were in vanilla due to increases to elite mob HP&amp;dmg, but difficulty is relative, so the overall gameplay and experience may still be preserved. 
---
To bring up another one of my examples in this thread, if the average group clears Deadmines without wiping, are we really re-creating the classic experience?
---
Its almost like a community has different people in it and not everyone is in a hivemind

It is the standard way of doing it in most of central and eastern Europe. see e.g. https://www.neogaf.com/threads/%C2%84european-countries-use-quotation-marks-differently.1213339/
---
So no, I don't find it cringey that basically someone comes from a different country to me
---
I agree with most of this and I can enjoy his stream quite often until that one friend of his chats with him, mconnel? I can't watch the stream at all when he's talking.
---
Yes! It‚Äôs on the way!
---
I tried for an hour and half before going to bed, but then being in the UK that 1:30am and I had work today
---
"what should I do, if I was a cheapskate on my server room and shit's on fire? #pleaseanswerfast"
---
I want this too, I'm tanking for a full group of friends and they want to do every dungeon in the game while leveling.
---
Yeah totally cheaper to design a brand new, never before implemented technology, than to just go with the easy &amp; quick sharding. When will the bitching about Blizzard's choices end?
---
I mean even if you're only going shadow for leveling or for 1 day for fun, undead is undoubtedly the choice.
---
Troll berserking is slightly better for strictly casting heals faster, but will of the forsaken is also useful in a lot of fear fights (dragons, etc).
---
Personally I would go undead even if I never planned to put a single point in shadow ever. Dev Plague is just really good and will of the forsaken is great even in strictly pve environments (which, lets be realistic, you're going to pvp at SOME time even if its not willingly).
---
Is this a troll post?
---
God damn stream sniping all the way from Tiristfall Glades. Sm shake my head h.
---
He message me and said it's awsome too
---
Ummm... and how do we know, this IS the one and only Omar?
---
Ah 10-15 minutes, nearly enough time to reorganize the bags in vanilla !
---
He almost had me.
---
LOGIN PRIORITY ON A STRESS TEST REALM MAKES NO SENSE. 
---
Hey look, another reddit retard. People were online minutes before streamers were on if the streamers had some sort of login prio they would have been the first ones in. gg u lose no re
---
LOGIN PRIORITY ON A STRESS TEST REALM MAKES NO SENSE. why would blizzard want to advertise how shitty their servers are going to be via streamers. By the way there were people streaming that didn't get in I guess they didn't get flagged right.
---
I mean, he literally said he's playing with warmode on retail when he's not streaming and he turns it off when he's streaming. Same could be applied to Classic.
---
You need to realize it's probably harder to gank him offstream and even then people targeting him probably care just about attention, which they won't get when they kill him offstream.
---
So I kinda agree with you, however with that being said I've noticed (especially during the last few months) that everyone is a streamsniper to Asmongold. I get it he's way more famous now than he was year or two ago, but he should realize it's not always a streamsniper. Even Forsen, who has the biggest streamsniper army on Twitch, isn't crying about it that much.
---
Many people on WoW forums from what I've noticed don't even watch Asmongold because they hate him for some reason.
---
You don't understand, then. As OceaN88 put it, unless you actually stress the server, it's a bad stress test. How do you figure the servers will be stressed enough unless it's put over max capacity?
---
I hope it calms down. I feel like an old and rigid man, refusing to see the overlap in users and recognize the twitch culture just because I don't belong to it.  
---
    
---
Of course I know what twitch is, but it's literally it's own little culture - and you might as well be speaking a gypsy moonlanguage, I don't understand the twitch emotes. Like what the fuck is a hyperthonk? And what does Kappa even mean, outside of being a brand of clothing and a japanese river monster, I don't get it D:  
---
Oooold, old and unwilling to keep up with the kids these days :p
---
Undead is not better for pvp when Troll racial is literally broken for pvp. What they say is not correct.
---
I don't agree that only post-Dire Maul matters, I always used DM for deadmines, because just changing a habit or a naming convention on a large scale just didn't happen. It did lead to some whispers and invites to wrong groups, but it was too late to change it then. And that's why I think DM is the original and organically formed abbreviation for Deadmines that people stuck with.
---
We don't need layering because neckbeards that hit 60 in 2 weeks will abuse the lotus spawns by layer hopping with their 5 other neckbeard friends that were lucky enough to get on different layers. While also not accidentally getting moved to another layer.
---
&gt;Anyone else find it cringey when people use quotation marks like this guy? What exactly is the point?
---
This is the most American comment I have ever seen.
---
You really shouldn‚Äôt level as prot in any circumstances. Warriors are perfectly capable of tanking endgame content without being prot, going prot just to tank leveling dungeons is nowhere near worth it and it doesn‚Äôt even mitigate much damage in the early levels
---
Did you have Classic WoW selected in the Blizzard account beta settings? It is a separate option to WoW retail and is not selected by default.
---
But i do understand. I was referencing that it cant fit so many in it
---
Lmao.
---
NOT THAT THE STRESS TEST WASNT BEING PERFORMED CORRECTLY.
---
Fucking. Retard.
---
You do realize by allowing streamers in and interacting with them they are reaching 100K people?
---
Imo it's worth it for Asmongold to get in so his experience and the whole hype can build up to 50K people, than mine or your measly ass.
---
The game will be our in August
---
Cdew and Venruki are extremely nice and funny lads enjoying the experience.
---
Part of my idea came from the speculation that some elite dungeon mobs were overtuned on private servers. Yet, people have celebrated them. Meanwhile, people watching streams have been suggesting that the elite mob damage is lower than it was, and it feels like they can pull too many mobs, tank with two handers, not have to CC, etc. without being punished for it. 
---
My intuition through all of this is that a bit of enemy mob tuning could improve the overall experience, but I could be wrong. Either way, I didn't expect to get a lot of traction in this thread. Just wanted to start the conversation, eat the downvotes, and see what people think.
---
Just looking for a discussion on the PVP state of Vanilla WoW. I am looking to go hard on PVP for Classic wow as I don't have interest in committing to a long term PVE raiding guild. Thanks for any info on this, as it will help me decide what class to play. I am hoping shadow priests are good, but not so sure about it.
---
But the 2 servers i played on always used VC after dire maul.
---
So. Ill never agree lol.
---
Twice the size of everyone else and was messing around also. I‚Äôve seen clips of him picking people up in the air and dropping to their death.  It‚Äôs a GM and who else would be named Omar on stress test event ?
---
GMs were clamped hard after TBC launch, partly because there was more they could break but mostly because Team 2 didn't want them breaking immersion... And the whole ticket queue thing.
---
This has never been about "cool GMs". Most don't even have access to classic, this is just developers and QA having fun.
---
Back in the day you might need to go into an instance or run some commands natively in the client, but it was increasingly rare and you had strict instructions not to be visible or known.
---
It was eased up a bit with better tools that let GMs do things safely like polymorph or spawn cakes, but it still just isn't the same job it used to be, mostly for the better.
---
As long as we know where the biggest streamers are, it's fine.
---
But if we don't, and we go there, make a home, start a guild etc.... Then we're in shit.
---
Time for a plan b smoothie!
---
Totally. Once we actually get a server list I have a feeling we'll see recruitment threads.
---
There's nothing odd. This can mean a milion things. Maybe there's a step where they do a "fake connect" for various reasons. Without seeing the codebase there's nothing special about this :)
---
If private servers on the brink of bankruptcy can handle 50k+ people on at launch I‚Äôm sure blizzards hardware would manage
---
nice WoD garrisons all over again, hope it's fixed in the beta unlike WoD
---
I miss this tv show...
---
Why though? Those streamers facilitate community interaction and world PVP.
---
Queue &gt; "There are no realms currently available." &gt; queue, rinse and repeat.
---
What part of "stress test" went over your head?
---
It's good to know I'll be able to get to at least one of the cool exploration spots!
---
Never
---
You can do that :) I'm not a warrior player myself, so I don't know how to set the talents, but there's a 2H fury specc that works fine in PvE, and I know my friend played it using swords, which in combination with windfury resulted in some seriously insane bursts, 
---
While it might not be as good as dual wielding, there's arguably a benefit in having someone in the require that does great DPS, but doesn't need the same weapons as the rest of the warriors.
---
One of the systems they‚Äôre testing is the authentication servers.
---
But humans get sword spec. It‚Äôs about as viable as the 2H sword is good
---
No feeling pretty good LOL playing on online server, nice one kid
---
To think that they arent watching the log in server while basically doing a mini-launch is fucking retarded what are you on about
---
If you look at my replies in this thread you'll see it's not a troll post at all. I see that most people disagree with me but it was something I was thinking about the last couple of days.
---
I like Asmongold. Sometimes on retail I go to his runs. On Classic I probably won‚Äôt see him though since he mentioned he‚Äôs doing a pvp server. My friends all hate pvp so we‚Äôll be going on a pve server.
---
I too would love to go blind
---
Or at least it used to be...
---
I love how this is stylised to look like assmoregold lol
---
And I can call bullshit on you all day long too lol. I USUALLY use calendar dates in reference to seasons. Sometimes it‚Äôs a vague June-August time frame but after k-12 it is never ever used to refer to ‚Äúschools out time‚Äù
---
Discussed this yesterday.
---
Tldr of that is yes vanilla can be divided to the cold data and the experience. To get the same game data wise is easy, just replicate. To get the same game experience wise would require re-thinking and working the game, in the most extreme case leading to a whole new game (wow2?)
---
This subject must be the wow version of the Ship of Theseus (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus)
---
It's still going to be in the game, you're still going to have to use these tactics. Catering to false #'s to create artificial difficulty that wasn't actually present in vanilla is unnecessary
---
People who hate keep classic shouldn‚Äôt play classic
---
**Ship of Theseus**
---
In the metaphysics of identity, the ship of Theseus is a thought experiment that raises the question of whether an object that has had all of its components replaced remains fundamentally the same object.

You are really missing the big picture though, none of us want it to be harder. When we were kids, the game was super hard and most of us barely got to MC or a little further.
---
If you look at a lot of posts, it's people like myself saying "in vanilla i never cleared MC, my goal is to clear BWL or Naxx!". So keep the difficulty the same, we have gotten better and now its time to take a second shot at WoW.....maybe this time slaying that fucking Lich who haunted us when we were kids!
---
Right, it currently seems like the streamers might stay on the same server, which I hope they do honestly. I'd make sure to check up on what servers they will be playing on before you choose a world.
---
I agree with you. If you look at the effort required to make a post its an incredible return. I was looking from the company net worth perspective. 1 million is peanuts for them. But yeah, easy money for 5 min of work
---
No. The gear is absolutely beautiful
---
back when epics were actually epic and not a 5 man dungeon reward
---
All your points are true, except the last... anyone can call himself Omar if he wants and the name has not been given. 
---
But now I also see that he is bigger than all the others... shame on me!
---
yea im gonna go post on my tumblr about it
---
We do. ;)
---
Haha, I guess so since for me too it boils down to I used this because everyone else used it so it's the right one.
---
I thought it seemed high as well, even for being max level and getting the exp conversion.  twinstar/twinhead and wowhead both show only a few silver for the max level quest, but I'm not sure if those values are correct either.
---
to be fair it seemed that you could only create a character if you already had beta access
---
"imagine" is a zoomer meme
---
Not saying they don‚Äôt get preferential treatment, because chances are they do, but relogging without a queue when you were already in the game and disconnected is a basic feature they had for a long time. You have a certain amount of time where your spot is reserved after disconnecting
---
Is that the one who shall not be named?
---
This might be the most extreme case of hyperbole in history
---
No but I find the word ‚Äúcringey‚Äù to be very cringey.
---
It‚Äôs not expecting to much hoping to log in just the once lol. The server was offline for over an hour and the 2 hours for me
---
Yes and it‚Äôs really not as good as you think
---
Its a bit of nitpicking but blizz is recreating vanilla, not the experience. The experience is almost impossible to recreate whereas copy&amp;paste the data as was is much easier.
---
Or ..... some people value their time.?
---
Do you think they just magically knows how much it can handle? Do you think they know how many of the people they invited will actually try to join? You have a brain, use it. And don't talk about topics where you're clearly clueless.
---
Pretty much. He wants to compensate all the knowledge of 14 years with higher hp. That will work /s
---
Kinda ironic the picture for WoW says BFA
---
SL lock is literally SSS Warriors are SS and so are hpals
---
Well apart from Soul link warlocks üôà
---
I remember calling it VC on the horde side, in order to not confuse it with Dire Maul
---
Yep... The classic wow community is the biggest turn off from the game for me. This subreddit isn't to bad; The official forums are atrocious, although I haven't checked them in a few months.
---
The only saving grace is that the entitled idiots here that cry about everything are the minority and will be drowned out by normal players on release. At least I hope.
---
To anyone I upset with this post. Remember that Blizzard doesn't owe you anything.
---
How do you train enchanting and get the mats to make it? New to vanilla and wow in general so clueless about a lot of these things
---
Is shadow priest rated that high? I‚Äôve always been a fan of shadow as a spec.
---
Upvoted. I haven't seen many people test like this and appreciate that an old PC can be used for kids or significant others that might want to try but not actually play as much as some of us more keen players.
---
ayy thats me casting the frostbolt right next to you there
---
Not sure if they are going to that in classic, but some kinda of memorial in retail will be nice, I just don't see them adding anything like that to Classic. Quest is too much I think.
---
Stress testing alliance were doing a raid on Valley of Trials and somehow ended up on the Classic BetaPVP server, fought with level 14s on that server. This kind of CRZ should be impossible with layering, right?
---
They know you‚Äôre obvious going to play classic. They wanna see if the BfA kids will
---
If we talk about being shadow..
---
It will be 1000 mana cost + 3 min cooldown + easily dispellable.
---
VS spammable 30mana hex which gives 20% healing reduction.
---
You get nice burst damage but there is chance people can still heal your target + 3 min is meh.
---
Personally I will hex as healer will be my choice which I use offensive to cripple team while healing my other team. If I get low hp I get 30% speed to help me survive.
---
Stay classy
---
I know blizzard hasent been the greatest lately but the fact they even thought about making a classic server after the "you think you want it but you dont "
---
Is amazing so im happy with what we got (its going to be better then bfa even if it isnt perfect)
---
Shaman having windfury alone outclasses everything else the Druid puts on the table. They‚Äôre also way better in raids
---
I wanted to write my own reply, but this is just to spot on. People getting upset because they think blizzard owes them a classic nugget leveling experience on a stress test server. No you are not here to level and play the beta. You are here to see server loads.
---
Man this shit is getting my so hyped for classic my dick is hard.  It's all starting to come back to me!  
---
On a side note i'm slowly dying inside watching streamers play beta, it's like they got me hooked on heroin and made me quit cold turkey.
---
You don‚Äôt and other people do, imagine that
---
Dude if people are gonna come into this comment section and be pissed about this, they should at least have read the post. But people would rather get pissed at Blizz and streamers than read the full post I guess.
---
You clearly don't know the streamer. If you know Quin you know he is always memeing and baiting normies and this happened... But this sub is great for laughing!
---
Shadow Priests are strong in 1v1 and pretty good in group PVP... assuming the others don't have a dispeller.
---
i don't agree with that list for many of the specs. Holy Paladin is B, but Priest is A?  Arms is B? even in a BG environment, Holy Paladin should be S, Arms should be, at least, A, if not S.
---
Was VC on Bloodscalp US when I was there in vanilla, I remember because I had to ask what VC was lol
---
People generally don't RP on RP servers
---
Basically had to grind to farm over 100 linen to learn tailoring to get to lvl 30 and create green robes and enchant them till I hit lvl 10 in enchanting and be able to create a wand.
---
Hobgoblins appeared in one of the Warcraft RPG sourcebooks, which were the best thing Warcraft lore ever had. Which is probably why they were declared non-canon, can't have quality in our retcon orgy.
---
A good wa of finding out if something was vanilla is to go to its Wiki article, click on History and scroll down to at least 2006.
---
Interesting, I found it on via rankedboost no idea how creditable they are. Thank you for the info!
---
This might be a semi-repost (sorry!), as I uploaded one of these images a few hours ago, but I thought some people might enjoy this in its entirety.
---
You can definitely go 2h as a warrior with fury slam build, you might not top dps but you will for sure be viable. Also it's more beneficial as horde due to windfury.
---
How was the stress test I imagine it went fairly well considering the amount of people there and it didn't crash
---
Bro, it"s litterly a beta client. If you dislike them that much just unsub
---
Don't hurt me, I can't speak common well. I'm a native Orchis.
---
My guess is, having lots of people in the login queue and seeing how the server reacts was part of the stresstest.
---
Only need 10 enchanting to make the wand?
---
I stayed up until like 4am despite me having to get up and do stuff four hours later
---
I acually hope all the streamers will play on 1 server. That way i can pick another one, and on the plus side im from EU so not that many streamers anyway.
---
Is there going to be anything somewhere online that consolidates all Classic WoW streamers and lists what servers they‚Äôre planning to play on, after server names are announced?
---
It‚Äôs surely in the Classic community‚Äôs, and Blizzard‚Äôs, best interest.
---
wtf are you on about lmbo
---
My 4am pain still no login was so you guys could have s better launch experience I done what was required of me
---
Nope. Never been a part of a beta, or tried a private server.
---
Retail WoW, Moonguard US.  The GM's used to be alot more present, and much more laid back.
---
Yes, and a lesser magic essence.
---
Is this a troll? Warriors B tier for BGs? Rogues S tier? This couldn't be any more wrong.
---
Put him in the tower in Quelthalas
---
When you're not one of the GMs affected by the mass layoffs
---
Theres no reason for them to have it. What are the chances every single person who watches asmon doesn't know about wow classic? There is no additonal reach that giving him beta provides. Soda could be arguable because he has been variety for a while, but still... They didn't even want to make classic, now they want to maximize exposure by giving people privilege ? iddkkk
---
I have no idea. It‚Äôs not my list lol. I found it via ranked boost, I didn‚Äôt play much in vanilla so have no idea where classes stand.
---
Here is a very good post on the matter: https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17624563195
---
Blizzard has the required resources to run multiple, big servers. More now than ever. Layering exist to my understanding for two main reasons: 
---
To spread the load across multiple servers and in case one layer goes down that wont affect the entire server. Now like I said, Blizzard have all the resources they need and with good server architecture and proper stress testing that shouldn't even be a problem.
---
Didn‚Äôt they already make a food type item called the total biscuit of something or something?
---
I was less than 10 infront of Esfand and got in seconds before him and was able to make my character and ended up doing the run with them as well.  I don't even have regular beta access and the account I'm using was made in like 2012.  Streamers weren't the only ones to get in, there was literally thousands that also got in.
---
Vegeta would be proud.
---
That multiboxer sure is lucky to get all his accounts into the stress test.
---
No disrespect to Hayven and what he did for the wow community as a whole, which was a lot, but Classic WoW isn't a memorial to the dead. It's a recreation of an MMO. Let's keep it that way.
---
No its not. Streamers generate a huge advertisement platform for their game. And do you really think 50 streamers getting a fast pass is gonna weigh down your chances? Fuck off. Queue was already 3000 in first minute. 50 Streamers is like 1,7%. Get over yourself
---
So you would say you're completely *OK-Sign*?
---
We know so much more about the game now, you don't really need to respec more than a few times, and if you want 100% perfect builds for PvP &amp; PvE then you'll get used to farming 50g every week.
---
If you want PvP rankings for Battlegrounds then you want a premade guide.  
---
This list is terrible is so many ways for BGs.  Rogues are completely shit in group PvP and so are Shadow Priests.  Putting restro Druid in a low tier for any BG is silly, they cap and spin flags better than anyone. 
---
 This whole list is a mess and looks like someone put a lot of dueling bias in it.  Being strong is a duel doesn't make you good in groups, period.
---
Yeah i see why raising difficulty could be celebrated. Again, those groups in dungeons have a good holy trinity happening. When I played vanilla it was like... Hopefully we can find a warrior with a shield. But whoever could actually just show up would tank, sometimes with a 2h, or a druid who has no idea how to tank. Sometimes it was a shaman with a shield lol. 
---
With increased experience and planning, classic may be more of a breeze. But that's the case when you rolled a second or third toon in vanilla too.
---
It‚Äôs really inaccurate
---
He's not asking why people watch streams.  He's asking why you watching Asmongold in particular.
---
Actually I am no #nochanges fanatic...
---
But I mean that exactly such rewards have lost nothing in the actual game. A small plaque maybe, but a statue? don't you think that's a bit exaggerated?
---
Also, private servers have been doing this shit in their moms basements running on donations only pretty much, ND crashed like maybe 3 times in its first 24 hours
---
It was also clearly stated to be a stress test though. Which implies the potential of not being able to play at all and was the main reason I did not bother to try logging in.
---
Alright thanks. I‚Äôll probably take the post down, looks silly now.
---
Ok bootlicker calm down and let people vent.
---
An hour before I fell asleep getting stuck at retrieving realm list. Hope I helped on some small way.
---
The lettering is good, but the lines above and under it are a little wonky and have different thicknes.
---
Overal 5/7
---
not really, shadow is really really good at smashing bad players but it isn't fantastic against people who are competent, fortunately the overwhelming majority are bad players
---
Have you heard of the high elves?
---
No changes.
---
Thank you for the info! The website did looks sketchy as hell lol.
---
You took something that was a joke. And went too fucking far. You are a social moron.
---
I KNOW EXACTLY what happened and how it works. Lmfao
---
&gt; I like Asmongold.
---
Why?  Dude's boring AF.
---
EU has never had testservers in their area in any blizzard game why would classic be any different. We enjoy the 120-150ping at all times. Im also EU for reference and I see no problem that an American based company base their testservers in their own region, wtf are u on about.
---
Does [this](http://puu.sh/Dw3Xu/be493add14.png) mean i also have regular beta access? Because i only see the stress test server...
---
It's how the internet works, personally I enjoy it, good entertainment, banter etc. 
---
You can go in every gaming sub and they will say *we're the most toxic*. But it's human nature, it's just on the internet we don't have to sugarcoat bullshit like in real life.
---
I'll say what I said in another thread about this exact topic: Classic WoW isn't a memorial to the dead. It's a recreation of an MMO. Let's keep it that way.
---
TotalBiscuit was a great content creator, so feel free to honor him in other ways. Just don't mess with Classic.
---
What a garbage person. Just stay in your lane and enjoy it
---
Wow, brilliant. I could already tell that was asmongold before I even saw the title and sub
---
In the original release, it was possible, but a pretty dangerous run. Can't answer for 1.12 officially, though.
---
In awe at the size of this lad
---
Fake. Warriors never have full rage.
---
 thats really true as well lol
---
it says it's for battlegrounds specifically, but, it's probably based off private servers, most likely, considering they put Subtly Rogue at #1 when Assassination or Combat were much more common, as far as i remember. most Rogues just put 21 in Subtly for Preparation.
---
Once you get his dry sense of humor he becomes funny. His frustration is mostly an act. My first impression of him was negative, but he's grown on me.
---
Anyone who participates in this streamer culture shit is that tidepod kid.  You know who you are.
---
This level of trash meme from toxicsensual?
---
You are the mvp.
---
&gt; 90% of it is just sarcasm in order to get a reaction out of chat,
---
This is exactly why people hate him. If you watch him for more than 30 seconds you'll realize it's easy to see he's actually pretty self conscious, and trying to laugh it off. 
---
Asmon is a good dude.
---
Apparently calling people names is a joke today. Huh.
---
I'm in the exact same boat.
---
They are technicly releasing in summer but they also said "get ready for a classic summer".
---
Releasing 3 weeks before the end of a 18 week period wont make it a classic summer. It will make it a regular summer with a classic end.
---
I always thought someone had to actually have acquired the item on your server in order for it to cache and made linkable. If what you said is true that's absolute craziness.
---
Barrens chat was just Twitch chat before it was created.
---
I'm not sure you understand what you are replying to. They want as much people as possible on the same server. They don't want two servers.  
---
Reasons they have this stress test:  
---
* To see how much load the server can take
---
NOT reasons they have this stress test:  
---
* For you to enjoy yourself playing the WoW Beta
---
Your experience is not important in the slightest. If it's 02:00 for you, then why the hell would you stay up for it? It's not a demo. It's not for your enjoyment. You're not entitled to anything at all.
---
He's joking, get a sense of humor
---
This is stress test, not beta

Gar'Thok in Razor Hill won't give my Orc Warrior the quest "From the Wreckage". My previous Orc Shaman got it not problem a few days (at level 6 or 7, probably 7 since I spent too long in the starving cave).
---
I figured maybe the requirements might be just nonsensical, so leveled him from 6 to 7 and it's still not being offered. 
---
WowHead classic says the requirement is level 3 so there shouldn't be an issue. I can't think of what I might be missing otherwise.

---
Yes Shadow Priest is def top tier idk what the other dude is talking about. Especially at skill cap.
---
How are you still under the impression that this stress test is there for you to enjoy the game?
---
So funny seeing all this when your name is actually Omar.
---
LMAO. Why do people hate him so much?
---
Every time he talks chat is like "SHUT THE FUCK UP MCCUCK!"
---
I like him. He calls Asmon on his bs.

I can only speak for the original EU servers, but 90% of them were Alliance heavy in some form - from 55/45 split right up to some 70/30's. But it's worth noting that most of them were PvE with only a couple of RP (the heaviest towards Alliance) and PvP (generally most balanced).
---
He's only getting that treatment because he made the video admitting he was wrong, it wasn't just nostalgia and that classic was an objectively good game, etc.
---
Because a lot of this community lives in their own bubble and wow is the only game they've ever played. They probably find terms like noob offensive since they are still living in the dark ages.

&gt;he's really good at manipulating the hype of the viewers, he knows how to react to make chat explode in Pogs or LULs depending on the situation
---
Well said man.
---
I don't think hex stacks with ms. So in a group pvp setting you're always gonna have ms or if you don't, at least wound poison.
---
And there's way more uses for DP besides just pvp damage. Leveling speed, surviving a bad pull in a 5man not having to waste time healing yourself, etc. It's not all about endgame pvp.
---
But sounds like you kinda made your decision before this thread anyways. My philosophy is play what makes you happy. I was just thinking if you're equally happy playing both, I think UD is the better choice by far.
---
If you like troll go for it.
---
Yeah for starters there‚Äôs no point in sorting by spec since half the pvp specs out there are gonna be pure hybrid
---
Jesus Christ. I turned it off after it became about gamer drama. Am I supposed to know these people she's getting upset about? 
---
Some guy she doesn't like is apparently the representation of all the toxic parts of the Classic community, and Blizzard making Classic at all is a representation of giving toxic people (her words) like him what they want? I-- Why is this even a thing people pay attention to?
---
SAL &lt;3
---
Knowing about a game and seeing how fun a game is, is completely different.
---
thankfully you're around to remind us
---
Are the future stress tests going to have a higher level cap? Because if they don't, I don't see myself having very much interest.

When you click on one asmongold on video then the youtube algorithm spams you with his videos
---
Private servers also don't have nowhere near the amount of players that Classic will. Layers aren't therr only to handle the stress, but also so they don't have to merge a lot of servers down the line.
---
Tipsout is a twitch thot confirmed.
---
It's not anything like that, and it's a stress test. Not a demo. Not a beta. Not in any way, shape or form is this intended to be somthing for you to enjoy. It's a favour you're doing Blizzard to stress their servers that you're doing them out of your own kindness with nothing in return. If you don't like to give something for nothing in return then don't participate in a organised stress test. Wait for an actual beta invite or the game's release instead.
---
It's crippling.
---
This affects some classes more than others, but it's bad for anyone who wants to raid in another spec than they pvp in.
---
Between farming (for) raid, consumables, farming at the very least 100 g (2x50g) respec costs, which assumes only one raid day, and ranking up in pvp - people who want it all will either dedicate an unhealthy amount of time to that cause or will have to accept that they won't be able to be at peak performance at all times, between all "modes".
---
Yeah well, don't participate then.
---
not if you consider the length of corpse runs in aq and the trashmob respawn timer. Man I hated aq from the bottom of my heart

*ASMONGOLD REACTS TO SODAPOPPIN REACTING TO EPIC WOW CLASSIC MASSIVE PVP TROLL, ESFAND SAID THIS? VENRUKI REALLY DID THIS?* !!CAUGHT LIVE ON VIDEO!!
---
What are your sources on that the majority of people didn't get in? Where did you get your numbers from? How many people did get in vs. how many people didn't?
---
This looks awesome
---
I know and I dont really mind.
---
I NEED IT!!!
---
Yeah it cracks me up. God forbid anyone be even a little disappointed they didn't get to play.
---
Really seems like it. Streamers didnt exist back when Classic came out so people basically just hate the "newfangled things".
---
Im honestly surprised at the amount of hate the streamers get on this sub . A lot of people here act very immature , is kinda sad really
---
When he gets summoned into the air you can see the tooltip for the player who summoned him (and who is also flying!). It's just "Omar"
---
I hope this is your, your father's, grandfather's, brother's, son's or boyfriend's name, cause otherwise this has to rank up there about the most reactionary and shortsighted tattoos...
---
This stress test is so much fun. I logged in and people having so much fun in chat. Mostly it was trash talk about GoT and some spoilers (not cool! even tough I don't care but maybe someone hasn't seen it). People were posting Thunderfurry memes and talking about the old days. I got invited to a group after like 10 seconds of playing because there were so many people and we were chatting about how wow has changed and so on. I had more conversation then in my whole bfa experience. Can't wait for it to go live finally!
---
Yep, but hey.. Maybe most of his fans can relate to being a dysfunctional, socially inept, gangly nerd.
---
i fuckin love these post so much
---
How are they going to get a bunch of players in a small time frame if half the people wont play they already have level 5s?
---
Im not a huge fan of streamer culture either, but Im saving my rage for the multiboxers.
---
Salty jealousy, mostly.  Underprivileged will always hate on those with more than them.
---
Well if its helping them at the expenses of being 2h frustrated trying to log, not thx i give  more value to my mental health
---
Do i need an active sub for an invite.
---
It was. It took over 2 hours of constant refreshing to get in just before this stuff began, and I really feel bad for those who never got in at all. Still, it was great to see the community expressing so much love towards Blizzard as it was happening.
---
those things happen without the hordes of streamer fans shitting things up with chat spamming and harassment
---
A few hours ago on Classic BetaPVE i started seeing a ton of PVP server players. Definitely some overlap, maybe to free up servers for the stress testing going on.
---
I don't think it's "artificial difficulty". Difficulty is relative and increases in avg player ability should be accounted for.
---
For argument's sake, let's say right before Vanilla released some guy at Blizzard thought, "you know what, this game is too hard" and all enemy mob dmg/HP got nerfed by 10%. But the game was still pretty great so we all enjoyed it anyway. It was a bit easy but the core gameplay was good.
---
In that alternate reality, should enemy mob dmg/HP be increased 10% for Classic, knowing that the resultant game would lead to a experience for the majority of players?
---
Wtf you even talking about? People have to make lvl 1 chars, they can't use the lvl 30 that they already have

\-It doesnt stack but warrior wont be having ms on every target as its on cd. Warrior will also be heavy ccd. Why wait for rogue/warrior do job when I can spam it on several targets from far away. You can never have enough ms in your team.
---
\-Also another thing.. Duration of it is 2minutes, so if you dont have resto druid gl getting dispelled by mage of ferals in your team. 
---
\-I wasnt sure about pve, they seem both equally strong there. So I will go just roll for purely hex.
---
Because the number 1 streamer for WoW is a vindicate ***. Who instead of constructing actual responses to people or even acknowledging something fishy may be going on. That person instead goes to their armory page and effectively harasses that person on stream. 
---
Because they can easily ruin a community because if large enough. It can be handing stuff to the streamer by their followers that others would have actually have to earn. To causing massive problems for players because they beat the streamer (gear roll, pvp, whatever) so the followers cause issues. 
---
Could streamers do good?  Yes but they could also easily break everything in classic.
---
Forget August 27th, that was me today lol
---
It was always VC for me because DM meant Dire Maul and someone once told me the Alliance had their own dungeon called Deadmines but the last boss was Van Cleef so it was VC in chat since Dire Maul was DM to avoid confusion. I played Horde. Betting Alliance are typically the ones that say DM instead.

Star Wars is boring as fuck. So is football. And NASCAR. I found Divinity:Original sin boring, as well as most television shows. We all have our own things. Asmongold is entertaining because of his unwavering confidence. His ability to talk big is something I‚Äôve always enjoyed. He‚Äôs played WoW as long as me, is the same age as me and finds a way to keep it entertaining. I love his stories. That‚Äôs something a lot of people don‚Äôt talk about; the memories. He tells a story of how he got home as fast as he could for AV weekend. Sometimes he talks about guild drama from the past. I had a bit of that too. At the time it seemed so stressful, but looking back the memories I have of WoW are the most precious treasures I have. 
---
I want to hear others stories, too. About the time their guild was stuck, then they had to replace people. Or how they weren‚Äôt good in vanilla and would spend all evening in BRD. Asmongold is the only streamer for any game that I truly feel like I can relate to. He makes me think of my own time in Azeroth, and of the hundreds of people I met. Some of the people I met I became good irl friends with. Some people I hated and grew to like. Some people I liked and grew to hate. Almost all of them have quit WoW, and I miss them all. 
---
I like Asmongold because he brings out these memories, my best memories.
---
so in the stress test today (that you can still play) You can get to level 5. In future stress tests are they going to increase the level cap? Or keep it at level 5?
---
GMs will not behave like that when the actual game launches, it's just beta so they can fuck around a little bit and call it testing. The GMs for retail and vanilla will probably be the same people.
---
Hi, /u/Zeroed415
---
Yeah it's very subjective. Picking the best out of bad options.
---
It does not.
---
You will heal at 60 as druid. 
---
If you want to end up healing at endgame go druid.
---
If you want to DPS at 60 go mage.
---
You can still jump the wall and fall under storm wind.
---
I don't hate streamers, but I'm not a fan of "streamer-worship" (people asking for in-game references to be created for streamers, naming special tactics after them, and people bringing streamer drama to light). This was a big thing with a game I used to play a lot, and I found it annoying.
---
But as for Classic WoW specifically, I haven't really seen any of that with my short time on this subreddit. I've seen some streamer names mentioned here and there, but that's about it.
---
&gt; so hyped for classic my dick is hard
---
Thanks for sharing....
---
What a bunch of memey retards. Almost every reply to me was a meme or overused reddit moaner straight outta r/everyfuckingthread. You guys are 14.
---
Probably. She still mains the same toon she made in vanilla to this day
---
to be fair some need to want to test it, so its fine i however know vanilla inside out did clear naxx in vanilla. and played in awakening.  
---
I feel such waste of time to ppl trying to learn what to do and whatnot i myself know where to go what to priotize already.  
---
just dont have the time to waste on somthing that gonna get removed =)
---
Ew community interaction.
---
No but seriously. Streamers are annoying. Their followers provide a toxic environment. 
---
When a big streamer plays on your server his or her followers will be the most annoying players ever. Mostly annoying people follow famous people around. The gold ecenomy is more unstable on the server. And the capital cities are constantly spammed with anal this, and anal that. 
---
It's like the entire community drops 50 IQ as soon as they're online, and it's impossible to form pug raid groups with reliable players, that even though they're new or veteran, still focus and bring their best to the table.
---
You guys literally don't know what projection is. Doesn't even make sense.
---
RIP Hayven but I don't know man that's a hard thing to agree to.
---
My experience was similar. I remember filling in as a tank many times as an arms warrior with a PvP build and no shield lol. But I think this time around, most groups will have the proper composition and the game will be a bit too easy for most to have a super satisfying experience, at least not on par with the Vanilla experience. I guess we'll have to see on release.
---
There's that one video clip where some streamer got a script copy pasted to him by a viewer, and once he ran it, all his gear was gone. Think MadSeasonShow covered it in one of his videos.
---
Wahhhhhhh he won't let me enjoy what I want to enjoy because he enjoys making fun of me :'(
---
"Stress test". If they had a lot of people logging on at the same time, they can adequately test the fortitude of their servers. I'm assuming the remaining day of time given to stress testers was just so people didn't feel like they missed out if they weren't able to make it for the specified 2 hours.

---
People keep saying this shit but are completely missing the point. Whether the purpose is entertainment or not, if people don't have incentive to join then the stress test won't be as successful as it could be. It's not about the "right" to, it's about the "reason" to.
---
Aw. Thanks for letting me know.
---
That guy screaming keep pushing made me cringe so hard
---
I eventually gave up because I wasnt able to create a character.
---
Without a pocket healer, warriors are easily B-tier.  With one, though, S or SS without a doubt
---
thank you for sharing
---
Asmon has always been this elitist persona, and thats why people love him. Only recently he has started showing signs of turning into a hypocrite when Chat rightfully flames him and his reaction is to ban them.

And I dont really care about Streamer handouts since I will never play alongside them anyway.

---
f-fun? That's a word I haven't seen in a long time.
---
&gt; I'm not rolling a character until I get a list of where all the streamers are so I can avoid those servers like the plague.
---
Every server will be a "streamer" server. There are a dozen big streamers and dozens of gaming communities, then you have the chance of a large guild forming and just acting obnoxious like streamers.
---
Just role any server and all the spergs following the streamers will quickly get bored of the game when they cant get past level 15
---
All depends on the raid leader. Everyone's gonna have their own preferred setup. It will also vary by guild. And yet others will follow some preset doctrine that says what the optimum setup for each raid will be.
---
Shadow priest is god tier in PvP, but the downside is that they run out of mana really fast.
---
So you basically say you are too high IQ for a streamer community? High horse much?
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0C-DVnPeVM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0C-DVnPeVM)
---
Ah yes, i've taken [multiple](https://imgur.com/a/3RBDEoW)
---
I think it's the more hardcore group that is opposed. If this stays true to vanilla, the grind is huge. The fans of streamers, based on what I've read on this sub, apparently give them everything. It could mean the 30 or so black lotus spawns on the entire server on 2 hour cool down might be completely locked down by an army of fans. They get infinite free arcanite bar transmutes, free elixirs, free good, allegedly.
---
Furthermore, the most hardcore players might want to go for the AQ Scepter. The streamer might get a lot of their 42,000 or so carapice from fans, in no time. Much faster than any player with no following outside of their guild. They might also be able to have a complete lockdown on the required world bosses. This assumes the streamer would rather be the only one with the scepter, rather than encouraging more people to get their scepters before ringing the gong. 
---
My only gripe might be faction imbalance, but I don't think there can be too many streamers with enough influence to completely shift a server 70/30 or anything. Maybe two, tops. Nothing else really applies to me specifically.
---
Damn I miss al this good stuff, because of a bussy life :(
---
Lmao dude plays PoE on twitch he doesn't care about his viewer count, he plays what his subs want to see and what he think he will enjoy.
---
Really? I‚Äôve always thought of him as a pretty chill dude, but I haven‚Äôt watched his streams (aside from now) in years. What makes him a dick?
---
Unfortunately it is counter productive to level as a prot Warrior. I‚Äôm a tank main, and even I am going to be leveling as either arms or fury. Most guides have you leveling as fury until level 40, then respec to arms, but I am leaning towards starting off in the arms spec. 
---
Good news is you can tank any leveling content as either fury or arms, just slap on a one hander and a shield and tank away. All other times you will be either dual wielding or rocking a 2h. 
---
TL;DR it will take you a very long time to level to the point to where you can go into any dungeon as a prot tank, and you can still tank any leveling encounter as arms or fury.
---
Will you say the same about consumables?
---
We don't know yet but it doesn't make sense for them to increase the max level, it's a stress test, only purpose is to put the most amount of players in the smallest amount of space to literally stress their servers, it's not meant for players to play the game normally. I can see them wiping the stress test server after this 24h and reopen it in the next server testing
---
What I meant was that I think you're overestimating how skilled the average player actually is.
---
i was there
---
Congrats man! I hope the stress test gave you some fruitful gameplay.
---
And there I was, unable to create a character for three hours. We really stress tested. Proud of us.
---
&gt; I won't be respeccing due to the effort.
---
Fixed it for you.
---
Just hate Towelliee
---
No. I am saying i have average normal IQ. And followers of streamers have a collective IQ less than a normal person.

For what it's worth I played a troll mage from beta into wotlk and I'm going hard druid this time around. I'm lucky enough to already be in a guild as feral off tank.
---
My main reason is druid is a world pvp god and if they can't win they can usually escape the situation. Mage has a lot of tools at their disposal but if you run into the wrong situation you're just a big dead troll.

I think streamer are a good thing, they make publicity for the game and create great event even tho I don't like asmongold for the person he is, he's doing good for classic.
---
The downside is that if a streamer like asmongold go alliance on server X then the population of this server will be evilly unbalanced like 80/20 in favor of alliance because the fanboys go on the same server as him resulting in a total domination of a faction over the other leading to the horde to leave and finally the death of this server.
---
Already lost at the flossing, rest is just the icing. 10/10
---
You didn't fix anything. I don't waste money on respecs.
---
Streamers didn't ruin the wow community, if anything the reason you have classic now is because they pressured devs to create it with their influence. Be thankful that you are in the position you are in right now.
---
And the whole armory thing is perfect to debase any idiotic argument people present. When you argue from a comical perspective and your experience with the game is lfr, you get made fun of. So please stop getting offended when he makes fun of you when you make moronic points.
---
Their misstep was to include the line "get ready for a classic summer" in their bluepost.
---
They knew what saying this would imply which lead to expectations of an early to mid summer release. It isn't a "classic summer" if the game goes out last the 3.5 weeks in a 13 month long summer, or the last 4 days of the summer vacation periods for most.
---
Aw, I remember when vanilla open beta was closing and infernals and dreadlords attacked Stormwind. It was awesome. Thanks for bringing those memories back man.
---
Definitely a good point. My argument to that would to be the private server situation. Most people playing private servers thought of them as 95% Blizz-like but it's now being speculated that elite dungeon mobs were significantly overtuned by up to 50-100%. Meanwhile, many people have observed the beta dungeons being too easy, where you can pull too many mobs, tank with two handers, not have to CC, etc. without being adequately punished for it.
---
In this case, many of these players might see the private server version as much closer to replicating the original vanilla experience. So naturally, I wonder if Classic could benefit from some deliberate tuning, while still retaining the Vanilla spirit as do private servers.

good answer.
---
&gt; Sniping heals as quick as you can means losing efficiency (having less mana near the end of the fight while your druids will have too much as well as overhealing).
---
&gt; It's interesting how people are so focused on pure hps meters which don't matter nearly as much as dps meters or overhealing meters
---
Realistically, any mana left over at the end of the fight is wasted, but I get your point. Similarly, overhealing only really matters if/when your healers are going OOM or you're deciding whether to drop a healer for an extra DPS.
---
But yeah, I enjoyed healing in Classic WoW and I hope whatever guild I end up in can be more structured on the healing assignments to avoid these kind of traps.

lol, your mental health.
---
If this is challenging your mental health you probably shouldn't play Classic anyways. 
---
Pretty sure just because **you** leave that doesn't mean there aren't still thousands of others for the next stress test but farewell.

You should go learn Battle shout!
---
I would say it's because streamers get priority access to beta over everyone else. No one should get priority. It should be fair and even across the board. But they get guaranteed access when your average pleb has to enter a lottery with about 12 million other plebs.
---
This is pretty logical though isnt it? Streamers tend to bring people to them, generating huge masses of players in a small area. In addition to thet they are free PR for blizzard.
---
Inviting streamers is a huge gain for blizzard on many levels and we should be happy about it tbh. Imagine if no streamers got invited, we would have no clue about the current state of the game and would have to blindly trust the words of strangers.
---
Seriously, if thats the hill you wanna die on there are not many games left you can vouch for.
---
Casting Charge seems to be displaying in combat text +90 rage, when the actual value is 9.  
---
[https://i.imgur.com/FJTDakz.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/FJTDakz.jpg)
---
Yep.  Regular recurring subs, gametime cards, or even WoW tokens from BFA will work.
---
The incentive would be that the the impact of sharding at launch could be smaller, determining realm sizes, etc. I mean you might need a bigger carrot on a stick, but I'd rather just help out to ensure that classic gets released in a good condition.
---
I watch a lot of streamers. The ones who get hate is mostly Asmongold or Soda probsbly for the reaction shit. The ones that don't get hate are the real pro pvp people. Like Pikaboo, Xaryu, Savix This are like gods in intresting content creation for youtube. Pilav also makes reaction videos oncr in a while but his presentation style is on a different level.
---
Ask for your money back then lmao
---
Remember when totalbiscuit told someone to get cancer and die then he got cancer and died? Life has a funny way of working out sometimes
---
TB were very much against Classic. It wouldn't feel appropiate, no disrespect to TB.
---
Asmon is actually the worst streamer man. His arrogance level does not match his skill level at all. Watched his stream for 20 mins and he's just screaming orders at people calling them noobs yet has absolutely no idea how to play his class. I haven't cringed that hard in long time.
---
Considering I've seen people do it on stream... It does. Not sure where the above is getting their info from.
---
Some prefer the more relaxed and somewhat mature streamers to more screamy teenage ones.
---
Ok, i gladly leave you my place at the permanent queue bro, i hope you enjoy
---
And toxic, don't forget another term gamers throw everywhere.
---
So it's okay for others you know to have personas but other streamers are all nasty pieces of shit, right ?
---
Maybe. Tbh I can‚Äôt be 100% sure because I don‚Äôt remember lol. But if it was there then there should be something about it‚Äôs removal in one of the early patch notes. Maybe check that.
---
did you do the quests in any special order to get ahead of the pack or what? I'm trying to figure out how to get out of there ASAP for classic's release
---
I think your wording was fine, you did say compared to the PvP server.
---
Normal human behavior. Go to a sports event, people there seem to be complete dumbasses, but if you talk to them after the game they can be completely normal people.
---
You're telling me that anyone can just get into the Classic beta and all they have to do is become lead dev over the whole game?! StReAmEr FaVoRiTiSm StRiKeS AgAiN
---
Look at life the way this subreddit looks at asmongold
---
That's a good point that I haven't heard from anyone yet and I think you might be on to some people's perspective on the game. Either way, I think one of the main reasons we all want to play Vanilla so much is because it gave us all of those great RPG elements including the sense of accomplishment. After wiping on Deadmines 3-4 times in one run, it makes it that much sweeter when you finally get the drop you wanted. 
---
My fear is that without recreating that level of relative difficulty, it won't be quite as satisfying for most players.
---
Streamers have more value than the average player.  Blizzard is in the business of making money and they are going to do whatever they can to get people to spend money. 
---
I got beta access on day1 and I‚Äôm  not a streamer.
---
They are entertainers and that's why their audience is bigger. You can't really engage with an MMO stream outside of entertainment. There are exceptions like world first races and tournaments, but outside of competitive play there is really not much content the game provides which engages the viewer.
---
Every time I see "The Black Morass" I can only hear it in the original voice from Warcraft: Orcs and Humans.
---
If you're horde the blue shield that drops off of the turtle in wailing caverns is very good.
---
There is a boe ring called "Ring of Protection" that has armor and defense on it. Usually sells for cheap on the ah when servers are new since it isn't an item a ton of people are dying to have
---
Seal of Sylvanas is a great item if you're horde, a ring with 8 Stam and 3 strength. Easy quest item from completing Shadowfang Keep and should last you for quite a while. 
---
Nothing really MUST Have jumps out at me for tanking
---
Free labour? That‚Äôs what those fans are to blizzard then. 
---
But obviously they didn‚Äôt want people to suffer this, but imagine all those people that stayed up till 4 am or some crazy hour and not even get to login? I quit trying after an hour.
---
Apex was/is actually great 
---
Problem is the devs refuse to update the game
---
Populations were always unbalanced before streaming was even a thing. Your point is moot here.
---
I got to enjoy the stress test because the streamers got in. Them logging in was more valuable than you getting in. You want special treatment? Start streaming, grow an audience and bring value to them, instead of crying on reddit that people who provide a service to blizzard and their viewers get special treatment.
---
That would be cool, a good kicking off point might be some raid or dungeon to prevent Kazaak from reopening the portal, diverging us from the retail timeline.
---
I was wondering the same.. is he licking his own balls with showing us how long he can write something without saying anything?
---
&gt; There's saying "Okay, I don't really like that" and going out of your way to make fun of something or even trash talking it.
---
99% of animosity against classic from most streamers hasn't been spontaneous, it's been in reponse to some cancerous vanilla fan boy coming in telling everyone how shit the game they play is and how great theirs is and the streamer reacting. Stop being so fucking delusional.
---
&gt; But I suppose all they saw was the potential for more $$$ so I can't blame them for their "Sudden" change of heart.
---
Then why has he declined every sponsorship for thousands of dollars that everyone keeps accepting? Why did he refuse to play the last few Diablo season in protest when its financially the best game for him regardless of the state of Diablo, thats where all his viewers are. Keep convincing yourself of these generic assumptions of him.
---
Bearing in mind they're a streamer who has all this time to play games, you're looking at somebody who's played more WoW than any other game in their life. Of-fucking-course they're going to play WoW Classic.
---
No,you'd be more interested in a holy sanctuary build (with consecration) for dungeon tanking/healing, alright early raid healing and decent aoe farm.
---
Yeah
---
Hmm.

2. Reserve your spot for the August 27th release of our Classic Wow services! Level boosts from 1-6 (10-25 days completion time.) Tier 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 sets. Windsword. Orange Hammer. Chicken Leg Staff. (Prices dictated by market)
---
These are direct translations of the Chinese slang for these legendary items.
---
Yes. Latest scummy move for your money: no active sub, no beta invite. Last one iirc was blizzcon ticket for demo. They‚Äôll find ways of moneytizing our nostalgia no matter the cost :/
---
And I don't disagree. I realize it's a test and I'm happy to oblige, but not everyone feels the same seeing as it's likely to be their only chance to get into anything resembling a beta.
---
A lfr addon? Wow....
---
Yeah batman and robin are supposed to represent two separate entities/opinions. OP made them both represent Blizzard.  
---
???
---
Grats! üòç
---
Damn
---
Good job grouping entire sub into 1 opinion 
---
Also the hype will die but that doesn't mean the game will die
---
Meanwhile theres a large amount of alt-right and neo nazi scum on there who are advocating for a white ethnostate. 
---
They're not just stirring the pot. They are vile, loathsome human trash bags.
---
/r/imaginarymaps might interest you. :)
---
Now I want a Chicken Leg Staff too. Sounds delicious tbh
---
This sub is retarded, so yeah, its to be expected.
---
Complain about anything other than "this pixel was not here during Vanilla, reeee" and you'll get fucking mobbed
---
I could be overestimating, but I think if you were to perform a statistical analysis, you find a pretty substantial difference. For example, 50% less PvE deaths from returning players, 30% less PvE deaths from new players when compared to Vanilla.
---
And if this is the case, I think we're kind of missing an opportunity to keep the relative difficulty closer to what it was which will go a long way in trying to emulate the experience.
---
Imagine being a beta orbiter to a dude who showers once every two weeks.
---
Well I just created a character and logged in this morning (EU). Felt great. Really enjoyed just standing there on actual Classic. Then I logged out with a smile because other than you, I have never planned to actually play and level in a **STRESS TEST**
---
The last part strikes home... why? Because we waited literal YEARS for this, many spent countless of hours watching streams and this community is like ‚Äúwhy are you excited?‚Äù
---
I just wanted to see even the graphics for myself, that would‚Äôve been enough.
---
Good looking women doesn't mean fan service you know...
---
Yeah I know. Lol.
---
Sad but true
---
Honestly I was supposed to put a /s and forgot. 
---
But it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if this came true simply cause of the influx of game devs doing this for hype reasons. Case and point: apex and ninja or shroud.
---
Something like this:
---
http://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuMgkZVuxhczx
---
Plenty of options to consider. This build goes with Improved HoJ over say Shield Spec since Shield Spec is of modest gain for tanking but HoJ is so valuable for PvP and controlling a tanking situation.
---
Yes, this hit the nail on the head. #murderedwithwords
---
Nope, I decided to just invite people and socialize (SCARY) to help with those kill quests. It's just going to be a fact that the starting areas are going to be flooded come launch so my best advice is, look for who is trying to complete the same quest and make up to a party of 5, there are going to be a lot of dead boars, scorpids, quilboar, and kolbolds in the starting area, so group up and you'll hopefully have someone nice to talk to on the start of your adventure.
---
Your very lucky good sir. And I'm not gonna rant that you disagree with me. But streamers in no way have more value than anyone else. Sure its free advertising for blizz. In a way I would say they hurt the game. When their playing they do indeed have a small army following them around helping them. I mean that's hardly the kind of experience that your average player can expect is It?
---
Speciallywhen there are no quests and 0 drops
---
Someone must aggro so the others may pass
---
Yeah we all(Australians) had to play on NA servers in the beginning until we eventually got our own oceanic servers. Ping was terrible
---
Hi, /u/ezzybear_x3
---
Chicken Leg Staff 10/10
---
retail virgins vs. veteran chad OMEGALUL
---
The joke was when i said apparently not.
---
Literal fucking retard lol.
---
Doesn't have a very big impact on 2hs. Main problem is lack of rage.
---
I don't believe there are any trash classes, I can't think of one. They aren't all THE BEST at damage obviously but they definitely have their role and usefulness.
---
Yes, yes we get it, you were a super pro in 2005
---
Nope, any spell/action cancels shadowmeld
---
Huh? I thought they made it so wall jumping doesn‚Äôt work in classic. Did you not need it to get there?
---
"rrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeee, my account is from november 2004 I DESERVE to be in beta"
---
Best paired with corn staff
---
So, you never actually planned to play a videogame where you are paying a subscription just to opt int and have the chance to play it?
---
Interesting, by any chance have you ever think about something in your life or just follow the masses? Are you even able to think by yourself?
---
Im talking about the sub since obv i wouldnt ever sub for bfa since neither i have it or want to play anything past wotlk, like manu of us.
---
That's true but where else would they be?
---
Top-tier, bravo.
---
Posting in another epic thread, you Sir are a god!
---
I was questing and minding my own business when I came across this.... I then made a character named Caitlyn and joined in! I love Classic wow:)
---
you got serious problems dawg..
---
There is a difference between 1650 to 1350 and 2200 to 800
---
I don't get the reference
---
Sounds spooky
---
Imagine all the people
---
Wow, I made a very similar post and got destroyed lol. How did you get people to agree with you? I think the way you phrased the question was much better than me. https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bryxv5/is_classic_difficult_enough/
---
And tired
---
How do you know that? Most of these garbage streamers never played Classic (or even TBC/Wotlk), so the only thing they know is WoW as an arpg with mmo elements. Now if you tell them about all these qol changes that are missing all these wonky mechanics that are in there instead - its not unreasonable to think its a worse game. They dont know better. They hear people being excited about what is seemingly a dumb game and assume its nostalgia / rose tinted glasses. You have to consider that even someone like Preach, a very reasonable person that did play Vanilla on a decent level, was highly sceptical about Classic before playing it.
---
Now these people who didnt know better play Classic and seem to enjoy it. Why do you believe they cant genuinely discover liking the game? It IS an amazing game after all.
---
This is the most fake smile I have ever seen in my life. I am positive he can't even feel real emotion.
---
half the posts on this sub now are streamer stuff
---
mods need to clean up the place
---
this isnt /r/wowstreams
---
&gt; I‚Äôm talking about normal and even heroic being easier than vanilla. 
---
It's not have you done HC week 1? you can't even pug past the first 2 bosses. A lot of guilds struggle on heroic.
---
It only becomes easier when we start outgearing it. Just like Vanilla and TBC and WOTLK.
---
&gt;  in vanilla if you messed up slightly you‚Äôd be dead 
---
Easier to not mess up when you are only given like 2 chances to mess up. In BfA or any of these recent expansions you have multiple mechanics you could fail in.
---
And not being able to enter it due to so much lag... those were the days!
---
Holy shit man, seriously, there is a LOT of anger in you but I fear neither playing Classic nor attacking people on reddit is gonna solve that.
---
I would personally advise you to look up a therapist. It‚Äôs no shame to do that. You deserve to be happy too. Best of luck!
---
Hey did you know Anthem is one of the most popular games ever? - That Logic.
---
What about it?
---
We need scripts for things like start attack, as /startattack wasn't around in vanilla. Unless the macro game was updated.
---
Sips
---
Also do you understand that gamers don‚Äôt go outside, even in summer? If anything LESS in summer? pog
---
Just fyi he said multiple times on stream that when Classic releases he won't accept any gold from fans as he thinks it would ruin his experience too
---
Isn't he historically at around 40-50? He has certainly had a jump with Classic. but that is in large part because of the exclusivity
---
These things will happen regardless, streamers just bring a toxic community with them. Also it will be much harder to get things like world bosses, devilsaur skins etc if you're on a streamers server.
---
Got'em!
---
Iirc since the client is the legion one, the macros should be much more versatile and easier to write than back in the day. I'm sure someone with beta access has covered the topic.
---
The way Jeremy is confused about why Blizzard turned Warcraft from an RTS to an MMO is exactly how I felt at the time. But here I am, 15 years later, excited as ever to play Classic once again! 
---
The follow up episode with him in WoW rehab is equally as good if you enjoyed this one!
---
Yeah, that deserves a ban
---
I made a thread here and on the classic forums on this topic and got destroyed. Oh well, we tried.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bryxv5/is_classic_difficult_enough/
---
178k doesn't count tho
---
I wish I had given up sooner, I‚Äôm shattered today with nothing to show for it lol!
---
&gt;Edit: Seems like most of you reading my comment are still in the denial stage of grief.
---
No we're not dumbasses with severe defficiencies in understanding basic logical concepts.
---
lol, some effort went into this
---
Right now there is no other content, including BGs available.
---
In Phase 1, more and more people will be pushed into dungeons grinding pre-raid BiS and Molten Core. There will still be some WPvP because that‚Äôs where all the PvP will happen.
---
Phase 2 brings the honor system, PvP rewards, the contested Dire Maul instances, and contested World Bosses. Expect a ton of WPvP here, especially around DM and Blackrock Mountain.
---
Phase 3 will likely kill most WPvP outside ganking and farming fights. When BGs are available it‚Äôs likely there will be a decline as the hardcore PvPers run premade WSG for rank instead of risking WPvP DHKs. People who just like WPvP will be drawn into AV. The focus on clearing BWL will split players between instances.
---
Phase 4 might bring some skirmishes with Green Dragon world bosses or the ZG draw into STV, but it‚Äôs also possible people just ignore each other to focus on the raids. Fingers crossed that they don‚Äôt add the PvP Battlemasters until later, which forces people to queue up at a specific BG entrance instead of sitting in IF queued for all 3. It‚Äôs less convenient but people waiting around for AB to pop are more likely to go dick around and WPvP.
---
Phase 5 may bring some WPvP back to Silithus, but much more loosely than you‚Äôve seen in the beta. Silithus is an objective-driven farm-fest so tunnel-visioned players may opt out of WPvP.
---
Phase 6 adds some dedicated WPvP objectives but they‚Äôre mostly a pop-up for anyone who might care, having no real value to either faction when, again, there is a lot more stuff to do in the game, between many raids, BGs, farming consumables, making gold, etc.
---
Attacking? Youre the one that came to attack me after expressing my opinion, its not that i called you or asked for your own personal judgement but hey, here you are stating retarded arguments that makes non sense just coz ‚Äúfanboy‚Äù you know... 
---
It want easier to just respect everyone opinion?.
---
Again, are you able to think or just smash the keyboard trying to type randomly and looking if it makes sense after sending it?
---
Will you make up stories in game too for in game gold?
---
"mature" Lmao good joke buddy.
---
on /r/WoW it's pretty much the agreed upon opinion that over 50% of Classic players will be gone after 2 months. And 90% of Classic accounts made at Launch will never make it to 60. But that the remaining numbers will leave enough players for one, maybe two, servers to have a healthy enough playerbase for those who want to play it to get to play it effectively.
---
Worth noting that Blizzard did state during one of their earlier panels regarding Classic that they were considering breaking add-ons that recreate modern functionality. So I wouldn't be surprised if some of these got broken or banned by Blizzard.
---
Shit like this I miss the most in Modern-WoW it was so funny when out of nowhre a GM appear and trollt you. Damn i miss shit like this.
---
Private server values.
---
How are they the 1 levelers and 1 gold farmers?
---
There are people who actually got to play? O.o
---
2 months did not pass, it just released, what the fuck guy...
---
It really is going to be a different game.
---
I'm definitely installing immersion Classic though.
---
You just gave me a really good/bad idea...
---
So you like him because you can relate to his less than rewarding lifestyle?
---
To answer your question, you replied to me originally. Sorry I‚Äôm not on reddit every day and took a few days to get back to you..?
---
I‚Äôm really not a big asmongold fan but you‚Äôre just clearly a hater and too biased to have this conversation. Stop obsessing over Asmongold, there‚Äôs a thousand other streamers you could have used to discuss ‚Äúwhat equals twitch views‚Äù and if you genuinely think they‚Äôre largely successful for being relatable than you must not know what you‚Äôre talking about. InB4 the salt mine
---
Depends on the class mostly. I‚Äôve used to play a Shaman on a pserver, hated raiding in 30/0/21, hated doing anything else in 0/5/46, so I was almost always broke.
---
&gt; People raiding Mythic Nonsense in Retail get barely viewers while every classic stream even if he just stands there and does nothing gets more viewers.
---
WoW is top on Twitch during every World First raid. Every Launch of an expansion, and during the MDI's.
---
A level 40 in the level 30 capped beta maybe?
---
Im actually super excited to level up fishing! And cooking, and professions in general. I want to be known on my server for my tradeskills. During vanilla i just had alchemy but none of the good recipes (best i had was great er natur absorb flask). This time im going full buff mode, im getting alch and cooking maxed and I plan on using the buffs to ease my groups dungeoning. Im gonna tank with my brother as a healer so we already have quite a big advantage when rundning dungeons.
---
Look for Sinclaire on the EU realms if you wanna join us!
---
I think it is not just one single point it's a lot of small points. 
---
The following points are not in any set order!
---
* Most of the Classic community is a bit older than your general "gaming" community, most of the older people simply don't watch streamers and can't see the appeal. Also as a side note they get none of the twitch memes 
---
* Many of the "popular" Streamers have no "real" knowledge of Vanilla wow. Most of them were little kids back then and don't remember shit. So they try to "research" everything from private servers which leads to "not real vanilla data" and being wrong about many aspects.
---
* Most of the people are very jealous of all the fame and money mane of these streamers get, just for playing video games
---
&gt; Thanks bigfatcock69 for the sub, thanks for the 5000 bits epicnerdkiller420. Oh wow, 20 gifted subs??? Thank you thank you thank you thank you dude! Really nice of you! Thank you man. 
---
*  None of the streamers have a general good look, you either get your fitness boy muscle head (that Sonydigital guy from asmons pvp event) or the classical neck beard like asmongold. Most of them are either one of those sites. You get either the not really a gamer, or the no real life gamer
---
* Also this sub reddit is somewhat in its own little bubble, before this sub was only for vanilla private servers who didn't want to play retail, after a while more and more people came in. Many of them are completly #nochanges and complain about everything which was not 100% in classic. ,
---
* Just as an estimate! 20% here really played vanilla, 30% only played vanilla pservers, 30% played wow retail at some point in their life, 15% play retail right now actively and want to see how classic plays out and 5% never played wow but know someone who is really hyped up so they are interested too
---
Hope this explains is at least a little bit, if you have some more points feel free to add something.
---
This isn't for you though. This is for blizzard. I'm sorry that you went in with the wrong expectations
---
It does, people were getting on top of gold shire inn.
---
AccurateüòÇ
---
I made a thread on this exploring the idea of helping to recreate the Vanilla experience by increasing the difficulty, as private servers have done (for dungeons, at least). Got a ton of people disagreeing with me and a bunch of downvotes.
---
It clearly says ClassicAlpha next to the player name.
---
Complain about classic when it is only news, get hate views, make money.  
---
Play classic when the beta hype is large, make money.  
---
People like this only have 1 motivation, and its not fostering a good community.
---
It's like, I don't know man, fucking terrible to read this sub. It's not even "not sugarcoating bullshit" it's so many wrong assumptions about bugs in vanilla, gatekeeping, insults towards streamers, the one true vanilla experience.  
---
Just because you are on the internet it doesnt mean you have to stop being nice and start being a douchebag. We all are more or less normal people IRL and you wouldn't have the guts showing that attitude face to face.
---
The community here dislikes empty posts, especially ‚Äúlol‚Äù posts
---
Even if i build it in retail?
---
Maybe nex time they let you make a lvl 10 char and spawn you in your race city or something. I don't know how stuff like that works, but that's what I'm imagining
---
Fun detected.. fun must be deleted
---
I was there, super fun. For the Horde!
---
i doubt these were normal gms, i think those were blizz devs, higher employees having fun
---
The bottom left of the system menu is a classic option as well which should further increase performance
---
Worst streamer with most views. I think somethings not quite right in your definition of worst.
---
How is it not rewarding? I work from home. I play WoW throughout the day, watch youtube, and make enough to support myself. I‚Äôm not a streamer, but I can relate to him quite a bit, minus the mold and cups.
---
I know it‚Äôs on me and they own us nothing for it. But it‚Äôs still disappointing.
---
Talk about stupidity...
---
Most likely a bliz employee
---
Nice rare pet from ratchet btw
---
I think people are frustrated because there time is valuable and in their eyes they spent hours doing nothing. I keep seeing the argument for ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry you were texting server load‚Äù but if people had an experience like me I was just constantly seeing a screen that said the sever was offline so I wasn‚Äôt helping test the server load in the slightest.
---
No, people are just finding correlation and calling it causation. You don‚Äôt have beta access but it‚Äôs great you were one of the ones to make it in! I didn‚Äôt get in, but proudly served my part in stressing the server.
---
\&gt; The scary part is that in theory, the Classic Wow community should on  average skew older (and hopefully more mature?) than most gaming  communities
---
Meh, in my experience, every community that sees itself as "more mature" is in reality not that much better than other communities. I see this with the Starcraft reddit community as well. It is smaller than say LoL or HS community so there are probably less a-holes on average but it is nowhere near the standard that it sets for itself.
---
&gt;Meanwhile theres a large amount of alt-right and neo nazi scum on there who are advocating for a white ethnostate. 
---
&gt;
---
&gt;They're not just stirring the pot. They are vile, loathsome human trash bags.
---
Basement dwelling incels that dont matter
---
I mention Hayven in all the TB threads i see
---
both of those guys loved the game and especially Hayven had a deep knowledge and love of how the game was built 
---
when classic was not on the cards and i no longer played his content was the only wow content i would watch. It 100% would have been amazing to have TB here but he was not really making any wow related content , im 100% sure he would have made plenty of it though the second classic would have come out.
---
Holy nostalgia, watched this when i was like  12 or 13, didnt they turn it into a tv series?
---
I would have paid thousands of dollars to play it but nope got fucked only one that didn't get a invite
---
aaayyyy

They succeeded by the way. Look around the net.
---
Thanks but a lot of sites classic Addons for years. there is lots of missin in your site
---
It's the normal way of using them? Albeit in my country you would use lowercase ,, and then uppercase
---
Love Island is one of the most watched shows on tv. So, by your definition it is one of the best shows ever made? Just because a lot of scrubs under the age of 15 watch another scrub doesn't make them skilled or it a good stream. Good lesson there for ya kiddo, all the best.

Runs very good on my 200$ laptop, steady 40-50 fps , even runs kinda ok on my gf laptop and that laptop is ancient.
---
IS THAT REALLY \[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker\]?
---
Become a streamer then ^^
---
&gt;having lots of people in the login queue
---
Is it weird to feel nostalgic about sitting in the queue for the wow login server?
---
No. No I did not
---
Too soon! You have awakened me too soon, Executus!
---
I didn't think he was that bad until I watched him play Dark Souls. I've never seen anyone be that clueless, that inattentive, or that stupid at anything in my life. He was beyond being bad at just Dark Souls, beyond being bad at video games in general, and was just bad at learning. It was like watching a grown man bash his head into a door over and over for 3 hours before he thought to turn the handle. I could have put the controller in the hands of my 86-year-old grandmother who's never played a video game in her life, and I bet she would have learned more of the game's mechanics in 3 hours than he did in 6.
---
I don't care if people are bad at games, but he was bad at paying attention to things and learning from obvious hints and mistakes. It was so bad that it kinda killed my ability to take anything he has to say about video games seriously.
---
I'm on NA so unfortunately won't be able to join you there but thank you very much for your kindness. I like leveling up my secondary professions in wow so I can be mostly self sufficient, something I unfortunately haven't been able to completely do in real life yet. :P
---
Yeah, I think they even ended up making a feature film as well. 
---
I stopped watching after the initial web series though!
---
mate, I would think all your points are valid, all of them. However, Blizzard made it really clear that they dont actually give a fuck of how many, otherwise why would they make it a pay to play beta? Hell, not even that, it's a roulette. My point is that they know people will join, the numbers support it, they dont need an incentive to give to players and dude, most people wont join the beta for 'helping it to launch correctly'. They join cause it's a drug they ve been wanting for a long while.
---
Unless they wanted to stress test authentication and log-in services just as much as the server. 
---
Force a certain amount of players to get Auto Rejected so they will be constantly trying to Spam Relog to put more stress on servers.
---
I mean most likely it's what you said. But there is a scenario where forced DC's is beneficial
---
The only thing this tested were my stress levels. I wouldn't mind if we were all in the same boat but giving priority to streamers just irks me. Are we supposed to be testing this thing or not?
---
And yet that player should not be there, because the alpha is no more. The name also indicates that this character is from another server, what should also be impossible.
---
You know it really won't make you feel any better or me feel any worse to publish paragraphs of frustration in this comment section. 
---
You're disappointed that you stress tested the login servers in a stress test? Bad for you, probably need some expectation management. Just don't participate in the next stress test and you'll be happier. 
---
But don't let it out on Blizzard or anyone that has the ability to understand what stress test means.
---
Do you have a social life? did you go to school? do you have a girlfriend that cares about you? Do you have friends? Are you achieving any other relevant goals besides playing video games? Do you have decent personal health? How often do you go out and do something productive that's not getting food? These are all things you should ask yourself. If you find sitting at home playing a game for the majority of your life then more power to you.
---
Same for me! If you find something pls give me a message!
---
For lvling and wpvp they are arguably nr.1. As in you pretty much destroy anyone you want to. 
---
For more organised pvp and pve you are gonna want to be MM. It is pretty easy to sheep you and deal with your pet in BGs. 
---
However while lvling your pet alone can 1v1 most classes lol. A really good pve and pvp pet is a windserpent. look out though because certain types of pet have caster stats. Meaning they have more int but less attack dmg. Get one that is not a caster.
---
That is stress testing, stop complaining!!! (The entire sub)
---
Its 2019 and people don't know what stress test is
---
Lmao nice asmongold drawing
---
And take another dive once the World Firsts are claimed for Raids. 
---
You'll get stupid many watching Asmon's guild trying to do Ragnaros World First (It will be Asmons guild who gets it most likely since it has all the biggest streamers and auto gets the most dedicated players because of it) Then take a massive dive as they farm it for another 6 weeks before starting BWL.
---
Oh no, did someone say a meanie word? 
---
Always with the toxic gamers smh
---
Solid analysis, good points.
---
What do you think about soda?
---
That one I just don't get... I've only seen him twice though.
---
I saw a clip of him spamming wrath and max rank regrowth as a healer in a WC boss. That gave me the impression that he was new to vanilla, and that's fine! So I opened his stream to check what he was up to.
---
In the stream he was afk in ashenvale, playing a different game instead, and telling some rogue exactly which quests to do and which talents to take.
---
When the rogue pointed out that he had riposte, soda told him not to take that. When the rogue asked why, soda just said "it's garbage" without even telling him why.
---
Riposte is actually a great talent for leveling and solo grinding, and parry chance is the best defensive stat because of parry haste! Also riposte is not normalized in 1.12 so it hits like a truck with a slow weapon.
---
He really struck me as a clueless teenager pretending to know stuff. That's not fine when there's 50k+ people listening to your "advice".
---
Who said the alpha isn‚Äôt running any more? The alpha version is for employee testing. Earlier people from stress test servers were ending up crossed realm with beta players.
---
WHAT??? YOU MADE IT TO CHARACTER CREATION YOU *&amp;#!?!*+&amp;_+#+!?
---
On my behalf I would be kicked after I waited in the queue. 13 times. Then the server was offline. And then  it was online but closed. And then offline.
---
AND ME AND 2500 OTHER PEOPLE NEEDED TO WAIT TO RECIEVE THIS INFORMATION!
---
"Rant" over. Back to seriousness:
---
I actually hoped to get a wiev on classic. As I don't have a beta access. I had an idea of what a stress test might be. But I genuinely thought they will have the capacity of letting everyone who was invited in. To test layers/shades etc.
---
I was a bit disappointed to be hones. But on the other hand they have their data and hopefully for launch everything is set.
---
Are you stupid ? You literally signed up for doing exactly what you were doing. You ever sign up to help in a soup kitchen for free and complain that you arent getting payed while working ? Use your fucking brain pleb
---
Totally agree. Got stuck at char creation for 2 hours, hung in queue the whole time. 
---
But that‚Äòs the point, blizzard had a server with X pop, the rest was waiting. Now they know that there is the queue Problem and they are aware of it. 
---
Am I sad that i couldn‚Äòt play? Yes, would have been nice. But playing for two hours only to level 5 and not being able to do that, gosh that sounds like we have people here with heroin-like symptoms that need to get a fix, even if it just lasts a second.
---
Oh no not the meanie words! We need to act now before the racist sexist males take over our tolerant classic community!
---
Why watch a quiz show if you can quiz at home, all alone? lmao
---
Oh wait, seeing this, I remember now that I DID watch a video about this some time ago.  It's a bit of a shame it doesn't emulate FFXIV's cross hotbar exactly to accommodate more hotkeys, but that's okay because of the reasons you gave, and it might not be able to anyway because of how it works with WoW.  It's still plenty workable and looks pretty cool.  I like it.
---
PVP is of course out of the question unless it can hack the game and implement 360 degree movement and auto-facing for abilities, lol.  Ah, I forgot to include auto-facing as another issue in my post!  But that's not really that big of an issue anyway.
---
The only thing in PVE that would really hamper controller gameplay are things that need precise **and** quick reactions like clicking on something not very easily targetable or moving your camera very quickly to see behind you, but I can't think of anything like that right now in Classic or even in most of later WoW.
---
That doesn't count healing.  Even in FFXIV, healing with a controller is awful to me, only very barely workable and even then probably only because of the GCD/pacing in that game, but there's nothing they can really do about that.  Healing is what it is.
---
garbage person because she has a different opinion about a silly game and it's community. bwahahha.
---
Being a convert is not a crime, this community needs to remember that. Though i understand streamers will have their intentions questioned more because large amounts of money are involved.
---
So you're saying I took your joke and went too far? You're the one who started throwing shade first. Get over yourself.
---
https://youtu.be/sWhFdA2CK4A  Is that the Ui?
---
Someone doesn't understand what a Classic Beta works. This isn't a new game, and ALL content must be tested.
---
There is ZERO need to test any raids in Classic. But I guess you don't understand that, and it would take me hundreds of words to explain it WHY there isn't such a need.
---
So, I won't do it.
---
The ring is called ring of defense, ring of protection is the reward from the raid quest in EPL The Battle For Darrowshire
---
Same, i believe they stopped cause one of the crew died in a car accident
---
There‚Äôs a reason they are testing it.
---
Imagine the uproar if servers launched without layering when you see how mad people get for not getting to play in a stress test.
---
No my preocupation is they literally lying to you and you not being able to realize, but i guess that should be yours prick.
---
I never forced you to start writting bullshit... but ok keep saying that.
---
Actual facts: they stated that they would look into accounts age for invites and an active sub was required... that leads to a record in sub increases so... PROFIT?... and it ends up being a lie because theyre whitelisting even the stresstest after getting ppls money with cuestionable tactics and lies. Yes lies, because streamers with accounts not even 2 year old are all in and ppl with 2005 acc and sub since then are not.
---
But you can keep saying that its a fair deal, good bussiness tactics and logic, at the end, the nazis never realized what they were doing till way later.. the effect of brainwashing on ppl with little to no thinking capabilities never cease to amaze me
---
actually it does, that's how free speech works. and it's the internet - don't take everything serious. He also stated he meant it in-game. 
---
Ya are just looking for an excuse to be toxic just as he is.
---
This site lists addons that are developed specifically for 1.13 and grays out those that are not updated or planned.
---
Dude ... this is the reason we are having these tests lol
---
I think it was indeed a coincidence, it finally worked 3 hours later
---
My bad
---
Why should anybody feel bad or sympathetic for the actions those people decided to make? I‚Äôm also living in EU and ended up going to bed around 2:30am, but I‚Äôm not going to sit there and complain. This EXACT problem is better to be solved now rather than launch. 
---
Not sure where people get this self-entitled idea that Blizzard somehow owes them something in return for participating in a test. When you do something good or to help someone you do it for that reason only, not with a second intention of receiving personal gain and it‚Äôs just sad af.
---
Yeah, and there is a difference between stormrage and illidan. Both are known for their dominance of a single faction before streaming was even available.
---
huh? Have you tried Skyrim in VR? Don't see an issue with WoW, even though it's been technically done via VorpX a year ago
---
No one is mad about this lmfao. If people genuinely think the values are incorrect then they report it. If Blizzard then confirms that the values are correct they don't whine like you say they do, you're the only one doing any whining around here. They're instead glad that Blizzard has it correct instead of guessing the values.
---
Check retrowow pserver, great to pass the time. It will die when classic comes
---
I honestly don't believe that any really big streamers are going to make it on PvP servers. It will be a constant clusterfuck of fighting around them wherever they go, regardless of whether or not they have a big following around them. There will be just as many people who want to ruin the stream experience as there are people who want to suck off the streamers. People like Asmongold will be camped for days. 
---
I am in the beta, and even during the beta there is a guild Horde-side that I was invited to that was specifically designed to attack streamers and corpse camp them. It had over 100 members. And that is in beta. Imagine how bad that will be at launch.
---
Kinda sad that this happens but it's so hard to combat. I wish the bugers would just play the game for themselves instead of thinking they earned something they just paid for.
---
Higher employees having fun sounds good in my ears. They should be able to joke around too
---
That's so fucking dumb, let the voting system decide
---
That's a Y I K E S from me dawg
---
It's 2019 everything is toxic now get with the times you fucking white male
---
Have you even sucked feminine dick yet you virgin incel
---
Love this shit
---
&gt; /u/X1project I‚Äôm not to happy with blizzard rn, it‚Äôs time to unlock the server ffs
---
dude be patient; entitlement has no place in classic wow
---
Wow streamers are more offensive though. When i first started watching them last week they were all calling everyone spergs and autists. Most of the other big games have maneged to mostly remove that type of casual discrimination. They seem to have toned it down so i suspect Blizz PR sent them some warnings when classic got so popular .
---
You think you don‚Äôt, but you did
---
Thank you.
---
I am not salty, nor do I obsess over him like you think I do. It purely depends on what streamer you're watching. On one hand you have streamers like Dyrus who have terrible personalities but massive skill, and a shut-in quit type lifestyle. Then you have streamers like Ninja and tyler1 who has skill and an arguably good personality. The common denominator is skill, people can relate to skill because everyone wants to be good at the game they play. Really there is no "guaranteed way to get views" like you say there is. 
---
to quickly name off why I think the people you listed are getting views. Soda, when he started screaming he was a relatable annoying teenager like most people who watched him whos viewer base grew with him he was also very good at wow. Really don't know who Timthetatman is but pretty sure he's good at whatever he plays. Esfand is very relatable to the older population of wow players.
---
You'll get there irl aswell, trust me! I got severe ibs so keeping times can be rough for me and so it was really hard finding a job i could do. Now im working as a nurse at a retirement home for people with dementia, works really well since there are toilets everywhere üòÇ
---
Oh my fucking god, hahaha, now your really got me good. Respect, that one was worth a laugh.
---
Did you seriously just compare Blizzard with the fucking nazis and requiring a subscription for a subscription based game with brainwashing? 
---
I've read MUCH really **MUCH** nonsense on this sub, but you reached a new level on tinfoil retardness. Congratulations to that achievement!
---
cross realm confirmed
---
These fun events are as recent as BFA's beta, they never went anywhere.
---
I‚Äôm playing idle heroes, idle bud farm and adcap because i am saving myself to go back.  I dont even have a desk yet its all coming together a couple of days before release.
---
The point of a stress test is to see how many players they can handle, what the bottlenecks are, etc. You dont invite a number of people that you know you can handle. But neither do you invite a number of people you know you cant handle. Both scenarios do not result in meaningful test results.
---
Joe Shmoe with 40 viewers doesn‚Äôt.
---
A handful might but that‚Äôs far from the norm. Fuck outta here

So you clearly dont actually watch asmongold
---
When people watch an NFL quarterback launch a bullet, no one has the delusion that they can go out in their backyard next weekend and do the same thing. People watch Ninja stream Fortnite, then log in to their game and think they can solo everyone. That's the problem with twitch.
---
If I pay real life cash for in-game currency, this will ruin the economy because you are adding an element which is not moderated. Everyone in the game can achieve the same gold (give/take) if they did the same job (essentially what you want, an even playing ground), however IRL people make more money than others.   
---
Therefore i will come in pay for 2 tokens ($50), sell them for 500 in game gold, i exchanged IRL currency for in-game currency cause instability in the economy, because not everyone has access to the $50 that I do. 
---
Now I'm 500 gold richer by using daddies credit card to by Krol Blade, where it may take someone 4 weeks to get enough gold to buy one. You kill the game by allowing power to be purchased using currency not everyone has access to, that's how you kill economy, there will be a growing gap between the rich and poor and it will be noticeable in game. 
---
Definitely know about the Chinese gold farms and that. I would prefer the same consequence be given to those that get caught using it, a ban.
---
What was bad about raiding 30/0/21?
---
Im being a dad.. Cant quit that when classic lunch though!

Where you see a toxic community I see a fun community.

---
I think you take his character too seriously, he goes out frequently, has a girlfriend, and lives a nice life
---
I did my part lol!
---
&gt; Lots of games put up huge Twitch/streamer numbers for a short period then die off 
---
Yeah, because those games SUCK BALLS, and are built to be a cash grab, run for 2 months, and than fuck it, they got the money they wanted, the game can die. Rinse and repeat.
---
Classic? It's going to rock the MMO gaming world. The numbers at launch will be ASTOUNDING, easily over 5 million people, and easily over 3 million playing it in first year.
---
And I might be conservative.
---
You have no idea how many people actually waited for a REAL MMO since like forever, be it current or former WoW players or current or former other MMOs players.
---
I'm not saying it was not an issue back then I'm saying it will definitively be an issue in the future on the server streamer play on.
---
No i compare your intelligente with ppl ‚Äúeducated‚Äù if we can call it that 80 years ago but hey, you know what? Im actully thinking that they were way smarter than you...
---
Yeah, and you can still play and level to 5. Without having these issues. The first 2 hours were to see if the server could handle things. Clearly.
---
Cool, go for it then. I played LoL for nearly 8 years trying not to touch any of that.
---
Just can't use reasoning and logic with these people..
---
No, he isn't. His median number of viewers in the last 12 months was under 19k.
---
I've seen a few videos and things of his. Gotta say dude acts like a manchild that didn't get icecream before dinner.
---
Asmongold has a social life, he did go to school, he has a girlfriend that cares about him, what actual goals are you achieving that matter? The answer is none because nothing you or I accomplish matters.
---
You're just stupid as fuck. The goal of a streamer is to have views, that the one fucking metric to gauge if they are good or not.
---
Hi, /u/Militem
---
&gt;Maybe there's a step where they do a "fake connect" for various reasons. Without seeing the codebase there's nothing special about this :)
---
Exactly
---
It's a fake connect for Initial Hotfixes during client initialization. They probably don't have these hotfix servers set up for the stress test beta client, and use a Dummy Connection to prevent errors when launching.
---
[DELETED]
---
"Comedy 'gold'" .. I see what you did there.
---
good point. Isn't it also true they want to stop that after some weeks?
---
Ugh yeah same here. I cringe when i think about how i acted back then, extremely elitist and just an asshole in general towards people i thought were "lesser" players than me.
---
it took most streamers like 30 min to log in just like everyone else
---
have you tried logging in now?    
---
I was able to get in
---
You are trying to make me seem stupid for half an hour now but all I can see is you being the actual clown in this thread. I don't define my intelligence by randoms from the internet, but rather by my education, my job and my real life achievements. Well probably also by the fact that I understand the difference between a beta, a stress test and an actual released game and by that definition you failed hard mate.
---
Garbage person because she somehow turned people wanting classic wow into some mysohpnistic movement related to gamer gate. She's stupid.
---
i hope they keep the addons limited to high quality ones and not get saturated with garbage to have to look through
---
I too am in a similar boat in life (wife/kid/job), but i like that, nay i love that. 
---
you want the game to reward those that can put in the hours, not everything should be attainable, that's why Vanilla never felt like you had finished it. Only 9% of guilds completed naxx, i think i read that somewhere, that leaves a shit tonne of people that keep going. 
---
where it takes hardcore players 5 weeks to get something might take you 3 months, ALL the more rewarding, this is an RPG you are who you are in the game, if you've played this game before i'm sure you'll appreciate that this isn't an overnight game where you will become BIS after 2-3 dungeon runs. (NO CHANCE).
---
I mean I'm gonna let you guys have this moment but in every past beta there was this random banter. I can remember in the bfa beta, they made the same jokes with shutting the realms down, beta ending prematurely, etc.
---
Dammit Bob!
---
Exactly, the only difference is that the average age of players goes up a bit or maybe it's just the spelling that gets better.
---
Did they ever say it was randomised?

NA Horde PVP - Speed leveling group
---
I'm looking to form a small group of mostly solo players that are going to put in ridiculous hours on classic wow launch to power level to 60 as fast as possible. The goal is to have a group of players that can complete group quests and dungeons when it's efficient to do so and to stay far ahead of the pack. High commitment to the group won't be required, but the entire point is to have a network of high level players to form groups with when necessary as you power level to 60.
---
I'll be playing on a pvp server that isn't determined yet, but it will be a high population server. Please whisper me of you are interested and we can set up a discord server. My discord is fakedout#2269
---
Just a meme guys fyi  &lt;3
---
lets just stick with classic for now okay, and hope they decide the release new level 60 content in the end.
---
Hiding the chat helps a little bit... But since i tried to watch asmongs mage tower "Guide" where he just did the challenge and explained nearly nothing i cant see that guy anymore... he is so hyped for no reason and the chat ist just memes you cant even see because theres so much posts you have no time for that. 50 LULW/OMEGALUL per second  i dont even know where this bs comes from :'D
---
A lot of disconnections but pretty fun otherwise
---
The middle picture is fucking hilarious
---
Not gunna say a name out of fear of repercussions but that shit is fucking funnnnyyyy
---
Let me put it this way "I know for a fact I'm right"
---
If people couldn't even connect to the server, they didn't stress test anything. The point of the test was to see how sharding would handle huge amounts of people in the same area. Staying hours in that endless loop of disconnects and not even being able to create a character is not actually helping anything, claiming otherwise is just stupid.
---
I guess they underestimated number of players and did not prepare enough hardware. Layering or not, you need enough of the real servers to handle the load.
---
I should preface this- I am on the autism spectrum, just barely, but I had professionals evaluate me a couple years ago. My wants and needs are different than the average persons. My main social life is raiding 3x a week on retail, and hanging out with old friends on discord/other games. I have a group of very close friends I met in BC days. They don‚Äôt play WoW anymore, but we do all sorts of other things. Once a year we fly out to Boston to meet up and go to Anime Boston. It‚Äôs definitely an atypical social life, but I do have one. 
---
I went to school and graduated college in 2011. I started at my current company that year, and at the end of 2014 I began working from home. 
---
I haven‚Äôt had a girlfriend since 2016. Honestly I‚Äôve been overall happier single. Every relationship I‚Äôve tried seriously stresses me out. 
---
As far as goals, I‚Äôm pretty happy as is. I‚Äôve recently moved to a whole different department and job title at work that I like a lot more. I‚Äôm learning a lot of new skills from my new team and boss, especially concerning developing tools for automation at our company. 
---
My health is actually better than it‚Äôs ever been. I go out and walk for at least 30 minutes a day. I‚Äôm slightly overweight but have been consistently losing weight over the past couple years. 
---
What counts as productive? I keep my spaces clean and make sure my cats have plenty of food, water, and attention. I take my mom out to buy stuff for her garden regularly, but other than that I spend most of my time on video games. 
---
We all have our own lives to live, and I realize mines atypical. I don‚Äôt think that warrants the hostile vibe I have been getting.
---
Most clips and things are taken from the "funny" moments of hischaracter, asmon and by extension McConnell are entertainers for the stream and act a certain way, many times asmongold will just be a quiet dude talking with chat and enjoying himself, hes one of the few streamers I enjoy these days and have watched since way before he blew up.
---
No we are classic
---
Hate to see what this subreddit has become. Such worthless content. These guys are bringing massive exposure to the game we want and all you can think about is how absolutely furious you are you couldn‚Äôt login to a 2 hour stress test with a level 5 cap. That‚Äôs a shame.
---
he said he doesn't care /s
---
Oh boy,  trying? youre achieveming that yourself alone
---
Maybe on the social life part now because he streams and is kinda hard not to. But, he dropped out after less than a year of school. His girlfriend hardly ever sees him and recently moved into a streaming house and didn't invite him, nor wants to live with him. I want to say this in an uncondescending asshole way but "nothing you or I accomplish matters." Is something depressed people say. Also, all these questions were geared towards you.

Looks brilliant, love the attention to detail as well!

Having experienced it now, it reallyyy sucks when you‚Äôre on the empty layer and all the cool stuff is happening on another one. Much less the cities. I sincerely hope layers will only be condensed to 1-10 overworld zones.
---
The first levels are pretty fast. At the beginning every successful catch grants a skill increase. But then it gradually gets slower and slower and by the end you need quite a lot. Something like 15-20 per skill point iirc.
---
So streamers should play intentionally bad?
---
And twitch isn't the root of the toxicity (applies to YouTube aswell), it is the streamer or youtuber who decides what community he/she wants to build. There are countless streams with friendly communities.  
---
Bad examples are Tyler1, Ice Poseidon (banned), forsen (although enjoyable to watch).
---
Good examples are DansGaming, CohhCarnage, ... list goes on and on.
---
You care about ppl aproval? Shame... I care about ppl righs and fair bussiness.
---
I guess is a matter of priorities.
---
Good to hear that it reaches 30fps on a system like that. Was it stable or did you experience regular stutters?
---
Well good for you keep watching him then really I am not here to argue against what you like.
---
LMAO
---
esfand/staysafe way better to watch
---
too much whinging from asmon
---
It's a stream of a god damn CLOSED BETA of a game that is FIFTEEN YEARS old, and 3 months away from launch.
---
Can you please provide ANOTHER example of a game, that was in a closed beta, and had similar number of viewers?
---
I think you fail to understand what it means for a beta version of a 15 year old MMO game to have 110k viewers in the same day that Fortnite, the most popular game today (not an MMO), had 174k viewers.
---
When Classic will actually launch, for the first weeks,  I think the number of viewers will be the HIGHEST ever recorded for a game on Twitch.
---
Maybe at that point you will revise your opinion that  "a page of twitch streams three months before launch means absolutely nothing".
---
It means A LOT more that you can comprehend.
---
Blizzard updated WoW's wall collision detection long ago.  True wall jumping is not possible anymore.
---
&gt; Dissenting opinion from the mainframe
---
I'm drunk, but like 99% convinced this is some 4d chess satire
---
I downloaded the stress client fully expecting it to be a clown fiesta of people struggling to log in and lag everywhere when they did get in.  What I wasn't expecting was streamer privilege letting them jump the queue and Blizzard summoning bosses to cause carnage.
---
This wasn't so much a stress test as it was a timed promotional piece and it surprises me that there's so many people in here defending it.
---
Incorrect. What you are speaking about is popularity. I'm trying to teach you the difference between popularity and skill level. Some others may disagree, but in my opinion watching skilled players stream any game so I can learn from them is what I consider to be a good stream. Watching overgrown children (i.e. asmon) scream at a camera pretending he is good is not a good stream, but it is **popular** with children (most people watching twitch are kids like yourself so the popularity makes sense). Go watch Monkeynews or someone with actual skill and stop being a sheep young lad.
---
No it is, one of the coolest memories I have of wow was this happening to me. I was maybe 10 at most, so everyone thought I was making it up, and for like a year after that day I researched how to become a wow GM I thought it was the coolest thing ever after my experience witth that cool ass vanilla GM
---
I hope i'm on a server with you
---
relax old man, being good at a game is not a requirement to stream it.
---
&gt; not a single EU player on any forum I could find reported getting in.
---
I'm EU player, with EU account, got into the beta 2 hours after subbed in.
---
Ah well, at this point it gets boring to give you reason to be anywhere near relevant.
---
Have a nice day and I hope you'll be happy and healthy in the future too :)
---
&gt;vanilla fan boy coming in telling everyone how shit the game they play is
---
you mean like a large text that tells you in an arrogant and patronizing way that your game is WAY better in every way and that blizzard will never ever ever validate your wishes to pay for a game because all you feel is nostalgia and probably are just bad at the game because your game was so much easier?
---
like that kind of toxic?
---
Pipe down young sir, I'm trying to teach Elfeden an important lesson. You wait your turn!
---
How the hell do you make it to Ratchet from Teldrassil but didn't notice that there was another pier with another, or potentially, another boat in Darkshore when you arrived there? 
---
99% sure the only way to get from Teldrassil to Darkshore or anywhere that wasn't Teldrassil was taking the boat, then snagging the FP, Swimming would kill you with Fatigue
---
Dark Souls became super popular by being hard, punishing and adventurous. The audience is there.
---
If you click the twitch icon at the bottom right of a clip (or watch full video if you view the clip full screen) it takes you to the part of the VOD where its taken from, then you can skip around from there.
---
Correction : the remaining numbers, after whatever percent leaves Classic, will still be HIGHER than retail.
---
found zarya main
---
I forgot how much i loved old auberdine!
---
Nope, I have a life.
---
You do know that the wands from ench are good until like 30, after that you won't get any better wands from ench
---
Who cares man it's about the experience.
---
Mate, go to sleep.
---
&gt; There‚Äôs a lot of interest because it‚Äôs new 
---
I hope you realize the stupidity of what you are saying.
---
ofc. because complaining about a stress test is absurd
---
Hahahahahahagahag, hahahahahahahah
---
Ok. But how long till you come to delete all your bullshit mr.fanboy that approves this kind of bussines behaviour?
---
Thank you Captain Obvious, i didn't know stress test wasn't for my enjoyment ...
---
The thing is that's frustrating to not be able to connect, while US players log in easier than EU's.
---
And i wanted to be part of it because i love the game. Blizzard called for as many players as possible and i wanted to help (and try the game, no need to be hyprocrite).
---
The events with devs and the community was something i wanted to be part of too.
---
Umm..context pls?
---
I know what they've done, but it's still entirely possible to do some wall jumping, such as getting under SW via wall jumping on the walls and walking through them.
---
was very stable, only somewhat stutter if i'd look at a wall and then rapidly turn around to a crowded area but that was very minor
---
&gt; WoW is top on Twitch during every World First raid. Every Launch of an expansion, and during the MDI's. 
---
And with one exception, all those "events' had less viewers than a 15 year old game closed beta.
---
Let that SINK IN for a while...
---
hey, hope you are alright. glad ya found someone to chat to, definitely makes it easier just talking stuff out
---
Fuck man... why do I have to be so F R E S H
---
I don't typically comment on these things but if you're going to slander a community or smear everyone in a negative light, like these streamers have, then they deserve to be called out. These people whether they're just regurgitating popular opinion supported the group that was gatekeeping the discussion about classic servers, by trying to stop them from evening happening.
---
i7 950 770 gtx
---
300+ fps on classic settings
---
&gt;If people couldn't even connect to the server, they didn't stress test anything.
---
Id say their login systems got thoroughly stress tested. Its not just about sharding, its about stressing ALL of the parts.
---
I'd warn against that, because given how much privilege they're giving streamers so far you can expect them to come down heavily on anyone who tries to disrupt their paid promotion of WoW Classic.
---
Alright, fair enough. How did she spin the classic movement being mysogynistic?
---
You sure, the engine didn't support flying for gms until bc iirc
---
Yes please
---
\#nochanges
---
While I don‚Äôt disagree, I am still pretty sure they got what they needed to test and push their server capabilities.
---
1: No they didn't. 
---
2: Those events are not a closed Beta. Closed Beta will always have more numbers than live events.
---
I think Blizzard realized not only that the WoW Classic servers will be FULL on launch...but they will need MANY MORE servers that they anticipated, because let's face it...we aren't talking about a mere 1-2 million people here.
---
Hence, the need for god damn engineers.
---
Cheers man, good vibes to you! 
---
Happy to see some oldschool people still going. A few KR people are also still playing on Stormscale (Deposit Coin guild and a reboot of KR, which is dead now), all on horde side. 
---
Will definitely give classic a try and hopefully relive some nostalgia :)
---
As Ive been on live since TBC, for sure going Horde this time for vanilla. Perhaps see you during leveling!
---
Hopefully, not with the engineers still inside.
---
Nice, Gladiatorlosa. I don‚Äôt need to learn any actual skill now phew. 
---
I can‚Äôt wait to hear ‚Äúcold blood‚Äù while I‚Äôm drinking. üëÄ
---
How miserable can your life be?
---
Should Tom Brady spike the ball every down? I don't think you understood my post. Biggest streamers = top tier players, huge fanbases flock to them because they want to watch them win, get delusions they can be just as good, log into their games and proceed to be just as bad as before, can't understand why they can't do what they just viewed on Twitch and proceed to rage and be "toxic", log out and watch Twitch again.
---
Has nothing to do with the streamers themselves. My point is much broader.
---
So did someone try to test cthun armor and resistance value to compare with pserver ?
---
Omar give me beta and ill stay through queues without whinning
---
Sorry, but I'm not sure what you're arguing. Half of your message seems to agree with me, while your other half is calling people addicts and that blizzard dgaf. What are you trying to say?
---
&gt;I think people are frustrated because there time is valuable and in their eyes they spent hours doing nothing. 
---
If you value your time, 1-5 level stress tests in middle of the night arent for you. If you CHOOSE to stay up, dont complain about it later.
---
Godamnitttt but it's so true. I hate that WoW Classic is being associated with a dumb ass Asmond's face
---
Lol, what a bad way to live your life.
---
fucking lol. anyone who supports these shit tier leeching streamers and thinks theyre actually important are part of the problem. congratulations on being a sheep
---
Well, he played retail WoW for a long time...
---
And here am I wanting to get on the login screen at least not having any access
---
I'd imagine the ire comes from streamers who said they had no interest suddenly developing it when they can make money. Where as average Joe vanilla supporting the company for 15 years has to look at a loading screen. 
---
Tin foil hat on a conspiracy I could get behind is that beta tester accounts got prio over stress test invitees.
---
Honestly the Classic Community is 100 times more "toxic" than the LoL community.
---
Vanilla addons != Classic Addons   
---
The API is very different
---
Isnt the server up for 24h anyways ? So you can go see the graphics, the "stress test" part was the first 2 hours.
---
What part of my comment conveyed entitlement? You‚Äôre so caught up in beating down this ‚Äúentitlement‚Äù message that you fail to realize that I didn‚Äôt breathe a word of entitlement. All I did was explain how the login issues of the stress test were not what Blizzard was targeting.
---
Well, who participates in the beta is at Blizzards discretion, those who are upset that they can only get to level 5 in a stress test might want to re-evaluate their priorities. (At least they got in, I sure didn't)
---
‚ÄúNormally these apply to me and I feel naked but this one didn‚Äôt so I felt comfortable laughing‚Äù
---
We haven‚Äôt been invited to a beta we were invite into the stress test (Stress) being the word we needed to give them the information they need so they know how many servers etc to run on launch how many players they can handle etc so it was in your interest. I also stayed up all night for it because it‚Äôs in my interest I never got online but I am a tester
---
I thought it was just 2h?
---
Really as long as you are happy with your own life and doing what you enjoy within healthy means that's all that matters; which it seems like you are. Majority of people are living atypical lives including myself but I am happy with myself. Can't tell you how to live but getting a degree and continuing education through work is something to strive for. I myself am not one to have many friends really my only friend I have at the moment is my girlfriend who is also very slightly on the spectrum. We just stay in and watch shows when we aren't working. So really productivity is subjective. 
---
Working in the medical field myself I know it's not right to just blindly call people out on their lives and there is no excuse for that, something about asmongold just pisses me off for no reason. And I am not in the place to argue against what people enjoy and try to make them see otherwise. In the end, we are all living atypical lives to just stay alive and as long as we have our health that's all we need.
---
Look at all these fricking streamers . You know Nicks? Yeah biggest WoW streamer actually. Dwarfs Asmongold in viewership. True story bro. Tinfoil Brotherhood.
---
The fun scale is NE&gt;UD&gt;Troll&gt;Dwarf&gt;Human
---
The PVE scale is Dwarf&gt;Human (arguably better than dwarf if you already have some in guild)&gt;Troll&gt;UD&gt;NE
---
The PVP scale Dwarf&gt;UD&gt;Troll&gt;Human&gt;NE (both best and worst at the same time really)
---
Most unique gameplay NE&gt;&gt;UD&gt;Dwarf&gt;Troll&gt;Human
---
Most trolling potential NE&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rest
---
She‚Äôs absolutely seething in this video. It is funny because she‚Äôs been constant damage control mode on twitter since beta launched. ‚ÄúI love classic wow the community was just mean to me‚Äù
---
In the modern video-game market, hype &amp; user-retention have a very weak relationship at best.
---
I don't think I have ever felt this old.
---
Asmon is a good streamer. He know what to say, how to say it and when. Most of the time. Ofc he have fuck ups also, but rarely.
---
He is popular mainly because he stuck to his opinions. And that matters more than what those opinions are, because there will always be pro and against views on everything.
---
He's just good at what he is doing.
---
Like a politician that wins election and election.
---
how much did the damage stack up to.
---
Ps. Now everyone there they got to c'thun in vanilla ? :P
---
Oh nononononononononono. What are you basing that info off of? Private servers I've played are not toxic, this sub is nowhere near as toxic as it can get over at lol. Have you not played League?
---
But being toxic is up to the viewers/players. They decide if it's worth it to brag about stuff in twitch channels.  
---
We can throw arguments back and forth, in the end it is all about the next generation of teens (14-18 maybe)
---
And this is essentially feedback.
---
3 stagest of stress test, what if... 1st stage is to see when login servers break. 2st stage is to see what number will break layers/start zones and last 3 stage is see when the server craps out if they keep adding layers.
---
1 word, whitelisting
---
1 sentence, lie saying that acc age matters but get all streamers with 2 year old acc in and 2005 acc subbed since then not, collect the tons of money from new subs.
---
Perfect bussines. 
---
Now downvote, fanboys youre wellcome but till they prove me wrong, its the truth for me....
---
It‚Äôs real hard for a caster to hit you with brokentooth fucking them im the ass the whole time. Nvm concussive shot at max distance keeping the casters out of range. Also you can silence them, and on top of that depending on how you have trained your pets brokentooth can also interrupt. Where a hunter shines is against cloth,
---
It's not this sub, it's everywhere even out of reddit. It's how human nature is. This has nothing to do with vanilla.
---
I don't know in what kind of bubble you been living...they're not nice IRL and douches on the internet, they are douches everywhere they just show it when there's no consequences. In our nature, due  to our constant greed, we are all kind of douches in one way or another. 
---
Why do I have to explain this...
---
I know a guy who enjoys that.
---
Hahahaha whatever :P
---
My point is you are going to have the exact same issues whether there are streamers or not...
---
tztztz why you say that? :P
---
I actually watch way more monkeynews and perplexity. I could tell you couldn't even think about that, because you started with kiddos (insult largely used by 12 years old or overgrown necjbeards that never really reached adulthood.)
---
Asmon is definitely not the best player. But the goal of his stream is not to teach people, it is to entertain. And his the best at it. I.e. , best streamer. Btw, he never said he was good.
---
World first pog
---
A chance at testing out the beta is easily worth $15 to me and I‚Äôm not ‚Äúfilthy rich,‚Äù as you say. Do what you want with your money, but don‚Äôt flame people for doing the same with theirs :)
---
I have over 2500 hours in League, its my most played game of all time.
---
I consider "Blizzard you absolute fucking retards why arent you giving me Beta Access I have been a loyal customer for years" or "Can we please ban this guy, he should just go back to being a BFA sheep." alot more toxic than insulting some random in chat in League.
---
its not the retail players who are toxic, have u seen this sub lmao
---
Why does it matter? Even if there was, it's a good thing so people not invited could watch
---
Outstanding move
---
Don't know what the number of beta invites are so I can't say, but if we assume those numbers are correct it just makes the streamer hate part less reasonable as it boils down to people just being unlucky regardless. My point wasn't that there was few invites as much as it was that it feels moot to argue streamer privilege having a massive effect on how many people that got left out.
---
His eyebrows bug me
---
I agree with what you said about everything here. So then why did you start off with ‚Äúpersonality does not equal views‚Äù if now you‚Äôve come around to saying it all depends on the scenario, which means the person‚Äôs skill set, background, viewerbase, game of choice, or personality?
---
I've been watching Quin since his Diablo 3 days, sometimes more, sometimes less. However one thing that fucking pisses me off about him was that he was actually against Classic (he never played it before this beta by the way), alongside with people like Towcuck. 
---
I don't mind if people change opinions, however he was literally being an asshole to the Classic fans. Like I remember arguing with most of his chat full of fanboys about Classic. Now he likes Classic all of sudden, so his chat does too.
---
Don't like pressing two buttons over and over but you're excited for classic? I've got something to tell you...
---
/who is capped at 50 ppl in classic
---
Good, you've spent the last 20 mins googling and building an argument that I approve of. Well done young whippersnapper, well done. *Strokes neckbeard and steps back into the shadows*
---
He is the guy who reported they grey item as a bug for not having stats, no?
---
I never figured out how to train pets on this server so that might be an issue :D, but most casters run at you right from the start of the duel so the only option is to trap and then it usually plays out like I described.
---
&gt;Plus the game is free, they need to support themselves somehow. 
---
dota 2, path of exile, fortnite  
---
all games with all content free and they are banking it, fortnite is beating LoL as well
---
Dude, I tried for soo long to get up on that damn hut LMAO..
---
No pfui or pfquest?
---
Did you ever play on any private server? I'm not saying she's right but lets be honest, world chat on most private servers might as well be a thread on /pol/ lol. The community was definitely suuuper toxic
---
[Mirror!](https://doa.cloud/s/kWmadfregoCj2Ds) 
---
To be fair, they did give everyone a full day of playing around (even if it's just to level 5) as a bit of a thank you I'd wager, but yeah. Just memes. &lt;3
---
To be fair, if they get streamers in there, they're gonna get more people logging in. 
---
Look at Asmongold in the Alpha, surrounded by a horde of characters. I think it was a good display of how well they can cope.
---
However, it does mean that they have set the bar high for launch performance.
---
Step 1: Only test US servers
---
Step 2: Release game
---
Step 3: All non-US servers die due to no testing
---
Step 4: Surprised orc face
---
Of course they should only test one server at a time, but if they never test servers for other parts of the world they will not be prepared for launch.
---
This guy wasnt even born when our guild killed C'Thun.
---
In a friendly manner, git gud. Hunters are perfectly fine in duels.
---
Against locks. It's a matter of gear mostly. Why do you even bother with freezing trap? Just nuke them down, get yourself a pet with 1.0 attk speed + frenzy to interrupt their casting. Train shadow resistance on your pet to resist fear. FD and scattershot/intimidate their cast. If they play with felhunter, kill it, it is really squishy, then you can trap all you want.
---
Against mages: when they come into the deadzone, scattershot the first cast, FD the second. By that point the nova should be ending and you can start engaging again. Engineering helps too. 
---
With shadow priests it is difficult, but you rarely see geared shadow priests. Also, they only have shadow damage. Break out your shadow resistance gear, use the reflector. 
---
All the classes you mentioned are the worst matchup for hunters in duels, where your biggest advantage (range) does not count because of the flag. Still, there is always things you can do.
---
Let's talk about warriors, rogues, paladins, shamans, druids. Where you are having a field day against most of them. Do you still think hunters suck at duels against those?
---
Finally, no duel is really meaningful in low levels or when there is a huge gear gap. Duel anyone when you have your Dragonstalker and you will have some very good times against all classes.
---
Thats not really how you do stress tests though. The point is to see what system breaks (first) and improve in that area. Consecutive stress tests are supposed to determime how effective your improvements are and further improve if needed. The goal usually is to not have things break during the last stress test.
---
which is not what walljumping is
---
I always watched the counter striker ones, or the ones about his micro
---
It was twitch chat before twitc chat 15 years ago
---
And legion stress testing had fighting Nomi Firelord in dalaran
---
Nah I'm good. Cheers though.
---
getting under SW does not involve wall-jumping.
---
Bingo
---
This is so true.
---
Most people gave up on logging in because for the first two hours or so it was impossible to log in/create a character. Then it went a bit more smoothly as less people tried to log in. Pretty bad overall.
---
Only streamer i like out of any of them is Swifty, at least he doesn't sit there and act like he knows everything about the game.
---
You're downright ignorant if you think that
---
Why would you make a 'home' on a beta server
---
Wrong.
---
Concussive shot. Improved wing clip. Normal wing clip. Scattershot. You have a million ways to get back into range. Stop thinking about freezing trap only.
---
They succeeded is a bold claim, literally nowhere in Finland or in real life (as far as I know) do people think the OK sign has to do with white supremacy...
---
Did they change the flight path animation too? I remember seeing more variation in the angle and height as you went through the route than that. It seems really static now.
---
[FOR THE ALLIANCE YOU CUR!](https://i.imgur.com/BqiPBrv.jpg)
---
They just ignored you. Sad.
---
I would have tried to kill you at least :D
---
Experience the nostalgia and the organised chaos of having so many people in the one area?
---
wall-jumping as it originally meant in vanilla wow does not exist anymore. yes, you can get under SW -- but this does not involve wall-jumping.
---
for example: you need actual wall-jumping to get into Hyjal or on top of Orgrimmar. this will not be possible in classic.
---
Pog is different too though
---
I dont truly see how a login test would help more than a playing test, since after all we are just talking about httrequests with little data(encrypted string with the login info) gestioned by the api...
---
They could stress it using a couple computers and spamming request... not harder than a ddos attacks that got spammed by kids some years ago.. 
---
The point is that we expect to at least get in, if you know you wont be abble no matter what, why you even bother trying?.
---
Hunters have no silence in vanilla.
---
Back before cata drop and the pre launch event was active me and a group of mates did the fear glitch to get into uldum and run around killing things a gm ended up poping up and had a little fun with us after letting us know not to do it again. Sadly i have no screen shots it was years ago and they have been lost
---
I dont need to eat my spirits high enough hahaha oh man back in the day that was the best shit on the internet for me
---
Blow your money get banned, seems legit like a win win.
---
hey man, I'm starting up an eu discord with some friends that we'll turn into a guild come launch if you guys would be interested in joining? It's very small right now but I'll be working to grow it and you'd be a welcome addition :)
---
This certainly holds true for the very first gamers that entered the game. Less than one month in the fact that instances existed and deadmines was the first one for alliance, deadmines was a  set thing. Heck, I took part in the US beta at the time and people already referred to it as deadmines. 
---
Ultimately though it doesn't even matter. By now it should be common knowledge to anyone that DM in many cases will mean DeadMines. If you're in doubt, shift-click the character name and check the level - that's what people did back then, too.
---
You put in the eagle eye video, then a bunch of streamers pvping on beta? like wut...
---
I love the game, but it's quite boring to watch honestly. Once I can play the actual game I will be playing instead of watching streams. Anyway more viewers the better for popularity of the game that's for sure
---
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

AFAIK the flight path between auberdine and teldrassil is always available. you never have to learn that one.
---
https://www.adl.org/education/references/hate-symbols/okay-hand-gesture
---
If this is not success then I dont know what is
---
I think he's talking about how some people that are not invested in the game (or just Classic) yet still want to make fun of the old-school players, just because the game isn't a new release or remaster.
---
It's true that streamers are happy to get more views and cash, but most of them don't just jump on the next newest thing that brings in lots of views. They are dedicated and enjoy the game they play and love. And they're just genuinely happy that others share their enthusiasm for classic, especially if they genuinely believe the game was better back then. So when other streamers come in with the "I changed my mind, it's actually good (but more importantly, more views and clickbaits)" I can see why you get this feel of doubt about their love for classic. Still, I wouldn't judge, since if you actually hated something, you wouldn't be playing it at all
---
He‚Äôs been trying to stop negativity from spinning out of control, by timing out memes against the streamers, like mccuck
---
Because it‚Äôs a compilation video hence the title ‚ÄúClassic WoW Moments‚Äù.    A lot of people don‚Äôt have time to look through different clips on twitch so I save them the trouble by uploading regular videos so they have an easy way of seeing the content and I get to promote the streamers at the same time.  Just something nice I‚Äôd thought I‚Äôd do for the community. I don‚Äôt get paid for my efforts or anything
---
As long as you arent just letting them sit in your deadzone (5-8 yards) you should at least be able to put up a good fight.
---
I was there too! Lok‚Äôtar!
---
&gt;kids
---
I'm sure you're a well adjusted adult, getting butthurt over streamers.
---
It's been 15 years so I might be wrong. But I seem to remember it not being available automatically, and being added automatically later in the game.
---
Go outside and talk to people, use the OK hand, you'll never see anyone think you're a white supremacist because of that. Doesn't yell success to me
---
On a 1440p ultrawide monitor ultra settings, I get 100 fps with Ryzen 2700x, GTX 1080TI, 16GB DDR4 3200mhz ram. It's locked at 100, so probably higher.
---
I thought the bat screech was a silence you‚Äôre right I‚Äôll edit.

I hope they do. An lfr addon already being made is shameful

People around me are friendly, so am I. No masquerade, because it's human nature to stick with a group of people. If I am toxic to all my friends and coworkers I am alone - why would I do that? Of course I am greedy in some ways, but it doens't mean it is on cost of other people. And just because there are no consequences does this mean people cannot stick to their principles and be fucking nice to each other?
---
This is just two-faced shit.
---
The names sound like chinese knockoffs of the real legendaries.
---
Not in particular, most of the path is walkable, and the only time you somewhat need walljump is when jumping against a tree (which is more about getting stuck between the tree model and the terrain) as well as a very small incline, but that incline might simply have spots where you can just barely stand.
---
No doubt that in the end they got the data that they needed because the initial zones were packed. I just think it's silly to claim that even though thousands of people couldn't connect to the server, they were stress testing it. The server has a certain capacity, when it's reached, you're out and that's it. Putting people in a queue is nothing new for Blizz, they've been doing that for 15 years now.
---
At this point you guys are just arguing over semantics and I was trying to bring it back to a positive light.
---
This looks awesome! Thanks for sharing. I guess I should‚Äòve stayed up till 1. RIP EU
---
Being disappointed is testament to blasphemy nowadays.
---
Personally I'm bloody tired of how some react to criticism or frustration nowadays.
---
Asmongold is popular because of his personality. He might not be the best at the game but so what? Him struggling and finding things out on the go is part of the fun.  If watching some neckbeard min-maxer execute his minutely planned-out route for the 1000th time is what you define to be proper streaming, then I'm sure there's lots of those to choose from too (just scroll down all the way to the bottom of the WoW streams page).
---
Here you have someone who gets to genuinely rediscover Classic WoW and some of you people in this sub just shit all over them for it. Don't hate on someone because they don't know the game as well as you do. Be happy he's exposing tons of viewers to the game you love. Your comments are just drooping in the whole "Virgin min-maxer vs Chad casual" vibe. It just comes over as pathetic.
---
Its cool, but do we need 15 of them tho?
---
Aye that's true.  There'd be a lot of streamer followers and subs all trying to get in, which would have put a heavy load on the server for sure.  That only adds to the theory though that streamers got privileged access since they didn't seem to have to worry about server issues.  It makes sense for Blizzard to do so since it shows to the tens of thousands of people watching that Blizzard are doing their jobs, and then they get to generate hype by interacting with streamers and spawning elite mobs and bosses.
---
It's safe to say from being invited to Blizz HQ, getting immediate access to the beta, and having no issues with the stress test, that many big name streamers are getting preferential treatment and I worry how long that will continue into release.
---
I lost it at "I AM GOD-KING SKOVALD" :D
---
First thing is first.. alliance or horde?
---
Jesus Christ some of you people are so entitled. Its a stress test. The whole point was for shit loads of people to put pressure on the servers. If the servers can't cope, that is something the Devs need to know. Then they can steps to make sure it doesn't happen at launch. That is the literally the entire point. Not for you to scratch your vanilla itch. The game will release soon enough. If you are invited to help test it
---
Streamers getting prioriticed is understandable but it lessens the Classic feeling imo. Back in the day there were no "high class" in Azeroth other than those guilds that made them selves it ingame (like those who got the Scarab Lord).
---
Now you get advantages for being popular outside of the game. It's no gamebreaking thing, but it's still something some of us personally does not like.
---
I need online aura / adi button auras for warlock
---
Play whatever race seems the coolest to you(orcs btw) and whatever class that has the most appealing gameplay. Kargoz on YouTube has some nice class overviews for beginners. Good luck and welcome to the community!
---
Lol we had 40 people in NS for like 2 hours, i just left but they are still going
---
Say what you want about the dumpster fire that is current retail WoW but a largely toxic community is not one of the issues that game has. If we're going by private server community interaction, classic players/enthusiasts tend to be infinitely more toxic and gatekeepy.
---
Looks like MS Paint to me
---
I think you mean "chad min-maxer vs virgin casual" ;)
---
I suppose it'll be worth it if it makes the actual launch servers more stable.  Perhaps in the next stress test they'll let more people in, but I think if they don't repeat what they did last night, with GMs creating hilarity and summoning bosses then people will just get even more jaded.
---
The double edged sword of letting the streamers get access is that it also showed people who couldn't get in what they missed and they'll be expecting it next time.
---
&gt;I have literally just seen someone compare Blizzard to the nazi regime and requiring a sub to login, to the regimes brainwashing. This has reached a new level. 
---
Link?
---
&gt; If I pay real life cash for in-game currency, this will ruin the economy because you are adding an element which is not moderated. Everyone in the game can achieve the same gold (give/take) if they did the same job (essentially what you want, an even playing ground), however IRL people make more money than others.
---
Therefore i will come in pay for 2 tokens ($50), sell them for 500 in game gold, i exchanged IRL currency for in-game currency cause instability in the economy, because not everyone has access to the $50 that I do.
---
This already happens in game with chinese gold farmers and gold trading sites. So it wont be something new which is introduced into the game. One could argue that it would increase the amount of people who trade gold for money. And your argument is the best one i've heard (by far) from anyone in this thread. And i can genuinly understand your worry.
---
However i feel that it breaks down when you look at all the other avenues of the game that are "unfair" because of outside influence. A person that does not have a lot of time to play the game will not have the same chance to get rank 14. The same can be applied to a variety of things in the game. You could also argue that people with fewer friends interested in WoW will have a harder time finding groups for dungeons or raids.
---
In your example
---
&gt; Now I'm 500 gold richer by using daddies credit card to by Krol Blade, where it may take someone 4 weeks to get enough gold to buy one.
---
It could take a person 4 weeks to get the gold to buy Krol Blade, but for someone else it might take 4 months because they do not have enough spare time to farm gold as quickly as you.
---
So there is already plenty of real-life influence on how people do in the game. And i dont think there would be any recognizeable downsides to let people trade game time for gold.
---
I think it is important to make a distinction between trading money for gold and WoW tokens for gold. If a person can earn real money from selling gold then there will be people who have huge incentives to monopolize markets or farming spots in order to profit. But since you wont be able to trade gold for money, only game time, this wont be an issue.
---
You don't understand a shit joke.
---
One thing I haven't seen discussed is: what happens if the population doesn't decrease as they expected, and merging layers at the end of phase 1 would result in overpopulation? What happens then?

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_controversy
---
Watch the video OP linked.
---
**Gamergate controversy**
---
The Gamergate controversy stemmed from a harassment campaign conducted primarily through the use of the hashtag #GamerGate. The controversy centered on issues of sexism and progressivism in video game culture. Gamergate is used as a blanket term for the controversy as well as for the harassment campaign and actions of those participating in it.
---
Beginning in August 2014, a harassment campaign targeted several women in the video game industry; notably game developers Zo√´ Quinn and Brianna Wu, as well as feminist media critic Anita Sarkeesian.
---
I only need dmgMeter.
---
And I don't remember but could you customize the raidmember display in classic? And the skillbars ... It's been to long

They don't need to be important, just more important than you. Suck it up and stop crying.

Because it discourages actually getting out there and talking to people
---
No one will get banned lol. The more players they ban the less subs they have they only really ban exploits. I‚Äôm paying for. 1-60 boost because I‚Äôve already done it and don‚Äôt wanna have to take two weeks off work to do it manually with all the headaches that come with it.
---
&gt;Enchanting is great too, folk always need weapons and gear enchanted
---
Frankly this is not a good advice imo. You're going to sink a lot of gold into it and you're not sure to make the money back if you don't have rare recipes. And you have to waste a lot of time in /2 to advertise your services.
---
I wouldn't recommend enchanting if you have a job (unless you're the dedicated guild enchanter).
---
You used the good old way from Loch Modan? Can you still do the first jump behind the tree?
---
Blizzard summoned bosses on many test before, that was rxactly ehat I was expecting, but sadly I wasn't ablt to create character
---
He‚Äôs hilarious. Donation read: ‚ÄúI have depression, how can I stop it?‚Äù
---
‚ÄúPlay Classic WoW, will fix it right up‚Äù
---
Chat explodes into LUL‚Äôs
---
And before anyone has him up for replying to a serious issue with a joke response, a viewer that may or may not have depression has asked a streamer, not a doctor, for advice.
---
50g x 2 = 100g every week ;-)
---
I literally sat and watched streamers get in without any issues they did not face any of the same issues others did. I sat trying to log getting to character creation and timing out while watching streamers make 2 characters with ease.
---

The comment after that one. Enjoy!

Seeing this comment on this sub is the funniest thing I swear. Every third post on a normal day is shutting on retail or those who like it, let's not act like this is that unusual
---
Loving his videos tbh. Thanks for sharing.
---
Not trying to have a go here, but I'm skeptical that his (wedding) videos on the channel are not from the retail servers. The quality of the videos is amazing, no where near the wcm standard back in the day '05 or '06. 
---
Maybe its because i'm a Vurtne fanboy, but can't help in noticing a great resemblance in the play style of the two of them.
---
I did get an achievement for 2 concurrent streamers aw yeah twitch.tv/nickau
---
Honestly I'd rather streamers get in so I can atleast watch and enjoy Clsssic content instead of Blizzard handing out the 100 odd streamer beta keys to random people who don't stream. People also forget that streamers tend to put alot of hours into playing, so they're bound to find some bugs even if they're not actively trying to find bugs.
---
The creator of pfui has said that he cant be assed to rewrite the code for classic unfortunatly
---
Who cares that one person that garners hundreds of thousands of views for our game gets to avoid the queue? It's literally one guy, even if you add up every single popular streamer or content creator you probably couldn't even list 100 spread across both NA and EU and multiple servers. They bring attention to the game and blizzard helps them out so their career isnt playing queue simulator 2019, I dont see the issue.
---
I'm not much of a wow player. In fact, I just started playing and subscribed last week when I heard the news of classic beta cause I wanted to give it a try (I don't think wow was even available where I live 15 years ago). But if I knew my invite to stress test was an invite to try get past a login and character creation screens for an hour, I'd probably just call it a night and go to bed at midnight instead of 2 AM. Problems and queues were expected, but I do feel kinda duped out of couple hours of sleep just to be a meat bag throwing queries at login servers with no real chance of getting in even for 5 minutes. Just some bad taste left in my mouth.
---
You missed his point - he said that because he knows it's capped at 50. OP says that despite /who being capped he couldn't interact with others the way he would expect in so crowded locations.
---
Thanks suppose it makes a huge difference levelling until 30!
---
calm down gramps, dont you know videogames are for kids?
---
Gravity doesn't kill anyone - it's the stop at the end that gets you.
---
This is 50 gold max for one respec in Classic.
---
50 gold is between 1 and 2 hours of farming depending on your efficiency.
---
Levelling another char is minimum 5 days of /played (so probably something like 15 days and a few months IRL).
---
Thanks for not having a beta invite :)
---
As a player since 2003 but all our great streamers are invited
---
Someone seems to have confirmation bias.
---
I'M FROM ELWYNN FOREST, AND I SAY - KILL 'EM ALL!

Time to have social exp√©riences back again
---
I guess you can still have an ingame friend list just like the old time (besides from B.net)
---
Ya, it was picked up by Showcase for only a month or two in like 2010 or 2011. I think it only aired in Canada.
---
mentally ill, literally.
---
Well bad for you, because you can see GMs having fun on tests, unique expirience is better than doing what you would do on live
---
I‚Äôm in a similar position: love Tauren warrior but Orc stun resist is just too good
---
based
---
For faction, pick the same one as your friends. If none of your friends play WoW, decide if you want to play a Paladin or a Shaman, as these classes are faction exclusive. If you don't want to play either, just pick the one with the race you think looks coolest. For class, decide what role(s) you like to fill (Tank, Healer, melee dps, ranged dps). Once you have picked that, look up the differences between the different classes that can fill these roles. Or ask here on WSIP threads.
---
The name "stress test" didn't give you a hint that this was an oppurtunity to test the servers to their limit?
---
You cheated yourself from your sleep by being that na√Øve.
---
Remember today they were messing around with Layer size, at launch, every layer will be the size of a vanilla wow population cap server, so it's basically the same thing as being on your own, vanilla-sized server, except you can jump between them with group invites.
---
Probably no mana tide
---
makes sense now :P
---
If you enjoy watching classic content but don‚Äôt always have the time to keep up with the streamers and clips then check out my channel that I recently put together to give people frequent highlights of the beta footage. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5qDWKzxHkMseEsw8PwFtKA
---
Can't blame you for that, I wouldn't believe it myself if I hadn't seen it, lol
---
Stresstest.
---
How do they test the servers the best way if it wasn't killing everyone at the same time?
---
I challenge your 2500 hour number.  I have maybe 25 hours in League and the toxicity drove me away from MoBAs forever.  At least I still enjoy watching DotA.
---
Part of the original experience and why Vanilla is revered is ‚Äòinvestment‚Äô.
---
If you put in the time and effort into forming or joining a group you feel an investment in the group formed.
---
When things go wrong in LFG and LFR, you say some snide shit and leave.
---
When your invested you are more forgiving and provide assistance to those who may not have the knowledge. When that happens, you embed yourself into a community.
---
How did you get that out of his comment dude üòÇ
---
A zoomer named Lilzoom LMAO THIS IS FUCKING GOLD!
---
**YOU THINK YOU DO BUT YOU DON‚ÄôT**
---
That's the beauty of the warrior. You got massive damage, massive health and massive tank. It was near unbeatable lol.
---
You just started playing wow last week and you got an invite to stress test?
---
lol "feminist media critic Anita Sarkeesian" wtf :D
---
Plus it‚Äôs not like when these streamers ‚Äúgot in‚Äù they weren‚Äôt the first in there. Asmon was one of the last people to spawn in on his initial gnome raid
---
I'm still using my old Notebook from 2010.
---
Intel Atom N450 (1.66 GHz)  
---
1GB DDR2 SDRAM  
---
I remember playing TBC on it, although it didn't run very smoothly. 
---
Maybe Classic will be playable on the Classic option plus really low settings.
---
I really don't want to buy a new laptop or desktop.
---
All you need is a wow sub.
---
What could you possibly have done through wow that is worthy of an apology 15 years later? You're not overdramatizing it?
---
You really had us in the first half there.
---
When you had 2 broken hands did you get a sweet handjob from your hot step mom?
---
It won‚Äôt be asmons guild that gets it. Not a chance. It will be an experienced private server guild
---
There is no real reason because it just make you click a Button instead of spam the chat a lot. 
---
People thing that the Addon could port you but you still have to go to the dungeons and people will still chat in Party.
---
WOW (pun intended) it was the same for me. It wasnt totally outside the realm of probability. It's kind-of a sad testament to what the former small hobby of video games has turned into a gargantuan money-titan-industry.
---
Ahha, sorry, mb then. Thought you meant to say vanilla classes were balanced, but the /s makes sense :)
---
One tip is to not play the game alone. Find irl friends or in-game quickly and stick with them. 
---
As for classes I'd suggest an easy leveling class like the warlock/hunter/druid. Also a somewhat rare class which usually means druid/priest/warlock but some strawpolls in this subreddit shows they might be quite popular. I still think they will be relatively rare, especially warlocks on alliance side. 
---
So I'd recommend warlock for alliance and druid for horde.
---
They are going to be tea bagged into oblivion.  Corpse camping was a thing in vanilla.

My Acer C720 Chrome Book from 2013 can run it between 10 and 30 fps on lowest of settings lol. I run Chrome OS and Ubuntu at same time via Crouton. I run the WoW client through Lutris + Wine.

Its satire.
---
He is funny and charismatic and loveable, it's very simple.
---
What a waste of life
---
If the end result is more people will get into classic then I suppose it's fine that streamers get priority.
---
Yup, I think I subscribed like 2 days ago. Blizz account dates back to Diablo 2 days though.
---
Thankfully 90% of streamers are US based
---
such mature behavior of the wow classic fans, really those retailers should learn to treat otherpeople decently and respect their opinions...
---
And yet pretty much nobody was expecting it to drop before August. Even 8/1 wouldn‚Äôt lend itself to ‚Äúclassic summer‚Äù if people are interpreting it to mean the summer can be spent on it
---
People can change their minds, but their social media posts are forever.
---
It works, barely. 10fps with tons of players on screen. ~25fps when away from the huge crowd.
---
It tested my stress alright staying up till midnight on a worknight only to not get in.
---
LOL YOU FELL FOR IT!!:D:D::DD
---
Okay thanks for the advise! I'll check out Kargoz's videos.
---
Its all in the game.
---
How do people not understand that letting the streamers in creates more overall login attempts which is the entire point.
---
Another person who has no clue what the word priority means lol. It doesn't mean everyone else is excluded completely. I
---
I'm thinking Horde, but not 100% just yet haha
---
1500 Hours on my old account, 1 800 TOP LANE on EUW before I was permabanned.
---
1000 Hours since then on my new account, Rintar0 0kabe after my permaban.
---
If you want an easy comparison compare this sub to the LoL sub. LoL sub is way more civil. LoL ingame "toxicity" is just kids throwing basic insults at eachother, thats nothing to the cult-like attitude permeating the Classic community.
---
From my experience folks tend to be friendlier on RP servers, and most of them know how to actually spell words correctly. Less toxicity and stuff.
---
Maybe. Thing about most Classic raids and MC especially they require basically NO tactics. They just require Numbers. Enough Mana to outheal. Enough Damage to kill Raggy adds / only one Add phase / Enough Decurse, Enough Stam to survive. 
---
So for MC at least the World First will most likely go to whomever can put in the most hours, long before it goes to whomever has the most skill. Unless it's coming down to the wire in terms of hours and minutes.
---
&gt; The goal usually is to not have things break during the last stress test.
---
Exactly, and now at FIRST test people complain that they didnt get to "play".
---
https://classicwow.live/guides/488/world-of-warcraft-classic-compendium
---
That fucking haircut gets me every time.
---
If you need to be told, this game isn't catering your demographic.
---
Yeah they do ban people who are vocal in public about purchasing "services" from third party sites.
---
Guess that means you won't be around come release (and thank god for that)
---
The entitlement of some people is mind boggling
---
And here I was thinking the wow classic community couldn't become any more pathetic in their whinging.
---
Holy/Reckoning paladin with spell damage equip (T2+ or S14) with proper weapon is strong. You can heal effectively and also deal quite a bit of damage
---
and yet most wow classic community were on the 16 july hype train. but yea sure nobody expected it before August. i just imagined all those posts about it.
---
Probably. I kinda expected 20-30 minutes of battling the login screens. Streamers got in after 40 mins so I wasn't that far off. Gave up after 1 hr, when I was going to go sleep anyway.
---
From lvl1 almost everything revolves around killing mobs so it will be hard not to show them. Maybe fishing? The racing track at thousand needles?
---
Facebook streamers are dead streamers
---
I started playing in 05 when I was 10 and had a blast just leveling through the world. I wasn't a native English speaker so I learned the language through the game as well. I think WoW is a great game for a child to play. You communicate with other people and let your imagination run wild as you explore and progress.
---
There's no reason to rewrite pfui when elvui is coming.
---
If I had to hire a bodyguard I would probably not hire a rogue, if he's stealthed chance are high that by the time he's in range to attack your ganker you're already dead so a lvl 60 unstealthed would be more useful as a means of deterrence to potential ganker + if the guy is following me he'd better be helping me in my grinding so a mage or better a paladin that could rez me would be a better option IMO
---
He complains about chat spam as if he is above people having fun. Of course if he was in control of chat it would only consist of the highest level of discourse.
---
It was oddly worded in the post, said that stress test is 2 hours, and that the server shuts down next day. So... dunno if stress test ppl can access the server just the 2h or the full 24 h. Some ppl did post that they got in way later than the first 2 hours, so guessing its the 24h then.
---
Don‚Äôt ruin my dreams :(
---
For race I would play any alliance race or Tauren, none of the other Horde races.
---
For class, I would play a caster class instead of a melee based class.
---
Casting smite as a priest is visually less violent than swinging a sword or an axe at a foe, at least in the way I see it.
---
Other than that, I would avoid killing monsters when I could, for example, go around the world collecting flight paths, go fishing, or just save a bunch of far away quests to deliver for whenever your kids are watching, and you have 15 mins of walking and scenery.
---
Good luck!
---
1) Strafing turns your character 90 degrees instead of keeping it facing forward if you are targeting something
---
2) Spell batching window seems super huge, things look delayed
---
3) Looting seems slow
---
4) Buying items from vendors is slow (doesnt appear in your bags for like half a sec+ )
---
Well, for one it creates an "us and them" mentality.  People are already talking about avoiding any servers streamers are going to be playing on.  For me personally I'm just worried about how much extra privileges are these streamers going to enjoy going into Classic.  Obviously they'll not get any boosts from Blizzard, but they'll have Blizzard's ear.  Will they be able to get people banned who gank them for example?
---
We keep thinking that streamers are just one of us but that hasn't been the case for a while now.  The big name streamers are all in the pockets of the big companies and they should be treated as such.
---
Well not really but it's nice to not have to wait until like lvl13 for a wand
---
Hmm.....get a chill wife i would suggest.
---
Its a fucking comic game, there is more violance in todays TV shows for kids.
---
Spamming "LF2M SFK need tank and dps" in whatever zone you happen to be and have someone replying "inv" is such a great and complex social experience that I honestly don't know how we can live without that.
---
That said, LFG system was part of vanilla in form of meeting stones so I have nothing against these type of addons.
---
What actually made people to talk each other in vanilla was long slow pace and long distances between quest objectives or instance entrances. When you had 30 min walk to dungeon and nothing else to do than get to know fellow players that kinda forces some kind of talk between players, just to fight boredom. It might be different this time, because most of us can just open second monitor and watch netflix if they feel like they don't want socialize, that wasn't an option 15 years ago, and banning addons won't chance that.
---
This is just sucking his dick. 
---
I have 0 issue with any other streamer. 
---
Towelliee is just an egotistical cunt, he has average as fuck content and thinks he is right on everything when he is rarely right at all. 
---
Then he shits on other streamers to try and gain popularity but whilst those streamers are sat in the tens of thousands, he‚Äôs barely scraping 2-3k during Classic beta... the mans just a shit lord.
---
It destroys the whole idea of having to communicate to find people to form a group with.
---
Also druid might intrigue them a lot since he turns into animals :) mage is just flashy and pleasant to look at and the hunter has a pet, these three would be cool choices to keep them entertained
---
Do you really want to stand by the ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no gamebreaking thing‚Äù part of your message? I‚Äôm not against streamers, but it would be in my opinion... ‚Äúfoolish‚Äù to not see the consequences a server will face when housing big streamers.
---
Was about to say, all the bullshit vanilla fanboys heard when mentioning way back.  Now that it's coming to life, we are flinging that shit right back.
---
I was watching Chance aka soda and he never got special treatments. I saw him 2300 in queue and I was 2200 I got in before him. Why would you do a stress-test with privileges? makes no sense.
---
Too bad WOW doesn't have family name, I'd totally name my char Elvis Frits ! :D
---
Okay thank you! Are there any classes or roles that are alittle more advanced then others?
---
Find someone who looks at you, like Asmongold looks at Ragnaros!
---
The owner of FlyLo airlines plays wow?
---
Honestly I never maxed a crafting profession in Vanilla. I didn't even have a mount until TBC (Travel Form + PvP set was slightly faster than a regular mount). On the other hand it was *extremely* rare to see someone use engineering gadgets or powerful consumables (e.g. Free Action Potion). The popular PvP videos make it seem like everyone had them, but I can't remember even one instance of someone throwing a stun grenade at me.
---
This may well turn out differently in Classic. I expect more people will be using those things, and I'll probably go Engineering myself, even on a Druid. You still spend a lot of time out of forms, and some items you can use and then shift if I'm not mistaken.
---
lmao i love it
---
You‚Äôve just summed up his entire content plan for his next stream haha
---
Slayers of Hogger and the only guild fight Level 5+ cross-server Horde in their own lands.
---
I think they had the beta already though and that's why they got in faster? 
---
Streamers give the game more fame, so it's like an advertisement for Classic.
---
You can't complain about them getting in since they only take up about 50slots. It's the people that were fighting for open slots, not streamers.
---
I think you may have your tinfoil hat on a little bit too tight there bud. People dont want to avoid streamer servers to avoid the streamers, they do because they want to avoid their awful fanbases and also avoid the thousands of people trying to log on to that server to give their favourite streamer 50 copper.

What would the point be? You find an item you don't know what looks like, you control click it think "that looks kinda cool", and then you never look at it again.
---
Where is Angwe when you need him the most ?!
---
I love it when staff in games have a personality as opposed to being stiff, order-following robots. I mean I understand customer service and that but seriously, live a little, have some fun - which these guys seem to be bringing back
---
I remember too! That Illidan thing is crazy... oh dude how all this stuff works.. just awesome.

We got rag on ours.
---
The real game isn't even out until August, why would you even try to get in?
---
To waste time on starting zones? Go to a private server then.
---
No use wasting words here about your choices, I know it's hype but we still gotta wait another 3 months or so
---
I mean I saw shitposts like ‚ÄúI just woke up today and farted, which means July 16 release!‚Äù Just a bunch of wishful thinking. Looking into the posts most of the actual thoughts were ‚ÄúI know it probably won‚Äôt be til August but I really hope *insert earlier date based on their vacation or something*
---
Its just a stress test. Less than 24 hour access to get to level 5. Couldnt even log on till Thursday morning due to the stressed out servers lol
---
Same, really happy to see it added to the list.
---
Nope
---
Legend has it- that he worked night and day, with no sleep nor water or food- And on the 29th day When the red moon passed the stars of oblivion. He emerged from the cave holding an USB token labeled WoW:Classic
---
Vanilla wow's community never drove me away.
---
LoL's definitely did, so much so that I cant even enjoy a moba due to the anxiety of dealing with the deluge of shit from players.
---
Why ask me a question and tell me not to waste my words?  I'm a little confused.
---
I think you‚Äôre underestimating some bosses, garr, major-domo, rag will cause inexperienced players trouble. Asmon is one of those inexperienced players in comparison to say monkeynews‚Äô guild. It may not be too difficult but I can‚Äôt see him getting it.
---
Do your characters get deleted? Or should I be creating one to save my character name?
---
seething
---
Why is streamer privilege a bad thing? I and 200k other people got to enjoy the stress test event because they allowed streamers in. Are you suggesting they don't prioritise the majority of their fanbase?
---
Doubt you know all of them if you say that...
---
Turn on the tv and compare what you see there to wow. 
---
We grew up watching tv and the violence didn‚Äôt affect us. Why would wow‚Äôs cartoon violence affect someone? Do you forbid your kids to watch tv too?
---
Trust me we grew up fine learning about violence this way. Everyone eventually learns about violence. At least we learned it through a screen.
---
Another unoriginal meme
---
You don‚Äôt need to buy classic. Just get a base wow subscription.
---
Sorry where did this figure come from, also you can‚Äôt break an economy within 2 weeks of a launch when the economy isn‚Äôt even formed yet....takes time. What are people going to do, jack up prices when no one is even buying them yet or has money too? Or are they gonna hoard mats and then when everyone else is 60 jack up the prices which would make people just go farm it themselves.
---
Honestly you have no point and this is just troll.
---
&gt; Wife is sensitive to me exposing kids to violence, death, the undead, or other such unsavoury items at a young age. Fair enough.
---
Mate it's not "fair enough", it's paranoia. I've been playing video games since 5-6 year old, including watching my uncle play Quake 2 when we were visiting him and it didn't make me violent, I was one of the calmest kids on the block.
---
I think your best shot is trying to change your wife's strange opinion. From what you said the only thing I can conclude with is she makes no sense, despite you shrugging it off.
---
You have "undead" and "violence" in fcking Harry Potter and the first book is definitely aimed for children.
---
WUAGNAWOS
---
OP didn't even mention tanking or AoE farming lol.
---
That's not what they are supposed to be testing
---
It's a stress test not a beta test
---
I have 3 accounts on retail and got flagged on two accounts for the stress test these were named wow1 and wow4. My wow1 account still can‚Äôt get past world server screen without saying none are available, yet my wow4 account can log all the way in and get into the world just fine
---
I mean I actually liked him less when I figured out he was just trolling for content nonstop. 
---
But to each his own - there's very little reason to care about streamers at all.
---
I've found I really really like Preach, his videos are extremely watchable.
---
i think the point isnt about his skill level, but about him shouting at other people while not having the skill level to justify his behaviour  
---
i dont know if he's actually done that, its just what i think the otehr guy is trying to say
---
Yeah, why play the game when you can just pay someone else to play it for you? I hope Blizzard bans people like you asap
---
Well, I'd think the biggest factor would be to ensure they could stream it.  Although it was a test, it doesn't look good to Blizzard if all they are streaming is constant disconnects from the login server.  They want to keep building hype for Classic's launch and letting the big streamers in plays to that.  I mean, look at how both this and the WoW mainsub are talking about bosses being spawned?  Thanks to the streamers that will be spread like wildfire across the internet.
---
I can't fault Blizzard for that I guess.  I just have to hope I can get in on it next time.
---
Glad to hear you got Beta access. I‚Äôve just been playing with a group of level 5‚Äôs in stress test. Another priest gave me a Lesser Magic Wand. I was made up!
---
But that, doesn't, change - if you use an addon.
---
The face of a true wow fan! Asmonbald for prezz!
---
Someone explain to me why the servers would still be so stressed 15 years later. There's been enormous advances in cpu and network bandwidth. Are blizzard just being "efficient"(cheap)?
---
I dont mind the vqueue type "LFG" addon that actually is just a chat parser that shows last 5 minutes of ppl shouting for ppl in chat. Anything more automated than that, naah. Your server reputation, what you do etc still matters just like in vanilla.
---
It saves time when you dont have to scroll through multiple chat windows if you are afk for a minute or two.
---
Much rather just run with guildies, so not a big issue in the long run.
---
Swifty doesn't pull stuff out of his ass, he will sit there and speculate in a way that leads you to believe that he is attempting to figure out or remember the answer. Also he genuinely does know a LOT of weird little niche things off the tops of his head, and I'll often go over to wowhead to confirm usually impressed at the tidbit.
---
I liked him less after I figured that out, but to each his own.
---
Garr: Warlocks don't be full idiots for the Banish. Bring at least 5. 3 wild can be managed. Asmon will have hundreds of Fans to choose from, bring 8 Warlocks and Faceroll Garr.
---
Domo: Bring Mages, Sheep Caster adds. Nuke one add at a time and don't go full Monkey Brain with AoE.
---
Rag: Melee move from explosion, Nuke Adds when Adds spawn. Tanks tant on Knockback. It's about having the Numbers to nuke adds before they Manaburn your healers to shit and kill Rag before second add phase. You get 2 add phase healers will be OOM.
---
There is literally nothing hard about those bosses if you have the right Comp, and with 80 000 viewers to chose from for his Comp he will have it. It's literally just Numbers.
---
Lol, that was the most stupid and uncorrect comment i've seen about layering yet. You managed to prove you don't understand what layering is, what server structure is and slam Blizzard about both those things (when you clearly don't understand it) at the same time.
---
Well done!
---
It's ok buddy, in about 6 years you'll be able to drive to OPs house and tell him that.
---
Back in the day I had a very shitty laptop. When my first ever character entered Orgrimmar my game crashed almost instantly, and everytime I tried to login back again it was the same.
---
RIP my dude still stuck there in Org limbo since I lost that account information, you deserved better.
---
I still form my groups the old way. Instead of spamming trade chat I spam my guild chat (big guild).
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people don‚Äôt join big guilds. It‚Äôs literally a different experience.
---
I really hope some of these get broken, obviously the LFR addon will get broken but I hope smaller things like Nameplate Distance addon/script don't get through. Part of the awesomeness of vanilla is using terrain to your advantage to get around people. Can't do that if people can have nameplates toggled 80 yards away
---
 But why? Ive been just as excited as the next person, refreshing this subreddit almost hourly for months. When the beta and release was announced I was refreshing my email and client hourly as well for a beta invite that I never got. I was pretty excited for the stress test but after reading its details...its meh. Couldn‚Äôt log on after a couple hours so I stopped even trying, no point lol. Especially not staying up later on a work night. Its not a real beta unfortunately.
---
People are really struggling to put 2+2 together recently. It's easier to just rage.
---
I hope this is the case for classic, but Chinese servers on retail is pretty ridiculous when it comes to gold, level boosts and rheblike.
---
No
---
Ye thats true
---
Lfg tools that dont use cross-realm pool of players wouldnt be very effective, its not using cross-realm that made the social interactions important. 
---
   You build your reputation and people get to know you. As your reputation grows people will whisper you directly to say tank for them, rather then spamming zone chat
---
Trust me lfg is cancer
---
I know the tactics, the point is he doesn‚Äôt. Not will he make any effort to learn them prior. I don‚Äôt think he will even be 60 before rag is downed.
---
Did you see my other comment explaining myself? In the end it comes down to how much time - and money they wanna invest into this game.
---
I played every GTA from the beginning and never stole anything
---
All we had late night was 5-8 horde tracking through Elwynn either stomping, or getting the stomp. Eventually the horde had three left, and about seven paladins chased them off.
---
Playing casters makes it look less violent when you "defeat" the enemies.
---
Weakauras? Nameplates? Castbar? UI? 
---
WTF... its classic and all those addons should be disabled by blizz.
---
If you want a fully modified client stick with BFA.
---
Unbelievable...
---
I'm curious about that too, though I think RP-PvE ISA safe bet.
---
He's such a toxic meanie!!
---
That‚Äôs a meme
---
Honestly it makes sense for Blizzard to butter up Asmongold because if he's hyping Classic he's not talking ill of BfA and if the end result is that he gets more subs for Blizzard then it's a win/win for them.
---
Money changes people.
---
However you're right about how it's the stream monsters people will more likely be avoiding.  That's another issue with streamers though, although one that's not quite their fault.  I certainly don't want to be harassed by dozens of fanboys because I mined the wrong node.
---
Fishing in Elwynn while gathering some herbs booiii
---
Troll confirmed
---
What are the consequences exactly? Can it be worse than playing on the same realm as a guild pushing for world firsts?
---
The only annoying thing about this whole test was that it had a very specific time frame that it would occur. It was completely scheduled, so people may have put their time aside for it when they got their invitation, and couldn‚Äôt even set foot in-game for that entire 2 hour testing period.
---
I understand that failing to login probably helped in some way, but Blizzard also understands the demand for this game. I‚Äôm an example of someone who is only really looking forward to Classic. I‚Äôm not playing anything else. So getting any opportunity I can to participate in these types of things is a big deal for me. While sitting there for 2.5 hours doing nothing but watching streamers have a good time, I felt like a complete dumbass for even being this excited about it all together. I felt disappointed that I had built up this excitement for this testing period, even if it would be a chaotic laggy disaster, only to basically get locked out of a cool memorable experience that I deserved to partake in as much as anyone else. No matter how hyped up I get, I can‚Äôt ‚Äúturbo-sub‚Äù to WoW or something, they‚Äôre gonna get my 15 dollars a month no matter what, so just let me play if you‚Äôre gonna invite me to play.
---
Now you only read half of that sentence then, the subtext was to not waste your words complaining.
---
You'll get your chance to play soon enough.
---
Brutal, gets my upvote though. One thing im excited for is the insane leveling times and no quest hubs, that itself should purge undesired demographic groups infamous for their low attention span

Disable chat. Let them level 1-5 in Northshire Abbey.

How about People who earned it during real classic and dont have time now to raid that much again ?
---
For example I had TF and almost Full T3 during classic. Well I still have it now of Course on my lvl 85 warri which I stopped during Wotlk :D
---
Would it be legit for to pay them ? (I dont mean by TOS or sth.)...
---
Not that I think about it. Would never pay that much Money for virtual stuff, but just as example.
---
But of Course I am going to buy Gold in classic, because no way I will farm those 1000g for epic Mount ever again :D
---
No achievements in classic
---
I'm in exalted with Taco Bell
---
I always found them to be cancerous to gaming communities.
---
The first time people started making frag movies in cs 1.6, a toxic competitivity rised above the ground.
---
There's a difference here you aren't making. You are referring to hating on a game you don't understand, which is fair. If you don't give something an honest attempt you may never now if you like it or not, at which point you judge what you see. What he is talking about is pointing fingers at the community itself and how they're bad people, which I think isn't something you should get over, because that isn't an aspect you magically just change the way you are putting it.
---
It's great they enjoy classic and I hope their opinion on the community changes for the better, but "get over it" is such a cop-out response to say "I don't want to hear your whining so shut up".
---
Google hard skill to have
---
You dont Need to buy anything. Just Sub. 
---
And no, you dont Need the newest addon, so just create a starter account (or use your old account) and Sub.

Correct, but names are not xxxaragornxx either.

There will come a day. When least expected. Relaxing in goldshire. A fel wind blows, some strange sounds are heard, and before anybody has a clue.... Doomguard.

Network scales super bad as you add more people. Going from 3 to 4 people means you need to send 6 extra locations, (3 old people the new location of the 4th person and the 4th person the 3 old people location).
---
going from 100 to 101 means you need to send 200 extra location's for adding 1 person. and this is just location data which needs to be updated constantly... just a fundamental limit on the amount of people you can have in a single location unless you start separating people a.k.a sharding.
---
Just seen the video yesterday, its decent (im veteran vanilla stock). For casual play hunters have deffo their value
---
Also you get to loot everything because everything is hunter item
---
So I started this guild as a joke, and we got over 300 members in less than an hour.  
---
We grouped for a photo, killed Gamon and Hogger! This is how excited we are for the Classic drop!
---
They don‚Äôt. And u know they don‚Äôt they arnt gonna ban hundreds of thousands of players a lot are gonna be getting boosted. I will be around and u know that :) buying gold and dominating hard
---
yeah I made a video about this too. it's super annoying, and strafe is buggy too. I hope they fix it ASAP.
---
I noticed that when I use raptor strike as my bow is about to shoot it completly stops all my attacks and I cannot attack until I cancel my raptor strike.

Because most people are slaves to their emotions and only see things in black and white.

Ofc Its good
---
Might be fake, dont know. In fact those legendary items were never ingame, therefore not removed.
---
There was one legendary necklace which dropped only once and was removed after that, because it was unintended that it was still ingame. 
---
The Player who got it was allowed to Keep it.

Thanks for making this post, makes me glad to see. I don't game on my laptop but I liked the idea of playing classic on it. This makes me confident that it'll be feasible, especially since I intend to play on 'classic' gfx settings anyway.
---

---
Hey, show some respect. This guy has made history as the WORLD‚ÄôS FIRST to clear Deadmines. /s
---
1: If he thinks he has an actual chance of making World First he will know the tactics. And he is gunna be in a guild with Esfand, who DOES know the tactics.
---
2: He will either be DPS or tanking as Warrior. He legit doesn't need to know tactics. Unless he drops Bomb in the raid on Geddon he can't fuck up bad enough to wipe them.
---
3: It's everyone else who will need to know tactics, since like I said, Asmon is irrelevant to the raid, and with more modern addons to help you track Sheep and Banish duration you can literally pre-cast spells and have a full overlap unless they resist (Which is why Warlock uses VW tank)
---
4: How fast he and the people in his guild will level is the deciding factor. But I originally said Asmon's GUILD will get it, not necessarily Asmon. Because his guild is going to be full of streamers and super No-lifers. I know Josh has said he will be playing Priest with them. He never played Classic but he's a full on No-Lifer.
---
Ah that's good hopefully the more people that report it will lead to it being fixed.
---
my man!!
---
Streamers are a drop in the bucket. There's like 10 of them, they don't represent a grand injustice to the consumer base.
---
The idea is you pack the starting zones so you can make sure the layers and shards work properly on launch day. 
---
If everyone is out running around elsewhere then not enough people are putting stress on the starting zone layers
---
I'd say there is a difference between streamers like Crendor and Swifty/Asmongold
---
goddamnit Blizzard!
---
Not hard to find whos the biggest wow streamer lol.
---
I never really played wow and know asmongold.
---
The real question is, can you get on top of IF and can you get to the airfield...
---
Are you sure rogues are slower than warrior after lvl 30 ?
---
In my memory warrior was faster 1-30 then slower 30-60 than rogue
---
But since I had a BOE epic sword at lvl 45+ on my rogue, my memory might be skewed.
---
And it was 14 years ago anyway.
---
I haven't played in 12 years and got beta invite...i wasn't even subbed
---
A 48gb patch? Wow..
---
This is actually insane how people can't handle the fact that they didn't get in ü§£
---
Had some nice battles with Horde players in Elwyn.  Maybe 10 vs 10.
---
PTR/Beta clients are different from Live ones IIRC, so nothing will carry over.
---
Thanks. This makes sense.
---
It might be the parts to Aitesh, I can't remember exactly what they were called...
---
It's ok buddy, you'll be too, one day, you'll be too.
---
Unless you ended up on a dead/imbalanced server, in such case people were whispering you regardless of your reputation.
---
Eeeh I won't disagree that yes, a lot of shit goes down in here, but there are way, way worse communities and you know this (or maybe you don't, but there is.). I won't go as far as to say it's human nature to be a douchebag like the other guy who responded to you, but it is a process that happens.
---
When you form a community around a particular subject (which every subreddit naturally does) you end up surrounding yourself with people that are of similar kind, creating a tribe and anyone seen as a threat to it is treated as an enemy. It's sad, but that's what we refer to as circlejerking and echo chambers.
---
Personally I just want people to enjoy the game, though I do think it's frustrating to see people talk out of their ass and then change their opinion completely without even addressing that they were wrong.
---
I love asmongold‚Äôs transmog competitions. Now he is just being toxic about everything with every chance.
---
Special mentions to sodapoppin for giving me cancer every time I watch his stream. Seriously he is a very good player, but his chat is toxic he plays the most toxic class-spec in the most annoying way and he can‚Äôt freaking stand still for one moment.
---
The rest of them are fine. They are obviously streaming for the easy moneygrab of beta testing, but they are not toxic.
---
I guess he meant skill level in the game. But you needed a reason to be a smartass amiright?
---
[Mirror!](https://doa.cloud/s/iysjLjZ29B85Xt5)

When tanking while leveling, Stamina and Armor is king. Stacking as much as possible of those will help you in 5mans the most. Agility is good too, everything else is largely inconsequential. Don't worry about Block value, it doesn't matter. Avoid +Defense, it's literally useless while leveling, and 'costs' a lot of other stats on a given item.
---
Besides your usual gear - you should really consider leveling as Arms - you mostly should look for a shield and a one-handed weapon. Great Shields from dungeons are

* [Commander's Crest](http://classicdb.ch/?item=6320) from SFK (lv23+)

* [Thermaplugg's Central Core](http://classicdb.ch/?item=9458) from Gnomeregan (lv32+)
---
* [Aegis of the Scarlet Commander](https://classicdb.ch/?item=7726) from SM-Cath (lv39+)
---
* [Crest of Supremacy](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10835) from ST (lv51+)
---
There are more, of course, but those are 1) really good and 2) not super rare. Once you hit lv58-60, make sure to run UBRS for [Draconian Deflector](http://classicdb.ch/?item=12602) (among other great items).
---
LOLOLOLOL, i did that.
---
But i also got into the closed beta. /wave
---
Alright you‚Äôre very passionate about asmon and his guild I can see that. Neither of us will prove a point till it‚Äôs happened. Let‚Äôs both just save this comment thread and the winner can post ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù regardless of who wins it will be exciting and I‚Äôm hyped to shit to finally be home.
---
So retail is a memorial for the dead than? Kinda messed up to think of if that way
---
Needs 75% to pass

Good stuff thanks. Haven‚Äôt played hunter before but you‚Äôre right a pet would be a big plus. Am I right that you have to feed the pet and generally keep it happy?

Nah actually layering won't help with launch day overpopulation in start zones. Since each layer holds 3000 people anyway (same as normal cap without layers) you will still be fighting like 500 people for boars in every starter zone.
---
It has more with forced interaction really, I don't have any particularly fond memory of social interaction in retail since years back because the game does little to make me have to interact with people, and the few times I do someone wants to speedrun and chatting to be kept to a minimum.
---
By process I would say you'd have a more enjoyable social experience in classic. Not because it necessarily has a lower number of assholes, but you'll have plenty of opportunities arise where you meet good people too to weight it out.
---
I'm not really passionate about it. I'm just playing the odds.
---
The biggest streamers, with the biggest guilds, and the biggest server, and the biggest outreach will naturally trough sheer statistics have access to the best players who level the fastest and who want to be part of the stream. Finding them will be harder, but the odds are in their favor
---
I‚Äôm so happy for you all. I‚Äôm not even a wow player but I play osrs and was this excited when it was released. Honestly it‚Äôs gonna be great, I‚Äôm even tempted to start playing wow classic. Old school/ classic games few
---
You should make this a post of it‚Äôs own. Nice one.
---
If you went to classicdb, then yes, it‚Äôs wrong. That database is based off pserver data, IIRC. 
---
I know pservers had a lot of rep reward numbers off.
---
It's a stress test mate. You stress tested. I don't know why you expected anything more.
---
I'm assuming you could save the Interface + WTF folders and config settings and copy them across on the Launch client, however?
---
WoW doesn‚Äôt need exposure, they‚Äôre doing it for $, don‚Äôt pretend otherwise.

This sounds very familiar, like it was the original intended purpose of dks

She should, yeah.

I‚Äôll bet you 100g it won‚Äôt be asmon or his guild that down rag world first. ;)
---
How the hell is the only thing that looks like it has a threat meter an addan that replaces nameplates? That's lame, we need something to tell scrubs to install after they remove their dps meter and git gud.
---
Leveling during 1.12 was very easy, yes.
---
Been tired of them for a looong time.
---
Yep the huge virtual world and the fact there are other real life people running around there are part of what I want to show them.

Now I think about it, it‚Äôs going to be a gentle early years introduction to cyber safety in some respects.

Guys seriously, i just teared up a bit.. True happiness is really something anyone can recognize..
---
I can certainly agree with that but OP was implying that the live game has a largely toxic playerbase and that's just simply not true. Especially compared to the average classic player from the various vanilla private servers and even this sub.
---
I didn't say it was grand, or even imply that it was.
---
It is and remains unfair though. As I said, the question isn't whether or not its reasonable to allow streamers because its also reasonable to be fair.
---
The question is which does the company prioritise and the answer is they prioritise the advertising over being fair to the customer base.
---
Thanks! And thanks for the tips I think it all sounds sensible stuff.
---
I agree, however the children in question are below the age of 5 and right from the start everything revolves around killing mobs so I think it's pretty difficult to not expose the kids to violence playing WoW. And even if you decide not to kill mobs but just explore, you're bound to keep aggroing different kinds of mobs eventually ending up fighting them or dying
---
Check drop down menu &gt; no beta &gt; raise middle finger to screen &gt; say f--k you blizz &gt; close battle.net

That's my 10 seconds of battle.net in the last... like 3 months or something?
---
But the standart option is like vanilla wow with modern wow graphics right?
---
Fwiw since everybody told me devilsaur was cheap, I went to see on the only French private server.
---
Devilsaur set is about 900G, arcanite cristal between 50-100G.
---
Then it's not really an issue. Layers have the same capacity as a server in vanilla did and people will be stuck to their layer unless grouped up.
---
Perfectly put. As someone who has health problems and pretty much housebound, his and Sodas streams have kept my mind entertained and therefore in a good place. And has got me hyped af for Classic
---
I would take you up on that because it's a win win for me either way. Assuming his Guild is in contention and Josh is raiding with them.
---
 Either Asmons Guild wins And I win the bet. 
---
Or they lose and we get more "Josh world second Raider." Jokes. 
---
But I'm legit too lazy to grind 100g on whatever server you're on.
---
Thanks! And now I'm fucking lost

Hi Whoop, thanks for your write up. I did indeed play a shadow priest back in vanilla, but I hope some people new to priest will get what you are saying there.

https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bZfhtcc0VZxMGu0tR
---
So I was wondering where to put the last point - Spiritual Healing would be one option, of cause there are many others. I am not a fan of shadow priests dps'ing in raids, but I suppose that shadow weaving buff has to be up. Therefore holy weaver is a thing.
---
However, this is not a raiding build, the holy weaver part is more of an afterthought, making the priest viable in raids in that role, and not suck too much at healing. Yeah I know he is going to miss out of regen in raids, but nobody is perfect. It turns out I love to have Mind Flay, Silence and Vampyric Embrace, for dungeons and for pvp alike. Playing around with Spirit Tap and Spiritual Guidance is part of the fun.
---
TLDR not trying to be an optimized speed runner here, but taking the best utility spells from Shadow and being viable in a raid as a holy weaver, having fun in dungeons with Spirit Tap and Spiritual Guidance, that's what this is about.
---
Ah, ofc Americans have to be strange in this regard as well.

I CAN SEE MY SEXY TROLL #BETABELIEVEIT
---
Since I don't follow any streams, what are  they doing/causing that is getting people so mad?
---
You won‚Äôt have to if you win. If you‚Äôre so certain it will be me doing the grinding.
---
Yeah I guess.
---
Man, it's a long wait though.  August can't come soon enough!
---
It will eventually go away. It‚Äôs there to let you level without having to compete with 200 people for the same pig. 
---
Unfortunately there is no other way to make it work. Not without creating huge queues.
---
So what? A couple dozen streamers got in before you did. The stress test went out to THOUSANDS of people!
---
God i love i this memes.
---
Because I care more about my time than being right.
---
Many things are old, like the models. Player characters are old style.  It looks like vanilla, but some of the world graphics look a lot better. It's pretty nice.  Not as demanding for the PC as BFA fortunately.
---
Have you ever checked his subreddit? Such a strange place where it seems people only post to rip in to him. Honestly don't understand the mentality. I personally really like his streams, his obvious passion for WoW is contagious
---
Oh no, there are people on the internet with different opinions than me! Different opinions make me uncomfortable!
---
The beta pvp server is the World of Twitch right now. All the major guilds are run by streamers, they get their groupies to help them farm, do dungeons, pvp ... everything lol. Its whatever i guess, but it really distracts from the game when everyones busy drooling over mcconnell and asmon, payo, soda and the little minion streamers they got tagging along
---
Sounds great! Im a dad though so i might not level as fast as the rest of you, but id love to try atleast! My youngest will be just over 1 y/o when classic drops so hopefully shes a little bit easier than she currently is :)
---
Got it, thanks.
---
Which game though, Classic or Retail?
---
Yeah, but this is more impressive, because a gray logon screen beat Fortnite.
---
Thanks, that‚Äôs awesome man! Hope you enjoyed it :)
---
Same man. Same
---
Cant Level past 5, bug reported
---
It will work outside instanced pvp. Do not expect it to work in wsg like it used to.
---
It's very sad. I happen to know he was working on a tbc port, as a matter of fact.
---
The timezone was picked as it the highest peak internationally, it's the only non-weekend time where you get lots of people from EU and NA. To think testing server in the US wouldnt also carry over to the EU servers is naive.
---
I guess that depends on how you play the game. I did see a good video why to avoid streamer servers, and understand how some can have the game completly ruined.
---
But I also think there will be enough "normal" players to drown some of the issues
---
Yes but we‚Äôre talking about very small kids. They watch plenty of tv. It‚Äôs full of animals and fairies and the like having a jolly old time while facing what the certification boards would call ‚Äòminor peril‚Äô.  
---
WoW will probably become part of their introduction to the wacky world of violence. All I‚Äôm saying is I can‚Äôt show up on day one  with ‚ÄòHey kids, you know you love that show about bears? Well come watch daddy slaughter some bears and skin them in front of their friends‚Äô

# ASMONBALD
---
God bless Blizzard for memories like these!
---
Why would it be bad for Blizzard to give out beta invites to streamers? They are free advertisement and hype machines for blizzard.
---
How is it bullshit that a couple dozen streamers got in when THOUSANDS of other people got in as well. Do you really think a streamer took priority over your spot in the stress test? You sound like a salty bitch.
---
Sure.  It's mainly better resolution options, better lighting, etc.  It's like half of modern WoW's options are there.
---
Sure there are, every community is different. But that doesn't mean that streamer will never hold a community event. You bet your sweet ass if that streamer is in STV questing and they get ganked by a higher level they will have viewers who will come and spawn camp the ganker for them, for example.
---
Okay =(
---
It's not the consumer base they're being unfair to, its like, 10 people.
---
Chill, crack open a soylent, and be sure to twitch prime.
---
Epic name
---
Im in the beta and the atmosphere is centered around twitch and streamers. The chat is basically twitch chat with people spamming Pog Pogu and whatever the fuck. Could be worse, but it could certainly be a lot better too.
---
Source on needing an active sub for beta?
---
time todelivera peteZA BALL
---
I expected to have a shared experience with everyone else involved regardless of how shitty. The fact that some got priority to go in and play around with devs and see crazy chaotic shit happen, while others who got the same exact invite to the same exact event had to just sit with their dick in their hand while it happened. That‚Äôs my point.
---
Did anyone get in and get to play? I tried to log in 2 times then gave up and went out.
---
Free Action Potion farming makes fair bank too if you're willing to farm the mats yourself, though you'd obviously need alchemy to make the potions.
---
Just because ppl dont read general chat doesnt mean they arent there
---
[Mirror!](https://doa.cloud/s/6sk4KNP3bjjFHqi) 
---
This subreddit is utter cancer, barely any game discussion just garbage memes
---
who cares?
---
Who
---
But why not also test EU or Asian servers in the future? I honestly don't get what's bad about this. Does Blizzard lose something from doing so?
---
Do it!
---
For a person who has dedicated his entire life to WoW, I can see why Asmon is so passionate about the game.
---
I'm not sure if you actually read the post lol.
---
But it's obviously both. It's to filter out bugs and such but free advertisement and hype is always good.
---
Yes, I can imagine a child crying because they forget to feed their pet and it runs away permanently
---
We didn't need it back then and we won't need it now
---
Every time the trinket is almost up there‚Äôs multiple raids heading down there. He‚Äôs just assuming there would be other raids (because there will be) and coming up with a game plan.
---
here's his opinion after one day of playing, I think
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/SmallSmellyMuleCharlietheUnicorn
---
&gt;He almost locked himself
---
What
---
More important though... how do you move if you use W as a spell...? You cant be using the arrow keys, surely not

[You can do some fun stuff if you put in the effort.](https://i.imgur.com/Y7zOrWv.jpg)
---
thtreamer benethits!
---
Oh look, a truly unoriginal and never before answered question.
---
Yup.  People forget that TBC heroics were specifically brought in because people found 5 man dungeons too easy in vanilla.
---
More or less every classes' solo ability was definable in terms of when they could first solo a dungeon.  I actually spent a fair bit of time early in vanilla taking dungeons on solo to complete quests and I distinctly remember being able to take that ogre at quite an early level.
---
5-6, fine, and I was doing much the same at that age. But the age range you‚Äôre talking about there is over twice the age of my youngest. These are small numbers but it is literally an entire lifetime to my kid on top of what they‚Äôve already had. That‚Äôs a big difference developmentally. 
---
Likely I‚Äôll do different things with the different kids if it‚Äôs one on one as the older one needs to be exposed to these things. But if they‚Äôre together then we‚Äôre pitching for a 2-3 year old.
---
I once watched a movie about space aliens but the main character was apparently also an adventurer called Indiana Jones a few years prior. I also came to the conclusion that the moving picture I had watched may have been faked to entertain people.
---
ya who cares about winning the gurubashi arena event 12 times amirite?  üòÇ  üëå
---
Are you mad? Retail chat is more toxic than private server. Maybe people at level 60 dont want to ruin their reputation in the realm, that shit is irrelevant in retail though.
---
I hate it as well, I played some on private but it feels like a waste, so stopped at lvl15 and I am gonna strap on my waiting gloves.
---
Hang in there bud!
---
It‚Äôs a stress test, which means they try to get as many people into the server as possible. That means many of you won‚Äôt be able to log in. Is that clear enough for the moronic mouth breathers in this sub?!
---
‚Äòthird world‚Äô wallpaper lol. Had me confused for a sec there. A wallpaper for poorer countries.
---
He's saying his wife is sensitive to exposing their children to violence, not asking everybody on this sub their opinion on his wife's way of thinking.
---
While I do think it's a bit extreme to consider WoW violent in any way, people are absolutely entitled to raise their children the (best) way they see fit. Although I don't have children of my own, nor share the same opinion as his wife, I do respect it god damn it.
---
&gt;&gt; Soylent
---
&gt;&gt; twitch prime
---
Just imagine.
---
No it's the consumer base. If you're giving X person (who is a consumer, and not an employee) something that you are not giving the rest of the consumer base, that is objectively being unfair to the customer base whether you like it or not, and whether its small or not.
---
Why not have both
---
"Closed Beta"
---
&gt;Invites mostly Content Creators who have literally no interest in actually testing the game and reporting bugs, they just rather spend their time doing fuck all.
---
Asmongold and Soda especially.
---
10 man raid, but works like a dungeon.
---
[[Splinter of Atiesh]](http://classicdb.ch/?item=22726)
---
Or, you do you and I do me?
---
Get mining and black smithing and play the auction house. Kids can watch you farm mats and make things.  Play a paly and just bubble hearth or something if you need to bail on a fight.  Making a ton of money in wow can be a lot of fun. Buy low sell high take risks.
---
just go hunter and crit 2k raptor strikes with ashkandi ;)
---
You clearly didn't watch the clip "Raid Warning : 4 Mages top right of arena" Not many ways to get that info...
---
i really want to know your magical 25g/h methods
---
&gt;imagine
---
&gt;show us where the streamer hurt you
---
Talking in catchphrases is really hip now
---
Toxic? How is resto druid toxic?
---
Jesus some of these comments. 
---
I mean yes I started playing different kinds of video games, some quite violent, ever since I was a little kid. My parent's didn't REALLY mind it. But I can definitely understand how a parent might not want to expose their children, not even the age of 5, to violence. Granted, WoW might not be the most graphic of video games but I think it's violent enough for children that young. :D
---
No worries man, it's probably gonna take me a while too! Congrats on the kiddo :)
---
Been moving with SDF + backspace since ut2004, I jump with one of my mouse buttons
---
I don't think blizzard forgot anything
---
ya if he farmed it legimitely id be impressed but he was carried by his stream on every attempt
---
yeah you're absolutely right.  i dont particularly like the taste of favourable treatment for streamers but it just makes way too much sense for blizzacti to do it.  the streamers are causing a huge amount of hype for the game which i'm perfectly happy with, even though i personally don't watch streamers much at all
---
so to me its a good sign of smart leadership.  although i dont know if i'd accept the same treatment after launch - effectively giving reserved slots would be a bit ... unethical?  but then that's almost certainly not going to be necessary with layering and after the first few hectic days/weeks
---
Possible, but I imagine the beta client is going to be different from the launch client, and it may break your settings.
---
Did you submit a report?
---
Maybe it‚Äôs a rogue scouting?
---
&gt; If he's genuinely enjoying it, say so. Promote Classic WoW. If he dislikes it, why bother playing it aside from it being a disingenuous cash grab.
---
So you need a formal video from internet personalities about how sorry they are that they joked/ripped on your game years ago? Holy fuck, get a grip man.
---
They are the best raiders.
---
They don't know either. They said in a interview they will react to the demand. Nowdays they can spin up more servers very fast. Probably free transfers to new servers. I honestly doubt there is a big decrease in player activity before phase 2. Most casuals won't even hit 60 by that time.
---
That is hyper inflated
---
This is basically what I've done on my first ever character 14 years ago. Loved it, but looking back it was true agony. Just spec arms, keep hold of the highest level one hander and shield you get your hands on and tank away in those low lvl dungeons.
---
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è everyone believed it to be 16 july because the 2 characters they showed in creation when comparing vanilla to classic were name osconty and july. Osconty was a lvl 16 mage. Also back in vanilla osconty recorded the 1st patchwork kill on 16 july 2006. Not because i farted or because vacation man... a lot was pointing to a july release. Ff14 expansion in july. Eso expansion in june. And then the "get ready for a classic summer" quote.
---
Regardless i hope everyone enjoys the shit out of vanilla. We just gotta wait 3 months.
---
Alot of people here are petty and bitter that they never got into a stress test.
---
You seriously underestimate the combined effect of twinking, 12 patches of class tuning and bug fixing.  When I first did dead mines my average item level was around 9.
---
Modern references in classic wow interest me
---
Saw a hogger raid earlier shouting about the Lord of Light and such
---
I'm (obviously) talking about when the game goes Live.
---
they were actually testing how much they could stress players, not the servers haha
---
I‚Äôd like this as long as we can copy our characters from the classic servers and essentially have both so that we always have a classic server that is unchanged
---
I also don't get the complaints about streamer bias during this. Let's assume the top 20 streamers were given priority even though thousands are being let in. It makes sense to me for the sake of a stress test. You don't want them to fail to log in after a half hour then go play something else. Keeps the classic buzz going, for all their fans who are desperate to play with them will keep stressing the server by trying to log in. I'm also not saying this is the case. Just if it was, I get it.
---
I was thinking of doing this too, but I think I will go with mostly default up until I hit 60 for that truly authentic feel.
---
Thank you! Are you planning on playing on a pvp or pve server btw?
---
Hi, /u/WickedSnake
---
2003?
---
Nah let's leave the game alone \#nochanges
---
I remember when searching in who max results were always 50
---
Nah feeding pet is good. Teaches responsibility, looking after others etc. A non-violent but negative consequence is perfect. Tears can be healthy!
---
The problem is they had way too strong of an opinion for a game they "didnt know". Money leeches who dont eve enjoy the game.
---
Yeah man, imagine enjoying something. Holy shit, how pathetic.
---
Asmongold is noobie right
---
Home !
---
Depends a bit on how they will handle shatter in molten core as well though, if I recall frost mages crit chance against the Molten Core bosses acted as if shatter was applied at all times.
---
I know you‚Äôre eager to catch a streamer doing something so you can say ‚Äú OOOOOO I‚Äôm telling!‚Äù which is essentially what you‚Äôve done with this post. Chance and him just talked about it on Chance‚Äôs stream. One of their 40 went and looked and there is nothing they can do about it.
---
Dude's hilarious glad to see he's enjoying it so much. Quinn and Erik exploring Azeroth. Nearly cried laughing when he raced to Silithus as a ghost and got ported back to Dun Morogh
---
He fucks around on stream to entertain people, kind of like playing a character like Dr. Disrespect but not quite. The dude isn‚Äôt being serious a majority of the time. 
---
Also when I watched his stream he said he hasn‚Äôt played vanilla at all since 2006, no private servers. So yeah I‚Äôm sure the dude is still figuring shit out just like most of us on this sub who haven‚Äôt played private servers.
---
Why are you asking me dumb dumb?
---
Well that's the tricky part in all this. Are they trying to recreate the game or the experience? Those seldom go hand in hand and parts of the experience can't be completely recreated because of knowledge and stuff like that.
---
Anyone who is still in the stress test, the servers are now working and playable until 7 PM MDT.
---
7 PM MDT happens when this comment is 14 hours and 39 minutes old.
---
You can find the live countdown here: https://countle.com/DDp8ZpV6O
---
Oh, man, isn‚Äôt it at one year it starts to get worse though? Until then, they are pretty stationary, stays where you put them. At one, you can‚Äôt take your eyes off them, at least that‚Äôs my experience for my two young ones.
---
and it needs more buck tooth
---
Close to brill
---
People can't log in and they are mad? 
---
*Sips* 
---
Perfect.
---
Preferably you in BFA.
---
Yeah I get your point but it‚Äôs not actually contrary to what I said. I feel like you‚Äôre just saying to me what everyone‚Äôs saying to everyone else. My complaint is with the lack of communication. If Blizzard had said ‚Äúyou‚Äôll get disconnected a lot, probably won‚Äôt get in but please keep trying to help stress test‚Äù then that‚Äôs fine, but what they actually said was that they wanted to get lots of players on at once and alluded that pvp wouldn‚Äôt be a problem as we‚Äôd only be in the starting zones.
---
All I said was I‚Äôd like them to have actually explained what to expect. The frustration wasn‚Äôt a result of not getting to play, it was because we had no idea why we couldn‚Äôt.
---
Inv
---
You're completely disregarding the huge section of the consumer base that is not allowed in the beta. People like me, who will be buying classic, and wanted to play the beta, but couldn't. My experience is immensely better because Preach is allowed access.
---
So we're not just weighing the harm done to the 10 people in the consumer base against advertising, we're weighing them against advertising and materially improving the experience of thousands of people in the consumer base like me.
---
LFG is just trade (or whatever chat you use to finding groups) chat with UI. LFG wouldn't prevent people whispering you and asking to run some dungeons. 
---
LFG addons would probably be very ineffective, because a lot of players are against those and wouldn't use it. However it's not a good reason to outright ban those addons.
---
And pirates
---
Daddy killed the bear because she was evil :). Don‚Äôt worry that much about showing violence just make sure you explain why violence has to happen.
---
Every animal wildlife documentary is marked as child friendly and it shows lions shredding baby zebras to pieces, but they justify that by saying it‚Äôs the circle of life and nature works this way. Also sex is shown too.
---
Pick a Disney movie and check out how much violence it has. I am working with sick and dying people in my everyday life and still one of the cruelest things I have seen in my life was the death of mufasa in lion king.
---
Violence in wow revolves around people hitting other people. Even the dead don‚Äôt really die. I wouldn‚Äôt consider this to be inappropriate for children. At least until they learn to read chat and find out that anonymity online is freepass to be a dick.
---
I have a ton of people in my guild with children and these kids grew up watching their fathers/mothers play wow since they were 1-2 years old. Worst thing they ever said was ‚Äúdad kill the evil elf before he steals our flower‚Äù! They used to ask to press a button and help him win too.
---
People who don‚Äôt like to read quests require Questhelper addons. 
---
Like me :)
---
Poor Asmongold üò≠
---
Yes, added the video for the report.
---
imagine disliking someone this much
---
Why does he say the level 35 trinket and that they forgot to put a level requirement on it?
---
The original text from the interview reads that ¬®he kinda locked himself away for a couple of weeks¬®
---
I didn‚Äôt even get in man. I agree with your point, and would like to point out that all the crazy and fun stuff was exclusive to the allliance streamers, while Horde were running around in a Congo line at spawn and asking whether they were gonna get any bosses
---
You did get a shared experience, with all the other people trying to login and getting booted. Again, don't see the issue here. Thanks for stress testing.
---
Thankfully those lazy ppl won't last long in classic because they're spoiled with QoL and lfg, lfr systems ;)
---
I'm ready for the hate comments.
---
It‚Äôs a feral hybrid built around kiting and rooting people while killing them slowly over time without giving them a chance to fight back.
---
Well, their system is floodgate control, so it should be quite stable once the layering is up and running, the worst would be that a few layers crash and you need to relog, but as said before, they should have an priority queue system so the ones disconnected can connect back in 15 min without problem, and jump over to a new layer, this is good for the release, and i am sure they have far enough experience to accommodate quite a large flood of players, being able to quickly expand their cloud structure while this is ongoing.
---
So no worries here. ^^
---
Westfall
---
It was both
---
The desert of Tanaris always made me happy as a kid. I‚Äôd go to Gadgetzan and try to gank as a solo warrior, I‚Äôm hoping that now that I know and am better at the game I can finally add value to the wars beyond the wall.
---
I WAS THERE Pog
---
&gt;people talk out of their ass and then change their opinion completely without even addressing that they were wrong.
---
This is  the closest I have heard Quin to admitting that he was wrong about the Classic, tho I have watched only like 30% of his Classic streams
---
&gt; I can see why people liked it, it's making a lot more sense to  me now
---
Definitely agree on the Hinterlands. That troll city is basically a open world dungeon. I love it.
---
just type deadmines
---
A lot of times he went off stream or alone and/or disadvantegous position to get it, he was not exactly carried until this fight which was brewing up even without him
---
*I sacrificed 3h of my sleep, what have you given?* :)
---
Both Asmon and Esfan were in the queue
---
"Winning" good one buddy. I love how these streamers shill for a good old days feeling yet they use their fame to get free stuff.
---
I mean i rly enjoy doing it while kiting and its only client side so dont really see the problem:/
---
People are still going to track them pretty easily with only a modicum of effort. Streaming or not.
---
One way that would be somewhat vanilla friendly and would still enable us to chase some of that vanilla experience is suffling the dungeon loot tables. It would make us rediscover the drop locations of items. You would still know what your BiS list is but you'd have no idea where to get them. Understandably many people wouldnt like this, but many also might like it.
---
I do agree with your overall idea of chasing the vanilla experience but it is very hard to accomplish. Retuning mobs and mixing some of the things we know (see my loot idea above) could be lite ways of doing it that would keep the game very close to vanilla.
---
World first was 15 years ago. Why do people do this?
---
Questing addons have been around since Vanilla.
---
So have I. And many others. They‚Äôre just addons.
---
Ikr. Some people make me SICK !
---
Westfall is beyond overrated. When you factor in travel time of quests, and the sheer size of the zone in comparison of every other 10-25 zone, it's ridiculously inefficient. Darkshore, for all it's size, has quest hubs that don't often make you run across the entire zone to loot 3 things and run all the way back. You go out, do 4-10 quests at once, run back, and go to the next hub area. Westfall? Not like that. Sends you out with 1-3 quests, and you have to run around the entire zone to finish them, then run back, and you have to repeat it like six times. ARGH!
---
Good find!
---
Just out of curiosity, are you also posting this an official bug report? Things like these are so important, I don't want to see them slip through the cracks.
---
Badass guy from the wire.
---
World first C'Thun !
---
hey its 4 buttons!
---
him being fake is one of the reason i stopped watching, if I wanted to watch an act i'd watch dr disrespect. asmongold has turned into a react andy these last couple of months and its sad because i used to love watching him, but I get it, it brings in the views so its obviously working, just not for me.
---
We need trivia addon.
---
Also why is weak auras allowed? Shouldn‚Äôt they ban this addon already? It‚Äôs way too powerful and gamebreaking.
---
Then watch it for the 10th time.
---
If you farmed scarab lord legitimately I'd be impressed but you will just get carried by your guild  üòÇ üëå
---
Thanks, I was looking for a good name to use on my classic-server character!
---
How many weeks did you guys wipe? Seeing gear of gour guild matws im not so quick to trust its your first kill.
---
Tanks have the highest responsibility, since they usually lead the group. Some classes are a bit harder than others, but not to a degree that it would seriously harm your enjoyment of the game. However, for leveling there are significant differences in how easy/quick they are to solo level with. Warrior being the slowest and hunter/druid being the fastest.
---
Nah, absolutely didn't watch it. Not worth it.
---
I'm not too sure as of yet, we'll try and make a decision soon, I'm personally leaning towards PvP but I know some of the guys are more PvE oriented so we'll have to hold a vote or something haha
---
I reported it when I had access during the stress test, but unfortunately I don‚Äôt have beta access, so I won‚Äôt be able to test it as much as I would like to.
---
I just want to say a big thank you to the OP and the other people helping in the stress test and getting us closer to an enjoyable launch.
---
Lmao
---
Good lad
---
I was there Pog
---
How about the mythic + version in which the leader sets up available spots and requirements and you have a list of people that applied to sort through? 
---
I honestly don‚Äôt see how this is different than just spamming general chat. You still have to run, talk to the person etc.
---
Mimimi.
---
Man, I CAN'T WAIT to play this awesome game again! Haven't been hyped this much for a game in ages!
---
There is no requirement for the trinket. Because its so hard to aqcuire for a low level player, it doesnt even matter. There were some tryhard low level twinks with this trinket too.
---
&gt;But of Course I am going to buy Gold in classic, because no way I will farm those 1000g for epic Mount ever again :D
---
My rank 14 group had a hunter.  I fondly remember how much it mostly sucked being a rogue, so not doing that again.
---
Yes there definitely weren't any opposing groups trying to kill him right  ü§î ?
---
Lol the tide pods totally killed me (seriously don't eat them)
---
The only good streams with him are him playing dark souls because it reveals what a shitty gamer he is lol
---
Yep, that‚Äôs it! Bigger radius around the player than I remember, but that must just be my memory being faulty.
---
None of the consumer base is "not allowed" in the beta.
---
All of the consumer base get the **same opportunity** and same **opportunity** to win a place. Besides streamers.
---
I disregarded no one. Youre positing a false equivalence.
---
Someone is upset.
---
The troll male that is fishing next to you is called "Matto" that means crazy in Italian. Guess it fits
---
Maybe you should've done some research before going on the bandwagon hate, you fucking loser. Quin has never hated vanilla or been against vanilla, he said on stream the other day that the context to that tweet was for the annoying Legacy WoW people who went around blizzcon 2017 and harassed developers and other people to try and promote classic, they were obnoxious and rude and this *JOKE* tweet is in response to that. So instead of just randomly spewing bullshit like some retard, maybe you should do some research next time. :)
---

Found on the same page.
---
I'm so confused.  
---
TELL ME why this means you don't have a social experience?
---
I, a non-streamer got to participate in the Stress Test without beta access. Stop acting so petulant and keep checking your launcher for an inevitable invite.
---
&gt; Wife is sensitive to me exposing kids to violence, death, the undead, or other such unsavoury items at a young age. 
---
Sorry to hear that.
---
 How is this toxic? Have you been raised in your moms bedroom or something? This is a joke, you could argue it was toxic to dismiss and talk shit about people that wanted classic, but when it was announced suddently they play it and forgets about all the shit they threw this way.
---
I read the whole chain and damn dude, you have some issues. You should probably take a break from internet for a bit.
---
I hope the toxicity continues and grows. I wanna see this community filled with vitriol and fractured.
---
If they are pointing fingers at the community for being the community, sure, I agree with you. But what I believe he's referring to is some select streamers were bashing on the classic community FOR WANTING CLASSIC (rose tinted glasses or whatever), because of their beliefs on the game (like you mentioned.)
---
Living life in peace
---
Imagine telling people to not enjoy classic the way they enjoyed vanilla
---
Good bot
---
Alright, then I'll gladly retract what I said in his case, I'll admit it's a bit of a knee-jerk reaction, I'm glad he is enjoying himself eitherway. :)
---
And even as a healer extra damage is always good.
---
But it#s a reliable source. His dad might be working for Nintendo
---
He died how he lived. Cancer.
---
Guys, its a fuckin beta test. He got a the arena grandmaster trinket. Who gives a fuck if it was done legit or not, stop being such whiney jealous dick bags.
---
Hoes mad as usual
---
Some say his back is so big due to all the carrying the hopes and dreams of many on his shoulders.
---
If you think quin cares about money you are cooked, in 3 months i havent heard him talk about his sub count, twitch prime or anything, he hasnt even fixed his paypal so people can donate, its been down for a couple of months.
---
Are we talking retail or classic?
---
Cus this r/classicwow
---
There is a big difference between the retail "hello, gg, goodbye" and good old "sorry I must travel kalimdor to go to zul farak, can we meet up at cabestan to do the travel together?"
---
This was my game of thrones back in the day, waiting for new episodes and refreshing the website on the release day. Good times.
---
If I'm not mistaken they stopped because someone died? a car accident if I remember correctly.
---
I can't recall who it was who died.
---
Again, good points and I don‚Äôt necessarily disagree. 
---
However, I would argue that the most direct and obvious lesson that could be learned from the bear and elf scenarios you give is: ‚Äòkids, it‚Äôs fine to kill evil things, especially if they want something you also want‚Äô. I want to teach slightly more nuanced lessons than that, but that requires a little more mental and emotional maturity on their end than is currently there.
---
I know I‚Äôm overthinking this but raising these kids is the single biggest responsibility I will ever have, so I‚Äôm entitled to some overthinking!
---
PS After more viewings of the movie than I can count I have only just managed to make my eldest understand that Mufasa isn‚Äôt just sleeping!
---
I played a hunter when my \~7 year old niece came by for a few days. I had that white tiger from STV as a pet and called him Kenny ([Kenny the Tiger](https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/2618561/size/tmg-article_tall.jpg) ). She used to watch me play for hours just to see the pet run and so on. Now she was older than your kids so I used to grind mobs and such, but still I think Hunter is a good choice for what you are looking for.

Name checks out.
---
Seriously wow and especially wow classic has got to have one of the whiniest communities out there which is a shame because I want to get into this game. All those people salty about not getting into the beta expected the stress test to be a free beta invite and then bitching about it. Fucking pathetic
---
That‚Äôs just smart druid PvP
---
Should he stand still? Fight them in melee as a cat? Not use roots?
---
Great to hear!
---
No, you only need to have a sub and Classic will be there for you.
---
Grim Dawn is okay.
---
If you aren't pleased with WoW Classic or the dev team behind it, vote with your wallet and don't play it. Be a good example and do it first :)  
---
Oh wait, you will play it regardless!
---
Ironforge was the one that blew me away, I have always liked the fantasy of a city inside a mountain. I Love the ascending path to the entrance, the architecture and the snowy setting.
---
 Can people like you stop being so dramatic? Its a joke, seriously this influx of gamer dads to classic wow made this shit unbearable.
---
Even if it doesnt carry, you can COPY most of the settings over, like keybinds, addons and their settings. Especially helpful if your char name in beta AND classic is the same (if theres some settings that have char name linked).
---
If you hoped that you clearly arent familiar with this community lmao
---
Mfw I tried to get in for 2 hours üòì lol
---
Then you‚Äôll be pleased to know that those features are staying! Enjoy!
---
Damage numbers above enemies scale with distance making them way too small when playing ranged classes  [https://i.imgur.com/WtvlDXy.png](https://i.imgur.com/WtvlDXy.png)
---
apparently you never heard of provat server autismo, there are loads of ppl which ranked to r14.
---
on every fucking fresh realm.
---
Nope, but if I was I could just not watch them.
---
The original demo release was like that. The email indicated something very similar, did you not get one? You have the wrong mindset.
---
I‚Äôm talking about adding the LFG list to classic.
---
Not the LFG/LFR that automatically creates group, but the premade group finder feature that gives you plenty of people to sort through to make a group.
---
then become a streamer and stop crying
---
No but it's something to think about, early on you can get by with a holy/sanctuary spec that allows you light tanking, healing and aoe farm decently for money.
---
What he meant was people mass disappearing like that. Pretty obvious they where running test with the system.
---
Lol its not pure Vanilla. If it was we would also be able to make amazing macros and other exploitative things....
---
genuinely lol'd, i love this meme
---
Did someone say.....
---
I am not saying there is a better way to play this class. I just find it extremely annoying and toxic.
---
Just because a handful of streamers got beta access it hurts the community? How many players participate in the beta? The only community who is butthurt is this one here and maybe the forums.  
---
And when did they announce LFG? And sharding?
---
The trinket you loot from the chest has a level 35 requirement but the trinket you get from turning in 12 of them doesn't have a level requirement
---
&gt;This isn't exactly promising for the upcoming 2 tests when there will be even more people invited.
---
It's possible they needed this first test to get a baseline.
---
The next stress test would be the first where we could possibly expect something even close to smooth.
---
If this had been smooth, it would have been amazing for the launch, but that was not a realistic scenario.
---
nah the mouth breathers are too busy crying about asmon
---
This is true.  I worked as a GM in the lead up to TBC and the culture surrounding changed.  I mean, we were never "allowed" to do any of the stuff we did but it was just commonly accepted as good fun.  That changed rather rapidly.  
---
Some people had a hard time adjusting.  A lad got sacked for repeatedly changing the name of a hunters pet to something a bit risque.  That put the end to any messing.
---
Yeah, I was expecting to stress test the realm servers, not the login servers.  Never got to a character creation screen until after the test ended.  How the heck are the login servers still a problem?
---
Right I know, I'm talking about retail too.
---
small amount of publicity?  wow is one of the top watched games on twitch for a fuckin beta and a stress test because of them.  i dont like them either but its the right move for classic in general
---
plus, if a streamer is online they'll probably bring a lot of players to try and get into the stress test - which helps them ... stress test
---
Wheres the source on that? I myself and my m8s that got in quit trying after we saw that most streamers got in while we didn't. 
---
Would love to stress test but if they plan it at like 3am on a thursday and then don't let anyone enter after 20mins there's no point to try futher, we have done our job.
---
Told ya. It‚Äôs not going to ever be the same. It‚Äôs a shell of its former self pretending to be what everyone wants it to be. It‚Äôs a sham. It‚Äôs a joke. I can‚Äôt wait to see how fast classic dies.
---
Asmongold to a fucking T.

---
wtf did you expect from a STRESS TEST?? the whole point is that it pushes their services beyond the breaking point
---
at any time you could have decided "you know what i'm not that fussed about standing in elwynn forest" and got on with your life.  i dont know what you were hoping for?
---
Hate to tell you but that's the only viable way to play a druid. It's not toxic when you are forced to use the class tools to win. That's like saying a frost mage is toxic because they use CC, snares, and roots
---
Yes, hardcore raiding guilds are the communism.
---
Well if you don't have a lot of time, being a healer or a tank is probably not the best way to go, especially for leveling. I honestly think you should go Hunter it has a relatively easy leveling experience and overall it's just really fun for casual gameplay.
---
6 out of 8, Also i meant to say that personalitys also matter.
---
Professions to make gold such as mining and skinning.....
---
Macros work exactly like that. Use something like
---
A button to switch to defensive stance and activate shield wall all in 1 button.
---
And for quests there isnt a main progress line, just get to 60.
---
Yeah just like how he was naming when he made that big report about starting gear not having any armor. Yeah good meme üòÇüëå
---
This subreddit is one half people who know streamers and use the word ‚Äúnormie‚Äù without irony and one half people who don‚Äôt.
---
Such an interesting demographic mix in here thanks to desire to play classic.
---
Sure, but are there going to be at least 40 of those Autismo's on the same server, same faction, the correct class balance and role distribution, and all being in the right mindset of Autismo to grind it out at the same time, nvm that Rank14 means they might just be pure PvP and not bother with PvE.
---
Vs Asmon's 80 000 viewers clamoring to be on his server, in his guild, in his raid, and on his dick?
---
Radiation made new generations of gnomes grow bigger and bigger. One day they'll evolve to dwarves.
---
MAKE GNOMES SMALL AGAIN... please blizzard, can't play these giant gnomes
---
It wasn't in Vanilla therefore I hate it
---
if you get ADL to notice you then I m pretty sure it counts.
---
I hate gnomes in all shape or form
---
Just note that "experience" is a completely subjective term because everyone experienced vanilla differently.
---
You're not going to have the same experience, but you want the base game to stay the same all the same which is fine. Make sure to know the differences between them and argue them properly.
---
IIRC RP PvP won‚Äôt be available at launch, only RP PvE, so you‚Äôll have to compromise or wait.
---
Remember Apex Legends?
---
Desolace is underrated. Huge zone, lots of normal quests, rep grind, group quests, lots of beasts if youre into grinding. I'd rather grind away there in relative peace instead of going to STVietnam.
---
Who are all these nobody's?
---
For real? That kills it for me, I‚Äôve always hated the updates raid frames, I normally turn them off when doing bgs/raids because they are so awful.
---
I will buy China Gold in classic to buy an epic Mount.
---
Choose the one you feel most comfortable raiding with, get a guild together start raiding and leveling alts in downtime so that they can see if you  got the skills to bring in other classes etc. Eventually you will probably have a max level of everything if you are an altaholic and or what not.
---
Third world is not about being a poor country. The third world signifies countries with no conflict during the cold war.
---
Ok but like in the real world? The reason those people congregate on shitty web sites is because normal people don't want to interact with them.
---
Which is pretty sad really. I bet most of these guys were decent kids once and for one reason or another became outcast. Sometimes by their own fault for sure but I bet a bunch of them weren't treated in a good way. That doesn't justify their behaviour though.
---
I struggle to feel any anger or resentment towards them. They are just sad and I pity them. Imagine yourself living in mommys basement and the only human interaction is through 4chan or worse. If you are not totally miserable by then it's guaranteed you will be shortly.
---
I only want questie!
---
Idk, probably the same reason people will engage random comments to show how cool they are?
---
They do in fact look a little bit taller, if the pictures are real
---
Nice shot.
---
Because you said you would have raged if streamers were given prio access?
---
Divide the population into two groups: streamers and randoms. A low percentage of randoms got to participate in what a very high percentage of streamers got to. It doesn't matter if that low percentage of randoms got the exact same express-relog permissions as the streamers because *basically every streamer* got these permissions and an invite while literally hundreds of thousands of players sat on the sidelines watching the few "lucky" hundreds play.

---
"pallymcheal" is a fucking great name hahaha
---
They analogy doesn't even make any sense you cant say "for arguments sake" and then come up with an analogy that isn't reality. If Vanilla was a certain difficulty for the first playthrough then you had that difficulty because you lacked knowledge and skill. And then on your 2nd go around you had much less difficulty because you knew what you were doing, this happened in Vanilla as well, and they didnt artificially inflate the difficulty and people still enjoyed it.
---
Such opportunity to gank Blizz employee...
---
To be honest, it‚Äòs a shame Blizzard never updated the quest dialogue. There‚Äòs an addon that breaks the quest text into pieces and puts it in more center so you can actually read the text like it‚Äòs 2019 and not have squeeze your eyes to read that wall of text on the left of the screen.
---
Best part is, it allows for much quicker reading too, because the text is broken into smaller pieces.
---
I started leveling a character this way, when they made the old zones scale. I wanted to finish a zone fully before going to the next one. It was amazing actually being immersed in the zones. But it left me wishing it wasn‚Äòt post cata azeroth (some quests remind you, that deathwing was here and look what he did, bla bla bla).
---
I can‚Äòt wait for them to make it work on classic.
---
[Here‚Äòs the Addon btw.](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/immersion)
---
So you earned it in the first place and now you want to continue lauding it over people who are trying to earn it this time? You sound petty as fuck dude. I know it‚Äôs ironic for me to say this in this sub, and get a life. Paying someone else to play a game for you is one of the pathetic things I can think of.
---
They could also set small layer people limit to test how it behave ... to create lot of layers and test them
---
They may fo come the end of the test.
---
The point is to try to see how much it can handle, how it handles it, how the layering works, ITS TESTING
---
how can you be that fucking stupid
---
Not that well read on Classic yet but DM isnt available from the beginning I hope?
---
It‚Äôs not punishment, it‚Äôs actually being presented with an impactful decision.
---
tbh I don't know if you are serious or not
---
You realise facism is on the rise all over the world and Trump is currently president of the US. In the past few months there have been multiple violent extreme-right shooters out murdering people as well.
---
And quite a few of the streamer have been actively testing mechanics and by creating events with masses of people that also tests the servers capabilities to handle this amount of people in one localised area.
---
Damm these scum, selling their product for money after investing money to make it!
---
I think it‚Äôs less that people are salty that they didn‚Äôt get in, and more that Blizzard are pretending it‚Äôs all equal with regards to logging in, when it‚Äôs blatantly obvious streamers are given priority (not saying streamers are the only ones who got in, just they had it much easier).
---
While I understand the logic in giving them priority, it doesn‚Äôt stop it feeling like we‚Äôve been bait and switched (having the servers show offline, despite streamers obviously being in game is especially dirty).
---
Another dude that thinks i would give a shit about their opinion. Ok man, keep being a blind fanboy, it will work great.
---
Used to be one, but in vanilla I was not, pretty much picked mage first thing and sticked with it.
---
As I said, doubt I'll have time to raid unfortunately :(
---
Tinfoil hats are flying outta the shops with this subreddit
---
This is already in the beta and it's working just as crappy as you'd expect.
---
Yeah you won‚Äôt be competing with 200 people just 100. Still won‚Äôt get the tag on the pig though
---
Uhu. Sure. Whatever works for you.
---
Multiboxers get the rope.
---
Twitch people are just using synonyms for common words. Kappa means sarcasm, monkaS means oh noes, pepega means retard. In our new PC world saying retard is bad, but pepega is fine.
---
yeah pictures are real... the problem is that they're not just taller, they're bigger
---
For the layering to be tested you need to be actually inside i think but i might be wrong...
---
Im not really defending soda but he has never been much of a PvEr.  He became popular for PvP, which he is good at.  So all his advice comes from a PvP standpoint.  The rogue was his friend who intends to go PvP with him, and at level 30 there are better things to get.
---
This needs to be rectified!
---
Sounds like Stockholm syndrome on your end.   
---
Blizzard communication was and still is the worst, it was bad when I played wow 11 years ago, it has not improved since if I were to judge from classic.     
---
It is just night or day if you compare it to other devs like GGG or DE and probably many others. Sure WoW is maybe bigger in scales but I am sure they can manage the few people they have in their beta.     
---
Then when it comes to stress test, I would love to be enlightened in regards to what was being stressed exactly.    
---
If it was their login servers then there are games that handle 50 times the load without even shocking.     
---
If it was their game realm, well obviously it failed cause only a fraction of people could connect and they did not quite experience full server capacity (or maybe they did) and if it was to test their layer technology then that failed as well.    
---
They had control over the number of people invited so they had all the time to tune it to what they wanted to test.     
---
I will lean towards the idea that they are not complete morons and that they tested exactly what they wanted. The part that was not fun was that the test consisted of having people who could log in and others who either could not or whose access was blocked once the server reach a certain load.     
---
This kind of stress testing is a bit deceptive, especially when it goes along the already obscure criteria to get in the beta topped by having an active subscription.     
---
Conclusion is let them do their things, if you have access to the full beta enjoy and find out the bugs, if you don't then don't bother until the game is out cause Blizz is not in the open beta mindset.    
---
And enjoy the streamer's streams who are in to give you a glimpse of what the game is going to be.
---
What about when I read level 60?
---
During leveling if I picked Shaman/Paladin (most probably Paladin as I prefer the race models there, I only like Undead on horde, I would pick the leveling talent spec so it might be slower yes.
---
Am I not allowed to have an opinion? I find this gameplay concept annoying and toxic. 
---
Yes mages were toxic too before finishing returns were implemented. I remember a mage spam poly on a monster I wanted to kill, just to make sure I give up and let him have the kill. Is it smart? Yes. Is it toxic? Yes.
---
And no it‚Äôs not the only viable way to play a Druid.
---
Shaman has Ghost Wolf which is great for leveling because you get around much faster, but Paladin is arguably the 2nd worst leveling experience after Warrior, especially for the first 30 levels or so.
---
No? Why... got any source to backup that claim?
---
hundreds of thousands lul
---
youll get clapped
---
;(
---
And guess what tons of people were in, I got in too, just had to wait, only to then jump around, get killed, rez, get killed again, duel someone, lose, get killed, rez, crash due to server coming offline.
---
And you know what I had fun and it tested the server capacity.
---
Oh boy is your tinfoil hat wrapped tight.
---
mobtagging never worked in vanilla, it was always privateserver garbage
---
Its less about server location and more seeing how their current server set up handles all the pressure. Funneling all people into one server is the only way to truly test it.
---
Is the s hat happen d? I was in the dwarf/gnome starting area with a LOT of people, then all of the sudden, most of them just disappeared. There were about 20 of us left playing.
---
Where are the 'original' pictures from?
---
there is an option in the graphic settings i think. or you just lower the graphics, i don't know exactly, but there is a way to do set it up as it was in vanilla.
---
no.
---
There are OCE servers based in Sydney for retail, can‚Äôt imagine they wouldn‚Äôt be available for classic as well.
---
A guild pushing for realm first could arguably be just as bad, but the amount of guilds that can truely push the resources to going for any realm firsts will most likely be in single digits. Adding to WF guilds, they usually buy from the market to give back to the economy with everything they make and thats a positive for the realm.
---
Some of the "consequences" can for example be that any zone the streamer is in is completely filled causing lag or making it unplayable for the opposit faction. I could see a world where a big streamer such as asmon or any similar viewercount streamer could completely block anyone else from getting scarab lord. I have to admit I'm not good at coming up for great examples, but I think realistically there "should?" be a noticable difference when playing on a big streamer server versus a regular realm.
---
I think the bigger problem the way I see it (Its fine to see it differently) is that the streamers often don't give back as much as they "leech", 'streamer benefits' aren't a made up thing, and they do consume resources in a much different way than a usual player would, for example requesting gold, materials, items, raid carries etc.
---
Again you're more than welcome to see it differently, and I don't think its wrong to disagree in any way.
---
How awful, I had high hopes for it being as close as they could get, but if they let simple changes like this go, who knows what else they‚Äôll change?
---
pretty obvious we‚Äôre not going for server firsts with a weekend raiding situation. Not everyone derives their entire sense of net worth from a 15 year old video game. Some of us got jobs, families and RL responsibilities in the 15 years since class launched.I really hope we can avoid these people like the plague anyways.
---
Yeah cuz everything said in donations is 100% true and never a jebait. Let‚Äôs not suck off Asmon‚Äôs cock too much
---
Didn't soda not get in?
---
Hey dude, I'm just saying. Don't be so defensive
---
I really, really, really hate multiboxers as it goes against the spirit of the game IMO, but Blizzard says it‚Äôs not against the rules.
---
As for the how, it‚Äôs the same method it‚Äôs always been, any automation is bannable, one click, one action only.
---
Moo :3
---
Is 200 enough? I feel like this is what used to make Blizzard games different and great.. amongst many things... oh sweet August 27th
---
They were given priority.
---
Oh well then yea if you aren't gonna raid just pick w/e you want really.
---
I'm not sure that server showing offline was intentional to be honest. In the two hours I was trying to get it it seemed to switching between low pop, locked, and offline. When I was able to get in, it was timing out like crazy. It is possible the infrastructure was so overloaded that whatever health check drives the server status display was timing out too.
---
Yikes, projecting much?
---
You pretend to the defend that 
---
‚ÄúPay(sub) for opting to work(yes, you pay for do a job)  for 2 hours trying to log in, being told that you should be able to when you actually cant coz youre not whitelisted‚Äù
---
Is a nice bussines tactic that every company should embrance, i dont need to insult anyone, youre just blind and dumb my god
---
I mean are they?
---
Is this your Haha got em! Moment? Some dude complaining about raid frames lmao
---
Stress testing had less people so it was possible to do couple levels. Game didn't feel that smooth because no EU servers so it has double the ping. So can't really say how it compares to original with skills and spells for now.
---
*insertthatsbait.png*
---
Looking forward to Duskwood, love the eerie
---
Why even wait
---
For sure, I think thats a really good point. The way you play the game will change how streamer's will affect your time (If you play on a streamer server).  
---
I think you're partially right about there being enough "normal" players, I think my concern comes from the fact that most of the classic streamers have 5k+ viewership at any given time, and some of them up towards 100k at their peaks. This is at minimum the cap of any realm, and in the peak case much much higher. You have to account for the fact that not every viewer is watching 24/7 so 5k average viewers usually means a much larger viewerbase.  
---
I don't think I could say that I in any way could make a properly educated guess on just how exactly the viewerbase versus realm pop will affect anything, but I hope you're right :P
---
*just die already and fuck streamers and I kms if total biscuit gets no memorial statue in OG classic and my logs say fake connect reeeeeeee*
---
It probably got a bad rep because alliance players would go there for the SM quest. You had like 3 other quests and 1 questline that gave you 1 quest for every rep tier you grinded out with the centaurs.
---
Faction, race and class are your choice dude. Why dont you ask a question that helps you learn about the game?
---
How are People enjoy something i cant!  /s
---
He only played that game because his chat begged him.  He really likes very few games, he just loves WoW. He admits it was a mistake and he never should've done it.
---
You must be playing on private servers then.
---
Im only doing it to level up. To make my mains life a bit easier
---
Not for PVP.
---
Such jealous, much envy.
---
At least they‚Äôre coming up with ways to try and hide it. 2.5/10. 
---
I don‚Äôt care for streamers either, but their being allowed to stream the game doesn‚Äôt bother me in the least.
---
Yeah, just saw that in the list. It's fucking perfect since this time I plan on reading the quests and that addon makes it look so sexy and more immersive.
---
Never had one.. level 19 twinks used to use it
---
Omar was with them so yeah
---
might be a slash command. tried changing everything with low graphics and combinations of options with no luck. gives me hope
---
I bet it's from a private server.
---
 Stress testing had less people so it was possible to do couple levels. Game didn't feel that smooth because no EU servers so it has double the ping. So can't really say how it compares to original with skills and spells for now.
---
You cant really expect an enlightening conversation with a chat of 50k+ people though.
---
Ofc you won‚Äôt get the pig. You wouldn‚Äôt get it even if it was 20 people. :) 
---
I plan to start playing at least two months after launch so I get a better experience.
---
Also in vanilla, there were no guilds working together to get great items for their most prominent members. No sir, everyone did everything by themselves.
---
I‚Äôve often wondered about this based off how much he plays each day.  What are his health problems? Just out of curiosity
---
What the fuck he's huge. Report it
---
Can I ask why you bother to ask why someone is popular theres a million different people in the world that are all different in popularity, why are you confused how some one is popular? like do you live under a rock, do you really not understand the world doesn't revolve around you or?
---
So I gather that you don't enjoy memes very much?
---
&gt;Isn‚Äôt the beta designed in the first place to fix Bugs, errors and server problems?  
---
Not really, betas from major studios like Blizzard are almost always just PR stunts.
---
Chill out m8
---
I was benchmarking Pentium J5005 with UHD 605 few days ago on retail client and although it needs very low settings it still manages to somewhat run the game... while Vega 8 integrated graphics in some laptop/desktop APUs is way way stronger, similarly GT1030/MX150 found in some "low end" laptops.
---
It‚Äôs been on private servers for years. Not many people use it though.
---
Getting paid to do what people love, it makes people insanely jealous and bitter.

---
The only popular wow streamer is boring. Kek
---
I wish I could say the same, but I stole a toy soldier from kindergarten when I was 7, im not innocent soul
---
How did you get there?
---
Look at the twitch streamers, pretty sure not only famous streamers do stream beta. It's just a fact of "making the rich richer". I don't care much about getting in beta's or not, but I assume some small streamers would benefit from it greatly (if not all mayor streamers get in first).
---
Also people tend to get salty their chances are lowered because for example 50 spots are handed out to famous streamers, leaving 250 spots open for them instead of 300 spots.
---
Probably just some rando jealous person who can't stand the fact that other people can afford to spend their money on shit that isn't diapers and baby food.
---
Go take a nap in your recliner dad.
---
Wife: I can‚Äôt believe these young, white, privileged kids just conform to this oppressive shit.
---
Me: To what? The circle finger game? Played that all the time, if you look at it before you finger it you get punched. Like slug bug.
---
Wife: That‚Äôs the white supremacy hand sign.
---
Me: um.. wat
---
I feel ya, idk where I was when they took that gang sign but apparently it‚Äôs a thing. I live in the states too, should‚Äôve seen it sooner but yup. OK symbol = white supremacy and I have no clue when or how that happened. I still have a hard time believing it, or anything news related because everything is so bat shit crazy
---
Because this sub is toxic as fuck and people are salty. I 100% agree with you.
---
Southern stranglethorn is overrated IMO. You had almost nothing to do until you were max level for the zone, the pirates were level 40ish, just like the ghouls near the arena for the elixir.
---
I remember going down there and just doing the quest to get a gorilla heart and then having to grind several levels just to be able to do the rest. I was so glad when they reworked dustwallow marshes because that area actually had quests (I'd assume those are available on classic release because it's patch 1.12?)
---
Not that much to work with in terms of builds? TBC took it up a respectable notch, when it comes to build viability.
---
Maybe I remember wrong from when I played Classic, but EU servers could go down while US servers still worked. Is this no longer an issue (or do I simply remember wrong)?
---
Is the "before" or OG picture from actual vanilla WOW days or a private server?
---
dead before they knew it
---
Same here. I'm also going PvE so there risk of being on a streamer server is even smaller.
---
He sleeps standing up so has more time to play
---
Alliance have plenty of quests in desolace, 2 chains start from a breadcrumb quest in Ironforge
---
What‚Äôs hard about determining what character you want when you make it? Being able to change your characters core identity on a whim takes away from the permanence.
---
Quin has been playin wow since TBC, where does this notion of him playing since 3 years ago comes from lmao.
---
Let them come. Blizz's cheat detections have certainly evolved in 15 years. I haven't seen a gold buying ad in YEARS. Let them come!
---
Obviously, blizzard isn't retarded
---
The red text of Hogger just completes this
---
There where addons that did the exact same thing, so why not have it? You can turn on the classic style if you prefer it
---
Ya, and I‚Äôm also going to mock try hard commie pinkos like yourself.  Why don‚Äôt you go push retail content instead of feeling compelled to involve yourself in a 15 year old game where people don‚Äôt act like communists?
---
Having seen comments like yours I am really concerned for the community of classic being really questionable.
---
STREAMERS REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
They are jealous that streamers get paid to play and get beta access.  Let them be angry and farm some imaginary karma points :)
---
No, that can still happen. But treat it like this... When a manufacture creates a car they have specific cars which they test in different ways to create the final product. That is actually what the stress test server was, it's not the same product thats going to be released but the information gathered from using it will be carried over into creating the servers for US/EU/Asia
---
I'd guess the most people simply don't care one way or another, the next largest group of people (including me) are fine with them prioritizing streamers for the reasons you stated, and the smallest group of people would be here complaining no matter what happened. If they go in, they'd complain about the level cap. If streamers weren't prioritized, they'd complain they didn't get to see what happened. I personally am just ignoring all of those threads because they add zero value to the sub.
---
One of them is the SM questchain right? I must've never found the other one so it would make sense why it felt so bad travelling all the way there considering the "quest hub" there offers almost nothing.
---
The streamers? Yes they are doing their job for money, good observation.
---
Maybe the dwarfs just got smaller
---
I'd just like to add that he also does as much community engagement as he can. He has a large community and they have fun together. This is what WoW is revered for in my opinion
---
crybaby, here we go again
---
If the extent of his bad advice is telling people which talents are good/bad then who cares? It's just a video game. It's not like hes encouraging kids to join ISIS or smoke crack.
---
Multiboxing... Kek
---
T-Bag
---
Guess people didn't catch the sarcasm here.
---
Your first comment? No.
---
The second one you edited after I replied.
---
Damn you know a lot about him.
---
Sure, do whichever you feel is best - from my end I can only add that sitting on my father's laps watching him play Warcraft II when I was 5 or 6 are one of the fondest and warmest memories I have of my childhood. : )
---
welp
---
https://classicdb.ch/?quest=1453 It's this one 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?quests=1.405#0+4+1+2 full quest list, as you can see pretty even for both factions.
---
Just use a raid frame addon if it bothers you so much, It's not like you are forced to use them.
---
Fuck the dislikes. While I agree with races having more class options, Tauren Paladin is still the most disgusting thing ever.
---
but they are USEFUL, think about it!
---
\&gt;All of the consumer base get the **same opportunity** and same **probability** to win a place. Besides streamers.
---
Yes, and the unfairness you're getting upset over is on the order of (number of streamers)/(number of people who want to join the beta).
---
Let's say they want 10k beta players, and there's 100k people who want the beta. You're getting upset that people have their chances changed from 1/10 to 0.9999/10, represent a 0.01% reduction in their chances. This is peak outrage culture.
---
And yes, you are disregarding me and the segment of the consumer base that is like me. We get a material increase to our experience with the classic wow beta by virtue of having streamers in there. If you weigh the detriment to the consumer base in the form of reduced chances of getting in against the benefit to the consumer base in the form of being able to stream live gameplay, you'd quite clearly see that this is better.
---
I think you are having trouble reading people. You are also getting irrationally upset at this, and I think you should consider taking a break from the subreddit (or maybe the internet in general) if this is actually impacting you to this degree.
---
As a person who played BfA beta, reported a shitton of bugs/issues and stupid gameplay design choices, I stopped believing beta is for anything but building hype. Streamers get a large audience, so a lot of people will see them play the game and want to join in.
---
Was there as well! Name was Brox =)
---
Loser
---
It's baffling to me to think that most of these people are probably over 20 years old.
---
Blizzard pushed the servers to the absolute limit with NEW technology just so they know how to tune the numbers when Classic comes out for real. Think about that for a second.
---
Shameful display of childishness.
---
So, you do but you dont. Literally.
---
What is that all about? Just curious :)
---
Eh, there's a great saying I love: "your values are not determined by the things you do but also by the things you allow". We have *very* limited information here but the one we receive for me suggests his wife might actually be an extreme parent. We don't know that and I definitely would not go as far as saying that she is extreme - but from what we know she could be.
---
So, because of that I spoke up.
---
But a car would drive different on the perfect highways of the US and the worn roads of Europe. Server location can have much to say, so why not add an additional test to the Line?
---
I tried to push it like 5-6 times in last few years but every time I dropped it at some point, it feels extremely meaningless because of 4 raid difficulties, mythic plus aka Diablo 3 nonsense, Titanforge/no bis potential, world level scaling, transmogrification, etc. To each their own. Are you sure you are worried about the community or just about the fact that some people with this mindset would gear up very quickly and gank your ass?
---
https://discordapp.com/invite/2r25M8Z
---
Well we are forced to use it if we have to download an add on to not see it, aren‚Äôt we.  That‚Äôs not even the point, if they change simple things like this, they will change bigger things in the future.
---
They really should be more transparent about things like that. It just makes us feel powerless and unimportant
---
Looking at https://wow.gamepedia.com/Height  
---
it seems like every race had their height adjusted in Legion.
---
Can't express the happiness from being in EU and never having to play with a big streamer
---
LFG thread gets stickied every Monday on here with guilds posting in there for recruitment
---
Well, who hasnt put up some weight in the past 14 years.
---
Preach is like watching an episode of Cosmos. Asmongold is like watching Jackass. Both are entertaining in their own way.
---
There is a massive looking for guild discord and a weekly automod thread for it too. I'd start there. That's how I found the guild I'm rolling with since retail guild is uninterested.
---
I am now. Getting mad over a stress test, incredible.
---
I am in no way trolling. I have already unfollowed all wow twitch streamers and unsubscribed from their youtube channels.
---
It's gold, Jerry! GOLD!
---
Gnome liver was a speciality back in my cycle
---
Supporting smaller streamers is something I could get behind. I'm not a fan of some of the top streamers, but I still recognise their value to Blizzard.
---
That's the guy, sad stuff :(
---
Thanks though.
---
I just wish they said beforehand that beta players would be given priority over stress test players. I would have lowered my expectations and not felt so let down.
---
&gt; there's very little reason to care about streamers at all.
---
The one's who seem to care the most are the ones throwing shade on these forums all day. Everyone else just watches it on our second monitor.
---
Even their members licked their officer's arse for better position/loot ;)
---
Exactly, like don't need that shit in WoW.
---
NO CHANGES!!! fix this Blizzard!
---
We dont even have the same talents that we had most of vanilla. How can you be so hungrig up on unimportant details ?
---
Not pumped enough to use google it seems.
---
I hope your computer overheats. Multiboxers are a scourge that should be purged.
---
It is going to be annoying up to the point the game changing ADHD kids that love streamers stop playing wow after a few months.
---
REEEE
---
ME, SITTING IN MY BASEMENT WITHOUT PANTS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THEM ADVERTISING THE GAME FOR FREE, REEEEEEEEE
---
Why do you guys hate on this topic?
---
Yeah it's all PR anyway, wether they bash the game or not, they have a large following who then gets hyped to play the game themselves
---
Cos arthas simply raised her as a banshee
---
Lol, I may not even play and if I do it certainly won‚Äôt be at launch so I will be behind anyway.
---
If the sharding and loot system changes weren‚Äôt enough to make me concerned, then the edgy 12 year old try hard mentality illustrated by you and your fellow preteens certainly has.
---
Dude actually said ‚Äúafraid I will yank you!‚Äù Thanks for the laugh little man.
---
I can't wait to see all the rage from people wiping on elites in MC runs.
---
I can understand that, but Blizzard still thought enough about you to give you a beta key. Most of us didn't, and I personally saw Blizzard allowing streamers in as them allowing us who didn't get in to also enjoy the moment as well.
---
All the pet damage is normalized in this client
---
It was Golemagg not Baron.
---
So you lost a couple hours of sleep but you went to sleep on time ? How does that work again ?
---
Nobody cares about your opinion - feel free to stay in retail if the community here triggers you too badly.
---
Lol nice bait no one is this retarded
---
Who gives a shit what they look like. You're just gonna install an addon to change the skin of everything anyway, just like everyone else did back then.
---
It‚Äôs based on 1.12, that‚Äôs clear we have talents from that patch.  Those raid frames came in 3+expansions later, there is a difference.
---
Why shouldn't they add the raidframes. Back in the day we downloaded an addon for them anyway. I don't see the point of this thread.
---
Judging by the brush strokes it's probably flash or photoshop.
---
Hi, /u/BladePocok
---
Or the dwarves are smaller.
---
7700k 1080 ti ddr4 32gb 
---
Max settings with 8x aa was getting 200-250fps
---
Exactly! Praise Rat's (mate's nickname) mom who had the "balls" to put her card details on 5 of our subscriptions! Saving all the pocket money from chocolates, magazines and all other stupid shit to pay her behind the scene was probably the shadiest thing I have done in the age of 15. But damn it was so worth it!
---
Very sad. I met them at an expo once. Super nice dudes, very down to earth. Just wanted to play some Smash Melee.
---
Most casuals wont get to 60
---
is this real? can anyone confirm?
---
big deal
---
&gt;I don't agree with you so you are 12 years old kid
---
The way I see it is that you are not unwilling to change, but you don't expect csgo jargon used in WoW or see people using Moba terms because it is WoW and totally unrelated to those just like it is WoW and unrelated to twitch so adding dumb jargon from something that isn't related is just pointless, it only creates sub communities within the community of WoW which is also pointless.
---
I‚Äôve always fantasized about living in a mud hut sooooooo
---
And Tauren got smaller
---
It‚Äôs gonna be on every server sadly
---
Get something like Boba 4G Buckle Carrier. Put you baby in it and be able to play wow at teh same time. Did the same but with Europa Universalis
---
Keep in mind that classic is a stripped down version of legion client (I think?) And WoW is made to be possible to run on every possible machine, just not great on anything either.
---
Which no one should of been saying anyway, it isn't like "Oh I am American so we says pants instead of trousers" kind of stuff, it is "This is my made up words from one platform so i'll use it wherever I go"
---
Which now I type that out and think about it, that is pretty damn autistic in the sense that someone has had the logic of "I know the jargon from twitch so I'll use it here as other people must know it."
---
[You mean this part?](https://i.imgur.com/3L3rifh.jpg)
---
I think it's still possible to go up there.
---
Yeah you could see Asmon realise that a PVP server wasn't really gonna be doable when he was doing the axe quest.
---
It doesn‚Äôt sound like layering fix anything in your case?
---
Yea plenty of guilds recruiting. Hardcore-serverfirsts and meme-spec casuals alike! What os your level of ambition?
---
It's even worse if you can't figure that out on ur own.
---
Ofc we are hyped, but some of us didnt get beta OR the stress test. Feb 2005 here. Literaly one of the 1st accs made in EU. Played 5 years on pservers, and wonder why some of us rage ? i feel personaly responsible for keeping all the 6 servers i played on (while i was considered a criminal and a nolife by most) alive and having compitant tanks to pug with. 
---
Some of us got fucked hard, and its hard not to feel left behind, when u see people claiming they were vanila veterans and raided nax when they were 12.
---
You are completely correct. Golemagg is the molten giant, Baron was the giant fire elemental. Its been ages since I've run MC.
---
I like watching asmon but this is 100% accurate because he will always accept literally anything from anyone and just assumes he deserves it which I find hilarious but atleast the EU servers don't have people like him to lose loot to.
---
GAMERS RISE UP
---
The difference was, I didnt get  ‚Äòbeta‚Äô access. I got ‚Äòstress test‚Äô access.  And clearly those with ‚Äòbeta‚Äô access were given priority as I literally watched them jump my position in the queue.  
---
I just wish I knew beforehand so I wouldn‚Äôt have set aside 3 hours of my day for nothing. 
---
And before you say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what the stress test is for‚Äù they really should have said somewhere in the post something about priority. Because getting skipped in line, no matter where you are or what the line is waiting for, is just total bullshit. I mean people get shot in the real world for trying to cut someone in line.  It‚Äôs a bad feeling
---
You literally threatened to ‚Äúyank my ass‚Äù and you take the game to an unhealthy level of seriousness THAT is how I know you are 12.  If you aren‚Äôt then you must Judy‚Äôs be a troll.
---
They were the best! Always interacting with fans on their forum. I had some really good chats with them.
---
True Canadians through and through!
---
Holy shit are people really too stupid to understand how stress tests work ? If you dont have any idea what you are talking about just trust that the people at blizzard who have been doing this shit for 15 years know what they are doing
---
Duels always happens just outside the gates.
---
Raganaros, magamablast
---
That's like 2 times worse than my 2 year old smartphone
---
It's there as well :)
---
Reddit user u/iantnotes discovered that gnomes seems to be taller/bigger in Classic Beta compared to vanilla wow.  
---
https://i.redd.it/zc8squd0xxz21.png  
---
And by looking at https://wow.gamepedia.com/Height it seems that he is right, however it's not only gnomes but every race that had their height adjusted in Legion.
---
I started playing on trial accounts when i was 5-6 ish. And got my first real account at 7. (2007, TBC)
---
Raided naxx/ulduar/icc on normal (not a full clear, but about 3/4. Couldnt be at most raid nights) at 8/9.
---
Just drop them in the world, classic wow is fantastic for learning patience, reading comprehension, planning, and thinking for yourself. 
---
Create a noob-friendly char and let them level away or do whatever they want.
---
An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind my friend.  Just because you were wronged does not make it right to wrong others.
---
OK? Quin hasn't written walls of text patronising you though so why is this relevant? If someone is irritating you over classic, why the fuck go into some random dudes stream and start complaining to them?
---
Just keep in mind that his viewer count also trippled. He earned 10.000$ during his DM run from prime subs alone. With those numbers you would look thrilled playing minesweeper.
---
Weakness like this should be purged
---
The sword off a thousand truths!
---
Also like, people would just go to thottbot before, anyway. The level of salt that some people reach over what other people do with their own UI is baffling.
---
Before I played I used to sit on one of dads knees watching him do everything from herbing to raiding (if i was awake).
---
I did force him to reroll from horde to ally tho because he was mostly an undead and they were gross and scary :D
---
If you show me where somebody promised you to play I'll officially apologize. Because as far as I know, the stres test was just a stres test, not actual play time (even had a level cap).
---
...Thunderhorn?
---
I would have if I had get in but... trying to log since 01:00 to 3:30 AM when you have to work the next day, having into account that you had to pay for the sub just to opt in the beta... to realize that if youre not whitelisted you just worked for free without a real chance to get in... I feel a bit dumb, a bit scammed since I just subbed for beta and well after all it wasnt funny for me but im glad you enjoyed it.
---
And judging by the tone and cadence of your message, it seems like you have young children or younger siblings who have corroded your brain into typing such unnecessarily temperamental, short, dogmatic, only-tangentially-related sentences aimed to control and perhaps demean. Not a good look.
---
Paladin or sham and another rogue for easy use... or druid and rogue.
---
According to Thottbot as of Mar 2007 (very early patch of TBC and the earliest I could find) the first Darnassus Quest, the Balance of Nature, should give +250 Rep. 
---
Unless someone knows of a major quest-rep overhaul between 1.12. 1 and 2.0.10, I would conclude that this is in fact a bug.
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20070316174123/http://www.thottbot.com/?qu=456
---
The problem is if you go that path what art assets do you use? Do you use the content of the expansions but tweak or remove the things that people realised with hindsight hurt the game long term? Or do we get brand new content but deal with a notable difference in art style? Tough decision that really will only come to a conclusion if Classic proves to be even more popular than Retail in the long term. The idea of slightly altering the content of the expansions to make them more in line with the design philosophy of Classic and maintaining that all the way through for years sounds pretty cool.
---
Final comment:
---
Mirror the monitor to the TV. Watching my dad run WSG on the big screen was a highlight of my youth
---
Classic is ruined
---
Imagine thinking a conversation has this much of an impact on people, jesus fucking chris dude get a grip.
---
What do you mean half is going to taxes. That sounds ridiculous.
---
I did downvote this though. Just figured I'd let you know since it seems to mean a lot to you.
---
perhaps those people shouldn't prioritize stress testing game servers?
---
Because no one willingly plays dire maul
---
Who‚Äôs ‚Äúwe‚Äù?  I know I didn‚Äôt have an add on for them, didn‚Äôt need one, you could just drag the frames out.
---
Um... no.
---
They announced the release date, and it‚Äôs in August.
---
No way people are mad at the original Vanilla experience... They didn't even pay for it, imagine if they had.
---
You have to read them as you had zero markers to tell you where anything is.
---
Yeah because on private servers they just guessed the size of gnomes.
---
Never said I did.  That is just the reasoning I found for it.  Die hard fanboys basically got muted and their opinions/feelings shit on for years. Now it's time for those to reap what they sow.
---
I never had add ons back in vanilla, and I‚Äôm a purist who would rather not ruin the experience.
---
This is blizzlike.
---
Some people simply cant comprehend that not everything revolves around them. Is it unfair that some people have a guaranteed invite and others do not? Yeah, it is.   
---
But thats not the point. The purpose of a beta is not to be fair to the people who want to play the beta but to get the best game possible, but for Blizzard and the playerbase. And some people are either are too dumb to understand this or full out egocentric.   
---
And the really hilarious part is when people complain about streamers getting in while at the same demanding an invite based on having played Vanilla.
---
I saw 3 yesterday on twitch but they had small audience.
---
Uhm ... they announced the release for the 27.08.2019.
---
So ... no?
---
WAIT WHAT?!
---
The fuck?
---
How do you think this would compare to a 2015 MacBook Pro?
---
I ll try to answer first question. Im not saying, my answer is optimal or any speedleveling, however if u do this, you will enjoy vanilla at its purest and also wont have to struggle about levels anymore. There are 3 leveling paths you can take for level 1-30 1) Human path: Elwynn Forest, Westfall, Redridge Mountain, Duskwood. 2) Dwarf path: Dun Morogh, Loch Modan, Wetlands. 3) Night Elf path: Teldrassil, Darkshore, Ashenvale. Now, to make vanilla leveling smooth, you generally want to clean all the quests in all zones from 2 out of 3 of those paths. I highly recommend for you as human the human and dwarf path. Do all the quests and dont move on, before they are done. Rotate between two of those with the same level range 1-10,10-20 and 20-30 (westfall-loch modan, duskwood-wetlands...) Redridge is an exception, its a 15-25lvl zone. By rotating I mean after clearing up Redridge, you will enter Duskwood at 23-24 level. Take all the quests and do the green/yellow ones. Ignore orange and red. After that, go to Wetlands, which is another 20-30lvl range zone from dwarf path and do the same. You will eventually level up and before orange/red quests will become yellow. Repeat until all the zones are completed. As warrior, you generally want to do lower level quests. Dont be afraid of gray quests. They might be chain quests and if you abadon them, you may miss out on a good exp chunk and reward
---
You will never change the minds of entitled morons who believe they are entitled to not only the beta but also a 1 on 1 q/a with Ian Hazzikostas. 
---
The most you can do is take the piss outta them and do what you can for the Stress test and what not because those people will quit a month into vanilla after the hype they build up ultimately doesn't stand up to actually playing it again.
---
Go to blizzard forums, there is a tracker for blue post and dont worry  coz you wont have to scroll much it was stated again like 2-3 days ago.
---
‚ÄúWe look into acc age for the beta invites‚Äù, ‚Äúyou need a sub to opt in beta‚Äù.
---
Its really easy to find, its  RIGHT BEGORE the new about sub increases.
---
I am not even said that I am planning to play in hardcore guilds, I will probably lvl in like a month like it usually takes on pservers and these people require to get lvl 60 in less than 2 weeks.
---
I mean yeah. Sometimes beta isn't supposed to be fun. I'm glad people are being positive about it
---
Where have you been? lol
---
What the hell my discord buddies told me may 27...
---
Dude, come on....
---
You were talking about the general Vanilla fanboys so i was talking about the general modern wow fanboys. Dont try to misrepresent the point i was making to gain some internet points.
---
AMD Ryzen 2700x
---
AMD 580 8GB
---
16GB DDR4
---
Running the game on Linux. Capped it at 100, but when I removed the cap it went up to 140 FPS on average.
---
This was in the Ashenvale starting area.
---
As I said, as long as there is no automation, you‚Äôll be okay, but multiboxing different classes will be a challenge. You‚Äôll probably level even more slowly than if you focused on one character.
---
But it‚Äôs your money.
---
Man, I got trolled...now I feel like shit
---
Stupid question, but without achievements to prove it, how do you know you guys were first?
---
Well the reason I think Enchanting IS good to have, is that you can farm mats easy enough. Even running lower level instances, you can get good mats for folk leveling enchanting. Also, as per Hunter main, I had enchanting and could run DM tribute runs for Great gold as I could DE the blues.  You could earn 100-150g an hour doing DM tribute runs and selling the LBS &amp; arcane dust on the AH.
---
Proving my point, thanks. :)
---
&gt; How is this toxic? Have you been raised in your moms bedroom or something?
---
Lol.
---
Well considering the donation message. You can verify or disprove the claim in his VODs
---
August 27th is the release date.
---
You should maybe ask for something more specific.
---
Overall as it seems imo Blizzard does everything correct, even to a Point that many People forgot/didnt knew. Best example is the warlock thingy, the elite dmg or even spell batching.
---
The nice thing about duels there is that people would stand and watch, or stand in line to be next. Sometimes someone would even start taking bets.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a cop out and very easy thing for him to say to deflect the situation.
---
You mean [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker].
---
Yeah Hate to break it to you but when everyone disagree's with your dumb ass comments its not them being stupid but you buddy. 
---
Your overreacting over nothing and we all know you'll still play vanilla regardless if blizzard literally fucked your mum in your own bed so stop crying and go away till aug 27th.
---
errr. I'd say NONE cos they have already provided a very public release date for 27th August.
---
They're even worse mouth breathers
---
they are... but it doesn't metter, it's a "game files" thing(client), server can't change what you see without updating your client
---
We went there with a full raid as soon as the server went up. There was no time to do it before us.
---
Wow, very convincing. Considered a career in acting?
---
must have gearscore 5+
---
Lame kids
---
Not yet. He brought it up with the guy, my assumption is he will get to it when he gets a chance. I don't wana push it too hard.
---
His first name is Tom.
---
To be fair.
---
I don't like Panser/Tradechat whatever, I don't watch her and I never had.
---
But she literally prefaced the talk by saying "I know it's not everyone who like classic who is bad, it is not even the majority" - so she is not saying anything like what you are inferring.
---
I'm looking at wowhead classic and there says it's 100, but not sure if it was just updated with this Beta Data or if it's the data from old 1.2
---

---
Also there's a guy in the comments from 2006 (allakhazam comment) that say's that give to him (human) at lvl44 11 rep points (I guess would be 10 to other races).
---
Not sure which one is right
---
private server, but what you see is client side...
---
10 downvotes from 10 fanboys in a fansubreddit... 
---
Yeah, absolutely everyone disagrees with me, even that old lady at the park feedint the pidgeons... 
---
Whatever, feel proud for being dumb, ok, nice logic.
---
Helps that it is incredibly accurate too.
---
Lol how long did that take
---
Sounds fun as fuck. All in favor of 5-10 BGs in Classic!?
---
Asoiaf is probably older than you, it‚Äôs not at all modern
---
Traditionally McConnell has been "the voice of chat". He hypes up chat, calls out Asmon on his BS, etc... But like chat he can be fickle and turn against the audience. That's why you'll see him called sometimes as McCool and other times as McCuck. His persona is way more extreme than Asmon's though so it's a matter of taste and getting to it, but one thing is sure whenever he doesn't show up for some time you can feel something's missing from the stream.
---
oh well today I learnt, that's far before my time.
---
I bet they are all vanilla players and old devs of vanilla and had a really fun time, just like the players did.
---
It was also where you'd set up a duel to exploit and get through to Old Ironforge
---
Mad about stress test. Mad about beta. Mad about the existence of streamers. Must be /r/classicwow
---
This is nothing to do with being a streamer, its been in the game forever. If you log out you have a skip the line grave period, your spot is saved.
---
Yea i remember this.
---
I watched some streamer(s) test this but I don't remember who though.  
---
Anyway, they talked about Battle Shout might be generating threat but not if party members were already affected by Battle Shout. So you can't spam Battle Shout to generate threat unless each party member clicks the buff off every time.  
---
Not sure if this was their final conclusion, but maybe someone can clarify whether this is true or not?
---
lol fucking necrophiliacs
---
Enhancement shaman would be a melee class with utility.
---
Just be a melee hunter and theyll just run into you thinking you'll try and get range but instead you'll rape
---
i actually cannot understand these crusty bitches.  i guess most are younger teens that are still in the trolling phase of life... lawd knows i was there when i was 14 and started wow
---
Im thinking about this too. Going to main shammy and if ill do it the followup char would be a mage. Get that water and later on grinding char + portals everywhere. Having a char that can do aoe is nice to get them spawns (shaman isnt too bad in those either).
---
Mage should be simple because you can just put every button in your bars to have ranged attacks as you do your damage casts on the shaman. The follow char should absolutely have ability to do ranged dps. I just wonder how do you can start two clients with the current app (just start two launchers ?) and is getting quests on BOTH chars even worth it. Should you just party up the two and share kill XP, do quests on main.
---
If you dont party and keep the 2nd char just on follow its going to be useless in few levels.
---
Im not sure if its even worth doing in levelup, but having a extra mage char on another account to give yourself portals in specific areas is very nice. If getting world buffs is going to be as hard as they claim, you are going to sit quite a bit in capital city, would be nice to have a mage alt that you could do DME or something while waiting.
---
This would help in later levelup having a L60 follow another char.
---
But you still have this!  The addon doesn't transport you to the instance, you still need to travel/communicate etc...
---
This is the perfect case of people flying off the handle without any understanding.
---
Yeah that's probably a good call. Most would give copper and maybe like 2s later on
---
Throwing ad hominems around because you can't reply to a simple counterpoint, really showing your intelligence here buddy.
---
Let's use Quin as an example. Someone that has nothing to do with WoW or the classic community, the man has no reason to be in the beta other than viewer count. Dude was reporting intro quest gear for having no stats, ffs.
---
You ended up deleting your comment üòÇ
---
That does sound a bit high, I don‚Äôt remember getting my first gold until about level 10 ish.
---
I used grid in vanilla. This shit doesn‚Äôt bother me one bit, it‚Äôs an interface, it doesn‚Äôt have to be the same shitty interface as before to be authentic. 
---
When you listen to classic rock in your car do you insist it be played on a cassette, 8track or record?
---
GTFOH
---
m8, the client is the official 1.12.1... this has nothing to do with the server... the only thing that changes in your client is the realmlist
---
if i wasnt interested in any news about classic wow i would've nope'd the fuck out of here fastest unsub in the west, i wish the main WoW subreddit would allow all type of classic wow content so i dont have to see this angry mob subreddit bashing the next streamer they dont like
---
1. You dont have to do every quest. You can pick and choose, if the quest is green and you have multiple yellow quest. The yellow will give you more xp and better rewards (usually). Red quest are almost always to difficult to do until you get higher level. Feel free to explore if you can get a quest in a new zone check out that zone for abit or move on.
---
2. I dont know I never got into macros when I played vanilla but apparently they are a big thing so I have to do research aswell.
---
3. Professions are good. If you dont want to spend gold/time getting a crafting profession up (like Blacksmithing or Alchemy) then you could go gathering professions such as Herbalisim and Mining. If you dont want to play the auction house I would suggest going skinning because you can vendor the leather pretty easily and you come across quite a bit of it. In order to level your skinning to be useful at your current level you will need to go to a starting area and skin mobs there until you have a high enough skill to move on. For skinning it really should only take about an hour or so to get it to a level where you can use it in your level range zones. Also go for mining or herb and then just check what the prices are on AH for the materials and just match them or undercut however you prefer to do business.
---
Are you level 30? You get extra money instead of XP when you are at the level cap.
---
I said  "some cancerous vanilla fan boy **coming in**" explicitly talking about "**some**" cancerous vanilla vanboys coming into a stream chat, not the general vanilla fan or even any fan outside of ones in somebodies stream. Improve your bloody reading comprehension skills man before you make a fool of yourself.
---
:rolleyes:
---
But have you seen /r/freefolk lately?
---
&gt;dealing respectful DPS
---
And so where in that post does it say that you WILL play? Cause all I see is you COULD play. And what does this post have to do with the stres test?
---
I see no reaso for you to be so butthurt. Nobody is exploiting you and nobody is lying to you.
---
It's converting xp to money because you're capped.
---
Fury warrior is fine don't have to tank
---
Ah okay thanks for the response. If shadow bolt spam is the way to go why isn't full destro more valued?
---
You don't even understand what that means, do you? Seriously, take a break, for everyone's sake. Kind of just embarrassing yourself at this point.
---
I don't understand why he looks so happy.
---
He admitted to never playing classic (unless this is wrong).
---
TBF he's probably more happy knowing he will get boosted through all the content by the loyal subs.
---
Would love to see the number on the combat log on last dead dude.
---
You are a true /u/Rage_Ironfist
---
&gt;I know they have an even harder time getting into raids as a tank.
---
I think raid meta may include one dedicated bear OT that can do backup heals *or* dps. If so, it will be a competitive spot, just like Warrior MT and OT, but there are also typically way fewer tanking Druids to compensate for there only being one spot instead of 3 or 4.
---
But we'll see!
---
As far as I recall the sub wasn't always like this. There was some big drama earlier this year that caused fracture among the community (there were actually two subreddits at one point during the drama) and the main sub just was never the same afterwards.
---
Bring back Captain Placeholder for Phases 2 and 3. #nochanges
---
&gt; The data was very limited to anyone outside of blizzard
---
I mean, according to Blizzard for years before they decided to do this, Blizzard themselves don't have the data either.
---
Feral Druids/Enhancement Shamans/Retribution Paladins are your options. All are capable of dealing decent DPS.
---
If you're just going to ignore what I said and troll, piss off.
---
I deleted a reply that got posted on general instead of this thread but ok loser hahaha
---
It makes it for a more interactive experience too, which can be super fun.
---
Horde scum! Hes looking at Paladin so OP is alliance all day.
---
Warrior is where it's at.

We've just got a bad case of nerd rage on our hands right now.

That‚Äôs what I ended up doing to get to Undercity. We got a group of 8 to bum rush and I was the last to survive but made it far enough to be at the Brill spirit healer.
---
Casual/Semi-hardcore raiding.
---
But this isnt mean as a LFG post, just not sure where to look :)
---
That is a possibility, but in that case you'd expect some kind of reply from Blizzard about it.
---
Thanks! On the discord now and will check the thread next monday :)
---
World of Warcraft: Classic will be out by the end of August 2019 and I don't think that we'll see Warcraft 3: Reforged before that. Since Blizzard didn't really announce the [Warcraft 3 remastered release date](https://egb.com/blog/warcraft-3-reforged-release-everything-you-want-to-know), I see no point in trying to guess it anymore. The only thing that matters now is that developers should release the game only when it's completely ready. I'd prefer to wait longer rather than playing an unfinished version of Warcraft 3.
---
Can confirm, I work in a data center. However, there are multiple different exhaustion systems.
---
Halon gas is pretty popular. Sprinkler systems are not the ones you think like in the movie Blade where they are dancing in the warehouse and have the blood spray all over them. Only the one that is triggered will go off to prevent total loss.
---
STREAMERS REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
As far as I know, he did get in, but was also disconnected for a period of time (along with everyone else) but the streamers made it back in no problem after that, while others did not.
---
Good point.
---
You can also try the classic recruitment Discord
---
https://discord.gg/mzCHx6
---
Actually, many streamers already said they'll roll PvE since on PvP people will perma gank them. I'm sure more will follow.
---
Just dumb american things
---
Didnt you read the email about the test? Or you missed that? Matbe you forgot since youre currently using your only neuron replying
---
He's clearly not cut out for classic wow
---
Warriors don't need to tank, they're great dps as well.
---
In classic, Holy Palla usually what you bring for raids, but for dungeons and anything else you can play whatever spec you want.
---
honestly anything streamer related should just be banned because 99% of the time it provides no actual productive discussions and rather just a flame war between fanboys and people who dislike streamers
---
it honestly is. People dont even bother reading the comments or replying, they just shit their opinions and make new threads about some stress test
---
&gt; you can start two clients with the current app (just start two launchers ?) and is getting quests on BOTH chars even 
---
Nice... good points - thanks
---
 Arena Grand Master = Scarab Lord amirite üòÇ üëå
---
So your specific problem is with Blizzard claiming no special treatment, but it being highly probable that there was special treatment? If it was the case that they got special treatment while Blizzard claimed otherwise, then that's something I can understand being angry about.
---
Im going to assume you are playing on a vanilla server.
---
Macros: you can do some very interesting things with macros. However when the official servers go online they will use another system to write macros.
---
Vanilla macros are more like a code injection and the new system is way easier to understand.
---
Since you are playing on an undocumented server i would suggest you dont worry about macros for now :)
---
I wasn't talking about the add-on but the retail VS classic social, misunderstood from both sides

There's something about being mercilessly hunted that is making these nightsabers grow up too damn fast

The streamers aren't there to report bugs, they're there to promote the game.

The GM events looked super though! Have to agree on that.

He has been doing shit load tons of dolars for a while now. That didn't kept him from feeling empty and in the verge of depression a few months ago, just before his last hiatus streaming.

Money has little to do with his happiness at the moment.

ITT: People who don't know what stress test means.

It doesn't mean you get to play uninterrupted for 2 hours fam.

Who even cares about a bloody stress test? Jesus christ.
---
In Vanilla, this was a checkbox in either Graphic settings or some other settings area.
---
The box was labeled as something along the lines of 'Death Effect' or 'Enable Death Effect'. Turning it off gave you exactly what you're referring to there there is color but everything is the hazy eerie bluish color rather than the ghostly white.
---
I have no idea when that checkbox was removed from retail but I haven't noticed it in ages.

Strafing while Auto Shooting as a hunter makes the animation for strafing left look like my character is running "backward" to the left.  
---
Sometimes while Auto Shooting I can't seem to use Raptor Strike when the mob gets close to me, I have to manually click Auto Attack first and the animation is stuck on Auto Shoot before I do.  
---
I managed to get it both on video on the same mob, check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5enk-OWpFw)
---
Sorry if these are common and known bugs or not bugs at all, it's just something I thought seemed strange.
---
He was being extremely facetious and I have no idea how you didn‚Äôt notice.
---
i wont multibox per se, but i will have a 2nd account on follow when i get my main to 60.

Enh shamans blow people up in pvp. Guess you never been 1 shotted by a windfury before?

According to a poll posted in this subreddit, you actually shared the experience with MORE people as opposed to those that actually got to log in. Something like 80% of people never made it past character creation.

**[EU - PvE - Alliance]**
---
**IRL**
---
Hello! Im Morten from Denmark, 33 years old.
---
**Ingame**
---
Planning on playing a Nelf/Human Prot Warrior
---
**Experience**
---
Im know as Mazie, my journey in started on a Nelf Priest, which cleared MC. Then I went to a newly started realm Khadgar, where I played mage in the guild that got every server first from MC to Naxx apart from 1 ZG boss. Meanwhile playing my mage I discovered my one true love, my gnome warrior alt, so when TBC hit, I rerolled Prot Warrior and became the main tank in a new guild. This guild proceeded to take every first boss in TBC that was released untill I left the server for a more competitive one. I went to Silvermoon where I joined Silence (during SSC progress), and was with them untill Illidan. Time restraints made me decide to go a bit more casual and play DPS warrior untill the end of TBC.
---
After TBC I've played a bit on/off, and currently playing a bit of BFA, but not much.
---
**Ambitions**
---
My ambition for Classic is going to be raiding. Wether it ends up being Casual or Semi-hardcore depends on the guild I end up in. I wish I could go full on hardcore like back in the day, but with a job, GF and house, thats not likely to happen.
---
I hope to become the main tank in a Casual/Semi-hardcore guild, since the role of maintank in TBC was the one I fit best in during my time of playing the game.
---
**Guild**
---
Like I pointed out, I'm looking for a casual or semi-hardcore raiding guild. I am looking for a mature guild who just wants to enjoy the game and progress efficiently, so not alot of drama
---
I don't play retail.
---
Why shouldn't I (or the posters above me) share our opinions on the state of this community? Are our opinions irrelevant because we're not hating on streamers or saying "xd retail sucks guys"
---
A lot of the posts on here are people crying about some perceived injustice or demands that the game be catered to how they want it. The reaction to the release date not being in July was nothing short of pathetic.
---
Perhaps take your own advice and feel free to stay on private servers if you're this entitled.
---
Lucky there aren't any boars in Tirisfal
---
Which was obviously a lie? Why respond with useless comment
---
Ahhh yeah, the infantile Zoomer. Taught at a young age by liberal owned media and institutions that those who oppose your views are full of toxicity, hate, racism, and rape. 
---
Get over it. A lot of us here are voicing our opinions and thankfully mods have been respecting freedom of speech thus far. If you disagree with us, explain why. Calling people toxic or name calling actually creates toxicity out of nothing.
---
Should also be noted that:
---
Data Center Technician =/= Server Engineer
---
There are System Administrators (ones who manage deployment of servers/hardware on them). The next step up would be engineer (specifically in my organization).
---
In Blizzards term, it could mean they are seeking a Devops / Programmer type. The average Sysadmin/SysEngineer can't shit out a complicated backend server stack that runs games. Closest they could get is a LAMP stack maybe.
---
There is streamer privilege because they bring attention to the game, deal with it. Even if we removed the streamers and would get a hundred new closed beta keys you wouldn't see those keys anyway. Rather have the streamers get them so I could watch the shit on twitch.
---
So quick-switch over to 2nd char when neeeded?
---
Yesterday was a good example of streamers doing what annoys everyone. Blizzard clean said they wanted everyone in the starting  spots for the stress test. what's the 1st thing these assholes do? They leave the starting zone with hundreds of their lemmings in tow to run through other empty zones spreading out the population. Devs had to put hoggers down to kill people trying to leave the starting areas. They spent the frist 45 minutes of the test herding back streamers and their followers to the starting zones and placing mobs down to kill them to keep them together. I have yet to see one big streamer actually  test shit. All they are doing is going for "world 1st" to garner those twitch clips for views and ad revenue. Blizzard is giving in because this is the cheapest form of advertisement and hype they can buy.
---
You should play at most 1 melee class, since it's really annoying to get all of them to be in melee range. I also wouldn't suggest hunter, as they will be in the deadzone if they are following a melee. All other classes should be fine, as a rogue I would prefer a paladin for buffs/freedom/heals, and a mage for burst damage and control.
---
I only watch him for his whinging though
---
Hey guys! I've been following [r/classicwow](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow)  for months now. I just decided to make a reddit account (first time  ever!) to make a comment and throw in my hat to support the RPvP server  effort!
---
I can honestly say that I was  blind-sided when I became aware that Blizzard didn't have immediate  plans for an RPvP server. I hadn't even considered that it wasn't on the  table because it ostensibly \*was\* a part of Vanilla World of Warcraft.
---
But, I still remain confident we will get one true RPvP server.
---
I  think the "layering" announcement helps our cause, too. It limits the  "fear" of Blizzard opening up more than one RPvP server and having them  become underpopulated and require a merger later on. With layering in  place, a single RPvP server will be able to grow, reduce, and stabilize  as needed after launch without risking over-producing RPvP servers  themselves.
---
And for those who think the  idea of an RPvP server seems strange, the appeal of an RPvP server, to  me, is that the Roleplay guidelines provide behavioral and naming  boundaries for the community that would not otherwise be there; and I am  still able to enjoy the game in a PvP setting which is supported by the  lore. Both of these factors contribute \*directly\* to increasing  immersion in the game. A more immersive experience is more enjoyable for  me, and many others.
---
Also, it does not  take away from anyone else's PvE ruleset, role-play experience, or PvP  availability on their own servers. Therefore, I think it's a clear win  to allow a single RPvP server, especially under the layering system, for  those who wish to indulge in that type of ruleset.
---
Long live Classic RPvP!
---
This may be a stupid question, but I haven't played in a long time. Do you still download add-ons through Curse?
---
Interesting I'm not sure where classic wowhead gets its data from. Have you noticed any other weird rep returns? And can you confirm if there is spillover?
---
I don't understand that retarded date.
---
&gt; Warrior which is a tank class  
---
Vanilla warrior is the best raid tank, a juggernaut in pvp with an healbot and one of the best raid DPS (fury warrior needs more than average gear tho)
---
&gt; Paladin which is a healer class  
---
True for vanilla  
---
&gt; Rogue which is a DPS, squishy class.
---
True  
---
&gt; I also like Sword and Shield playstyle  
---
There is niche Shockadin but meh, and tank warrior starts to deals 'decent' damage from wotlk
---
you post on twoxchromosomes and probably a whole host of political subreddits
---
you've proved my point.
---
Tanaris underrated
---
I can only keep an erection for so long
---
Are you trying to prove my point?
---
what the fuck
---
Yeah, because bringing Ragnaros was only beneficial to Amongold and everybody else hated it.
---
Streamer privilege is free advertising.
---
I think a lot of people are upset because yes we knew getting in would be a difficult shitstorm but there was an expectation there that we‚Äôd be able to play. But we get the feeling that Blizzard does not respect our time, which to a lot of people interested in clsssic is a precious commodity. 
---
I was upset but only because, even if it was just for half an hour, I wanted to get in and play and be part of the fun. Instead people got stuck and saw a lot of streamers get in who showed them justwhat they were missing out on.
---
It was a shitstorm, an expected one, but I didn‚Äôt think Blizzard was yet this incompetent or disrespectful. I guess they really have fallen. I won‚Äôt be participating in any more stress tests and I probably won‚Äôt be giving Blizzard any more of my money for the foreseeable future,
---
This was a thing in vanilla too!?
---
Thank you for understanding. I got jumped in the queue, live on camera and I‚Äôm very salty.
---
Honestly the best class to multibox would be shamans. Mainly for totems but also because double chain lightning guaranteed crits will destroy most classes.
---
Level 5. Stress server only :(
---
You dont understand the difference between fans (as in a group of people) and a single person( in this case quinn). Sorry but i wont take advice from you. Have a good day
---
You were saying how this"Stress Test" was a failure because not everyone was able to log in during the stress test.    
---
That's like saying the fire drill was a failure because not everyone was able to escape the building in time.    
---
These things are done so they can see what went wrong and to fix it from there. There are going to be more and more stress tests as launch date gets closer. 
---
All I can hear from your comment is, "The Stress Test was a failure because I wasn't able to play".
---
I was getting fed up of people saying it was a failure because they don't understand what a stress test is for, so im glad to see stuff like this.
---
This happened to me too! GM found me trying to wall jump my way into hyjal so he asked if I wanted a port. Hyjal was bare with alot of missing textures. GM let me run around for about 5 minutes before porting me back. I honestly forgot this happened until I read your comment.
---
... dead zones? 
---
I'm also not sure you understand how stress testing works.
---
People are out of their minds, they just want to play classic they dont give a shit about testing, they just want to join beta to play the game, they just wanted to join stresstest to play the game.
---
Not everyone but a lot... I am glad that those crybabies couldnt get in, they dont deserve it since they dont even understand the purpose of beta.
---
Its so sad to see what a stupid delusional community we have to suffer from once classic releases.
---
I think this may play a significant role especially if you take into consideration the fact that we‚Äôre probably only getting a handful of servers at launch.
---
It‚Äôs likely to create server pop imbalances that *could* affect game play. 
---
As an exclusive PVE server player I don‚Äôt see that affecting me negatively, but this could be a big problem for people looking to play on PVP servers
---
Its racist and bigoted to not WANT to sucks a transvestite cock jesus chris get out of here straight white mails
---
&gt;I feel a bit dumb and a bit scammed also since I just subbed for beta.
---
But you are not entitled to a beta invite, yeah timing sucks for EU (i'm in EU too, thanks insomnia). There is no real whitelist, just lucky to be in the batch that gets in or does not have the character creation timed out (managed to log in before asmon but got stuck in character creation for 20 mins T_T).
---
The point is you are invited in the beta not entitled to one though it is scummy to only allow beta invites to people who are subscribers, if you do something shitty like that, don't announce it...
---
Good find. Looks like they forgot to revert this change.
---
&gt;people have a right to call out
---
And people have a right to call you a crybaby
---
They're going to dramatically alter the experience. People give them free stuff. They host giveaways to give out fee stuff. The economy gets ruined. The streamer hosts events and has hordes of kiddies following them. They get camped or have a group of losers protecting them. 
---
It's just not going to be an organic classic wow experience with these "influencers" and their hordes of little fans running around.
---
Can you explain what pegas is? Never heard that one before.
---
Yea prolly... But my guild are going Ally :/
---
Yeah, so you are at the level cap. This is why you are getting extra money.
---
Can't you see that you and your mates getting stuck on the login screen is EXACTLY THE POINT of a stress test?? It's not a fucking demo, it's a stress test, putting the most amount of players in the smallest space to see how much the server can hold and how the queue lines work etc. This whining is ridiculous
---
so... any reason the "Westfall" text is in white even though you're in enemy territory on a pvp server?
---
Maybe you are her e-dad.
---
So you have more of a problem with specific streamer personalities having access and abusing that access, rather than the idea of streamers, in general, having special access? My point is more for the general idea of streamers getting special treatment, though I can see myself agreeing to specific cases of streamer abuse being looked at.
---
You can always jump and hold W (after jumping). This was you can jump a shorter distance than jumping while running.
---
This entire joke must be purged
---
Wtf is numlock running?

Former GM here, worked with Blizzard from 2007 to 2009 and still know a large number of people with the company since then.   
---
They absolutely do and did actively ban players for botting/using levelling services. I must have banned hundreds myself, some for 72 hours as a warning/heads up, some for life.   
---
Gold buyers were harder to ban, but did happen far more than people think. You'd be amazed at how many tickets we got on a daily basis from people complaining about their main account being banned for gold buying, after we literally had a log of them receiving a direct trade (multiple times) from "hasjdsa" or other nonsense names.   
---
Gold sellers/farmers were often banned individually, but largely in waves. As a lowly GM, I personally preferred banning them on the spot, but company policy and all that. Apparently from a management view it was easier/more efficient to do it that way.  
---
Posting this on the off-chance you're serious, rather than just a troll. Always nice to give people a heads up.
---
hey guys its ok for streamers to log in today while you can't it's just good advertising for blizzard you'll get in next week don't worry it doesn't matter that they got world first 60 because you can watch them get 60 so it's just like you're a part of it streamer privilege is a good thing
---
If you are stupid enough to think that this is one of the most toxic subreddits then you REALLY don't use Reddit much...
---
&gt; It is possible the infrastructure was so overloaded that whatever health check drives the server status display was timing out too.
---
if that was teh case. streamers would have been impacted as well.
---
just go to privateserver if it matters that much
---
haha yeah, unlike yours
---
I think people salivating to get into a stress test realm that caps at level 5 is a better indicator than twitch viewers. People are excited.
---
Asmongold server gonna be like a chuck-e-cheese birthday party.
---
At least you crush warriors, rogues and paladins
---
Thanks mate, that's really helpful. So you're saying not to take up BS right away? Instead substituting it for skinning? At what level would you suggest I start training BS?
---
I'm upvoting this so you can't hide your shame.
---
Stay safe lmao. Esfand is alright, and asmon does whine a lot but he's funny and entertaining too (imo)
---
You're retarded.
---
Dude lost it on his chat the other day for being toxic pieces of shit, really think the break helped him.
---
Because it's entertainment.  He puts on an act that's different from other streamers.  Aside from watching to re-familiarize myself with old parts of WoW, I also watch to see people working together, and sometimes have fun laughing at him get his ass handed to him in a duel.  Granted, I don't watch for 8-12 hours a day, but there's very, very few things I'd watch that long.
---
Have you been in a streamer server for 18 months?
---
How is it gasmebreaking when basically everything it can do already exist in the form of multiple different addons? Most people only use it to track their CDs and procs (of which Classic barely has any) anyway because they don't know how to properly use it.
---
Fishing would be amazing **if** you sell it right. 
---
Tell them a Story about your ingame guild friends and they want to take a long journey! What do they need for a long journey? FOOD!
---
So you start in SW (i just say ally because its more family friendly) and you take the flight master to a lake to go fishing, after that take the flightmaster and go to  \[insert "cool looking ingame kitchen" here\] to prepare the fish for a dinner, After that you can maybe ask a guild mate to meet you at a location with an empty inn, and you and your guildmate go to a table and start eating. That's next level RP but i think your kids may like it.
---
The good thing about this that you have so many lakes and a lot of different kitchens haha.
---
What i did back in the days on a pserver with my younger cousin. I was a hunter. I told him i am a hunter master and i can have 2 cats following me around. And I trained one cat so much that I could give him voice commands without using the keyboard. That other cat was of course a druid listening through TS. He did all the commands like sit, jump, dance and everything even attack. After a while I asked if my cousin is skilled enough to try the commands himself. He did and this was one of the most epic experiences in his life. He tells this story till today because he was so blown away by this.
---
The bending over and ass kissing just to get some mild recognition on stream. Oh my god so accurate
---
Dude no one is leaving you behind ffs,it's a fucking STRESS TEST! Go outside, get laid, punch dudes, climb mountains, hunt boars, play single player games, listen to Rammstein, watch My Little Pony, whatever the FUCK YOU WANT for the next 3 months and then you can freely enjoy the game. This is not a competition or r/gatekeeping on who's the better man for getting into a random beta/stress test
---
Then join everyone over at /r/thewire and talk about it.  I get lost in threads about The Wire, The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, and Justified.  It's like every time I try to look up one topic on Wikipedia and I wake up in Narnia.
---
It looks like the stress testers were given certain assignments. Group 1 able to fully go through, group 2 was able to create characters but not get through. Group 3 was only able to get to realm selection before being forced to back to login servers. This would make sense since Blizzard would want to test everything and not just the game itself. An even more sinister thought is the fact that Blizzard knows people would continue to trying to logging in, which is a perfect setup for the stress test.
---
Except you can just mount past everything and reset wherever you want, which is why open world dungeons could never work.
---
It's closed beta and it has a level cap. There is no "world first 60". You need to chill. Rather get to watch classic on twitch than give it away to some nobodies in order to "be fair" and not get to watch it.
---
Is Decursive back?  At work and can't see the link.  I know they did away with in TBC.  It made a huge difference in decursing the raid for me as a mage.
---
True, but we can still not support them :)
---
Downvotes are for off-topic replies that haven't got anything to do with the discussion, such as yours. You're the one putting a personal value into it.
---
gotta buff your pets man, SM/Ruin is a meta spec as it‚Äôs kinda chunky with your voidwalker and you do decent shadowbolt damage.
---
later on, to do more damage you can spec into DS/Ruin. which leaves you with no pet. if I were you I‚Äôd farm the shit out of gold and soul shards at an early date so when you‚Äôre at Naxx you can buy consumables pretty easily
---
Im highly inclined to think that there actually is a whitelist, there just wasnt a single issue for a streamer, but it could be coincidence
---
So this what was happening while I stared at the character creation screen unable to join.
---
People have been using addons ever since the first ones got created in **VANILLA**. People had fully modified UIs by the  time Vanilla was a year old.
---
Also, it's not like automation addons like Decursive (which got broken) or PallyPower didn't exist back then.
---
This is the real shit.
---
Par for the course on this sub
---
I'm at work atm. I will check it if I still can log in when back at home. In the chat window with rep info only showed +100 Darnassus, but didn't check in the reputations tab if other reps increased by a little (maybe it does and it's not shown in the chat window).
---
&gt; it's a stress test, putting the most amount of players in the smallest space to see how much the server can hold and how the queue lines work etc. This whining is ridiculous
---
except what did all these streamers do for the 1st hour of stress testing? they fucking ran away from the starting area and had their followers in tow. They was having a race for world 1st to wherever. BLizzard devs spent the 45 minutes dropping hoggers on the  starting area to keep people from escaping.
---
Did you think to report it?
---
Which OP should definitely report this. It looks like a hiccup in layering trying to behave like sharding, which us definitely something they need to know about.
---
I am
---
Or maybe there were other people that got in and you didn't see them because they aren't streaming? You aren't being singled out because you aren't a streamer get a grip.
---
Too bad the Horde didn't get any boss spawns, all they had was Hoggers and congolines
---
It‚Äôs just a game.
---
Vanilla isn't about others, it's about your own journey through the game. Most people wouldn't take streamers that would get their shit handed to them seriously anyway, so you shouldn't either. Being "world first" doesn't mean anything in the game, especially if you get carried.
---
Hey guys, does anyone of you know if the droprate of items/gear is normal?? I logged in with an orc warrior and before I even turned in my first quest, I already got 5 grey gear items only by killing/looting  boars
---
Yes!
---
Its not really that bad unless you want to be the main tank for your guild but also pvp.
---
Most halfway organized guilds would cover the cost of your respec anyway if it was really needed.
---
Crimson (Horde-PvE) is recruiting. 
---
Intro:
---
We are a group who have been playing and raiding together for several years now, and are looking to step into Classic and progress at a quick pace. We like to maintain a laid back attitude outside of raiding but go hardcore preparing for and during raids to make quick progress. 
---
Goals:
---
To be the best guild on our realm, and one of the best in classic, while we maintain a good quality community of friends.
---
What we are looking for:
---
Solid players who want to push the limits of Classic and their class, while also being reliable and able to make our raid schedule.
---
Looting:
---
For our 40man raids, Loot council is current plan, though DKP is still on the table. In 20mans, when available, we will generally roll for items except a few exceptional items.
---
Schedule:
---
Our tentative raid times are
---
Monday: 19:00-23:00 CET
---
Wednesday: 19:00-23:00 CET
---
Thursday: 19:00-23:00 CET 
---
Sunday: 19:00-23:00 CET 
---
We shall use extra raid days to do guild dungeons, 20man raids, and farming when 40man raids are cleared for the week.
---
We require 90% Raid attendance.
---
If you are interested. Message me via reddit or on my discord Oulous#4513
---
I remember killing you twice on your journey, we were wondering how the hell a night elf got there
---
Glad you enjoy watching streamers. I don't. A lot of people play this game because it "equal". Everyone works hard to level characters and aquire gear in the same allowed time and difficultly. This all combines into making you feel equal. The second you start to give someone privileged access makes others like myself feel less equal. At what point do you stop?
---
I'm a grown-ass man and I can enjoy Asmongolds schtick at times since there seem to be a genuine guy behind the persona that really loves the game. (while McConnell seems to be exactly as stupid as he presents)  
---
But I hate Asmongolds fanbase of edgey kids and Trumpinistas.
---
Streamers BAD! Reddit GOOD! YES YES
---
Man i keep seeing the dumbest shit in this subreddit.
---
"Why would blizzard want recorded footage of bugs and inaccuracies, including possible hours of gameplay that lead up to them, with hundreds or thousands of extra eyes to spot said inaccuracies and bugs should the player miss them, as part of their beta testing? Who ontop of this even act as marketing! All for 1 key. Its just baffling why blizzard invite streamers for just this over me, a 70 iq ape"
---
Vatolocon AFK'ing like always, sigh...
---
You are toxic
---
You can't fix retail, it is so far from the original game that it would totally alienate the current players. It would get much more time consuming and skill oriented, two of which most people that play BFA don't. They want a slot machine that will give them instant gratification. There is no hope for retail.
---
What is already in beta? Are they just doing spell batching as it was in 1.12?
---
What? Cringe nerd
---
Asmongold,  I hate you with the intensity of a thousand thousand blazing suns. The entirety of human language cannot begin to express my disdain for you, you sniveling worm, your grunting ape, you whining dog. You've insulted, demeaned, and outright mocked forces beyond your comprehension, and an end shall soon be upon you. As we speak, the legions of Hades come against you, there will be no mercy, no recompense, and no respite, for your transgressions are beyond forgiveness, and you will answer for them. Eternal torment and woe be upon you, lowliest of fools, weakest of men, dirtiest of filth, for oblivion's embrace is beyond you. One might be tempted to apply conventional insults to you, you are an Idiot, a shameless attention wh0r3, an Ugly m####f####, a whiny Bi###, sleezeball, and so forth. But the fact of the matter is that those insults and the various colourful variations and combinations of which never the less give you too much credit. Even idiots can be put to good use, even if just as projects to cheer people up or sweaping the floor, an attention whore might be amusing in some way even if just by accident, plenty of ugly people are decent and respectable and better despire their asthetic deficiencies and Whiners can contribute too, even if they make a fuss over nothing and are annoying as fuck and a sleezeball might have some good ideas despite his loathesome mannarism and attitudes. Not that these terms could not be applied to you, no, no. But because the people that those words described can be put to use in some small way to make this world a better place, or at least have some vaugely redeeming qualities. You, however do not. Never before has in the history of the universe have the forces of the nature come together to create such an abyssmally substandard human being such as yourself. What are you? You are a Waste. I don't pity you, i pity the tapeworms that are forced to endure dwelling in you horrid intestinal track. I pity the water atoms which have passed through the blatters of Great People, be they Enlightened rulers, scientists who push forward humanity, heroes who have saved the lives of thousands or simply pleasant, kind hearted and Generous folk and now must endure being stuck inside the cell tissues of your horrid legs. The only possible way you could endevour to make this world a better place is if you went into a chemical waste dump with a sharp rock (not a knife, some object that was shaped by the hands and minds of mankind and the fruits of their efforts deserve some respect, which befouling it with your bodily juices is anything but) and stab yourself in the chest, letting your body degrade amongst corrosive industrial run-off so it may be elevated to its level and that the materials that the universe would have eighty more kilograms of free material to be turned into anything other than you. 
---
TLDR: I'm your #1 fan Asmongold add me on bnet lordspaghet#1826 so we can do dungeons
---
The ZFC I think. Zandalorian something charm ;)
---
I am not really about the server firsts. I don't have the time I had 15 years ago to grind that stuff. This time through will be more about the game than the end.
---
imagine going on a wow subreddit and asking how many sweaty neckbeards there are.
---
The internet needs it's bacon!
---
you were fine with streamer privilege in beta why wouldn't you be fine with streamer privilege on release?  can't have those viewers watching a week long queue as millions of players try to log in, but everyone can experience classic if the big streamers are guaranteed to get in
---
It wont change retail. Two different target audience.
---
Retail no longer has an immersive RPG experience and (I assume most) people who play retail dont want that. Why would they want harder leveling when they can level cap in less than 14 hours? Why would they want to feed their pets or have to look for groups when its been spoon fed to them for 6 or so years now.
---
Dont get me wrong its obviously possible to like both but no way Blizz will risk whatever sub# they have in BFA by changing it to mirror aspects of classic.
---
Good to see they fixed that warrior haf mana bug
---
It opens the flood gates to other changes, what happened to all the #nochanges people?  Might as well rebalance undesired specs to make everyone happy now.
---
Oh right, thanks for the clarification TIL.
---
&gt;It doesn't mean you get to play uninterrupted for 2 hours fam.
---
tell that to the streamers that ran out of the starting areas for world 1st in the 45 minutes of localized stress test. Devs had to place hoggers to keep people herded in the area that wanted them.
---
All of us who tried to get in for 2 hours straight were just Blizzard test puppets. It's obvious some accounts were on priority so they could get in and others were not. I realise the purpose of the test but jesus I would have actually liked even 20 minutes of playing.
---
If you saw it on youtube it should be in your history
---
&gt;Most people wouldn't take streamers that would get their shit handed to them seriously anyway,
---
What kind of nonsense is this?  These drones would compete to see who could give Az the most shit in the hopes he mentions them on stream.
---
Nah, most people here are too noob to be toxic
---
Congrats! Send me a DM if you're interested in grouping. I'm on PVE.
---
Or they just had some fun during a dumpster fire of a stress test. Weird right?
---
I would love to have this confirmed as I am fairly sure it was a thing in Vanilla
---
Try 6 hours
---
It‚Äôs literally not for that at all and will not change that in any way whatsoever
---
Guess what, world's first already claimed 15 years ago.
---
Their still in the server dumb dumb
---
I think it's a mistake to look at classic and go "oh lets make levelling harder".
---
I think it's more accurate to say "lets make levelling more rewarding, and it'll be okay to make it harder/slower/whatever".  Wanting to blitz through it is a symptom of there being so many levels and so few jumps in power along the way.
---
Examples of playing on a server with big streamers like Asmon or Soda:
---
1) Forget about questing in the same zone as he is, since not only is he playing there contesting the same mobs as you, but he'll have hundreds of players following him trying to help him or griefing his playing experience, or griefing yours just to help the streamer (i.e. tagging the mobs so you can't complete the quest but the streamer can);
---
2) Forget about getting that sought out item you're farming in an instance if you happen to be in his group. You may roll need as much as you want to, but if another player wins the item they'll give it to the streamer if he wants it.
---
3) Forget about trying to get cool titles like the Scarab Lord. You may struggle as much as you can with the questchain and ultimately give up since you can't do it alone or with a small group, but at the same time an entire raid group of stream followers gives him all the items needed to get his own Scarab Lord title without so much as a sweat.
---
4) You acidentaly killed the mob the streamer was trying to kill? Tough luck, you now have hundreds of players mass-reporting your character which results in an instant ban for you due to how the report system works in the game. This goes the same if you killed the streamer if you're playing on the opposite faction, good luck runing away from a full raid of followers coming after you and camping you for hours just to get back at you for killing the streamer.
---
These are just some examples
---
No one cares.
---
This! I was so happy it worked still!!
---
This goes back to OPs post. The purpose if yesterday was a stress test, it was not a demo. I know you and a ton of other people wanted to play, but that was not at all the purpose. All of this is for the launch to go well. This time and energy costs blizzard money, they are not doing this just to mess with you. This is QA which is for our benefit, not theirs.
---
The streamer's teeth in this picture are too small
---
Honestly I was just happy enough to see the old login screen again.
---
lol as if poe is a shitty diablo clown, diablo 3 is the shitty diablo clone nowadays
---
I feel like most of the cities felt so grand when you first saw them except for Darnassus and maybe thunderbluff.
---
I wish I could explore Azeroth for the first time again üò©
---
The rule for multiboxing is actually "One click, one action *per client*". Input broadcasting is not against the rules.
---
Calling a spec ‚Äútoxic‚Äù just seems like a poor choice of wording.
---
You should... find something to do.
---
Written by chills
---
Literally everyone was spamming "summ ragnaros" near omars char
---
Streamers bring the bugs to many watching eyes. It's the best way to look around for stuff that shouldnt be there.
---
I dont get it with people wanting to get in the beta just to fool around. Wait for classic release. This is not the game, this is part of recontructing the game. Do all you can to help them/us. Whining on reddit does not help towards a game ready for launch.
---
I myself dont want to get in the beta because I can't see how I could be of any help improving the game. If i got a beta key, i would enjoy it sure, but still I would think it was a waste.
---
Yeah, I'm in the same boat. Sucks. Let's hope other people submit this then.
---
Wait, who cares? LOL get over yourself man.
---
weird flex (70 dollars a month or w/e does it take to multibox 5 accounts) but okay
---
Sharding is a relatively new thing, which removes other players physically from your view. 
---
Cross-realm BG's were brought in to help lower the Battleground queue times. I'm personally of a mixed opinion about this. On the one hand, I remember the joy/fear of seeing someone on the Horde team who I knew I wanted to kill or avoid like the plague, but I also remember the queue times that took hours. 
---
An important factor of Classic was being in a Guild, and being somewhat sociable (this continued through TBC and maybe a bit in Wrath). Part of the issue with the modern game is the lack of social interaction, I can log on with my Druid/Warrior/Warlock, press a button and enter a dungeon/raid and have literally no conversation. No discussion, no chatting, no laughs. Communication is non-existent. 
---
LFG/LFR massively contributes to this, because a system is in place which highly increases the chance of no further interaction with people. The -requirement- to directly interact with your team mates is gone, you're now effectively playing with NPC's.   
---
LFG/LFR addons -will- take away from the community aspect of the Classic experience, which is one of the reasons people like myself and thousands of others actively campaigned for Classic. You go back to the old threads about the joys of Nost and why Blizzard should release Classic, community is a massive reason why.
---
I understand that man, I think there definitely was some priority, but can you really be upset at blizz? The streamer priority makes sense- it builds hype for the game. But I genuinely think the servers were just too fucking slammed.
---
Gnomes are baby dwarfs, everyone knows this. That taller gnome is just two years older.
---
Wise words master Yoda.
---
So if I understand you correctly, you have more of an issue with streamer "culture" than Blizzard potentially giving special treatment to streamers? I can agree with arguments against streamer culture, though I wouldn't know what to do about it.
---
If streamers were well behaved, according to a definition you would agree on, would you have a problem with Blizzard allowing them access to content at the potential cost of regular customers?
---
In Vanilla yes but not in Classic.
---
I think the whining is an act, purposely hyperbolic, which is what makes him hilarious to me.
---
Any class, any spec can farm a minimum of 30G an hour by just killing any mobs (assuming we're speaking lvl 60 here).
---
I can't figure out why someone multiboxing is a loser either.
---
You are building the mother of all strawman arguments here mate.
---
If only it could do was track procs and cds I wouldn‚Äôt call it gamebreaking. 
---
Weakauras can do everything you can imagine and even more. It can transform the hardest most complex fights into complete facerolls.
---
I did, quote:
---
We will, however, be making exceptions for established streamers and/or "influencers".
---
Did you?
---
Who are you kidding?  This game is all about the end.
---
Maybe they have different infrastructure server beta participants? Who knows. Whatever the case, I don't feel they were trying to deceive or cheat us out of anything.
---
Thanks man. Yeah if I remember correctly, you'd only see +Main Faction but you'd get like ~25 pts to some/all of the others.
---
just imagine caring about streamers so much you type imagine being this salty on the thread about an imaginary tide-pod eating kid loving streamers too much
---
Well of course if you can solo high lvl instances it start to make sense. However very few classes can do that !
---
Why's the middle guy look like Asmongold
---
There‚Äôs nothing we can do if 100k people want to give asmongold and sodapoppin free shit. It‚Äôs their right to. But they also have the right to refuse it.
---
It‚Äôs kind of ironic to hear them advocate for #nochanges when clearly the biggest change is they didn‚Äôt have an army of followers in 2004
---
You really think world and server firsts won't be coveted in classic wow?
---
I'm probably joining "the streamer server" for the world PvP that's being epic since now. But I don't plan on watching them.
---
I mean, if you love wPvP, there are the server to roll on.
---
Can anybody explain to me why Asmongold is so popular on Twitch?
---
Thanks I'll have a look! Which class have you enjoyed playing the most?
---
What?
---
Just because you have an active sub doesn't mean you get into the beta it means you have a chance to get into the beta. It's in the fine print on the Classic beta webpage " Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account. "
---
 [https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule)
---
It depends on how many classic servers there will be. Hopefully too many, rather than too few to choose from.
---
Bitter old people can sometimes be even worse than immature teenagers.
---
You didn't catch on to the fact that this is satire from tge part where they say they will take into account the streamers cleavage?
---
This is just embarrassing for the community. There are some real bad apples here, I hope they wont spoil the barrel.
---
&gt;Report "it".
---
Gnomes have feelings too, you know.
---
In the Stress test I noticed that, hovering over an item in my bag, with the shift key down, I got the "Replacing this item will result in the following stat changes" message, which I am fairly certain didn't exist in Vanilla.
---
And you're the one still replying with short, vaguely demeaning, and basically directionless simple statements. Proving my point, thanks. :)
---
You absolutely must be trolling.
---
How can they destroy the economy just by giving/recieving things?
---
I mean, it's not like they can generate wow gold from thin air. Unless of course Blizz add wow tokens to vanilla.
---
You couldn‚Äôt login? Wasn‚Äôt that the point?
---
In the stress test, my character portraits flickered.
---
Too bad thats what everybody is gonna be doing. I love rogue, but seeing how popular it is, makes me not wanna pick it.
---
Hey I am kind of in the same boat. Warlock, mage, and hunter. Are all decent choices. You have the ability to level pretty quick, and at level 60 you can farm very well, so if you are waiting on a group there is that at least. Although with mage and warlock, they are always sought after dps for raids and 5 mans. Can‚Äôt ever have too many mates, and warlocks are just helpful.
---
There is also Druid if healing and or tanking is a must for you. You can tank all the endgame five mana and ubrs if you want to.
---
Sure did.  He and his chat were negative as fuck before his break.  Glad he took a break and realized it. Hopefully he keeps his chat moderated.
---
The way we usually login, outside of not being able to connect (which of course people had issues with) all would normally login at the same time, so it wouldn‚Äôt be toooooo hard.
---
Essentially if one would get in, the others would as well.
---
100% serious
---
this guy is such a noob honestly. probably the only content creator that i'm actually salty about getting an invite. yesterday he ran all the way to AQ as a ghost thinking it would allow him to spirit rez there. and on day 1 of the beta he reported white quest reward items not having stats on them. this guy is kind of a joke not sure how or why people watch his stream
---
Lol, if you thought that it was any different in vanilla you're ignorant. Those who got the mounts had loads of drones too. If you thought that you could solo that quest chain you would be severely disappointed. Let's be real here, you wouldn't get the mount anyway.
---
Hi, /u/pattycracks
---
My wife is playing on the stress test version. So yes, anyone at work you should still have time !
---
Your either a troll or the worlds dumbest person because you just admitted that your down votes are from fans in a fan subreddit so you know your fighting a losing battle and yet you still think people give a toss about your opinions? You lost any opportunity of people taking you seriously after you compared a gaming company to a racist genocidal regime. You need some help kiddo because you clearly take this game far too seriously.
---
Fascinating.  First i've heard of a stress test only person actually getting past character creation.  Ofc, negative reports bubble up far more easily than positive ones.
---
Yeez people are salty, usually, the streamers don't get world first, except the hardcore guilds like Method etc. I highly doubt the streamers you probably are referring to, correct me if I'm wrong, Asmongold, Sodapoppin etc won't get any world firsts.
---
It has Vanilla like pop : 3500 (1500H &amp; 2000A) lvl 60 were connected last 2 weeks.
---
I only looked at horde side prices though.
---
I don't play on it so I don't know if a mafia controls the price or if there's so little offer that sellers make the price they want.
---
I hope it will be better in classic !

Again, that is all you are able to hear from *this sea of loud comments over here.* I recognize that the sub is full of people complaining about not being able to get in. The sub is also seeing a spike in people doing what you‚Äôre doing: coming in with something like, ‚ÄúLorem ipsum solor dit amet *entitled,* kid,‚Äù and cashing in on the upvotes. 
---
All my comment does, and all it still is doing, is speculate on the specific intent of the stress test and posit that collecting login and character creation data is not being seen as a success from inside the development team. These systems are less likely to have seen significant change over time and therefore more likely to have already been closely studied during previous releases. This is coming from someone with a degree from a top 10 university in the US in electrical/computer engineering, another in computer science from the same university, and nearly a decade of professional software systems experience. 
---
If you would like to debate the specifics of my claim, then put forth your own counter argument. Otherwise, off you go back to said *sea of comments full of whining voices over here*; good luck with your low effort karma farm!
---
I really think there won't be nearly as much wPvP in the other servers. The stream's servers will have loads of wPvP all the time, specially on the PvP servers that some streamers are playing horde and some are playing alliance.
---
The rivalry will be epic
---
All of the big streamers (and their friends) have said they will all roll on the same server and are passing the info around.
---
This reminds me of the scotsman from Samurai Jack. 11/10, 2nd half was a bit drawn out though.
---
Thanks Anthaenopraxia, I'll take that on board.
---
17% for a credit card isn‚Äôt the cap in America. I believe it‚Äôs around 25.99%. 
---
Just because I don‚Äôt know other countries credit system doesn‚Äôt mean America‚Äôs system isn‚Äôt fine if you know how to take advantage of it. Thanks for playing though.
---
&gt;There‚Äôs nothing we can do if 100k people want to give asmongold and sodapoppin free shit
---
There is though.  We can come to an agreement as a community that they have an unfair advantage, and therefore are disqualified from any achievements.
---
Hell yeah, Rammstein and My Little Pony... fucking metal.
---
Haha my son is 10mos and loves smashing buttons on my laptop, I forsee a few deaths from that in my future.
---
Uhhh people can give and give away rare items, and throw em up on the AH and screw economies. If fancies start giving away mats and some hordes them and the value sky rockets m, or the AH is flooded and it inflates. 
---
The point is it won't be an organic experience. Players will favor streamers and streamer planned events and communities will alter the style of gameplay on that server, for the worse.
---
You aren‚Äôt wrong tho ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
For a sub that talks about how great the vanilla community is they sure act like assholes against new players.
---
They are mad that streamers like Soda and Asmon got into the stress test and they didnt. Seems like they really dont like Asmon though.
---
It doesn‚Äôt. Interface is not content.
---
#nochanges crowd are stupid anyway,
---
Have you ever considered that not ***every thought*** that pops into your head merits a thread being made about it?
---
Literal imagining
---
:O
---
Yea but attackspeed wasn‚Äôt changed for pets until 2.0 so brokentooth should still have the 1.0 attacks per second, and that is the highest dps possible from a pet. Did they use the same attackspeed from 1.12 or is it the attackspeed normalization from 2.0?
---
I got into the stress test with a gold purchased sub. Bought it 4 days ago.
---
no there is hope for retail but teh change will have to be slow... like 15 years slow.
---
*plays the worlds smallest violin*
---
Your attitude looks more suited for BFA my friend
---
I bought a sub with gold last week, got into the stress test.
---
A sub is a sub :)
---
It's completely different.  Those were guild efforts.   Also, it wasn't the case on every server.  The guy that won on my server did it largely on their own.
---
that's a socialist server for you
---
This comment doesnt ring true to me. Just because someone is playing and maybe even enjoying bfa doesnt mean that they don't realize that blizzard could do a better job in a lot of areas and are completely content with how the reward system operates. Tbh classic requires more focus and energy to level through and do base level dungeons, but the people who are playing bfa even at least a little seriously are playing a game that is much more skill oriented for people (raids and mythic +). Classic has a higher skill cap for pvp but for pve as long as you're using your consumables and cheesing windfury correctly if you're melee you'll be do well as dps.
---
More like awesome
---
Same with Thunder Bluff that shit was mind-blowing
---
Long enough for people to die from natural causes sounds like a solution.
---
Its a thread about the fail with stress test so i though i could just simple leave my opinion without others trying to impose me theirs as im not doing it, but i guess we still cant do that.
---
And i just compared the level of brainwashed, i feel it dumb to understand it otherwise since obv blizzard didnt kill anyone... at least that we know lol

You mean like this peaceful tauren which hammered down the pet bear of the dwarf hunter with his massive log?
---
That is a very good point. Getting i small power increase from talent points every level gave the feeling of growth much better than the current system. It was a rewarding feeling to finally get to that certain talent you had longed for. 
---
As for the time spent leveling i can see the issue of there being so many levels right now. Personally I enjoy the current speed and experiencing the story of an entire zone is rewarding. Getting a kill 10 bears quest in retail means put a dot on 10 bears cast an aoe and be done with it, since they pose no threat. A bit more challenge would be appreciated. But often we have many more objectives in the same area, so it might become to frustrating to complete all objectives if the mobs are too difficult.
---
it was near the end, yes
---
FIREPACK INCOMING
---
I hate gnomes period.
---
haha, nice double strawman!
---
I'm sorrry :(
---
All I know is I‚Äôm staying far away from any server they play on.
---
While I really want Classic to eventually do this and evolve down an alternate timeline , let‚Äôs just enjoy what we have first. 
---
Also, Northrend / Outland were already well established by the time vanilla launched so I think they have to exist in any alternate timeline if we use vanilla as a starting point. They could be implemented differently, obviously with a classic philosophy. 
---
They should start, however, with things like Karazhan/Gilneas/ Grim Batol which were intended for vanilla or existed in vanilla but scrapped, if they do new content.
---
Man if it was in may I'd be needing a new pair of shitproof pants
---
Nope it‚Äôs exactly how I feel about it, as a melee player for 14 years.
---
The sad thing is, those guilds will likely have their fair share of drones too.
---
But did you get into the Stress test or just the log in screen?
---
Best thread of the last couple of days for me. 
---
Sorry OP.
---
What is wrong with people these days....
---
I've read the whole text because I want to know the reason for all of this  \[insert :notgonnaliememe:\]
---
First sane post I've seen on this subreddit in weeks.
---
I did not get trolled and I still feel like shit
---
It's probably the most active subreddit for a game that less than 1% of the playerbase can actually play at the moment.
---
You know , you deleted the comment because you are insecure. Biggest loser I've seen. Pathetic.
---
take my upvote you tinfoil thief
---
So you‚Äôre not a streamer?
---
I wish I didn't sell my audio system. Hopefully I can get a much better one by then.
---
Woops... My bad!
---
Agreed.
---
Hey moron, I quoted cata to prove to you that there was no 'wall' that was put in during vanilla.  Let me explain it to you so you understand.  If there was a wall put there in vanilla, or whenever, it would have been there during tbc, wrath, cata, ect... but it wasn't because there was never a fix for it.  Because you could never get through that portal, and it never ported you to the back of deadmines.
---
If you choose to be this fucking stupid, keep it to yourself.  Alright kid?
---
How do you know you‚Äòre world first if there are no achievements in game?
---
Asmon was stuck in a 2k que as well, it just went quick because everyone was logging on and off trying to make characters, for the first 20 minutes he couldn't make a character either.
---
Wow. Just garbage.
---
Yeah, he went along the lines to saying he can‚Äôt host anyone because of how toxic it is and will be permabanning toxic people, I hadn‚Äôt watched him regularly since wod so here‚Äôs hoping.
---
He did play classic.
---
Lol without resolution all these posts are completely useless
---
I couldn't get in last night, but I've had no problem getting in this morning.
---
"People bringing 200k possible customers get more attention than meeeeeeee!"
---
lol pwnt.
---
&gt; If fancies start giving away mats and some hordes them and the value sky rockets m, or the AH is flooded and it inflates.
---
Yes, but said items still have to be farmed to be given/sold. It's not going to be different from a regular crowded server, being it a streamer server or not.
---
Yes, the stremer's followers will be favoring them, but on the other hand, there will be people commited to gank him and said folowers, leading up to an awesome experience IMO
---
This is the internet. Being reasonable isn‚Äôt allowed here. Sorry.
---
Holy shit are you guys serious ? I realize that there are actual disadvantages of playing on a streamer server but holy fuck you are taking this shit way too far. Idk why you are acting like he and his dumbass fans are going to follow you around 24/7.
---
Worst case the trade chat is aids and you meet him a few times. Maybe prices are a bit different but you guys are going full retard
---
I couldn't even make it past the char creation screen....
---
As far as we know bliz is trying to make the game as close to vanilla as possible so getting first kills is at most counted as server firsts (since we know the fights)
---
How did you manage to group that many words for you? What an achievement!!!
---
Nomad and pegas? I don‚Äôt even want to know.
---
Here's a tip: am for the nerve stem to put it down for good.
---
I bet a lot of the children don‚Äôt even know what PTO is.
---
His comments here really do seem like it.
---
The only thing it was missing was the waterslide and the octopus.
---
Literally unplayable.
---
You seem to have made up your mind about this and I respect that, I guess all we can do is wait and see who gets world first.
---
It‚Äôs extreme but not stupid, it‚Äôs a small change to revert the interface, and if people then want a different one, they can get an add on, don‚Äôt force people to download add ons because they want to play the classic game they are being sold as vanill.
---
scroll... scroll... scroll.. scroll... *see Z-Perl* "YUSSSSSS"
---
Yeah I wish we had a definite answer on this. We tried a bunch of different stuff but nothing seemed to work. 
---
Method 1: 
---
No party members were buffed at start of combat
---
Player 1 white hits the target 3 times 
---
Player 2 white hits the target 2 times and uses battle shout once 
---
Result: the mob stayed on player 1
---
Method 2: 
---
All party members start combat buffed
---
Player 1 white hits the target 3 times
---
Player 2 white hits the target 2 times and uses battle shout once
---
We repeated both methods again having player 2 spam battle shout every time it was possible. 
---
All players involved were level 2 human warriors with the same gear.  
---
We tested with player 1 only using 3 hits before player 2 used batfle shout, and we also tested with both players continuously white hitting the mob.
---
We used wolves and defias outside northshire to test, and we also tested having player 1 being a lower level than player 2, and were still unable to get player 2 to pull agro with battle shout alone.
---
Can also confirm for those who care that you can still get under SW, as well as on top of SW gates :)
---
This is the dumbest shit ever. We all know streamers have fans who are retarded but they are few and far between. Most fans of these guys are perfectly normal human beings just wanting to play on the same server to participate in events.
---
Some people will actually do retarded shit but dont act like you are going to see/meet them 24/7
---
This should be reported!
---
rip bfa
---
Please, you embarrass this whole subreddit.
---
&gt;having a race for world 1st to wherever.
---
They where behaving like players doing random shit, while having fun, witch is just normal and a positive... They are aslo still on the same server, that's how layering works
---
&gt; hoggers on the starting area to keep people from escaping. 
---
If they where particularly stress testing only the starting areas the devs could do a lot more things than drop hoggers on people... like.. I donno.. restric what areas you can go to?!??
---
Just a small trivia as well: There will be an actual race among people like me to the STV arena on launch as well. It's not secret that people know whoever loots a chest there get a guaranteed 3 gold and a good chance at some nice consumables or even a green item. 3 is a HELL OF A LOT OF GOLD for a lvl.1. Depending on where you start from you will ding around two levels from the areas you explore by the run itself and if the starting areas are bad enough this \~30min  run might actually not set you back.
---
Nah, It was easy. I didn't even need to compare people to Nazis. Maybe you can do it sometime too.
---
I'm hoping, if they do that stuff, it's a new server with a one time "clone my character" option so that classic servers stay preserved.
---
They‚Äôre level capped (5 is the cap in stress test) so they‚Äôre getting bigger payouts in lieu of XP.
---
And I‚Äôm going to stress test some more today!
---
Go to bed, grandpa!
---
Fucking ~~chads~~ streamers take all the ~~women~~ beta invites, they don‚Äôt even deserve it. I‚Äôm ~~a nice guy~~ an og 2004 account and didn‚Äôt get shit.
---
\&gt; ~~/r/incels~~/r/classivwow
---
Is Classic going to use the new models or no? I‚Äôm confused.
---
Same thing
---
(Not in beta) it uses the old textures and models in the new engine so i think if you run it on classic mode you should be fine depending on the cpu
---
I‚Äôm thankful for their streams but I hate having to see their ugly faces and hear their annoying teenage voices screaming bullshit
---
Why ?
---
You know for a bunch of people who ‚Äúplayed Vanilla 14 years ago‚Äù this game is gonna be filled with a bunch of fucking children.
---
I think Might of Menethil is the absolute best 2h?
---
That seems like a hyperbole. I was able to get in around 11 PM EST after trying for 4 hours nonstop to get past the "Character creation timed out" boss. I do not have the beta; only invited to the stress test. When I logged in, dozens of people were saying "omg we got in?!", leaving me to assume they were all in the same boat as myself.
---
You are a sad, pathetic human being.
---
I would love to see the statistics after all the stress tests are done. I'm sure the numbers in classic can beat the big private servers.
---
Dont think so, nazis were also ppl and deserve some love... btw youre mistaken the nazis as a culture(brainwhased obv) with just the army and that are 2 different things sir. 
---
The first are just guilty of being dumb and let it happen.
---
Cant anyone have that name though? Im OOTL
---
You're not being sold anything - the GAME is the same, raid frames being some ugly bullshit doesn't change the CONTENT. Are you going to bitch when you can get whispers from realid friends as well? 
---
Maybe you should stop posting on reddit, it wasn't around in 2004, go resurrect the elitist jerks web page.
---
What you're asking for is asinine, especially since they specifically said this is classic content on the current client.
---
You have no idea what your talking about. Lol toxicity is in every single game you play

I agree with you, its super disappointing how toxic and immature this community can be at times. Classic is closer than ever and it seems that all this community does it bitch and cry.
---
Pservers are NOT representative of what the classic community was like at all.
---
Pservers are NOT 100% blizzlike, and we are finding this out more and more through comparison with the beta.
---
I don‚Äôt give a shit about what you intend to do when you play (in fact that is sort of my point).  I DO have a problem with the attitude that you somehow think ANYONE is entitled to tell another person how to spec their class.
---
This min max pserver / retail mentality is toxic and arbitrary since the game is so dynamic it is impossible to know what is the most efficient spec in the any given situation.
---
Feel free to read my response history explaining specific examples of how arbitrary ‚Äúmin maxing‚Äù is.
---
Also asmonds changed layers 2 or 3 times to get on one that rag was on. So it wasnt even summoned on his layer?
---
Yeah all those damn twich streamers, they are everywhere!
---
We suspect Classic Winds has begun his [important work](https://youtu.be/Zh6iBkfvkY0)
---
If your expectation in a stress test was that you'd be able to log in and play with no issues then your expectations are pretty unreasonable.
---
If you're ending your subscription because you couldn't play for 30 minutes on a server with a level cap of 5 then I don't really think you were cut out for classic in the first place.

FUCK THE FAIRWEATHERS. SUPPORT THE HOMIE ESFAND
---
What's the fps on that thing?
---
Patch 1.10
---
&gt;Quest Experience to Gold Conversion at Level 60  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Previously, quest experience was wasted if one completed a quest at level 60. In this patch, any quests done at maximum level will have their experience reward converted to a healthy amount of gold, thus adding additional incentive to completing those quests in your log once you hit 60.
---
I think it's interesting that it's converting it at whatever the level cap is. I guess it's pegged to when you stop gaining XP rather than a level per se.
---
Jesus, the rest of his comments are just as bad.
---
This is exactly why when other raid healers would spam chat after a fight with the overall healing stats to show they were 'top healer' and tell me I'm not keeping up I would just link the over-healing meter, where 50%+ of their heals were wasted and I was almost always &lt;5% overheal. (healing as Holy Paladin) I never really cared for topping healing/damage meters as long as I was being as efficient as possible while keeping the raid alive. We are all there together and as long as you win the fight then you are all winners.
---
&gt;thankfully mods have been respecting freedom of speech thus far
---
Getting r/the_donald vibes

Well, you didnt heal in vanilla then.

Nah. I played on MG when Asmons project 60 shit started. The server was noticeably more shit up for months as result. Never again.

Hoes mad

Hi, /u/bdelswag
---
big *oof*
---
I can't tell you how many times I've seen people claiming that Game of Thrones stole the idea of The Night's Watch from the guards in Darkshire. Infinite facepalms.
---
Asmon or Soda?
---
I think they are both afflicted with acute basementdwelleritis, nothing too serious.
---
Give us Beta on alliance side was sitting at the 1k cap for pretty much the whole duration. Even ponies up 10g for the tabard!
---
Exactly the same for me.
---
Mad gains bruh
---
Thanks, you were definitely better at detailing situations than I were in my comment :)

How is this current or a private server?
---
This sub is full of addicts that's why
---
More than you'd think
---
Dudes got the cleanest ass hole in North America. üëÖ üçë

Soda is a hardcore PVPer, he doesnt really give a shit about "leveling talents" or anything like that, if he said Riposte was crap he most likely said it in a context of its PVP viability.
---
I am stressed
---
Oh god... that Keyboard has soms serious crust on it.
---
I'm always entertained by posts like this. People always forget that the vast majority of the population, in any country, is fucking retarded. And they're always surprised when some of that manifests.
---
you see what you have access to, at the realmlist
---
i think its hilarious u kids talking shit about asmon. u wouldnt say this shit to him at blizzcon, hes jacked. not only that but he wears the freshest clothes, eats at the chillest restaurants and hangs out with the hottest dudes. yall are pathetic lol
---
I was there! I invited must‚Äôve been 100 people
---
If you login to the game, you should be able to know by the realms available.  
---
If you've only got the Stress Test, you will only see the Classic Stress Test realm, if you have Beta Access you will see 3 realms, a beta pvp realm, a beta pve realm and the classic stress test realm.
---
lol be honest, yes it does mean corpse camping. maybe YOU don't do it, but a lot of people do. just like on non-RP PvP servers.
---
Ah he didn't specify he was only the for stress test and not full beta
---
I dislike starting as a cow mostly bc of TB. Lol

Firstly isnt blizz trying to reduce the lines with layering? Secondly so what if one or two people pass you in a line of hundreds of people? Doesnt really change the time it takes you to get in.

Im just gonna enjoy the game with friends and chill. All the world firsts and stuff were done 15 years ago. Speedlvling or dungeon speedruns might be the only thing left, and pvp ofc.

Yeah an what makes you special?

You are so retarded
---
I think Asmongold said he wont accept any free items or gold from his viewers before he's pre raid bis or something tho. We'll see how that goes
---
the fact that you call this a sane post when this post does the exact same as all the other posts that get hated on which is, breed toxicity. Sure he has a point that people shouldn't be so upset over a stress test and freak out about it but the way he goes about it doesn't offer anything constructive or community building either.
---
Do you really think making a post that starts with ''Imagine being butthurt...'' and then going to frame everyone who was upset as an autistic manchild who goes ''reeeeeee'''with everything they say, does any good for the atmosphere of this sub? 
---
I think not. People on both sides of the aisle are so quick to call the other side toxic. If someone is insulting streamers or blizzard, or anyone personally that's toxic. Yet, that goes both ways and also goes for people who are on the ''side'' of streamers and call anyone who complains toxi and start sentencing like ''imagine being salty / toxic over a stress test''. Sure you can find it laughable some one is upset over a stress test but if someone is framing it like that they are being toxic themselves...
---
Regardless of why, he still demonstrated a new level of stupid that continues to impress me. It was seriously like his IQ was 62.
---
You'd also think he would get an apartment with running water.
---
I really hope they keep this. The black/white one hurts my eyes.
---
That will happen anytime you switch layers.
---
Haha it's deleted now. Gamers are still oppressed it seems.
---
The concept of people thinking they get world first on a game that came out over a decade ago is so funny to me.
---
berry good
---
As far as we know Blizzard already decided to use patch 1.12 as a base for skills, abilities and itemization. If you have any idea how much different the game was in different patches you wouldn't that think raiding MC with 1.12 talents for example is actually same as in Vanilla. I think Blizz is doing good job and good compromises when those are needed but the game will not be same in the sense that calling something world first would be somehow absurd.
---
Something I learn, even if everything is perfect...people will find a way to complain.
---
Stop fighting with windmills dude. Just find the guild of likeminded individuals and let likeminded minmaxers form their own guild. I am just surprised why the hell you can't understand that this is a normal thing to ask the person to respec to a build which is needed for current raid content. How is this wrong in any shape or form?
---
And yes, the main and only noticeable difference from pservers and retail is being needed to pay for your account, so, limiting the amount of them available and not being so cocky with bannable behavior. Pretending that 5% less or more damage or 5% less or more armor will be a gamechanging for the whole community is a bit silly.
---
Yeah I remember those streams.  The only enjoyable part of them was having the Dark Souls  threads on 4chan open in another tab so I could scream into the void alongside others at the train wreck I was watching.
---
Really the only times I've found asmon entertaining is when he's been playing with someone like Esfand who can mess with him and be entertaining in his place.
---
Lmao just triggering folks. I got the beta and I got in the stress test before Esfand and Asmongold. Obvious streamer prio
---
&gt;would you have a problem with Blizzard allowing them access to content at the potential cost of regular customers?
---
I don't have a problem with streamers per say. But i've seen the damage they can do during ESO beta and ESO launch. All the beta testing streamers decided to team up together and join 1 faction. This lead to a huge disparity in population from day 1. When a streamer joined the battle. Lag was used as a weapon. The reason why they bring lag? Is because of the horde of twitch viewers are vying for their shot to be on twitchtv, or even get their name said on stream. If i had to find an applicable comparison. I would say twitch streamers are in the same boat as instagram influencers. Their heart is in the right place. But they end up fucking up whatever they touch for sake of clicks and ad revenue.
---
Some people have a hard time understanding what a beta test is.... it isn't for you own entertainement... it's to test things out.... you're not entitled to anything.
---
I just want SexyMap
---
Not really, there's still alot of variation in the stat distribution, which holds true in tbc aswell. Retail is just straight up 5+ ilvl = 5% more stats across the board or something similar, with two completely different items with the same ilvl being a 1:1 copy. It also means that outside some specs heavily skewed in favor of one stat, an ilvl increase will always be an upgrade.
---
Please get rid of the bfa thumbnail twitch.
---
Gave the route a try on the Stress Test servers.      
---
Works out for the most part, but some XP values are off and it somewhat off falls apart in Dun Morogh - mostly because I ended up at the wrong spirit healer.

Nochanges..... except for gnome height?? that aint right
---
Yikes.. 
---
I don't see the problem with requiring an active sub. Surely they want control over how many people are in the beta and if you're not even having an active sub it's pretty unreliable if you will play or not. If you choose to play then great, but if you choose to not play then they have to send out more invites, which might mean that if you start to play they get too many. It's far better to be restrictive with how many invites you send out to begin with than to remove peoples' access to the beta.
---
As what goes for streamers getting a "free pass". I have a 2005 account, played since vanilla (with breaks here and there mind you), haven't gotten any beta invite. I'm totally fine with that. If I get an invite then great I can try it out, if I don't, then great it will all be fresh to me. Streamers getting in will get more hype which means more people to play which means alive servers and that is great for everyone once the game releases.
---
The game might be #nochange, but we are changed.
---
We have websites that track world firsts, also in game you can type /who 60 to show all level 60 characters online for your server. I usually track progress by doing /who 50-60 and seeing everyone that is racing.
---
&gt;we are flinging that shit right back
---
You justified a negative action with a negative action.  It's exactly what you said.  If your reason for doing something to a person is "because they deserve it" then you "deserve it" too.  Why can't you just step back and accept a person may not have the same opinion as you, disagree with the "shit flinging" in your direction and then express your point of view without "flinging shit" back?  It's ok to express your opinion, but it's just as wrong to intentionally try to bring someone down because they did it to you.
---
They could fix the game, but they‚Äôd kill their profits. Their existing players would leave quicker than old players would return.
---
For better or worse retail is the game it is.
---
I do think there is merit in combining the raid and class combat mechanics from wrath - bfa with nearly everything else from classic. 
---
Frankly, if we could have modern quality dungeon and raid difficulty (m+, mythic raids) with the old world, no flying, no dailies, no LFX, no multiple difficulties, a long attunement, classic pacing, consumable based &amp; worlds resources scarce...I‚Äôd be so happy.
---
As it stands, I‚Äôm intending to keep my retail character raid logging so I can keep some challenge in the game. I love. Massive pace, but raiding in classic is a yawn compared to retail wow.
---
I‚Äôm kind of with you on this. I tried watching his stream for a while but, I don‚Äôt know, maybe I‚Äôm too old. It just seemed stupid. Hell all the streamers do to me - it‚Äôs effectively people talking to themselves alone in a room while a chat box scrolls by at light speed.
---
I get the whole ‚Äúshared experience‚Äù aspect of this, and maybe it‚Äôs just an evolution of chat plus Teamspeak that I had in my teens, but nothing about watching this dudes streams makes me feel like he‚Äôs producing content worth the money he‚Äôs getting paid.

I better not see streamers getting in before me on launch day.
---
He is acting pretty much every second he is on stream.  I can't believe so many people don't realize his shtick is just a part of his persona.  And I, too, find him funny.  "I want you in a loose gaggle!"  (When directing his PVP minions in Arathi a few days ago).  Funniest thing I've heard someone say in a long time.

No and hell no to a quest

Asking why someones popular is a relevant question. Take a look at Kim Kardashian, ask why she's popular. And it will vary - what started the popularity and what keeps them popular. Same thing goes for this guy. What made him popular, and why is he still popular. His personality is very lackluster, and can be offensive (childishly so) and it can make people wonder what makes this person so popular? Is it just because kids watch? But no this person wants to genuinely know, is there a reason or thing that made this guy popular.
---
Sarcasm flies over most people's heads for some reason.
---
I think it's it mostly because we have a big bunch of private server people in here. Most private servers have the most toxic, disgusting communities you'll ever come across. Just check r/wowservers

The ‚Äústreamer‚Äù issue is so blown out of proportion on this subreddit that it‚Äôs beyond words.
---
There is definitely an playerbase out there that will enjoy the hell out of it and I am sure many will play it, but many will also just come in to check out the hype and bail out when it gets too difficult. That first 10 minute corpse run in the barrens might be the breaking point for many people for example.
---
Just today for this specific test. It should end sometime today
---
If that is a concern to you, here is a solution: wait a year after the release to play it. By then, population should have spread and casuals will have dropped the game.
---
I disagree, I think people don't even read comments or replying. They just come in and vomit their opinions and rehash old threads about whatever topic is at hand.  
---
^^^^^^^sorry
---
I logged into the stress-test realm just to revisit Auberdine. My favourite hub in WoW :)
---
That's not correct, the Horde streamers were waiting around for bosses to spawn, doing congo lines and killing hoggers, but they waited in vain
---
Really? I find him very annoying.

yeah the bot was wrong, this happened about four hours ago.

So it's actually playable, don't know how well the game is optimized
---
The hit box size reduction is the only reason I don‚Äôt want them smaller. It‚Äôs such an infuriating problem to have.(feral druids with their off center hit box are the epitome of this problem)
---
&gt; If they where particularly stress testing only the starting areas the devs could do a lot more things than drop hoggers on people... like.. I donno.. restric what areas you can go to?!??
---
Pretty much this, there's nothing stopping the devs from 1) putting a restriction on which race to create, thus forcing everyone into the same starting area and 2) putting a giant fucking wall to stop people from leaving.
---
*Didnt play Classic *
---
Starter items without stats &gt; bug, better report it.
---
I am so looking forward to the shitshow that classic launch will be.  Running out of the initial leveling zone is going to feel amazing as the world opens up and there's less competition.
---
Slow or fast, i will enjoy the game. Plus not everyone is rushing things pointlessly.
---
Not sure if serious. Its doable. Some classes can even do 35-40g an hour by farming maraudon. Roll a hunter if you are so woried about money
---
When people say streamer in this context they mean the 10k+ retard brigade ones, or the 2-3k ones who come together to combine into a 10k+. Anyone sitting at 1k alone isn't significant enough to have fans make up much of the population. The wow twitch category really does not have many big streamers, there will probably be two or three real streamer servers on US, seeing as some of them intend to roll on the same one.
---
Got mine just after the first WW, but I had to unsub during the Great Crash. I guess this is why I still haven't received my invite yet...
---
No they don't
---
The hot takes on the official forums are gold, as well.
---
Try asking a genuine question. Most people will insult you rather than help.
---
There are a lot of comments from people who have clearly never watched more than a few clips of these streamers. Quin was a "Cutting Edge" raider on retail WoW until Betrayal league in PoE. He's been in the Blizz community for ages, especially in D3.
---
The gatekeeping in this sub gets pretty insufferable if you scroll too far down in the comments.
---
Yeah the actual video I dont mind but if they could hide their webcam and chat that would be great. I hate listening to them bitch constantly. People say Asmond is just putting on an act which may be true but if you act a certain way 99% of the time then its no longer an act, thats just who you are. Its annoying as hell. However one good thing may come from a streamer. If I happen to be on a server with one I will finally level a rogue just to fuck with them as much as I possibly can. Just sap lock in SW
---
Where did blizzard explicitly state they wanted us in starting zones? Prior to the stress test they said they were excited to see what we got up to.
---
They also made no comments on server broadcasts on beta or the stress test to not or to stop the race.
---
Calling bullshit.
---
This is a real issue that will destroy the Classic experience on the servers with these popular streamers.  I don't mind Asmon, I will watch some of his stuff on the youtube, he knows WoW better than almost anyone.  It's the twitch chat, it's like pure distilled human refuse...
---
Jesus. The way you treat streamers you'd think they personally strangled your dog and made you watch them fuck your mother.
---
If someone gets carried, good for them. Won't harm my experience with the game any. Or yours either.
---
His joke is one-bit. It's pretty bad. Self Deprecation as a comedian gets boring after a while.
---
No flame, just looking for a place to report that I couldn't even get into the game. Tried entering at like 19:20 EST, got in queue, got to realm select screen, and then got kicked after trying to enter it.
---
Requeued again, this time got disconnected while trying to retrieve the realm list. This happened another 2-3 times before I decided to just wait a bit to see if things might calm down. Like 20-30 min before the event was supposed to end, I tried again, got back to realm list finally, but the only realm available was listed as Offline.
---
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Authentic Classic experience! üòÇ
---
Zoomers zooming hard in this thread!
---
I don't think you know what that means.
---
I would love to recover my old account but I'm not sure if I ever did the merge with [Battle.net](https://Battle.net). Can you recover it if you never merged?
---
What is.... "life"?
---
Classic was optimized for 4:3 screens, therefore had a different FOV. Modern WoW is optimized for 16:9. The height isn't different, it's how the high is shown to you. Both gnomes would, for instance, jump at the same height.
---
Can I play with the original blob shadows? The new detailed shadows look out of place.
---
Queues are kind of req for mega servers
---
classic is just a quick cash in to fund the shift to mobile development for the asian market, that much is clear. naturally they save money on servers etc.
---
I totally agree with you. You explained it nicely. The problem with current classic numbers is that:
---
1) Technology advanced a lot, so we are no longer gonna play it with 10fps on dialup internet.
---
2)Wow is no longer something new. Players know it in and out. Mechanic and knowledge of game are almost second nature to the most players, and since we no longer have hardware restrictions it won't be too hard for new players to get used to it.
---
3) Knowledge that is available on the internet makes it a lot easier.
---
With all that, the only way to make it survive long enough in the current age and without making any changes is to just do what private servers did, make mobs harder to kill and more dangerous.
---
People on this sub won't bother reading or digesting what you are writing, even if you put it nicely for everyone like you did. They just see the whole text as "CHANGES" even though it changes nothing. Its in vain.
---
Yeah some people are just clueless about how things work. If you use these services but don't ever say a word about it and you don't make it obvious, most of the time you'll manage to sneak by or get away with a slap on the wrist. But if you're a loudmouth about it, yeah you're getting banned for sure. Just to set an example.
---
I believe Blizz said anything that automates the game would be banned and specifically called out decursive as an example.
---
I don't know what you mean. I just tested it out on the stress test realm and mobtagging for players is definetly working and rewards 100% experience. Can't check dungeons for obvious reasons. #GiveFullBeta
---
The WoW community literally has always been the most toxic and most immature gaming community.
---
So I guess #nochanges it is?

MMMMOOOOOOMMM!!!!! Asmongold pissed in mah Wheaties!

Did you try the spot in the pathway between the military ward and the great forge? iirc it was also possible to start duels there
---
Again, it won't be the same organic experience. That's the simple point I'm making. 
---
It's okay if you eat tide pods, have a shaved head and love streamers. Doesn't mean that experience needs to be forced on the rest of us.

Oceanic servers still had bad ping for years. They weren't located in Australia until WoD. For years they were just on Oceanic time but still located in the US. (eg Jubei'Thos was born as an Oceanic realm in early 2006, so that's like eight or nine years playing on an "oceanic" realm that was actually located in the US)

I caught Quin‚Äôs stream a few days ago and was pleasantly surprised. Erik and Quin is a dynamic duo that‚Äôs actually really pleasant to watch. He‚Äôs pretty much a vanilla newbie who‚Äôs always challenging the possibilities and defying conventions while having a good time doing so.
---
So many whiners in this subreddit. Losers who must have forgotten that vanilla had a ton of addons. HERP DERP BLOCK ALL ADDONS. Idiots, vanilla was full of addons. Yes the addons are better now and have more functionality, but just don‚Äôt use them?

This is actually a really good catch, well done.
---
Streamers and their groupies are the reason the stress test was a failure. I hope Blizzard learned an important lesson here about letting influences in before people who will actually test.
---
Can you make a video about this? Showing the specs and game play
---
Around 30% of any big group of people are hopeless fucking retards. On the internet those people are loud as fuck.

Twitch bought Curse (yes that twitch), which is also owned under the Amazon umbrella so if you have a prime account you also get the equivalent of a curse paid account.

Either way there's still a repo and a desktop app, if you want it, to manage it all. You can either download and copy files manually like before or you can use the desktop app to manage it.

I hope you realized that you don't "deserve" anything. Nothing was promised with this invite. All you had promised is access to the login server, nothing further. And I don't really know why did you expect anything more from a stress test, that was for testing the robustness of the servers. It's your fault for hyping yourself up for a stress test.
---
I don‚Äôt enjoy many streams, but his are constantly hilarious. People that are serious about things need not watch or they‚Äôre just going to be frustrated and unhappy. 
---
People that understand that 95% of what he does is done so in humor will thoroughly enjoy it.
---
I just want Bagnon and Titan bar
---
&gt; the Classic Wow community should on average skew older (and hopefully more mature?) than most gaming communities
---
The Eve online community would like a word. 
---
at the end of the day everyone is a child just pretending they aren't
---
Also, there are VODs that developers can just check and re-check literally how many times they want if someone pointed out a bug, while that'd be much harder to do if the bug report is just a random player's ticket.
---
Might see you around then! :)
---
You do realize there's a massive difference between a stress test and a demo, right?
---
My dude, you WANT this shit to be broken now so it's fixed in three months.
---
god bless eu and our freedom from streamers
---
Of course you will. But we're talking about very few people on a server X) 
---
I doubt more than 40-50 people out of millions, and it'll be realm specific. If you're legitimately upset about that.. well..
---
Why don't you have an audience you can directly affect the opinions off, who are entertained by what you do and whom you spark an interest in classic for? 
---
If the answer is that you can't, then just accept that maybe 40-50 people on your server has a priority. It's not a significant amount to affect your logging time.. blame the other 8 million :P
---
Welp, I'd say because hes known for going big dick, an incredible neckbeard IG and IRL. Also he is very articulate and generally provides good conversations. When hes autistic is like watching a comedy TV show.
---
Because people like me exist?  lol I guess you got triggered because someone disagreed with you on the internet?
---
The money is removed from the economy, yes.  But the economy of WoW isn't fixed.  When you start a new sever there is 0 gold and 0 items on the AH.  Each gold in circulation HAS to come from mob loot, quest rewards, or selling items to vendors.  Every single one of your million gold had to be created in those ways.  Removing that million gold from circulation doesn't mean much, since all of that is constantly being earned back by other players doing those exact same things.  The price of things on the AH is largely driven by how easy it is to make gold organically than how much gold is actively in circulation.
---
In real life we have mints that make money.  If we start with 0 dollars in the world and the mints make 1 million dollars so now we have 1 million total dollars.  Then you take half of that away and never use it, then the value of the rest of that half million dollars almost doubles.
---
In WoW we start with 0 gold, but there is no mint.  Players create gold simply by playing the game.  Every single gold has to be created through player action by killing/looting mobs, quest rewards, or selling items to vendors.  There is a constant supply of gold into the economy.  One day there will be a million, then a million and change the next, and so on.  If you take half that million away, it doesn't disappear and double the value like in the other example.  Money continuously trickles into the economy through organic player action.  That's why it's so difficult for a single person to severely disrupt the economy on a server and that's why items are similar prices across pretty much every server.  It's based more on the rate of gold generation through organic interaction than it is the amount of gold total in and out of circulation.

You're pretty awful at reading.
---
Well if you can't play classic but there are people who can and are showing themselves playing it, it's kind of the only way to get content. I haven't tuned in to a single stream but don't worry, this happens to *every* new game when a beta is out. It'll die down and the sub will return to talking about the game once we actually have the game.
---
Report this... to a blizzard employee? Like the one standing next to him on the boat?
---
Apex is consistently top 20 and makes shitload of money
---
"LFG/LFR addons -will- take away from the community aspect of the Classic experience, which is one of the reasons people like myself and thousands of others actively campaigned for Classic. You go back to the old threads about the joys of Nost and why Blizzard should release Classic, community is a massive reason why."
---
Can you tell be ONE social mechanic that an addon removes for you?
---
The problem with retail;
---
- You get TELEPORTED to the instance (won't happen in Classic)
---
- The dungeons are much, much easier so you don't have to talk to team mates (won't happen in Classic)
---
- Retail is cross server, so you have a low chance of meeting them players again (won't happen in Classic)
---
Make Classic Vanilla Again
---
Impossible, demon hunters didn't exist in vanilla.

Hard to discuss the game when it isn't out yet.

I've tested multiple graphic levels and it's runs incredibly well from the lowest to the highest.  It's significantly less demanding than BfA is and since the zones are less detailed, it really creates a smooth experience.

I just hate gnomes
---
Well, the case is old, but the specs aren't as old, so it's running like 50 ish fps, without much issue
---
as a gnome, screw you thats our advantage
---
this didn't happen 19 hours ago, this happened 4.5 hours ago
---
yes everyone says that that should theoretically be the case but I was looking for some numbers from someone who was in the beta
---
Two times worse or *half as good*? Turn that frown upside down!
---
Yeah idk i kinda agree with this. Obviously streamers help market the game but it gets a little meh when they constantly get royal treatment to have fun getting killed by Cthun in elwynn and we're left waiting.
---
I stayed up until around 2:00am UK time trying to log on.
---
I fully expected that I wouldn't be able to, and I'm not salty. I probably would've been up until then anyway because it's my "weekend" (I don't work Thursdays or Fridays). So whatever Blizzard wanted out of this stress test, hopefully I did my part.
---
Went on for a bit this morning and it was fine, the stressy part of the stress test is over. Maybe it'll change when the Americans wake up though, haha.
---
nice that's good news. mind sharing your specs?
---
Viability yes, but much of BC was spent simply bringing the "developer-intended" builds up to par, such as Elemental Shaman, Enhancement Shaman, Balance Druid, Feral Druid, Protection Paladin, Retribution Paladin, Shadow Priest, etc. These specs were all in Vanilla anyway, so BC didn't add much.
---
When I talk about "build tinkering", I'm referring to creating things outside of the "box" of the 3 intended talent trees.
---
&gt; Not that much to work with in terms of builds? 
---
I said "not that much *more* to work with in BC than Vanilla".
---
From what I understand, once we get into the game proper, it‚Äôll be like being placed into a hidden server as your character enters the world. If the hidden servers get full, they just spin up another layer. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll really notice it unless you frequently jump between groups with friends in.
---
there are funny and epic moments occasionally on the stream, and the other times when he's being childish or forcing his reactions too far, I just stop paying attention for a bit.
---
he's not perfect, but you can't say that nothing about his content is entertaining.
---
Complaining about complaining, that always works.

**[EU - Alliance]**
---
Im known as Mazie, my journey in started on a Nelf Priest, which cleared MC. Then I went to a newly started realm Khadgar, where I played mage in the guild that got every server first from MC to Naxx apart from 1 ZG boss. Meanwhile playing my mage I discovered my one true love, my gnome warrior alt, so when TBC hit, I rerolled Prot Warrior and became the main tank in a new guild. This guild proceeded to take every first boss in TBC that was released untill I left the server for a more competitive one. I went to Silvermoon where I joined Silence (during SSC progress), and was with them untill Illidan. Time restraints made me decide to go a bit more casual and play DPS warrior untill the end of TBC.
---
And I've got the week of the release off work, so hopefully I can get a good start :)
---
Like I pointed out, I'm looking for a casual or semi-hardcore raiding guild, so probably 2-3 raiding days. I am looking for a mature guild who just wants to enjoy the game and progress efficiently, so not alot of drama
---
He played classic, started after the gate opening, and was bad (freely admitted by himself.) I think he went to like mc or bwl during classic.
---
Heavily moderated to cut out all the edgy /pol/ shit, I hope. I got real tired of the constant redpill talk on pserv Barrens.
---
Until one day, the fire nation attacked
---
See my other responses here, I have been playing LoL for far too much. I still dont consider "Yi you are fucking trash uninstall" more toxic than the general attitude of the WoW community. 
---
Just go on the League subreddit and compare it to the shit attitude here on this forum.
---
there's a classic graphics option, but it doesn't change models
---
To be fair it was actually a really fun idea.  I feel like they dont bend to his beck and call; if this was a bad idea they wouldn't have done it. It just so happened he had a fun idea that they actually liked.
---
Agreed, Darnassus is probably the most disappointing. The idea of a city being build in the branches of a giant tree is so cool, but you never really feel it as a player. The city feels small and the layout is boring. It's really too bad because the elven assets are gorgeous, the ancient greek'ish columns and white stone architecture have so much potential but is poorly utilized. 
---
With that said, the bear tree bank is 10/10.
---
Wrong place to post it buddy, People seem to have a boner for Streamers around here.
---
They pay the same amount of money that we do so they should be treated the same way, but that won't happen.
---
I got to see fuck all because I was asleep...
---
Oh so it's gatekeeping if you don't want people see around with 3 toons to make shit easier for themselves which affects other players aswell? Makes sense. Totally not comparable to gatekeeping.
---
This right here is the classic MMO elitist player.
---
So many people acting like if it isn't something that matches their thoughts and opinions, it must be the wrong way of doing things.
---
Nevermind the fact that Blizzard has created a videogame empire and done Billions upon Billions in revenue, whole this guy is probably still struggling through English class
---
Still a better descent into madness than Daenerys Targaryen.
---
No shit. All people do is bitch about everything they can.
---
It wasn‚Äôt a large portion (or really any portion that I know of) of his stream/gaming activity until Legion. When he‚Äôs known for being one of the top Diablo 3 players (mainly monk), his minor background in WoW is overlooked.
---
I‚Äôm glad you said that because I agree. But, to me, that‚Äôs one of the problems that I have with asmongold. Every now and then he says something like ‚ÄúI know I sound like I‚Äôm mad....‚Äù or ‚ÄúI know I‚Äôm being a jerk but...‚Äù then he‚Äôll say something nice about his fans or the people he is playing with. 
---
There was a period where he took a break for a while. When he can back he gave a very heartfelt honest description of a brush with his own mortality, his humble life and the enjoyment he gets from streaming. Honestly made me like him a bit.
---
But he continues to be a jerk to his fans and people he is playing with. even after that break and his brush with mortality, he is still really abusive to people on a pretty regular basis.
---
I‚Äôd consider his flip flopping from asshole to a nice guy as more manipulative than redeeming. Plus he absolutely can not tolerate any reciprocation of his abuse. That‚Äôs so annoying.
---
You probably haven't seen r/Freefolk yet :p
---
This isn't going to happen when the game goes live. People will be busy actually playing. It's only like this right now because it's a beta/stress test and none of the work put into any characters actually matter.
---
Holy shit, I loved this place. Cata ruined so many great places. Wow officially changed for me when cata came out. I actually get to experience this game, the old music in Ashenvale, the old models, no dungeon browser, the old skills from an official blizzlike server. Yessss
---
beating a dead horse
---
nobody cares about your opinion
---
just stop
---
Yep. We know they do this since they just used a asmongold video in a blue post.
---
How sad. It‚Äôs a fucking game.
---
Jeeze, cry more.  Just play the game how you like it and stop worrying about other people.  The economy isn't going to be destroyed because a handful of people get gifted a million gold.
---
Building credit is great. It's not common knowledge to know every other country's credit interest rates. Also, what's with the stab at calling America an uncivilized country? This is a video game forum.
---
Did he use a different name for those speedruns? Because I just checked and don‚Äòt see him on the leaderboards.
---
For those of you that didn‚Äôt play back than. It was almost always referred to as VC. I didn‚Äôt even know about Dire Maul that early lol but yes on my server everyone called it VC. I distinctly remember it.
---
Sort by best and scroll to the bottom for the best experience.
---
Trust me, playing too much BfA makes feel you many things, just not happiness.
---
What‚Äôdya want? A cookie? Fuck off. You weren‚Äôt even born when the Romans fell in 476  AD.
---
Yeah, we got a great OP lecturing others when he doesn't know that layering will be gone before phase 2. What a retard.
---
1. There is no "main" quest to follow during your leveling, there are multiple zones for each level so you can chose where you want to quest. The best would be to not stick to one zone for a ranch of level but to explore the world, switch continent and see what kind of atmosphere you prefer (dense wood, desert, grassland, mountain,..)
---
2. Macros are not mandatory but are of great help if you want to maximize your reaction speed in combat as well as other minor life-comfort mechanic. You can do basic stuff with it as well as very more complicated stuff, you should look for guide online, there are plenty.
---
3. Gold management is a required skill in classic, having a gathering profession will help you a lot, with skinning you can sell the hide to vendor for some extra silver while with herbalism and mining you can get some valuable herb/ore that can sell for good price at auction house (up to more than 20 gold for some stack of 20 plant). Don't be afraid to use the auction house, if you're not sure about the price of a green you dropped you can check if it's already on sale and use the same price otherwise just look for same lvl range item with same stats. You will soon recognize which type of gear are worth auctioning and which are just good to sell to vendor. Gear with +shadow/fire/frost spell power and +healing power are generally worth some gold as well as item having both stamina and agi/intel/strength. There is a difference between grey item and white item, when it's white it means that it has a use may it be for a quest, to cast a spell or a profession. Some white item can be worthy to sell at the auction house like Light Feather that can be dropped on nearly all feathery npc and used by mage and priest to cast Slow Fall and Levitate.
---
The beta uses the old models.
---
Personally, I'd be fine with using new models, although it would take away from the nostalgia.
---
Probably just another person who is trained to hate guns and freedom.
---
Me. Stress test only. I used gold-bought time to re-sub last Friday.
---
Yeah, his persona of how he's the best WoW player out there is hilarious.  Maybe it's just not everyone's cup of tea.
---
Why is ragnaros in elwynn?
---
Curse client is now the Twitch one, and it functions exactly the same way as it used to with curse :)
---
I don't doubt for a moment that literally thousands of people get away with it. I'm positive it will and did happen in fact. 
---
I don't want to go in to too much detail, because I'm truly not sure how much information has been publicly shared, but even back then on our frankly awful tools we were able to track down far more unreported people than people think.
---
You could actually do more with vanilla addons,  ex: Healbot you could add parameters for each spell, what rank to use at what % health, who was a tank/dps/heal and when should they be healed and bind it to 1 button and heal using just that 1 button.
---
Lmao human race playera
---
Jealous that they got in and they didn't. It's as simple as that. And the scarab lord title didn't come into the game until tbc IIRC. They wouldn't get the mount anyway. People just like to bitch.
---
That‚Äôs fantastic.
---
The overall responsiveness is even better than in vanilla. Everything runs so smooth.
---
Seriously idk why you have to be just LIKE the HUNDREDS OF OTHER PEOPLE MAKING POSTS ABOUT THIS SHIT 
---
REEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I like how I accidentally clicked on one of his videos by mistake, thought he was a douche bag after about 3 minutes of watching a 45 minutes video, and never clicked another video again.  
---
YouTube has been trying to make me watch 'Asmongold reacts to x' videos religiously for the last 8 months.
---
People are just mad streamers have beta and they don't. I wouldn't put much thought into it.
---
I absolutely LOVE Desolace, whenever I think back to my original vanilla experience Desolace is the first zone to pop up in my mind.
---
&gt;Where did blizzard explicitly state they wanted us in starting zones? Prior to the stress test they said they were excited to see what we got up to.  
---
&gt;They also made no comments on server broadcasts on beta or the stress test to not or to stop the race.  
---
&gt;Calling bullshit.
---
here ya go, chief.  
---
&gt; ‚Äîwe want to push our tech to the limit, and that means a critical mass of players in close proximity.

---
Wait, so just to clarify this... EVERYONE gets access to Classic Beta Stress Test?
---
What is your source that the spawning of Hogger and Rag etc was to keep people in the starting area? If I recall correctly the server message said that the testing was over, the server would be restarted and they would have some fun 'Hogger event'. 
---
Blizzard did their testing with layers, people logging in all together etc. When this was done they had some fun for the people that participated. I don't think I've seen any Blizzard employee state that what the streamers did went against what they wanted the testers to do. 
---
No need to be so hurt that you didn't get to log in smoothly like you would in retail. Also the posts that claim that the streamers got preferential log in queu's make me giggle.
---
12 FPS right in the feels
---
Don't forget to spell Aragorn wrong too, or it won't be that authentic classic experience.
---
/r/gatekeeping/
---
My guess he is so happy is because he was tweeting at wowdevs to spawn Rag and they actually did.
---
Inb4 a blue post comes in telling you your wrong with data and logic that know one here accounted for.
---
I would add visuals in dungeons/raids
---
There is sooo much shit going on with each class I cant even see what Im fighting.
---
I'm not in the beta so can't test it but I bet it's the same as the Poweraura one that were backported into the vanilla private servers, it's a very basic CD/proc tracking like TellMeWhen, it's not the fancy Weakauras that we have for BfA for example
---
Planning to stream myself once I get into the Beta (new, starting from 0).
---
I don't get it too. I understand that some streamers are hated because they also quite arrogant from my personal view, but overall Twitch Streaming should be the best thing WoW Classic could have happened. The attention is totally at WoW now and everyone is FOMO to get Beta Keys. 
---
Long-term the Twitch Streaming is not really helping if Blizzard doesn't bring new Classic Content. That would be crucial to have a lot of players still play after 1 year. I don't expect that but I see WoW Classic dying in latest 24 months from now for 90% of the players.
---
You think AQ event is in phase 1 of the game?
---
How would everyone feel if a streamers guild was able to get logged in first on a rough patch day and they got to start the raid 1 HR early? Doesn't sound fair to me.
---
I mean, as much as I hate twitch chat sometimes, let's not act like the channels in vanilla wow were good. Chuck Norris, tf jokes, dirge jokes and barrens chat. The same shit man.
---
Yup. I will already have my names ready by the time classic goes live. I will probably wait until the weekend to log in for the first time.
---
Yea, that's what I had in mind. 
---
To me, I thought that blue post would be enough to make people stop complaining at least for a bit. But I think whining is something just too enjoyable and uplifting for them to just quit like that.
---
was the stress test server a PVE server ? if so this is right i think
---
I never actually maxed out fishing in Vanilla. Is the skill something worth leveling?
---
You make good points, I think the general hate comes from the perception of streamers being given everything for free, free carries, gear, and progression because their e-fame.
---
Annoying and petty
---
So did you show her your penis?
---
Mage_Girl isn't the brightest of individuals. Her post history reads as that of either a troll or a troglodyte. Bit lamentable, really.
---
I didn‚Äôt get in until this morning haha
---
Did you say Thunderfury?
---
It's a stress test you inbred monkey
---
Asmond, Mconnel, and Esfand are all cool AF. Most of you haters are just jealous imo. That being said I'll admit I think streamer prio is real, but it doesn't bother me at all because instead of sitting there logging in for 3 hours i was at least able to watch someone get in.
---
Way off base with ESO.  The faction disparity was because people had enough info from beta that we started a viral campaign to join Dominion.  I know this wasn't streamer driven because I was a part of it and am not a streamer nor do I watch streamers.
---
The lag also had nothing to do with streamers.  The base issue was particle effects and number of people fighting in an area.  It was further abused by certain group strategies.  If streamers had any idea of how it was abused then you would have a lot more info, it wasn't just people following a streamer around.
---
There's definitely a lot of bullshit with streamers, but you've gone full conspiracy mode on those ESO comments.
---
How old though iirc her voice actor has changed three or four times since vanilla. I liked the wrath era voice personally.
---
i agree that it will be less organic, but i dont understand how you think that giving away items to a streamer is going to 'crash the server economy'. this is really fucking stupid and a ridiculous stretch. obviously streamers will have an easier time on servers with people gifting them money, people following them around helping them kill stuff, etc (even though a lot of streamers including Asmongold said when the game starts they won't accept gifts to make the experience more authentic for themselves &amp; viewers) but i dont understand how this is going to effect anyone but the people in a small range around where the streamer happens to be.
---
Yes I tried, no luck.
---
&gt;The attention is totally at WoW now and everyone is FOMO to get Beta Keys.
---
Yeah exactly!! They create communities that follow them into the game, they create a ton of publicity and will make classic into much more than just 100k private server nerds and a few retail players who just try it for the hell of it.
---
I forgot about that. I was 14 at the time one of the best memories of my life no MMO has given me that feeling since.
---
I watch him pretty frequently but never noticed he hated on the game in a serious way I mean he is pretty autistic and sometimes the jokes can be taken as serious but then again even if he hated it people will have their opinions and that's fine.
---
The only thing that matters right now is we will have classic and I want BC even more since I was never invested into classic as I was into BC, but damn I'm fucking hyped now for the game!
---
What if an event happens on a different server entitely? Do you still miss that event?
---
I am out of loop. Is lvling your proffessions hard in vanilla or it‚Äôs not useful?
---
I know, I started the first book in elementary school before the show or WoW. But people did not reference it in classic. 
---
How can I put this? Back in 2005, xxLegolasxx was referencing the recent movies, not the books. In the same way, the cultural impact of game of thrones is coming from the show, which ended this week, and not the books, for whom nothing has happened since 2011~.
---
People take him seriously and dont realize hes joking.
---
Good find. Now we just need to shrink them and keep shrinking them until those little devils stop existing completely
---
I remember the first time I played on a pserver since I started in Late Vanilla (then quit since no money to pay for sub) like 5 months ago. The music absolutely brought feels..
---
That said, holy shit the graphical upgrade they did to Classic is unbelievable. I was in the ‚Äúremaster/new models‚Äù camp for a while but..we dont need it. Not with how they updated what everything looks like
---
Could just be connected realm. Would make sense to test this functionality too.
---
epic!
---
This a true happiness face. Thanks, Asmongold. Thanks, Omar. Thanks, Blizzard. 
---
You think you want.
---
We now have over 450 members and are halfway to purchasing a guild tabard design! Server first!!!
---
Yeah really, does anyone remember cartographer? Like that was functionality they would never allow now.
---
I would guess a druid is optimal, u can throw HOTs up and then tab and melee with the rogue. You can stealth past stuff, he can also tank.
---
O
---
The real question is : will we get elvui ?
---
ElvUi will be avaible, there is no need for pfui.
---
It‚Äôs a meme, settle down. I‚Äôm in the beta, don‚Äôt care about the stress
---
Thats common on twitch, and its really annoying.  It brings down the mood of chat.
---
&gt;  It can transform the hardest most complex fights into complete facerolls.
---
And none of them exist in Vanilla.
---
The most "gamebreaking" stuff it can do is only utilized in mythic raids, which are, in fact usually the most complex fights and it does not turn them into facerolls. Method has members who come up with amazing and complex weak auras during mythic progress and do you see them kill the boss the try after? No. Mythic Uu'nat still took 730 wipes and they are currently the (second) best guild with some of the best players.
---
Most players don't even touch mythic raiding, so they don't even use those "gamebreaking" weak auras. As I said, the majority of players, if they use WA that is, only use it to track their CDs and/or procs.
---
What are you even saying lol. The changes to the gnome cause of FOV would also impact the dwarf his height.
---
You can clearly see the difference whereas the gnome just about reaches the tip of the beard in the left screenshots and on the right ones his heas gets like halfway the beard.
---
Good, you're out of arguments so I consider this discussion closed.
---
I‚Äôm just more upset I wasted an hour trying to log in. I don‚Äôt have much time to play as it is and had to convince my wife watch the baby to let me play. After an hour of dc‚Äôs I gave up. I didn‚Äôt even want to participate in the AQ race, just experience the old lvl 5 starting zones of a Human or Tauren.
---
Would have liked to have stress tested something. But after 2 hours of constant Queueing and DCing..never did get in.
---
STREAMER BAD
---
Right?? Like at first glance it looks like a low effort paint meme.. but then you look closely and its actually tremendously highly detailed.. is crazy
---
It‚Äôs 2007scape all over again.  
---
Tons of people with different opinions in releasing a previous version of a game, spiced up with beta invites and streamer drama.
---
Kinda, now it's twitch. We can download more than 1 at the same time without buying a premium and shits. It does it job.
---
Yeah don't report this because it's working as intended. At "level cap" you don't get xp, you get gold. You just happen to be at the stress test server level cap (5).
---
During the beta/stress test Im all for streamers getting in. Thats thousands of more people to look for bugs by watching the streams. It also creates hype which we need for Classic to succeed. However when it comes to the actual game I dont want chat filled with 'POG POG POG' shit. Its to early to tell how they will affect the *actual* gameplay but for testing purposes I see no problem with streamers getting in.
---
&gt;being given everything for free, free carries, gear, and progression because their e-fame.
---
Well, same is done for any person who can get upwards of 100k followers in anything from religion, politics, sports and acting to music.
---
Please don't come to eu servers.
---
Get a threat meter instead pls.
---
Same :(
---
Yikes, this comment didn't age well.
---
My biggest worry is that the big streamers will have a lot of followers causing huge faction imbalance on pvp servers.
---
It does to US feminists.
---
I'm not complaining about barrens chat. That doesn't impact how the game is played. Chat spam happens in every game no matter what. Who cares?
---
I'm talking about having a "celebrity" on your realm that has a large following outside of the server and game. This brings more people to the server. This attracts people to play with that streamer. And this following will impact *gameplay*
---
Those interactions will then influence the gameplay in multiple ways, not just chat being spammed. 
---
The examples i already provided were potential impacts on the economy, mat availability and price, price fixing or inflation, rare items and gifts being given away to the streamer or by the streamer, raid runs and pvp events hosted by the streamer, large groups of players following the streamer (both factions). 
---
These gameplay changes wouldn't occur if we didn't have "internet celebrities" publicly broadcasting themselves to 100s of thousands of players.
---
Some baby just crying about asmon , nothing to see here
---
Yet, still summer.
---
What is wrong with wanting classic to be as authentic as possible?
---
If it was real it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me. It is a closed beta so having only a handful of people joining and some streamer in order to pull up the hype would be logic. I would stop checking my mail and go back to a productive work to wait for August 27th.
---
Gps/waypoint arrows were in Vanilla tho?
---
Hey now, I can't say your arguments aren't wrong. They're totally valid.   
---
I guess I'll admit to being totally against the LFR/LFD system, and even a 3rd party addon is something I'm not comfortable with.   
---
I think part my issue here is knowing Blizzard, they'll see the popularity (potentially) of the addon and move to implement a full system for it, much like on live.   
---
Another issue with this addon and the existing system, is that it removes the necessity to interact with others or have a guild. Why bother joining one, and doing these things, when an existing function takes care of it for you. 
---
The AddOn/function is not so much the problem, rather the long term impact on an existing system we had that didn't require it. I don't want to argue the 'slippery slope' fallacy, but it does have a whiff of it.   
---
First of all it starts with this, and then things like Achievements become harmless, and Transmogs etc.
---
It was probably 1 month of attempts after clearing MC.
---
I‚Äôm no expert but I have been playing since Vanilla. There are people on this sub who have never played vanilla before and might feel pressure to play certain specs. I just hope people make sure to have fun on the game. I don‚Äôt think being new to something makes someone ‚Äúdogshit,‚Äù though.
---
which I think is a good thing. I just hate that Blizzard is a bit in a bad situation to hold these peoples. I mean we are stucked after AQ40 or? 
---
Blizzard could make a tone of money with Classic now, but they would not reinvest it into more content I guess.
---
Really hope Blizzard builds someday another MMORPG maybe .. don't know but I would love to get Classic from Start without knowing what is coming for the next 2 years in terms of content‚â•
---
Imagine complaining about other people complaining.
---
^an observation, not a complaint.
---
boo hoo.
---
Warlocks, because of their ability to summon. Mages because of conjure food/water &amp; portals. Those are the first two that come to mind for me. Both are just plain fun to play too, imo.
---
"i don't like something, so i can't understand, and get angry and defensive when other people like that thing", the post.
---
holy fuck just let people enjoy things. nobody hurt you and nobody wants to hurt you.
---
Nah... nowy tendz
---
There was nothing to argue.

He's been carrying the whole WoW section since I've started watching him back in 2016 when he was luckily getting 5k viewers. He's been voicing the opinions of the huge amount of playerbase, he has a fun personality (altough sometimes annoying). He's managed to make retail WoW actually fun to watch, until he became a reaction streamer (just type on YouTube Asmongold reacts to and you'll see), thanks to mount and transmog competitions. I know he still does them, but not that often these days (he also wasn't doing them that much before Classic beta already so it's not about Classic). He has also a specific sense of humour that just doesn't seem fun to everyone. One thing I really don't like about him is that he thinks he can't do wrong, in raid leading, how he plays his class. But he's been like that since his early YouTube videos.
---
I'd say his stream is one of the fastest growing streams on Twitch. I mean like a year ago he didn't have even half of the viewers he has now.
---
I 100% agree. Well said. I just think people should do their best to figure out what they want out of the game before investing a LOT of time into a character. If you enjoyed the video, I hope you subscribe!
---
Lol you‚Äôre a fag dude. Get laid pls
---
Streamer clips are way better content then:
---
r/classic: here is a vague comment from a nost database showing why the offical code is wrong
---
Its extreme likely that private servers mobs would do too much damage because if you posted on any private server forum that this mob does too much damage with valid proof, the only response you'd get is: "get gut scrub"
---
\#metoo ... or too soon?
---
Well i play holy priest in classic. Way more effort needed than with the damage classes. Same goes for warrior tank at least.
---
Healing classes are always required. People always need healers. So Priest, Druid, Shaman, Paladin. 
---
Tanks as well, but with tanks the guild may have a core group of tanks when they raid. 
---
It‚Äôs cliche, but just play what you want. As long as people like you - you‚Äôll be accepted in groups.
---
I hate sodapoppin, he acts like a jerk and he doesnt like the game, he's paid to play it. Just watch his stream, he despise Vanilla.
---
On the other hand, I really enjoy Asmon Payo and other streamers content :)
---
Classic wow is back ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Shit everyone's just going to spam whole lines of stupid emojis? &gt;_&lt;
---
Hopefully they wouldn't update the classic servers to TBC for example, but make a new TBC server that you can transfer a Classic level 60 (maybe 58-60) to for free.
---
Humar right? I remember my cousins playing 24/7 on Arthas to try and get him.
---
Uh oh - people are acting unreasonably on the Internet. Better post a paragraph whining about it and threatening not to play. You guys better shape up or I‚Äôm not going to play, I‚Äôm serious! Goddamn this community of people acting stereotypically like humans on an Internet gaming forum.
---
&gt; created a dwarf rogue [...] and much time is spent eating and drinking.
---
I mean, it was your decision to play a dwarf.
---
The thing with mages is i feel like everyone are going to play them, but yeah they look really fun from what i have seen.
---
Duskwood and plaguelands underated. Westfall is over rated
---
I don't think it is, you can setup your raidframes to show curses/magic/disease/poison with many addons tough.
---
He was a smaller streamer back in WoD(first time I saw stream WoW) definetly, but he has several gladiator titles in WoW and several #1 parses, so "minor background" certaintly isn't minor.
---
People who complain about streamers being a cancer to Classic wow don't realise that to the general population, they're as much as a cancer too.
---
This crazy tinfoil, elitist, toxicity that happens in this subreddit is hilarious. You are just as bad as the people you claim are the worst. The only difference between you and the streamers is that you don't bring thousands of viewers and don't make blizz any Good, so aren't as important.
---
It's not a "stress test" when the servers crumple immediately. It's like telling a parade of elephants to cross your rope bridge. You gota build a bridge that stands a chance before you test it.
---
Hyjal is extremely underrated.
---
Okay, I can see that happening with bad planning. 
---
If you are a streamer aiming to do PvP would you not try to avoid this as probably few people wants to watch you in a BG queue for 50 minutes at a time or complete lack of challenge (huge zergs) in world PvP?
---
and I have to say it.. some are just arrogant. (at least for me personally)...
---
There is a big difference between Esfand and e.g. Asmon..
---
Still both are fine and have their communities liking them. I am more the Esfand guy ... a dude who likes to play and who is down to earth.

I wanna agree with this, but that's not how it worked in classic.
---
Probably intentionally forgot. It's a brief and tiny bit of fun they can get away with once or twice.
---
Maybe I misspoke. 
---
As a gnome you have a smaller range for melee attacks than the larger races. My fear is that if the gnome gets smaller then you will need to be even closer to your target to hit it.

---
thats pretty cool!
---
Yeah i thought about healing. Priests looks good because shadow seems okay to lvl with and shadow seems viable in pvp if im not mistaken so that would be nice to be able to do some pvp as dps as a mix up.
---
There's no spillover into any other reputations, just updates the darnassus one by the amount given. At least in starting quests, don't know in later quests.
---
I never said "crash" the economy. I simply said impact.
---
They're.
---
Fixed thay for you, dumb dumb
---
Cata release was great in comparison to vanilla and tbc.
---
Classic is a very specific kind a game. A game that's rewarding and fun to play - much more fun to play than watch. 
---
High level PvP will have an audience for sure. A group of friends gaming (like Kaif with Slave Raiders) will do great too. 
---
Everyone else... Nah. Might be cool as background while playing, but I can't see myself watching it rather than playing myself. ^^
---
It depends on a lot of things; spec, level, gear, engineering and so on. As a warlock I generally don't fear rogues in the first half of the game. I can easily outlast the stun lock. For mages it's usually a bigger problem because they don't have much HP. They can't blink out of stun either, only roots. Neither the mages' nor the warlocks' pvp trinkets remove stun so it's kinda tricky getting away. A properly and specced rogue can unleash a lot of damage within the stunlock so you probably have to use consumables or engineering to get away. 
---
You also have to consider which pet you have out, are you demo lock? Ice barrier? And so on. If both are in their optimal spec and gear then it's fairly even. FAPs and LAPs make the stunlock useless. LIP can also be used. The rocket helmet can stun him for 30 seconds and then you can unload a big and unpleasant soulfire/pyroblast in his face.
---
Still better than MMO Champ. They've been ripping each other's throats out for years.
---
Tank or healer.
---
how about the posts about the cry babys....
---
You didn't waste it, you failed to log in which effectively contributed to the stress test on the servers.
---
I'm kind of with them on this one. I don't really care about streamers at all but this subreddit's obsession with hating them is a bit cringey.
---
I can think of no better use of your time

---
yup, thats the whole point of all of this
---
Considering the amount of hateposts about him and other streamers I see around, I'd say you should be a little more positive about life in general.
---
Whether youre aware of it or not, you absolutely participated in the test.
---
The problem is, people are thinking the purpose of this was to test leveling to 5...and not test stress on the server.
---
You play with people you never see again. And teleport to the instance 
---
It removes all rp elements and immersion
---
It also enforces this mentality of kicking or quitting. Since it took you no time at all.
---
One thing was for sure, if you were alliance and ran sfk or Sm you stayed and kept your team
---
Your actually retarded and I hope your on US servers so I don't have to deal with you in any capacity when the game launches because no matter how much you bitch and cry deep down you know you'll go crawling back to them come aug 27th so your better off finding something better to do rather than demonize a company you support and make yourself look like a moron to everyone on here.
---
this is my only real issue with streamers, so i'm just gonna do my best to avoid a server with any major ones.
---
It was an interesting ride for sure
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more. I find it stupid to call all streamers toxic, but I also find it stupid to not recognize the effect a streamer might have on a server. It‚Äôs a different world, streaming wasn‚Äôt a thing in vanilla so I see some truth behind the fear that some have.
---
Maybe this is a white hot take, but I was a little bummed about the server stress test. Maybe the purpose wasn‚Äôt conveyed well or I just didn‚Äôt understand, but I had expected that people would be able to get in and actually play in the world. I thought the stress test part was going to deal more with how do the servers handle thousands of new people playing in the starting zones, not how does the login server handle a bunch of people logging in with little chance to play in the world. That being said, it‚Äôs nice that they left it up for the next day so we could play around before we lost access. All in all, I wish they had just been a little more clear about expectations from the stress test. If they wanted us to spam the login server, that‚Äôs fine, but I, and I think others, had hoped we would actually be in the world stress testing the starting zones with lots of players.
---
&gt; Tanks require far more dedication than any other role in a guild. If you can't make every single raid and event, don't be a tank IMO.
---
You mean tanking takes more dedication because you are so needed?
---
Official Blizz statement from like 2017 said something around the lines of "we'll keep Vanilla servers online 10 years from now even if only 3000 people are still playing this game by then". That heavily indicates a solution that adds future expansions to the "list" of Classic servers instead of replacing the old ones.
---
People sure want that instant gratification.
---
Stay strong. If you click one even once they'll be recommended for eternity.
---
Locks get shut down hard by ud rogues
---
\&gt; They are a huge net positive to the game: 
---
They're not.  The only positive effect they MIGHT have is to get new people to the game, but most of those people will join their servers, which I will avoid like the fucking plague.
---
\&gt;   They create a community around them. 
---
A cancerous troll community filled with adolescent retards.  I'd rather be in the prison community.  Not the American prison though.
---
\&gt;   They make inherently boring things fun and engaging. Like running for 40 minutes by foot, lol. 
---
For the viewers, this one doesn't make sense.  
---
\&gt;  aka people trying to gank them on a PvP server fishing for a reaction, big scale fights, community raids and more. 
---
They will constantly be surrounded by drones....  You can't gank them.  Even if you could, you would probably be mass spammed with juvenile racist homophobic comments, and then mass reported.   What great "content".  
---
\&gt;  I don't actually know exactly how to obtain the scarab lord title 
---
Really, lol?   Why are you even here?
---
That said, they have every right to play the game, but anyone with any sense will try to avoid them like the plague.
---
This is an incredible screenshot.
---
Theres so much to see in this image.
---
Scarab lord is from unlocking the gates of aq. 100% in vanilla.
---
That's wicked
---
I love misinformed people ranting lol
---
lol you can get 120 an hour from DME as Mage. Various non-instanced locations can get 60-70 an hour if you don't have too much mob competition.
---
100g a week for PvP respecs is mildly painful, but it's more than doable. And the game doesn't really have a lot of other gold sinks anyway, besides the big ticket consumables and a single epic mount.
---
The meta should be:
---
1) Get to level 5, congratulations you're max level
---
2) Because of 1, quests now grant gold in lieu of xp
---
3) Go to the starting areas, do the starting zones, gear up from vendors (really decent armor from vendors is available). Do higher level quests in guild groups for greens
---
4) World PvP it up!!!
---
Also, the 40,000 people watching the stream can catch bugs... Win/win.  I don't have a retail sub, so no chance of getting a beta invite myself but I'm content to watch the occasional steamer while I play other shit.  I didn't even use twitch before the classic announcement...
---
You think you don't but you do. Watch their actions ladies and gentlemen. Actions tell the truth.
---
Part of gaining reputation (good or bad) is lost when you just have an automatic group join. I pretty much just tanked in vanilla (autocorrect tried to say ‚Äòyanked in vanilla‚Äô, which about made me die laughing in cube city), so I can only really speak from that experience. But here goes.
---
People that wanted to form groups for a dungeon would, of course, either spam chat or peruse the people who were spamming to join a group. At first, they‚Äôd just have to find some randoms to fill the roles, no one knew anyone. But after time, you‚Äôd get to know ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs a fair tank. He‚Äôs a good healer.‚Äô And so on. Have a healer and dps already? Let‚Äôs pop open the fiends list, see which of the 4 reliable tanks I know is available, and finding 2 more random dps‚Äôers is easy. Quickly formed group and known reliability in the major roles. 
---
Or for myself as a tank, I‚Äôd pop open the friends list and find some healers I had some good runs with.
---
And once they‚Äôre on your friends list, sometimes you‚Äôd just shoot the shit with them, and new connections are formed. Maybe you find yourself a guild that way. Maybe you‚Äôre each part of a different guild, and now your guilds are friendly too because you often run with groups mixed with each of your guild mates. Who knows what forms from there.
---
It all ties back to communication, reputation and socialization.
---
I think I'm getting your point. I was looking forward to streamer events as it could be catalysts for constant world events to participate in, but the negative effects could be greater in the long run, realm population imbalance being a massive one.  
---
Thanks for taking the time to clarify.
---
What? Twitch chat is a fucking plague.
---
Thank you!
---
Yeah, there are literal subreddits devoted to hating women because "Nice Guy TM" and people really think a bunch of idiots acting like idiots is more toxic than that?
---
It reminds me a lot of "activists" who claim to be fighting the real fight and all I can say is "have you seen some of the third world countries? People literally get raped and murdered there because of their gender, skin color and/or religion..."
---
There are often a lot bigger fires than the candle you're looking at right now. So stop pretending this candle is gonna burn down the whole world when the world is already on fire!
---
Unfortunately 100% NOT shaman.  In 1.12 nightfall can no longer proc on the extra attacks from windfury
---
i'm with you on that. some streamers just seem like jerks but there are a ton who are pretty chill and funny so i just stick to watching them.
---
DME wont be there at launch. And i was talking as a minimum
---
Haha thank you :)
---
Honestly, I don't even want the beta.  Why the fuck would you want to burn yourself out on the beta?  Plus, there's a thing called private servers.
---
No, you tried telling people how "most vets feel".
---
How come you apparently know what the purpose of the test was, and Blizzard didn't? Surely they wouldn't spawn bosses at random if it was meant to simulate a launch. Also, do you not think people are gonna do stupid stuff on launch? Because some people are. Many start leveling, some will just run across the world.
---
Levelling: Honestly to fix it, you would have to remove the current iteration of scaling.
---
We need this server to be 1 per region. It is not much, but will make a lot of players very happy.
---
I was shocked when I found out that they don't want to create this servers from start. Start of classic will make the server shine!
---
You participated in a stress test, not playing beta.
---
Lots of people didnt get in, myself included.
---
You trying to log in, sitting in queue, failing at character creation, was participating in the stress test. Yeah a lot of us didnt get in, but the purpose was not to test contwnt, but the load on the server.
---
People are acting all entitled and butt hurt that they did not get to try the game, when that wasnt the purpose.
---
Keep trying - nobody gives a fuck about your concern trolling or trying to police what memes are politically sanctioned on this sub. People will use whatever memes they find amusing even if they aren‚Äôt approved in whatever leftist shithole you frequent on this site. K? K.
---
less than 1 week is more than enough to significantly destroy the economy in the lotus, leather or ore department, we've seen that plenty so far.
---
Hoard mats to jack up prices so people farm them themselves, ever heard of a mafia? Some casual players will not be able to contest, skill and time wise, the kind of people who run mafias. They are usually top 5% pvpers.
---
If you have no clue wtf you are talking about you should stay quiet.
---
I don't get everyone complaining about the streamers getting access to classic. Like would I rather me having access than one random streamer? Sure, but Soda having access is better for me than some random person having access. Everyone is able to watch streamers play, so it has some benefit to everyone.
---
We're not all toxic. Played on a dozen pservers myself over the years. The toxic ones are just the loudest.
---
From my experience - I remember always looking for healers. DPS slots always filled up
---
I was lucky because I was a warlock so asking for a healer was easier because we could summon them.
---
They were testing the layering. Purposely jumbling it up

holy shit it's a fucking STRESS TEST. you are not logging into a STRESS TEST to get the 'classic feeling', you are logging in to test the server capabilities. you are not logging in to the STRESS TEST to play the game and level your character, you are logging in to help blizzard work on and improve their server architecture for a smoother launch. getting upset over this shit is absolutely childish.

---
Iirc mages can blink out of stuns
---
&gt;Retail is just straight up 5+ ilvl = 5% more stats across the board or something similar
---
And vanilla is by and large the exact same. Retail just uses a more optimal selection on stats on all of their items, while vanilla has experimental/sub-optimal items scattered in. This does not change how the item level stat pool formula works. A higher item level item will always have more total stats on it in vanilla, too. A notorious exception to this are proc effects, but there are also other exceptions (some items have "bonus" stats; these are usually marked green in the tooltip and do not have the usual cost associated with them).
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/index.php?title=Item_level&amp;oldid=929821
---
How it works is documented here. These are reverse-engineered approximations, but they come very close (within a couple of itemlevels) to the actual itemlevel.
---
WHAT YOU SAY TO ME YOU LITTLE @!@#@!#@!#@!#@!#@!#.

I AM AGGRESIVLY PASSIONATE :P
---
&gt;I hate sodapoppin, he acts like a jerk and he doesn't like the game, he's paid to play it.
---
Never watched him so I might be totally off here... sry. To me it still seems vierd that someone with that many viewers  plays a game he hates for several hours nonstop just for money? Are there not games he actually enjoys a little more he could stream instead?
---
However, I watched Asmond yesterday as I could not get in on the stress test and it was really entertaining despite all they did was literally run for 40 minutes and I thought it was great just to see the WoW forums today being filled with hate towards him and just classic streamers in general.
---
Just to add - in case you spergers out there can't tell a bit of /s, i don't actually give a fuck. Watching you all get so triggered is better than a morning coffee.

---
I don‚Äòt mind not being top dps, but when you play feral in classic, you pretty much have to switch forms to get that extra energy really kills immersion for me.
---
I do not care about the #nochanges players, I wish they remove that, and buff them ever so slightly. Let them still underperform in most tasks, but it doesn‚Äòt make sense for the class to have to be played like that.
---
I‚Äòm not saying a cat should never swap forms, to heal or cast other spells, but constantly switching forms to abuse the energy thing is silly. And you kinda have to abuse it, not even to top the dps charts, but to be able to keep up at all.
---
"Ban whatever I don't like"
---
Uh no.
---
Haha this posts makes me love this community
---
Only the big streamers cause problems. People go completely mad when they are online, trying to associate themselves with the streamer. There will also be a sizeable population who will follow a streamer onto a server and then leave whenever that streamer leaves. Mostly though, it's because the community in that server tends to center around the streamer and others will have a really hard time to shine through. Servers have a sense of identity.
---
I'm sorry I won't find VODs now so you don't have to believe me, but he was shitting on Classic so much during Legion when he was playing retail like every stream alongside with Towelliee. He's been always on Towelliee's side, during that Asmongold drama for example. 
---
I know he's being sarcastic most of the time, but when you've been watching some streamer for a few years you kinda see after some time if they're being sarcastic or not.
---
Discovery xp
---
I understand. I realise now this is not really related to classic wow.
---
Damn I want one! Nice job!
---
Yeah but they have better memes lol
---
Wow they really are milking it for every last penny. Next thing you know we‚Äôre gonna see 10 minute and 3 second videos of people leveling first aid.
---
Shh, don't interrupt the circlejerk.
---
It refutes the idea that streamers are somehow the bane of this stress test and ruined it for everyone. You make it sound as if streamers dominated the test but in reality there were probably tens of thousands of players who participated which is a far cry from "some other people". 
---
Did those players get a priority too? No. They got lucky or logged in early. We didn't.
---
Even if this streamer priority were a thing and they didn't get in then congratulations 13 extra slots opened up and now we can talk about how shitty Blizzard is for having awful test servers because it's always something.
---
oh look, somebody on reddit complaining about everyone else on reddit
---
Man blizzard really is bringing back the true classic experience.
---
Reported and removed :) No concern trolling or backdooring politics on this sub - thanks mods.
---
He definitely used to, but after his month long hiatus he's toned the negativity way down and claims he doesn't want to be like that anymore. We'll see.
---
Who?
---
It's too late to change levelling for retail I think. They already have those level boosts in the shop and most people playing retail have several max level alts, it's not even super uncommon  for someone to have all classes at max level. Once they let us do that, we can never go back to having a real main character and maybe one alt at max level with greens and blues. There are retail players that haven't levelled through 1-60 since before cata.
---
They did say in an interview that they are willing to listen to player feedback, so when "classic ends" they could do the same for Burning Crusade.
---
Exactly. If you talk shit before understanding something, you deserve a notch taken off your reputation. Of course he is allowed to be wrong. Just not in a consequence free way. If someone is wrong about something, or a few things for that matter, they deserve to be trusted a little less. That's how trust works.
---
Foretold by Salzman
---
Ever tried a good dose of r/wowservers?
---
That's the real toxic wow community
---
Uhh...this is the exact reason I said "no flame"???
---
I fully realize this is an outcome to expect from participating in a stress test. Is not also part of participating in that test *reporting* ones experience?? Which is all I have sought to do here. Lol wow.
---
Telling me my reasoning is considered 'Gatekeeping' is an argument, which you can't elaborate, hence why this discussion is over.
---
Are there any known routes or guides that will get you far enough ahead? I'll try searching for some.
---
Never got to create a ton. I was trying from the moment it open to server shut down. It was fun
---
If it makes you feel any better, I read it as butthurt and didn't even realize until you stated it.
---
He did I on the stress test server as a level 5 but its not very hard. The tricky part was getting logged on.
---
But even as a minimum, saying 35-40 is pretty low. Even inefficient farming specs can get a fair bit more than that, provided they're selecting the right farming location.
---
Live to win
---
I'm not a streamer and have classic beta. Honestly I'm trying to do what I can to report bugs, glitches, issues. For example - animations don't play when looting interactable objects (chests, pumpkins, etc).  
---
But I am suprised I got an invite - yes I signed up, yes my account is old, but it has several strikes against it too (2 bans, 2 suspensions).  
---
My recommendation to people who haven't got in is to hope that Blizzard work on these bugs, and don't just sit on it, like they tend to do in an 'open beta'. And also, enjoy not being burnt out on Classic like some people will be who go super hard on the beta.
---
Yes I believe so
---
I knew it, I knew there was a reason I didn't like him. I hate phony people.... granted people can change, I guarantee he is just riding the hype train and will be back on BFA as soon as new content is released
---
Anything you can do with weakauras was possible during vanilla.
---
You're an autistic manchild.

I'm an autistic manchild.

A-Fucking-Men brother, a subset of this sub has turned into entitled 13 year olds and it's just sad

Joana‚Äôs classic leveling guide. 
---
A lot of streamers have recommended this to me.
---
You‚Äôre not wrong, it‚Äôs just that vanilla was always seen as a grind game, you‚Äôre rewarded for the hard work that you put into things. Being given that for free ruffles the feathers of some, leading to the sentiment towards the streamers from a large population of players. I‚Äôve got no skin in the game, this is just what I‚Äôve observed. I like plenty of streamers myself but if Sodapoppin got geared in a raid he just showed up in that I‚Äôve been attending for months over me simply because he‚Äôs famous, I‚Äôd be pissed.
---
There's this similar comment unironically with a bunch of upvotes in this very thread
---
Ah, thanks for explanation
---
It was actually fun to make! I'd make ya one!

Its most WoW forums really. You should see the animosity the official forums have towards streamers
---
no, maybe as an off tank, but even then, you should just take one more warrior. every mt of every raiding guild ever is a warrior. noone cares that they are okay at some encounters, when they are just not good enough for others
---
no, when a druid tops your healing meters, your guild is a joke.
---
no, doing 50% of the dps of a real class with powershifting and mcp isnt "okay" dps, its a wasted spot. hunters arent comparable, you dont bring hunters for damage, but for their utility (tranq shot). You dont need the druids utility at all.
---
The #nochanges stans are way too toxic. Hell yeah.
---
Can see why you feel that way, it's not quite at a point where he is favoring information that supports his own belief, was just the quickest one I recognized since he chose to interpret the smile as fake to support his belief.
---
I just played the beginning of the gnome starting area from retail and they make a comment on the "small gnomes" after healing the leper gnome.
---
Okay. You're a more reliable source because you actually played during Vanilla. I've only seen videos and played on the stress test. Lol
---
That moment when you decide to heal as dps, but you don‚Äòt know if it makes more sense to waste your mana to try and help out the healer or commit to your spec and stats and just keep dps-ing, because you get more bang for your mana and more damage means we kill the boss/pack faster.
---
Work was worth the effort I'd say. I would definitely wear that shirt.
---
 bussiness
---
Blizzard stated like 5 times servers are open for 24 hours
---
Hmm that's true, to an extent. I asked about leveling as a healer and while the responses were helpful, the thread it self was down voted into oblivion
---
Undead rogues*
---
Oh, ok. I swear the email said it only lasted two hours...
---
I can provide you my feedback on why I have a mitigated perception about streamers. It might not be representative of the overall population however.
---
Positive points:
---
- create a community, which is good and will bring people to the game
---
- animate servers to create event and therefore memories
---
Cons:
---
- create a unbalancing in the population. Lot‚Äôs of players would like to be able to follow their favorite streamer
---
- (the biggest) benefit from viewers help as for gold/events. Ruins competitions with every other player, because they don‚Äôt have the same resources. R14, scarab lord, gold, world bosses
---
- sometimes the event created are dumb... and ruins other players experience. Potential example that pops in my mind. The streamer server is down so let‚Äôs roll lvl 1 gnome on server X. Server X cap reached and you have to wait to connect. I guess it will be less of an issue in 2019 than it was in 2005 however.
---
I don‚Äôt hate streamers but I prefer to play vanilla wow like in 2005... where this kind of exception were reserved to death and taxes/nihilum, fighting for a world first. Streamers are helpful now for the hype, and that‚Äôs good.
---
It's not that I expected it to be more mature because it said so, I just thought (or hoped) that it would be more mature just because it has an older audience. Other communities for at-the-time massive hits, like WC3 and AoE2 today do seem more mature, and I think a lot of that is an older audience.
---
Now that I think about it, though, communities for those games are driven by a love for what the game was, without the other factor of disdain for what the game has become; they don't have a game which has changed so dramatically, where they resent what has happened between the 'good old days' and now.
---
Smh this is such a retail player opinion, us private server players know that people don't even read comments or replying. They just come in and vomit their opinions and rehash old threads about whatever topic is at hand.
---
Kinda hard at leve 1
---
The worst part is - the people that are so violently opposed to the 'changes to vanilla' are still going to play it, and they're still going to bitch about it. 
---
At least with Game of Thrones, its over now.
---
Does the spot under the stairs in the military ward still work?
---
Are you sure? I strongly remember blinking out of stuns in vanilla but I might be wrong.
---
I'm not invited, but I couldn't care any less. I'm biding my time, preparing and if fate allows it, I will get invited, if not then so be it.
---
People are so whiny. I bet they will find a way to tarnish the image of Classic after launch. What a load of human trash.
---
Yeah and his is an observation too, not a complaint
---
Hey that's a fantastic recreation of /u/asmongold
---
I‚Äôd have that worry more so about rogues and warriors. Mages are always appreciated, there were always a ton in my vanilla raids.
---
Which is hilarious that people are mad about it.
---
Heres my experience, I spent 2 hours trying to long in and when I finally got to character creation I couldnt make one. I didn't even get to finalize my character let alone load into the world.
---
Compared to the length and breadth of the entirety of WoW, it is. He‚Äôs been playing with any seriousness (I mean more than dabbling, not just playing hardcore) for about 1/4 to 1/3 the life of the game.
---
Also, parse ranks aren‚Äôt a matter of skill. There‚Äôs so many things that you have zero control over to impact that, along with general padding. Hell, you can get rank 1 by being the first player with a brain to kill a boss after a patch. Don‚Äôt judge anyone skill by rank parses, that‚Äôs just silly.
---
There are literally hundreds and hundreds of long videos about how Classic works. Did you even bother *trying* to search YouTube?
---
while a fun idea. It completely went against the reason the stress test was even done. Thanks for showing the subreddit exactly the reason people are opposed to how streamers do their trade.
---
&gt;‚Äîwe want to push our tech to the limit, and that means a critical mass of players in close proximity.
---

He's not crying you fucking idiot, he's pointing out a disparity. Shut the fuck up.
---
Ever been on r/survivor when an non-underdog is about to win the game?
---
So many great comments in there.
---
&gt;Would have liked to have stress tested something. But after 2 hours of constant Queueing and DCing..never did get in.
---
That's how stress testing fucking works. So many people have no clue and should just wait until release. This is why Blizzard tries to be selective with who gets in.
---
Wagnawos?

Moron. Back to the basement

---
Ah I could be wrong, I was basing it from the wording here: https://www.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow - I do still expect some fierce competition for mobs.
---
I feel like I'm listening to a political science debate in community college.
---
Whiny bitch boys like you are way worse than the toxic kids.
---
Not all heroes wear capes.
---
It is not :) but we are talking about a competitive game with an equal treatment in the beginning that ‚Äúfame‚Äù might imbalance, which is an issue. At least it is one of the reason for me
---
With Classic you probably don't even need to buy a second copy, since it's free with the subscription and doesn't require the expansion, and the base game is free these days.
---
There will be no cross faction. It would affect the open world pvp too much.
---
yea try looking up some Class guides on youtube. Just search for Classic.
---
I couldn't make cross faction characters on the stress test.
---
Top tier shitpost mate.
---
You can't. Tried it in the stress test.
---
&gt; That's how stress testing fucking works.
---
He is wrong, mages can blink out of stuns.
---
Did you ever play on popular servers back in the day?
---
You‚Äôre correct, no one knows but Blizz, but it‚Äôs safe to assume that they would try to test things in launch-like conditions, or else why test them at all?
---
Spawning bosses makes sense at the END of the supervised test, to see how far they can push the services. They gave people 2 hours to test the flow of the starting zones at launch, but the ‚Äúrace‚Äù took priority.
---
Toxic? Yes. One of the most toxic? Fuck, I wouldn't even put it in the list of most toxic gaming subreddits.
---
It's just full of whiny assholes, jealous at streamers for getting priority treatment (ya know, since they're basically freelance PR reps for the game) and people who just want to cry about every piece of information they get ahold of.
---
You dont get the point. Plus, the 50k people is nothing compared to the million players.  Twitch is not the center of the world. 
---
Yeah they reach peoples using twitch but most twitch viewers are already playing the game and
---
So which streamer do you regularly donate to?
---
No you cant.
---
So if people are toxic I should look away?  
---
And you forgot another option. How about be nice to each other even if its on the internet?
---
I've always copied the old way because I hate getting auto-updated to April Fool's jokes. I know it's more actual effort my way, but it's less mental effort
---
1) The servers didn't crumple at all. The servers had locked population, which means nobody would ever be able to get in after they got the amount they wanted.
---
2) It's a TEST, you don't only test things you know are going to work. You test things to see if they work and if they work how they're supposed to.
---
Thanks for showing everyone how you have no idea what you're talking about. You're welcome to go back to bitching because you got to participate in testing auth and realm servers and misunderstood the purpose of a fucking test you moron.
---
I think he has a significantly larger role on the classic team as well, his role on the retail team was kind of minor.
---
The difference is that blizzard is free to do whatever they want with retail you carebear.
---
gimme smoll gnome plz
---
I mean, private servers exist. I don't understand why people are being so impatient, go play on a Vanilla server until Classic comes out rather than complaining about betas and stress tests (which are going to wipe anyway).
---
reeeeeeeeeeee
---
It's the 'Classic Stress Test' server. It just threw me off because the email said 'Wednesday, May 22 4-6PM PDT' up top and I didn't keep reading to the bottom where it says they'll keep them open until today. Doh.
---
Blizz dumped a bunch of stuff in Elwynn for the stress test.
---
Cthun, army of Hoggers, Rag, Onyxia... it all looked like good fun.
---
Incorrect. If you had every played mage or even viewed a single mage pvp video from vanilla or any pserver, you would know how important it is for mages to blink out of stuns.
---
It was not allowed in Vanilla, so I assume it's the same.
---
A lot of the people on subreddits like this don't really have anything in their lives besides video games which leads to some of them taking it way too seriously and spouting a lot of the shit we see here.
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/news=290910/spell-batching-in-classic-wow](https://classic.wowhead.com/news=290910/spell-batching-in-classic-wow)
---
No one reads anymore
---
Nah, this community is genuinely disproportionately filled with degenerate manchildren, it's a fair assessment. I don't really care if it helps or not. It's beyond saving. 
---
The constant state of meltdown is not normal even for gaming communities. There is a uniquely deranged group. I blame the pserver community, because the retail WoW community is not even close to this shit lol.
---
I dont know, he maybe enjoys retail, but I watched him play Classic and he was making stupid mistakes because he was rushing, constantly complaining how "stupid" the game is, Jesus, this guy is so obnoxious, other streamers show genuine enjoyment even when they die and laugh, he's just like a spoiled brat who constantly bitches about EVERYTHING, really.
---
Projecting?
---
I totally agree. I commented this in another video about this guy and got downvoted hard. Fickle community.
---
Jealousy is abound.
---
I see that in the fine print now. I figured they'd only be open for the test duration. Leaving it up is a nice gesture for those of us who have a hard time meeting the two hour window.
---
My classic log in gives me wow1 - server unavailable
---
Wow2 - stress
---
Will wow1 just be a bug?
---
And how does your comment improve it? Irony fail
---
The real problem has been found..
---
You *did* stress test something. That's how it fucking works.
---
Your mom is a more toxic subreddit.
---
You cannot create opposite faction characters on a PvP server. I tried last night in the stress realm and it did not work.
---
A lot depends on the circumstances (talents, available cooldowns and gadgets; and whether it is open wpvp or duel).
---
For duel, with optimal talents and some engineering gadgets, mage vs rogue is skill based, in favour of the mage.
---
Same circumstances, warlock-rogue depends on the warclock's spec. If SL, then skill based but heavily in favour or the warlock. If other than SL, skill based but heavily in favour of the rogue.
---
In wpvp, the rogue can always disengage:p
---
But ye rogue does not "counter" these clothies in the sense of frost mage vs warrior However, watching a non sl-warlock die in the cheapshot+kidney shot without any escape (eg. because or having felhunter out) kinda feels the same sometimes.
---
Make Gnomes Short Again!
---
Uh. Yeah that's exactly what you can do. You can't force people to be nice. Dick. Stop crying about shit you can't change. Who the fuck do you think you are that you get to decide for others what their behavior should be? It's a personal decision.
---
I played on a Vanilla server last night and I got hit hard with the nostalgia of the starting zones.
---
I think we need both tbh
---
Lul, u think wpvp never happened on pservers before the community was blessed with streamers?
---
yikes, what did I just read.
---
Honest to God people like you could complain about there being too much fun in life.
---
Hatred and jelousy?
---
Pablo and his deep thoughts.
---
You have no idea how expensive it is to buy skills in vanilla.
---
they put hoggers in at northshire to kill people trying to leave. the event they were referring too was the spawning of Cthun, Onyxia, Rag. Hoggers were crowd control. Hoggers were not the event.
---
This happened to me in BC! My server (Shattered Hand EU) would get together a weekly PuG group for Naxx. One time I had to leave the PuG to go to the Internet cafe with my friends, I get there and see an older guy doing Naxx. Stop to look at his screen and the name rings a bell, ask to take a closer look and yep! It‚Äôs the exact same group. Completely mental.
---
Really nice guy, he went young me lots of free gold and gear since he played pretty hardcore and I was a filthy casual.
---
DO NOT run around the world discovering zones for exp like the other guy said. It's the slowest way to level by far even if questing zones are packed with people.
---
It's better to just run away and kill mobs people have not gotten to yet, so if you're in Valley of Trials you should just run to the burning blade coven and kill stuff before the mob gets there. If you have friends you need to do the same thing, tag as many as you can, kill them quick, get to level 4 and leave Valley of Trials instantly.
---
Classic WoW will be WAY slower than pservers even with layering because there's no dynamic respawns. Every single spawn will be camped for hours by different people so killing random mobs to level up will be the fastest way.
---
They didn't crumble immediately? Thousands of people were in the Server lol
---
With optimal duel specs, warlocks absolutely destroy rogues (and every other class for that matter). SL is so strong that it's the only spec in the game that is banned in duel tournaments.
---
Rogue vs mage is also a slightly mage favored matchup. And yes, mages can blink out of stuns.
---
ITT: Everyone is stupid and toxic except for me.
---
Holy shit. Of all the things to be mad about people are even mad about blizzard summoning bosses and having fun at the end of the test. 
---
Retards like that are why they don't do shit for fun. Cause you bitch about even that.
---
Unbelievable levels of pathetic from people surrounding a stress test.
---
It is a turn off - you get people like the other replying to you who are all "Hurr hurr cry more get off the internet if you don't like people being shitty to each other" but it's an MMO. Community is important and sharing the experience with others is part of the game.
---
But on a positive note, I've been playing the beta and I've had a great feeling of community. Lots of spontaneous grouping, people helping each other out and acting fairly, and chatting amiably in global and party chat. Hopefully the bitterness from so many here is temporary (for their own sake more than anything), but if not, I think the majority of players will go in with an attitude of looking to enjoy the world and be good to each other, and those dedicated to hate, conspiracies, and elitism won't have much impact.
---
It is trying times for sureüò≠
---
Not sure what you're smoking, but I think you might need to put it down
---
It runs smooth but there was a lot of server lag even this morning, most noticeable on looting. I had 29ms but substantial lag when I looted.
---
I remember going to Orgrimar and going through every single building, talking to every single vendor because I head no idea what to expect.
---
&lt;rants in old person&gt; You kids these days....back in my day we had to hike uphill both ways to our capital cities...if we died we LOST exp...you don't know how good you have it...get off my lawn..etc &lt;/rants in old person&gt;
---
:P
---
Then im glad im on EU, as ive heard we dont have as many streamers :)
---
The 'participation medal' generation becoming adults and realising the world just sometimes isn't fair.
---
im sure theyre going to break addons like LFR and LFG, but im really hoping they break the [raider.io](https://raider.io) and [dungeon.io](https://dungeon.io) addons that im seeing pop up as well. addons that make it easy to gatekeep people have no place in vanilla
---
I'll gladly take those that are frustrated over how blizzard has handled this beta over the toxic wash that streamers manage to dig up as viewers who are always there to protect both the streamer and blizzard like they're some saints that do no wrong. üôÇ
---
Hes not out of argument, you are just being a douchbag. First what makes you say that "dont play wow with multibox, goes against core of MMOS"? That is YOU oppinion, so invalid argument. And why not on a PVP server? clearly this dude will not go 10 shamans bursting every last soul he comes across. He wants to efficiantly level with 2 or 3 chars, he pays blizzard to do it then let him do it. And you open up your "argument" with a personal insult wich just screams insecure douchbag.
---
You said vomit, which is exactly what SHARDING makes me do.
---
Classic DoA, amirite guys?
---
Deadmines = DM
---
Dire Mual = DiM
---
Atleast this was how it was on my server way back.
---
Get out of your reddit bubble you fools.....
---
I think the biggest frustration came from the fact that if you were lucky enough to get in in the very first wave and make a character you never had problems logging in again after a realm dc.  
---
If you were unlucky and got the "character creation timeout" or kept getting kicked back to log-in then it never corrected itself.  
---
I completely understand being a little frustrated that some people were able to test for hours by actually being in the game, while others were testing it by getting the same error message over and over again with no way to get past it.  
---
I'm not sure of one person who got the character creation error in the beginning that ended up actually getting in later. Those I know that were able to make a character after the stress test was over that had that error message continued to get the World Down message.  
---
It felt more like accounts were being flagged incorrectly or something than a server stress test, because many were unable to get in even after the server population went back down after the tests were over.
---
Given the bruhaha about the advantage of the Gnomes height (or lack thereof) during original release, I wonder if they'll keep them this way.
---
Never heard of duel tournaments, I hope these will be a thing on Classic though.
---
Do you have a jewelcrafting guide to go with the cooking guide?
---
Rogue is a very skill based class that has a lot of even matchups. They don't really counter anything though (except bad players, they destroy bad players regardless of their class). Rogues vs cloth classes depends a lot on what specs are being used. Frost mages, shadow priest and SL locks are all hard fights for a rogue. Fire mages, non-SL locks and healing priests are less of an issue.
---
Look, if it weren't for streamers then almost nobody would have any idea what the beta has been like or what went on during the stress test. Streamers enabled hundreds of thousands of people to experience the beta in some way that otherwise wouldn't.
---
It's even worse in person. Trust me.
---
It‚Äôs really not. The only people who say this are streamer subscribers.
---
most people that use to play vanilla, including myself. Dont have the time for this type of MMO game play anymore. Sure there will be a community for it, i just dont think the people who have never played it before will get much enjoyment out of it. You literally have to dedicate your life to it to get anything good.
---
Came here for this comment
---
Why would anyone rip on a girl with an Aussie accent? That shit is HOT.
---
Of course it does. But I think streamers make it more interesting by providing hype.
---
Mmm spanks
---
When someone pushes you off:
---
"They came from.... Behind!!!"
---
find spots and grind, as well as quest. there are loads of good area's, even in starting zones, where you can tag/kill anything. If you're a hunter, its even easier as you can tag mobs from a distance.
---
&gt; Discussion was closed way back here - https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bs1i9a/multiboxing_classic_which_setup/eoiayvn/
---
Thank god they will implement phasing/layering to combat this awful problem.
---
Imagine rolling undead, they're like 50% of horde
---
Not being able to do anything is actually the point of a first stress test I presume.. overload the thing and see what happens. Streamers or not,at this point they accomplished nothing more than the majority of other testers lol but was funny to watch.
---
How sad are the people who spend their free time doing shit like this?
---
Can confirm, not working
---
You just go kill 5-6 mobs in groups, invite random ppl that go do the same. there are a ton of mob of that level to sustain a hundreds of people in groups of 5. as for 1-5 zone, just forget about it, it completely no worth the time.
---
once you get to like level 3-4, you split the group and continue killing in groups of 2-3. until you get level 5-6 and start doing 6-10 quests if you can, or just grinding.
---
Why not just level with friends like everyone else?
---
He used Joana, Which leaderboards did you look at.
---
&gt;If you're invited you can enjoy it however you want to
---
Of course but mainly a beta exists because of testing and reporting bugs.
---
It's almost like people want to play the game.
---
Real curious if they would actually change this to the correct format
---
I'm so glad I have no clue wtf you're talking about.
---
You guys are like a pack of piranhas, instantly devouring every scrap Blizzard throws to you and then turning on each other when it's gone.
---
You did stress test... stress test doesn‚Äôt mean login in and play. Stress test means. people TRY to login. Some get in and some don‚Äôt make it all the way in, then Blizzard records all that data and now they see exactly the limits of the system, what it can handle and what needs to be changed so this doesn‚Äôt happen at launch.
---
When you‚Äôre saying ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt even get to stress test‚Äù you‚Äôre misunderstanding the situation. You literally were part of the stress test because your failed attempts at login is an element of the test.  Just by you trying and failing even once has helped tremendously... they need people in seats trying to login so their server can record all that data.
---
That is what is considered a stress test in the development community.
---
Who cares about forums. Once the game is out this forum will be much better. People are bitter they can‚Äôt play their favorite game.
---
I played LoL hardcore for years up until recently off and on. I quit every time because the IN GAME community is hell. It‚Äôs so toxic the game is unplayable.  The in game wow community is the nicest in any game I‚Äôve ever played.
---
4. Have been proving on retail to not be accounted for
---
The loading screens are lightning fast. Saw my brother playing a bit, he hearthstoned and the loading screen literally flashed, then he was at the inn.
---
Then turn them off...

I just log 1h, group with one random guy, we quest and chat a little bit. I just had a great moment.

This is essentially what layering does, except you can travel between those soon-to-be-merged Servers, which is a byproduct of many advantages

I like the stink lines. The only thing missing is a collection of half empty large sized fast food cups in the background.

facts. this sub is pathetic. I really hope the actual classic community wont be like this sub.. people went from retailbashing to streamerbashing, there are 0 original posts, only reposts, overused jokes and ocasionally some decent posts about subjects that have been discussed 1000 times.. I subbed to get updated on classic but god damn it just doesnt worth it lol.
---
Envy. They can play the game eventually but are incredibly impatient. So they want now.
---
You can play Vanilla WoW right now is what I'm saying
---
Did you report it?
---
Yes! I forgot about that aspect! Looking forward to it even more! 3 months is a long time :(
---
To add to your comment. Omar - one of the original devs. on classic - joined Esfand when he reached Silithus.
---
Just for arguments sake on the sub part and them knowing if you would even play the beta... You have to check the Classic beta in your beta settings to opt-in. They'd know who wants to play just by checking the opt-ins, having an active sub to retail has not a lot to do with that particular point.
---
I see it as a revenue/profit source, for sure, but I'm not exactly hitting them over the head with it. They are a business... and as far as business practices go, this is easily on a lower tier of shittiness.
---
But, I speak for myself on that. I can afford to resub, many can't or won't, and that's perfectly fine. I think it's important to remember that beta access isn't a right or anything like that.
---
Oh fuck off, the adults of the time were the ones handing out the participation trophies. The kids getting them knew they were meaningless. And believe me, millennials have known their entire lives that the world isn't fair, what with how the previous generations have fucked up the world and now don't want to deal with it.
---
well Blizzard wanted to see what would happen if the starting areas kept every single person who logged in so they can stress the system.
---
At least for me, there are several things I want to test before launch. Namely, the speed/feel of the modern client, and also seeing if I can import my UI from retail or private. Also, getting that UI setup to where I can paste it in on release.
---
There are some other things, too, but basically just tasks I'd rather not deal with on day one, you know? And, of course, I would like to be able to say I played the beta. It is a small piece of WoW history.
---
I always found crafting in vanilla to be a bit weird, as by the time you hit the trade level to craft something (dark leather for instance) you're usually past it actual level wise, unless, of course you grind nothing but skinnable mobs to level.
---
Not him but I rock ESDF on wow. It frees up W and A on the left and allows for a shorter reach to T G C Z and V.

Playing like that doesn‚Äôt aggravate my carpel tunnel as bad.

Stress test was only 2 hours, but the server is up to play on for 26 hours
---
&gt; according to blizzard's own documentation.
---
link?
---
can you on a pve server ?
---
It's a fucking TEST. You're essentially a volunteer. You having fun is not the priority here.
---
I mean this was something that had yet to be noticed and probably would‚Äôve gone unnoticed for a while. Nostalgia aside, this has next to zero impact for classic or the #nochanges
---
Yeah, you're probably right with that. I recon the nicer one don't really take part in discussions as much and just enjoy the game.
---
Layering creates several isntances of the same world on the same server. So your one server will have several different layers separating the players in the starting zone, so you have a more normal amount of people.
---
I leveled to 5 in both the NE and Human starting areas last night and it was fine. Slower but not insanely so and I expect it to be better at launch when the layering has been smoothed out more.
---
By hype do you mean idiotic twitch memes spammed in chat?
---
Please tell me you had a ‚ÄúRegulators! Mount up!‚Äù /yell macro?
---
They made Tauren smaller!!?!
---
This needs to be fixed!
---
Idk, mods need to step up, this sub will get inflated really quick.
---
No, you should downvote and upvote helpfull comments.
---
this guys is so obnoxious. Being a father and almost 29 acting like a teen all the time. zzzzz /signed grumpy old man
---
Yeah, I think its very unlikely we wont see a massive drop in player numbers after a few weeks. Even if we ignore the fact that tastes differ, many people simply dont have the time for a game like WOW.   
---
That doesnt mean I assume this game will be anywhere dead... we are good for at the very least 6 months after Naxx launch.

Not like vanilla, they were supposed to be bigger and in blue as seen in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CNN_Cn2L2A)  and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rUim7uPdPM&amp;t=556s)

My boy AQ20 always getting shafted.
---
No thank you.
---
Im swedish, but english isnt a problem :)
---
Blizzard probably found bottlenecks in their infrastructure. Specifically, in their login servers as you pointed out.
---
That's exactly what the purpose of the stress test is.
---
when people start referring to everyone and everything they don't like as 'nazi'... it kind of dilute the insult...
---
Even if you didn't play classic, how come you can't be happy to see a giant Ragnaros just chilling there?
---
Agreed. I have never been more excited to hit 5, yet more disappointed I couldn't hit 6 to buy those skills. :D
---
He was popular on YouTube, so when he when he moved to twitch he had a large following. This allowed him to be on the top row of WoW, if not the largest channel. Because of being on the top it makes it easier to grow he kept growing to the point he is now.
---
Thank you for finally speaking up about all of this. The entitlement is way more than expected from this crowd.
---
Especially all of the hate toward streaming this game we all love. Most of the streamers got really lucky being in the position they are in today. Literally whole days of ‚Äòworking‚Äô up to where they are now. Not many of us have the spot in our lives  to stream all day and not worry about bills or feeding the family. They got in early enough to sustain and if a company (Blizzard) offers you something that could not only give your job more traction, but is also something you love, wouldn‚Äôt you do it? 
---
If you don‚Äôt like streamers just because they got into the beta just don‚Äôt watch them. It‚Äôs like anything else. If you dislike it, don‚Äôt give it your attention.
---
That is so true. Same thing with retail.
---
True big if
---
People love a good circlejerk!
---
money rewards in Dun Morough are way off. I got 27 silver for a level 4 quest (Return the mug)
---
&gt; Can you please provide ANOTHER example of a game, that was in a closed beta, and had similar number of viewers?
---
Closed betas barely exist anymore, so your point is pretty dumb
---
Be sure to report it ingame
---
I love the fact that he claimed you'd delete all your comments, and then deleted all his comments.

---
tldr, calling people out for being toxic is fair enough, but doing it in a toxic manner doesn't benefit the community either
---
The video with the WoW dev said a layer is an entire server of ~3k people and they will all be competing for the same mobs. I'm not sure why people assume this is going to be different?
---
We're you able to log in and create a character?
---
Your argument about parsing makes 0 sense, because according to you all the current #1 parses in WCL might aswell be people who don't know their class and RNG'd their way through logs to get #1.
---
Parse ranks are a matter of skill, nobody with lack of class knowledge will get #1 in the world, it requires knowledge of the class and experience in the fight, if you think otherwise you're a bit delusional especially considering that in some fights and depending on the class trying to pad = actual dps loss. I could go on and on, but actual research on WCL logs would be enough to prove this.
---
And the argument about being the first player with a brain to kill a boss after a patch is completelly irrelevant in this case, when his guild has been a world 100-200 guild. If you had told me that because the very top guilds usually private log so it doesn't matter much, I'd give you the benefit of the doubt, but this is clearly just a comment from someone who doesn't really understand what they're talking about.
---
damn that is grody af
---
You're right, that is helpful
---
Thanks.
---
I use mouse buttons to move and all the keys with the exception of a and d for key bindings
---
I totally agree on 3 and 4. Its hard to say if its the stress test server that affects it or not. I do not have beta access.
---
I knew he would do that when I read that comment, lol
---
What and arthas, illidan, thrall and muradin weren't fan service?
---
The beta client isnt really a good representation of how it will actually be. Go look at any old video of him saying retail, there is always at least 15 people just following him around trying to stay in frame.
---
Back in my day gnomes had to swim through shallow puddles!
---
Every sub I‚Äôve ever gone to is ‚Äúone of the most toxic‚Äù.  Can we just accept that it‚Äôs people who are toxic and has nothing to do with the games?
---

Got to see an undead, and then instantly disconnected.

A lot of people likely don't wanna mess around with private servers.

I tried once, didnt get in. I figured it wasnt just my own stuff so i did my part :)
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
WHO TF do I have to blow to get a damn stress test or beta access? Been sitting on my ass watching everyone test the game that I've been waiting for.. blizzard got me looking hella heartbroken...
---
Cool, thanks.
---
Yeah here whole existence is strange to me. Isnt she suppose to be ethereal or translucent like all other banshee's?
---
They have server logs about what happened to you during your login experience.  Don't worry about reporting it they already know.  The report bug feature is for things that are acting buggy, like an item not giving you stamina when you equip it or being able to ranged attack through LOS.
---
Your complaints are that streamers being in a server will cause the server to be big, and to have increased player interaction on those servers. There's still 0 evidence it would cause tilting of any economy, you simply have 0 proof or evidence that this would happen.
---
Oh no. People are going to run raids with these streamers. The... travesty? Classic raids are faceroll up to aq40 anyways man. Unless you are worries that people who aren't hard-core raiders will be doing the raids (they will anyways because classic wow raids were easy.) 
---
Oh No, pvp events! That sounds like no fun! Wait, No, it sounds fun because there would lots of fun events and consistent pvp to be had??
---
The were massive realms back in the day and they didn't suffer from these situations. The most that will happen is a few streamers will get shit for free and there will be constant massive pvp battles between streamers. And who the fuck cares if that happens. Hell that will bring up some insane world pvp to the server.
---
You're making mountains out of molehills.
---
The way you wrote shit makes it sound like you'll be upset that there is going to be consistent activity on the streamer servers. People going out in the world and doing massive world pvp. People doing raids together. People helping each other and grinding together, which will cause even more pvp. That sounds like classic was to me.
---
Yes but there is zero variation in how stats are allocated in retail while it was common in vanilla to have items with low or no stam while making up for it with raw sp/ap etc in return.
---
I was able to see there plans they range from free to 22$ a month I believe depending on the services you want.
---
I understand that, but if you really want to play the game the option is definitely there.
---
Ok so you didnt see the part where there were hundreds of people in Northshire.  Stop acting like you know everything.
---
the mobs are bugged, they hit too hard
---
If this drops opening week I wonder how much you could sell it for? Obviously the market for lower level items won't have been established yet, and I doubt many people would have tons of gold to drop on such an item.
---
Could hold onto it for a month or so and put it towards your epic mount, or just use it.
---
I plan to play druid, pretty sure if I got this drop I'd just use it in that case.
---
you couldn't even log in during the two hour window
---
Too soon
---
Did you see the starting areas after the race was over? They were crazy.
---
GMs were joining in on the race to AQ as well...
---
They will have gotten plenty of data for the stress test.
---
If the alternative is queues, that means they're expecting the population to drop off to where it fits a single layer by phase 2. What are they going to do if it doesn't? Just have queues anyway?
---
Some people are just pathetic
---
I wasn't hyped for vanilla at all.... til a bunch of my old school wow friends decided to all come back and play. Community is what new wow is missing. Will vanilla bring it back? I'm hoping but doubtful.
---
Praise be to Omar
---
Damn how do you get up there?
---
I don't fully believe streamers were the only ones who had it good.  After everything was working 30 minutes in, I was able to sign in  then create my gnome and get to the starter zone with out issue.  The was the same time others, including streamers with which i was watching, were able to too.  
---
I am not defending streamers, but saying only they played without issue isn't factually right.
---
[Oh no, bro!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpFQoUG91IU)
---
**Munches popcorn**
---
I only do lfr nowadays because I couldnt be arsed to do more in retail. There simply is no point.   
---
Yet I am very hyped about Classic and cant wait to play again. So whats your point?
---
If it helps, Asmongold,Esfand,Sodapoppin, Tipsout, and Staysafe are planning on playing on the same server.
---
That's not even a joke. Survival melee hunters with asscandy hurt like a motherfucker in melee.
---
I‚Äôm a just chatting titty streamer kind of guy
---
No new gear. Physics based enhancements...maybe.
---
Wrong, stop spreading misinformation.
---
Kapparekt420
---
World first classic wow stress test to AQ gates.  Seems legit to me.  Even came with $500 prize.
---
&gt; they are... but it doesn't metter, it's a "game files" thing(client), server can't change what you see without updating your client
---
The server can make models bigger or smaller (see: noggenfogger elixir, elixir of giant growth etc.), but I'm not sure if that can be done without applying auras, and I certainly don't think it's what's going on here.
---
Gotta love people with projection issues.
---
I seriously don't know why Blizz allows multiboxing. Its literally pay-to-win. Even PServers ban it. 
---
How can I make leveling, questing, and farming easier? Oh, I just have to pay for two more accounts? Awesome. 
---
I will attack multi-boxers on sight and if more than one character attacks back, I will clip it and report them for multiboxing in PvP.
---
Ok so no, here's what he said. We have regular server setup to start with. A Layer is a portion of a server - so a server might have 9k people to start with with 3 layers of 3k players each. That was the example given, but who knows what they'll actually do at launch. It might be less than that, but the point is each server will be broken up into a few different layers to accommodate the population. Considering how many they invited to the stress test and we were all spread out over all Horde and Ally starting zones, I'd say it was a very doable experience.
---
Imagine seeing "LFM DM" in Westfall general chat and thinking "oh, they must be forming a Dire Maul group."
---
It is interesting though how many different experiences were had. I'm with you that I understand it's a stress test and am not too worked up about it, but being realistic I can see why many were.  
---
Many streamers probably had a priority queue of sorts, which is completely fine and makes sense. You don't want your biggest names sitting on a login screen for hours when they can generate hype to thousands instead. The downside of that is that you will have passionate players who want to help test the game that feel undervalued as a player compared to others.  
---
Justified or not, I can sympathize a little bit with those being upset but reasonable. Some people are just crazy though.
---
Confirmed. Since I couldn't actually get into the world last night this was about the only thing I could test.
---
This has to be a Private Server, Thunderfury doesn't drop off spiders...
---
Some weeks meaning some months. When they release phase 2 they'll remove layering.
---
Just read the delete reply. I think everyone that ends a rant with "ahahahahaha" is a fucking morron.   
---
He looks like a League of Legends player.
---
That's what I've heard
---
OP is arguing that extremely overpopulated servers resulting from forced layer merges will impact AQ, not layering itself.
---
Wow. Thanks. That's surprising. It was definitely a thing in vanilla.
---
Thralls Balls, that was a great watch! Thank you for sharing
---
Welcome to r/classiccirclejerk!
---
This subreddit is a pillow fort in a kindergarten play pen compared to other places on the internet, but "much so toxic, so mean and angery". Sure dudes.
---
\&gt;watching every second
---
dude go outside
---
It is downright retarded to expect an online gaming community to not be "toxic" to some degree. I've been watching people do it for years yet it still persists. Wanting something is fine. Demanding others want the same thing is not. If you don't like toxicity so much, you're in the wrong kind community. I think it's inevitable with online gaming and I don't let it bother me. I think people have the right to be as toxic as they want. And others have the right to not associate with that toxicity. Seems fair to me.
---
Good old Bigdicklance
---
Wait one day?
---
I've had this happen to me. I started playing at the end of vanilla and my friend showed me how to walljump (which is sth you can't do anymore) to get to the Ironforge airport (which wasn't accessible back then). After about 10 minutes of checking it out I got ported to GM island and told to never do that again.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why these people are acting like the game is launched and they‚Äôre entitled to play.  It‚Äôs embarrassing.
---
Maybe next time they shouldn‚Äôt cough up 15 bux if they get this angry about losing it. 
---
These people should never go to a casino.
---
Could as well be a Rocket League play, you never know
---
It will be harder to use Gnomes as 10 pin bowling skittles if they don't go back to smaller.
---
It's understandable, and hopefully blizz releases a open beta in the coming months for the community.
---
Whoops, something went wrong!
---
If Retail died, I couldn't care less. It is the product of greedy fucks.   
---
It is corrupted to the core and is beyond salvation. Let it die.
---
Ah yes I'm on mobile so I miss some of that timestamp info :P
---
Sorry, but what do we see there?
---
I got sad I didn't get an invite, then I realized I didn't have beta opt-in enabled. I'm so dumb!
---
The problem is'nt the language. The problem is that we need to be on the same realm and I will prefer a german realm (=
---
If they didn‚Äôt want to test launch conditions, why would they have 3-4K people try to login to the same all at once? Why not limit it to waves, or open multiple test realms? Simple answer is they probably wanted to test launch conditions on a single realm, and see if the hardware could handle the load.
---
I never said that launch-like conditions are just the first few hours, I said the first few hours were supervised, which means Blizz had eyes on the ground to witness everything firsthand versus looking at data after-the-fact. I‚Äôm sure the test did provide them with tons of data, I‚Äôm just saying the data might‚Äôve been even more useful if the race didn‚Äôt happen.
---
Burthurt. Now I read the post as Bert Kreischer.
---
And seriously. They don't even need the players for this stuff. It's just marketing and hype.
---
I know, and thats the way it should be. I just couldn‚Äôt find anything from blizz confirming this. I figured they‚Äôd keep it that way, just looking for solid confirmation. Thanks bud.
---
I'd take engineering instead of alchemy. There's always someone in the guild who can make pots for you.
---
it was just because you were level 5 (max for the stress test) so i guess the game treated you as level 60 so you get extra money from quests.
---
Looks like someone doesn't know the Cx reddit.
---
You have a lot of negativity in your post and about streamers in general. Exactly the kind of person I am struggling to understand. Avoiding their servers sounds to me like avoiding some of the most alive servers out there. But I respect your choice and I am sure you can have fun with the game anyway.
---
&gt;A cancerous troll community filled with adolescent retards.  I'd rather be in the prison community.  Not the American prison though.
---
Trolls on the internet is not a new thing, just deal with them like anywhere else. So what I get from this is that you have social anxiety.. online? 
---
&gt; For the viewers, this one doesn't make sense. 
---
It's mainly for community building. Participants have a "I was there" feeling to it and such. As a viewer it was also hilarious to watch this happening on Asmongolds stream as he was making funny comments about survival of the fittest among lvl. 1 gnomes being eaten by high level crocodiles.
---
This. 
---
Maybe the first two "kill X of this common mob" won't be as bad, so killing boars and scorpids to get a quick lvl3 might be worth to do before grouping up to go kill lvl5s and 6s. It will depend on how much layering will help.
---
Having a guild ready before launch can help too.
---
You think telling a toxic person it isn't okay to be toxic will change them? Lol.
---
Can confirm, I'm on reddit, not working.
---
She isn't really a nobody persay. She did host parts at blizzcon: https://youtu.be/7mpFwXf2Chs and earlier during legion https://youtu.be/472qv17cxDA it's obvious shes been around for a long time but doesn't make it right what she said or is currently doing. I personally think she is a phony and really could care less about what she thinks it has to say about our community. Were a passionate community, nothing else to say about that
---
Vannila was a pure gem of gaming! Ill never will forget that feeling when we killed nefarian and got my t2 chest....good old days
---
A requirement to be in the stress test was to have an active wow sub, which requires purchasing the game.  I'm confused what you mean they didn't pay for it?  Literally everyone there has paid for the game and a sub.
---
Or they‚Äôre both bigger but gnomes grow faster.
---
So you‚Äôre saying we shouldn‚Äôt point out when people are being ridiculous?
---
Is this why mob tagging felt a bit delayed? Sometimes if me and someone else were going after the same mob, I'd feel like I got the hit in first but it would tag to them. That explains a lot!
---
Soul link is op.
---
Seriously though if you let the lock free and dot you up, you've already lost. You have to keep him cc'd and you have to get good at cc'ing him and getting restealths.
---
If you have all your cooldown there should be no excuse to lose to a mage. Vanish out of novas, cheap gouge trick to waste his blink, sprint, etc. You should destroy him.
---
I was playing on CRT til I turned 16 in 2010
---
They could probably get it refunded it anyway but just end up whining on the internet.
---
And my axe!
---
I was able to play with no issues this morning. Leveled to 4 before it was time for work. 
---
I know the point of this testing is not for us to have fun, but it definitely was a blast. Old school spell sound effects, actually having to pay attention to quests, visiting your class trainer, mana actually mattering... I can‚Äôt wait for the official release
---
I know.
---
But you are forgetting that entire communities that are toxic as fuck will move to WoW Classic.
---
I have been apart of some of these gaming communities and some of them are VERY toxic, to the point that in some games they play SOLELY to make everyone elses experience worse, because that is what they find fun.
---
You going for horde or alliance?
---
While i think your analysis is correct, i do believe that a slower paced leveling style would be necessary to retain the feeling of reward and the bonding with both your character aswell as the leveling zones, where you get to know the history of the places and their struggles instead of mindlessly questing which i feel is another important aspect of why vanilla questing doesn't feel like such a chore.
---
Having to stop to read where to quest, understand why, then having to manage food/drinking really make you much more invested in what you are doing and once you have finished and have overcome all your problems, probably banding with other people aswell, it makes you feel good.
---
If your leveling is much faster and you don't have to think as much about these things, it somewhat ironically makes leveling feel like a chore to just get to the cap.
---
Are you playing on a pc that's 14 years old btw? What about your monitor? You're using widescreen? But, what about your vanilla experience?
---
This is the state of gaming now. It‚Äôs not 2004 anymore. Even in vanilla there were large personalities like Swifty and Athene that people followed around. Content delivery has evolved and twitch is massive. There‚Äôs not really a way to police it. Does Blizz enable it by giving these streamers VIP access? Yeah of course, but think of the money these massive companies sink into marketing and pr. It‚Äôs naive to imagine they would pass up exposure that they pay absolutely nothing for. Love it or hate, that‚Äôs just how it is.
---
Art of war
---
They had 10 million subscribers at the beginning of Warlords. There will always be people to come back. If they changed the game to be more like it used to be sure some people would leave who are very casual but there are millions more waiting to come back once the game is good again. There's no way you can convince me that making things a little more vanilla or burning Crusade like wouod alienate more players than WoD or BfA.
---
Til the prequels...
---
Just FYI, beta invites were not random. https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-testing-access-as-of-may-22/179883 they were based on various factors.
---
I'm on the stress test now and not seeing Floating Combat option for Heals.  It shows it over my own head but not over other players when I heal them.  Any suggestions??  I have tried to console command  /console floatingCombatTextCombatHealing 1
---
It was a fun thing to be a part of, even if it took till 5am est to play. 
---
Being on discord chatting it up with all the folks was the community experience of vanilla I have been craving.
---
This argument can be used for so many things in Classic.
---
Can someone please elaborate a bit on the elitist perspective? Is it veterans that feel entitled or #nochange movement wanna decide everything? Can someone nail that one down for me, please?
---
She "streams to Facebook", that should be the only red flag you'll ever need.
---
The keyboard corsair k120 aint that old, i just bought when it was released!....or wait...am I old ??
---
That dude just earned himself a sub!
---
Unless Blizzard does something in regards to the size of a layer, I don't see how layering will help congestion at all. 
---
The stress test had layering and it was still a cluster. A layer supposedly contains a "original vanilla server size" of players across the entire continent. Historical race distributions will still make popular race zones (Human, Orc, Undead) a nightmare.
---
how does he get that name but i cant get Boobear......
---
Every time I post a legit mechanics related game question it gets downvoted, someone comments on how it worked in 1.12 even though that was in my original post, and someone says it's been asked 1000 times, even though the beta only came out days before.
---
Meanwhile some streamer related meme gets upvoted.
---
What we really need is a gameplay/theorycraft related subreddit.
---
&gt; This right here is the classic MMO elitist player.
---
No, this guy is just insane, period.
---
Nobody said anything about demanding. Nobody said that. And expecting people to be decent on the internet might be silly, but I'd rather do that than turn into someone who starts cursing at and insulting people over nothing. It's not right when strangers at a gas station flip off the cashier over nothing, and it's not right when people do it online. Doesn't matter if it's normal. It's still not right.
---
It‚Äôs asmongold a streamer and he always says that when someone dies or even when he dies. Or lose at something.
---
ModUI pls!!
---
Kill literally everything you see.
---
lmfao I love this comment
---
That is different from the entire server being about playing with a streamer though. If it's just one raiding guild that's toxic that's w/e, if it's a 60k streamer it's completely feasible at least 1000 players on that server are just there to be seen on stream and pass him items and not be part of any server community.
---
Bigger everywhere?
---
It‚Äôs not complicated.
---
Launch is for playing to your hearts content.
---
Betas, stress testing phase are to ensure that on launch you CAN play to your hearts content.
---
You people who are complaining: stress test is not about you. Beta isn‚Äôt about you. It‚Äôs about improving the software so launch CAN be about you.
---
None of this is personal... right now you‚Äôre just really valuable piece of data! this is a very large scale software development project still under development. 
---
On launch it‚Äôs all about you.
---
Well content-wise, what is special about him? I used to watch him sometimes back in the day and I guess he was decent. Was really suprised to see how popular he's become averaging like 20k+ (Prior to Classic Beta) on Twitch.
---
I mean he is no top player, he's not particulary funny or creative. I just don't get it.
---
You seem confident that this wont get fixed...
---
What does adults handing them out have to do with what its led to? The pussiest generation so far.
---
Yo fuck that, they been makin' all kinda gains in the last 15 years. Dwarf needs to step his macro game up.
---
You need to learn how to play a hunter better.   Get a fast attacking pet, like Brokentooth (the lion from the Badlands). It has a 1.0 attack speed which interrupts casters a lot. They get push back tonnes. 
---
Also, what spec are you playing?   if you  are BM, then Beastial Wrath is deadly for casters too. The big red pet, does a shit tonne of damaged. Just get to ranged using conc shot, wing clip, frost trap.   
---
If you are Marksman, you also have Scatter shot to throw into the mix, improved Conc shot, with 20% chance to stun (only has a 12 sec cooldown). 
---
If you are Survival, improved wing clip gives you a 12% chance to immobilise your targets for 5 seconds. You have Entrapment &amp; trap mastery, giving your traps a chance of trapping your targets for 5secs, and less chance of players resisting it.  If you use frost trap, every step they take this can proc....so good chance to have then stuck. U have deterance (chance to dodge/parry).  You have counterattack...which is great against melee classes. And you have Wvyern sting, which can help you put a target to sleep, then you can get to ranged and get off an aimed shot! 
---
Dont get me wrong, you are not OP against every class, but hunters are good and hard to kill if played well.  If you are lucky with critical hits, then clothies are very squishy, and you can kite warriors / pally's etc.
---
The view distance in the beta sucks and is not adjustable, players dissapear from your screen at like 70yds away, my memory from vanilla was you could turn your view distance way up and see people very far away
---
Let's not start seperate generations like that. People have been whining about something or other in WoW for over 15 years.
---
I would love to play with you and your family. Being part of that experience would be amazing.
---
&gt;Layering also has the fantastic added bonus of completely overpopulating a server if it‚Äôs full of streamers/non-tourists **after the la[y]er collapses.** This will (in some aspects) ruin massive elements of the game, from flooded chat windows, [...] to trivializing the AQ event, and more.
---
I think it's pretty clear.  I'm all for debating the subject, but let's be clear on what specifically we're arguing about.
---
WE DO NOT KNEEL
---
Any gaming subreddit is toxic
---
We now have over 500 members!
---
Awesome. Thats good.
---
I finally got in this morning (CDT), and was able to create a character, so we were locked out last night due to sheer overcapacity.  Last night was so frustrating I was believing the conspiracy theories about streamers all getting preferential logins and that "mere" stress testers who were not full beta testers were being deliberately locked out of character creation.
---
Players were definitely stress-tested last night, and one of the bugs Blizzard needs to address is community relations and communication. The mood was definitely ugly on here and on the official forums last night, *because* everyone could see the Twitch streams with hundreds of people on line, but For Some Reason, almost no one on the either set of forums could successfully create a character.
---
By trying to log in and by trying to create characters, you are stress testing though. Stress test doesn't only mean in game, it means outside of it and the whole infrastructure.
---
He has been streaming so long I¬†doubt subs or money phases him much anymore. I think money was last thing in his mind in this moment.
---
I think i would prefer alliance since its closer to most things at lvl 60 and time is very precious for me.
---
I might want to see classic from a new perspective though so who knows really. Depends on where the people are playing!
---
Mine looked like this:

Best part is that people are burthurt over the streamer race for ruining the stress test when omar gonzales our lord and savior (lead developer on classic) was joing in on the fun and running around silithis with esfand. What is with the entitlement it was a stress test not the actual beta, I do not know if they were actually letting streamers in ahead of people but if they were thats fine it allows those who didnt get access and those who failed to log in the chance to watch it from many different views.
---
Someone on sodas stream said they took the day off work to participate in the stress test but never got in, any one who took a day off work to attempt a 2hr stress test should be saving their days off for the actual release if they are that eager.
---
This is all temporary even the characters on the beta will be deleted with launch stop getting upset about little things that do not matter in the long run after 15 years we will be able to go back and enjoy the classic adventure whats waiting 3 more months, enjoy the time we have with our families and friends before we all inevitably loose our lives to the greatest game most of us have ever played. 
---
On a side note I hope that the few people going into streams and trying to start shit with some of the best players in retail over never being as good as top private server players will stop, a lot have been to world championships in arena they are highly skilled players and deserve respect they may not be as good on classic as people who have been playing on private servers for years at the moment but they have the dedication mechanics and brains to figure out the game, by harrassing them you are only making the private server fan base look bad not the streamers.
---
P.S. Sorry this was so long needed to get that out.
---
Well you go ahead and keep on wishing people would be nice. Best of luck to you. Let me know if it works and people stop being "toxic". I will then admit that I was wrong and consider you the savior of humanity.
---
this reminds me of the Wax on Wax off Mr Miagi training technique. Through the grind and suffering, you will emerge a sharpened tool of perfection. 1-60 is not quick or easy. You have plenty of time to become a master, trust me.
---
i didn't watch the whole thing yet, but the part you're referencing sounded a lot like "i'm not racist but..."
---
"i don't hate the entire classic wow community but fuck them, they're gamer gate blah blah."
---
2 and a half hours of log in boss wipes and it was worth every second. üòä
---
Honestly that's not exclusive to here. Ask any "commonly asked" question on most subs and instead of an answer you will get people who just "reeee how lazy are you just use the search feature", ignoring the fact that the search feature on reddit isn't very good and can be difficult to use (not to mention the fact that the effort spent flaming someone for not searching old posts could have just as well been used to actually answer the damn question)
---
Perhaps the wowwiki? A lot of your questions are super general and can be answered by people in this sub as well.
---
you literally said "ruined". if you really think that i'm exaggerating, maybe you should take a look at your own attitude and perspective first.
---
Its a god damn salt mine!
---
They could always ramp up the spawns like they did on BC launch day. That was pretty funny, people from both factions frantically saving each other from angry red orcs that popped before you even looted the one you just finished killing.
---
Unfortunately the stress test ended before the fight did. Surprisingly we were actually able to do some damage to him albiet we had onyixa helping and Bolvar tanking
---
Somehow I think the first AQ stress test was done the day it came out when everyone rushed there. You know, over a decade ago.
---
Nah
---
There are so many people who feel entitled to the beta or stress test or whatever. There's a reason they choose streamers and family members for these betas, and they've done this since forever. Like, why are you getting so worked up over a video game? It's not like they're gating the actual game, it's just the beta.
---
3 ways:  
---
You can go out of the starting zone and kill mobs which are probably higher than you until you are able to change the zone. This will be suffering and not enjoyable.
---
You can try to grind your way through the zones like everybody else. Hunting for every mob and take your time until people are more distributed through the zones.
---
Or you wait a few days. And enjoy the game.
---
Warrior when played correctly isn't really that slow, hamstring kiting and efficient routing with weapons makes it fairly decent. Rogues on the other hand are slightly more dps but takes 4x more damage with no sustain, getting 1handers to level with can be very difficult, from lvl 15-40 the only good mainhand you can get on ally is the drop from DM which is like 25%, and a lvl 39 mace from arathi highlands, you are pretty much cucked for the rest of the experience unless if you get a drop or do a lot of dungeons.
---
The only game I had to stop playing because of the toxicity was league of legends. I've always said that the people online are really smart or really fucking stupid. There is no in between I feel.   
---
Anyways, nice post bud, 100% agree
---
There will be more than one server, don't worry friend.
---
Wife is a fun killer dude holy shit. Just let them hit attack buttons on low level mobs or fishing. Don‚Äôt need to go into the whole Lore of the Forsaken they won‚Äôt even realize they are different from a troll besides color.
---
I'd 100% keep it for a few months then sell it. It's a highly desired item for the 39 twinks and can get you a huge chunk of your epic mount gold.
---
"Come on out May 22nd from 4PST to 6PST and see if you can give the server framework actual organic hypertension and associated cardiac arrest."
---
Nobody's shunning anybody for rolling anything other than a dwarf priest lmao.
---
I hope they don't, see their attempt to make the wq group finder addons break, result is they still work, just takes another 2-3 seconds, while making the groupfinder utility in the game completely broken for anyone not using them.
---
yeah and dwarves are bigger too!! this makes gnomes even bigger
---
It's not totally unreasonable to point out people's emotionally reactive behavior, especially since it's been very common among fans.
---
People wanna play the classic realms without paying for a sub.
---
No one is arguing against that point. The point I was trying to make was that ‚ÄúStress Test‚Äù was a little vague and I think people wouldn‚Äôt have been so disappointed if Blizzard had been a little more clear about what the Stress Test was testing. I think a reasonable amount of people thought it was the starting zones, not the login servers.
---
Well scrolling down I realize I am lucky to play in EU servers then!
---
I really don't get how people don't see this. Even if you don't like streamers, everyone being marginally better off because Asmongol is streaming is way better for the entire community than everyone getting to have 1 more chance at a beta invite.
---
And obviously there's lots of people who don't like Asmongold (me) who likes other streamers, so they should have a shot as well. 
---
Even if you accept that it's fundamentally detrimental to have special access for streamers, the benefits to the community still outweigh whatever detriment you can argue exists.
---
Haven‚Äôt re-sub‚Äôd yet because well it‚Äôs beta and waiting for the full release. But sadly so many toxic players destroy the enjoyment of others. When the full launch hits I‚Äôm hoping to avoid any server with a large streamer present. The top streamers I find completely annoying and want nothing to do with them.
---
Thanks mate
---
I assume his style mainly appeals to a younger audience. Asmongran being coveted as some epic veteran from a time where they were too young to play the game. I can hardly imagine anyone over the age of 25 actually enjoying listening to that much complaining. If I'd want that, I'd just start showing up late for work.
---
I spent 2 hours trying to log in and create a character over and over. I couldn't. Yet while I kept trying  I watched streams and had a laugh at the race. And then while constantly trying over and over, I finally made it in at the end when they summoned patchwerk etc. I got nothing done, but it was fun and throughout the whole thing I enjoyed my time because I was contributing to the stress test by just failing to log in and then getting 10 mins to just soak in the world.
---
I can't imagine spending 2-3 hours seething and hating everyone around me because of that experience. That sounds like I'd have a lot of issues in real life that I should sort out instead of trying to put hours of time into a 14 year old game.
---
It's crazy watching people try and make money from their jobs. Where do these guys get off am I right?
---
That's legit the first epic my buddy and I had drop for us. I was a rogue and he was a warrior. Got it from the ogres in alterac mountains. Sold that thing real quick in December 04.
---
Fucking christ OP, I'm dying! LMAO
---
This is fucking gold.
---
[Here](https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo?t=296) is the video where Omar says you'll be competing against an entire realm's worth of characters. Nothing they say here give any indication that they're going to tone this down.
---
I'm kinda gleaming. They only invited so many people, not all who will play, and it was still too many. They received valuable data for the next 3 months. I'm sure there will be another test, but this is a good thing. It tells me the interest is there.
---
I know. I was around from launch -&gt; Cata. I just want to be as far from those guys as possible.
---
Damn I‚Äôm getting excited already
---
Tbh he has been competing pretty fairly for it. At least the attempts that I've seen.
---
That's why I specified "classic" wow (which is the name of their new product, as opposed to just "wow" or "vanilla" or "retail" or whatever you want to call what it was back then).  It's a silly discussion because you could have world first anything.  World first "me" hitting 60!  Whatever, man.  If you want to rain on everyone's parade that's on you.  We're all over here having fun with it.
---
Am I the only person that doesn‚Äôt care or watch game streamers?
---
You can't possibly be so sheltered that you think *this* is the MOST toxic community on the internet...
---
None of you seem to even comprehend what a stress test is..
---
What makes me laugh is the people who are angry that some streamers get priority. OF COURSE certain streamers are getting priority. There are plenty of people who have been playing WoW Retail, discussing classic for months until the Beta. Now they got in and they‚Äôre playing the beta all day doing these fun activities.
---
It‚Äôs free advertising for Blizzard to get these big streamers in. It also puts them near the top for Twitch, and it gets others curious. The streamers may think there‚Äôs no bias, but we all know there‚Äôs a bias, and it‚Äôs for a good reason too.
---
This. I had no problem helping them with metrics on how their login and authentication servers would hold up, that's the point. But maybe if the email had just said "The main focus of this test is to stress the login and authentication servers, so even if you don't get in please keep trying! We need your help for this." then everyone's expectations would have been managed better. As everyone says that was the point right? Just a little more info or transparency would've done a world of diffusing I think. Still, I'm sure they got the metrics they wanted from people slamming the login servers with queries :)
---
I was part of the stress test last night, and gladly sacrificed my 97 minutes of queue time for the greater good.
---
That being said I'm hopeful that we'll have a smoother experience at launch, I obviously plan to start playing right away, but I'm not taking time off right away, figuring that we'll need the fervor to die down a bit.
---
Or automage (i think that was the name), it was literally a bot that required you to press 1 button over and over.
---
It would travel to a zone, conjure water, buff kill mobs, drink, basically if you had an autoclicker it was a full on bot.
---
Also the "waypoint follwer" addon, I don't remember the exact name, that would walk along a pre-set route to its destination, oh you died in brd? npnp, just release and press "follow back to instance" and afk while it ran for you.
---
When did i threaten to not play? I only said that the community was the biggest turn off for me.
---
Well done for proving me right i guess.
---
I think blizzard assumed that people understood what a stress test was.
---
A community doesn‚Äôt inevitably turn toxic- shitty people make it toxic. I‚Äôm in plenty of non-toxic online communities and they stay that way by kicking out the shitty people. Shitty people who think they‚Äôre allowed to say whatever they want online because nobody can physically dislocate their jaw over it, and the people who are too cowardly to put their foot down and not let people get away from it. Cut the toxic people out, physically remove them, let them cry ‚Äúcensorship‚Äù even though that‚Äôs not what censorship is and they‚Äôre not actually legally entitled to be a piece of shit, let them realize that there‚Äôs consequences for their bullshit when they‚Äôre stuck with only the other cut out toxic shits. Things are only how they are because people who think they‚Äôre so fucking clever being cynical all the time about everything let the dickweeds get out of control.
---
Walked right into that one, buddy.
---
Just contributing how I can for the beta test. Also, there are some examples of things that were bugs in vanilla that they are recreating in classic. If this is one of those things then this is huge!
---
Okay, to the few people who don't understand. Let's assume RandomJoe shouts up in /1 Stormwind-City: OMG I HATE *Racist word here*. He wants a filter that, if *Racist word* pops up, it's auto-filtered and blocked.
---
At least that's what I got out of his question.
---
Descursive is/was bad, don't use it, too many variables to consider to make a proper priority list.
---
Pserver baby, eh? I can tell cause you have such a copycat opinion; I'll have you know I played ORGINILAL Vanilla WoW, and now you guys are just coming in here not even reading comments or replying, just coming in and vomiting your copycat opinions and rehashing old threads about whatever topic you saw someone else talking about.
---
No one is shaming anybody for anything other than rolling a dwarf priest. Ftfy
---
Sorry
---
It really helps with cooking, and I like the mp5 sagefish you can catch in places like wetlands and hillsbrad.  Also nice if you tend to be faster than friends stopping to get nodes.
---
Retail raids overall are getting better and better, few exceptions excluded I would say each expansion has improved the raid encounters alot. With a good raid group, retail is worth subbing for even if all you do is log to raid 1-5 times a week and ignore most of the other content. 
---
Problem is "that other content". Forced BS ap grind in form of island adventures, world quests etc. And un rewardng system overall. Bs loot system with rng on the level of some of the worst Korean mmo:s, because titanforging is the only way blizz can think they can keep cleared content "relevant" for longer. 
---
People hated WoD back in the day, but I take wod and the relaxing endgame over this bs retail any day. All you had to do was manage your garrison as much as you wanted and log for the raids. If you didnt wanna play alts or farm mounts &amp; tmog and only cared about mythic raids you could freely log in bit before raid, manage your garrison, raid and then log out until next raid. Nothing wrong with having spare time for other games instead of having to do some bs busywork for AP. 
---
I get the dailies, first win of the day, daily hero challenge etc. Thing games like dota, lol, fortnite and hs has, but there is no reason for subscription based game to have them. Create Content people want to do and logs in for on their own, don't force people that enjoy a specific part of the game and is willing to sub for that part alone (raids, m+, pvp...) into doing annoying busywork just so they would log in more often. 
---
This is coming from the pov of semi HC mythic raider with all cutting edges from last 3 expansions except crucible (my guild un subbed from bfa after jaina).
---
Yeah, priests are usually in such low quantity compared to very high demand so no matter the class they'll always fine a place in raid. 
---
Unless you're in a hardcore guild.
---
"But I've been subbed since humans vs orcs!!"
---
Interacting with the streamers who have been pushing for classic and helped show there was an appetite for it is a positive not a negative.
---
At least you guys are getting that real classic feel... lol
---
I'm just saying, if you go out grocery shopping, do you expect random shoppers to tell you to fuck off because they don't like the brand of salad dressing you're buying? Or you ask someone where the ketchup is, and they tell you that you're a fucking idiot, then walk away? But people are totally cool with it online.
---
I'm not saying it can be stopped. I'm just saying it's shitty behavior, and people generally don't like shitty behavior.
---
Not to mention, even if they don't break it (I *sincerely* hope they do break it) these addons can't port you anywhere.  They just automate the actual grouping up part to an extend, and they can only work between people that actually have it installed.
---
Can confirm. I remember that vividly.
---
I mean I feel like the only people going on about world firsts are Asmon's army of mindless mongs so he can feed his over overinflated ego.
---
in vanilla wow, Grand Marshalls were almost always hunter, because of multishot. Second in honor line was almost always a Warlock.
---
Humans are better than Dwarves in later progression as far as min/max goes
---
and Night Elves can at least do Shadowmeld + Mind Control to grief on PvP servers. Personally I'm going NE on Priest alt :)
---
you can just type r/madlad and it automatically links it to the same place fyi
---
Same! I even made it as far as char creation I was stoked! August cannot come fast enough.
---
im subscribed to a few classic wow streamers. i dont have anything against any streamer. what i said is what i personally believe is better for the subreddit as a whole because there are a vocal people on both sides who are the reason this ''toxicity'' exists in the first place
---
Most of r/wowservers doesn't even like r/wowservers though.
---
While i agree with almost everything you said. I do not agree that, "Classic will generate a good amount of revenue but WE fought for this and they are doing it for us."
---
Lets be clear here, Blizzard Activision funded creation of classic because people who looked into its profitability reported that it would be a smart business decision for them to undertake. They are not doing this out of the kindness of their hearts and because we asked.
---
Cmon I'm not gonna share my secrets mate
---
But em yeah, definitely go explore it works great /s
---
Truth.
---
Today's gaming community is much more toxic than 10-15 years ago. Prove me wrong.
---
Its because everything is in the right proportions, making the drawing feels like a weird ass filter instead of just a drawing. 
---
If I went and tried to draw this in paint, i'd almost immediately not draw anything to scale and that would ruin the effect.
---
OP does a great job of keeping everything the right size, including emulating some depth.
---
This all seems like personal issues.
---
Why wouldn't you want to roll the best looking priest race in the game?
---
I can just imagine you bumrushing a 90 year old with a walker who's on the way to the toilet.
---
"MOVE, BITCH! ME FIRST! YOU CAN HOLD IT, I CAN'T!"
---
LOL.
---
WoWHead is a comprehensive source of information so I imagine most, if not all, of your questions can be answered there.  For the more general questions like the ones you posted, those can be answered simply by playing the game and chatting with other people.
---
While it may seem overwhelming right now, keep in mind that everyone started with zero knowledge and learned the intricacies of the game as they explored Azeroth.  Try not to stress too much, it'll all come in time.
---
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs their age. I think they aren‚Äôt familiar with software development. 
---
Their expectations of a stress test are very misguided.
---
TukUI is already ported and ElvUI is being worked on now.
---
Did you expect anything other than downvotes?
---
Yeah, I liked it 100x better before Classic was a thing here. Now there are all these Kids here who have never played Classic. 
---
I mostly pissed at all the fucking Streamers who are the cause of this garbage. 
---
I have Beta Access but I'm not really having much fun. I wish they would invite more people and open up a Streamer-Free Server, preferably EU Only.
---
[Referring to this helpful graphic that was on the frontpage a little while ago](https://i.redd.it/xpz3z1ly1dy21.png).
---
Layering is going to be used to mitigate starting zones being unplayable in the first few weeks, and then phased out once zone populations stabalize.
---
Well iam with you with addons. But people already here said it doesnt hurt anyone. Back then in vanilla i saw it with my own eyes how people only had any clue what to do when a addon told them what to do each second of a raid. If the addon broke because of buggy patches or something whole raids got canceled. If something went wrong nobody had a clue what to do and a wipe followed. 
---
Same with stuff like healmeter. I was in 2-3 guilds that had 0 progression until i joined it and carried the whole raid together with a tank. Still guildleader nagged on me not having high enough numbers in my healmeter and being bad apparently. That went for a few weeks until i quit and at that moment the guilds progression went back to "we cant even get the first boss down in MC" or similar.
---
Seeing what happend in the past 24 hours i guess classic wow just wont do it for me. I just hope on german servers this will all be better.
---
Also i thinking about creating a guild myself so i can just not use addons for raids. I mean most bosses are not that hard. You just have to actually pay attention and all is fine.
---
Add-ons were always a part of the game. They aren't going anywhere, sorry. Since Classic will use the modern wow API, I don't think things like your rotation helper will work at all anyway. The only bad "addon" is raider.io (basically gearscore/skillscore) 
---
If you aren't a specific score on raider.io then you're shit out of luck for groups. Can't even build up your score to get there because people are even asking for crazy numbers for easy dungeons on modern wow. Think Mythic 10 raider.io scores required for a Mythic 3 or 4.  If that comes into classic then it will be horrible.
---
You play WoW at work?
---
I would have disagreed til I talked to some friends who do 60 dungeons on pservers, apparently it's like being a woman on Overwatch.  Mostly fine, but 10-20% chance an incel goes HAM on you for nothing.
---

Hahaha or alternativly "YOU GOT A DIAPER, I DON'T" üòÇ
---
This is ecactly what happened
---
yikes dude
---
I was just trying the "well if you want some movie recommendations then tell me about some movies/ genres you like" tactic.  Chill.
---
Can confirm said Matto isn't crazy, however love the matto fact you have supplied me
---
Wouldn't line of thinking mean that classicwow is worse than those subreddits you're talking about? I'm pretty sure that people not getting objectively has more negative impact on the world than whatever is discussed on this sub.
---
ElvUI is the real deal that pfUI is a copy of made for classic anyway.  It's visually the same (and/or can be made to be that way) and has even more functionality.
---
Oh yes. When there is downtime and no cases to work with, we all play games.
---
It will come i'm sure, anyway I guess wow just isn't for me. It was cool but not quite what I wanted in an MMORPG
---
I just want to play a bit of it to see how it runs, so I know if I want to put vacation time in or not. 
---
I really hope they do an open beta a month or two in advance, my career is rough to take proper vacation time in without significant planning.
---
Happe cake day :D
---
Your beta character is gonna be gone after the game launches. Same thing.
---
Sorry, I probably shouldn't post right when I wake up. lol
---
Are you fucking stupid?? What do you really think the whole purpose of a stress test is? Please, give us a laugh and tell us.
---
Yes. Badboy anti spam with crap filter or cleaner or something plugin.
---
Agreed... that would have been so lame lol. 
---
I think the devs for this game are so playful and chill and I love that! 
---
 They love interacting with their player base lol.
---
Thats a bold statement.
---
I was really bothered at first : "What ?! Some people are playing the game and I can't ?".  
---
I started watching a lot of Classic videos on youtube, reading everythread about it, waiting for blue posts, I even made an account on Twitch for the first time to watch people play the beta on the first day.
---
And then it hits me :
---
I don't wanna watch somebody play the game. And I don't wanna play the game only to restart again in 3 months.
---
I feel fine now. I know that some peoples are playing and having fun, but not me, that's not my time, and that's fine.
---
See ya at the end of august !
---
I'm sorry to tell you that ElRubius (Spain, 5th biggest youtuber in the world) plans to play WoW Classic. He has streams of around 10k viewers.
---
Seems like you didn't read what I said at all
---
Different playerbase I think. The low attention span, instant gratification crowd wont be able to coop with slow pace of classic, bfa caters to them still. I personally cant be bothered with bfa and im thrilled to get back to vanilla where things needed effort and purple items meant something
---
Yea but the memes are great
---
Yeah, but that's a fraction of what will happen at launch, and they need launch to go well. The stress test didn't fail, sure, but that's because it's purpose is actually *information* rather than *try to break it*.
---
Servers will be heavily populated but not like the stress test. Have to remember there will be plenty of servers and laying.
---
I think you will just have to accept the grinding of mobs in the starting area. It‚Äôs not gonna have lots of people the first week, not just day 1.
---
I wasn't saying we should speed up leveling, I was saying it should be rewarding.  A slower pace is a good tradeoff - if not necessary - for it to feel rewarding.
---
As you say the faster you go, the more it feels like an delaying tactic (to reaching cap) rather than a rewarding process in and of itself.
---
In other words I think we agree :)
---
I agree with the Hunter suggestion, since you can collect and befriend animals, feed and take care of them, that sort of thing.
---
Night Elf zones are also pretty chill violence-wise, if you read quests. Most quests have an environmentalist bent to them. In the starting zone you kill some boars and cats, but it's because their population has outgrown the area and threatening the ecosystem. You kill some imp things because they've been driven mad by poisonous plants. You kill some spiders to make antivenom and even save a guy, and you kill a giant spider because it's a danger to the population.
---
After that things open up and you can focus more on professions, exploring, etc.
---
I expected rationale conversation and discussion, instead of simply hitting the down-vote because you don't like the opinion of an outsider who wanted to make world of warcraft a better game for everyone.
---
lmao dude you've been bamboozled
---
aight. I'm not up to date on my addons at all, so I guess I'll just get that :D
---
I guess so.. probably a reason why I never sub, and I come back every few years after buying the expansion to see if anything has changed toward the type of game I wanted to play.
---
I mean if people really had the urge to play vanilla wow, can‚Äôt they just play on private servers? It‚Äôs not like the beta will matter as everything will get wiped before release anyways.
---
Hey man you seem like you know what you're doing. So when I tank these five man's getting my pre raid bis, do i go full fury dps or do I go fury/prot for the mitigation from the first three tiers of prot, then go full prot for like MC and the raid after it, then I can be full time fury prot? 
---
Sorry I'm learning this and I'm trying to be a God tier tank at 60, I'm even practicing on a instant 60 private server
---
You might as well stop considering it. It's a dumb meme with literally no basis in reality
---
Okay then good luck with your Kulak...er... I mean "censorship". People are allowed to say and think whatever they want and if you dislocate their jaw, that actually lands you in prison. Turns out that you're also to blame for letting words cause you to assault people. People are allowed to do whatever they want until it infringes on the rights of others. Sorry you can't understand this.
---
Sounds like blizzard trusted people to stay in the area and the lie detector determined that was a lie lol
---
If I can squeeze the time in after work today I'll post them here for you.
---
Unsung hero tester right here!
---
Men i just hope i can find more people like you and OP when wow goes live. I will have to play on german servers though :/ and there it can become problem just way on other side of the fence.
---
Like if your making a stupid mistake people get really pissed off and there is rarely tollerance for that stuff. We had a very successfull guild on rexxar server back then whiches rule was 1 mistake ok second mistake guildkick. And that happen OFTEN.
---
Here's what idiots like you don't understand. Blizzard have made their decisions about the game. End of. There is nothing to discuss.
---
You're talking about a bunch of teenagers who know nothing and think the world owes them something. I think that Blizzard really should have set this up in their e-mail and warned people this would happen so people wouldn't be surprised since they are young and inexperienced. Like hey, this is a stress test so you might not get in, but what you're doing is helping us get the game out quicker and figuring out the kinks. Kthanx.
---
Remember, we are talking about kids who weren't even born when WoW vanilla was out. They don't know things.
---
A part of me wishes they would just whipe out everything and start over again with a new mmo taking all the lesson's they learnt from wow, but I think they didn't learn any lessons because all the core problems I have with the game will still exist regardless if it's Live or Classic.
---
I‚Äôm rolling night elf priest because they get cool tiger mounts and can turn invisible. Sue me.
---
I'm sure with same prio SOME of the streamers would have still gotten in, and then you could've watched those streamers. It's just a stress test though, no biggie as long as everyone has same prio at launch
---
retail is shit, but we can be even shittier than retail.
---
dude, are u okay?
---
Method Josh makes up for that.
---
&gt; Would doing so be against the philosophy of Classic WoW?
---
You will find for sure one. Cant tell you of course if they will be succesfull or not. I had a guild back then that ONLY played and raided for 2 hours sat and sun and still made it through naxx in wotlk.
---
\- An opinion can be an argument. I'm not trying to give true or false statements, as there are none. I'm just giving arguments as to why I think multiboxing is shit.
---
\- Even though he might not be oneshotting people with 10 shamans, he's still walking with 3 toons through STV. Other people competing for mobs can't kill him because hes multiboxing. Also he can kill other competition while multiboxing, hence it is a problem. Paying Blizzard for his toons doesn't mean it isn't a burden.
---
\- Yes, I do think multiboxers are losers for the reasons I stated. Nothing to do with me being 'an insecure douchebag'. I don't see the relation between the two. I hope OP is not too offended by it xx
---
Maybe, but that's just a trainer. They don't gain any abilities from class quests.
---
Maybe we could just not call it a cool idea since it‚Äôs not.
---
Same here. I was just shooting the shit with friends on Discord while spamming to get in, they didn't even have the beta invite. I got in after around 2 hours. Was it frustrating? Maybe a bit at times, but I was able to provide data to Blizzard's stress test and I'm happy to do it.
---
Great shot!
---
Humanity is toxic.
---
It'd be out of place and a stepping stone to more changes. I wish people would stop bringing this up.
---
"I don't expect people to change but I can't ignore people who talk shit."
---
That's your fucking problem. You are in for a stressful existence. You're bitching about something you can't change and don't expect to change. Makes total sense.
---
This is some next level thinking right here. To be so against add-ons and so in favor of sharding is BAFFLING and really just shows that Classic is not for you. You really have no idea why Classic is going to be so successful. Not trying to be a jerk... but no. Also, Guild Wars 2 already exists. It has EVERYTHING you could ever want based on this post. If you aren't already playing GW2, you need to stop what you're doing and go play GW2. You will be incredibly happy. With that said:  
---
1. You're actually just concerned about the community. Find better friends!
---
2. Absolutely not. This point entirely invalidates any opinion you could have about Classic. This idea makes Classic WoW pointless. And it already mostly exists in retail. Want to kill Classic before it launches, do this.
---
3. Retail and Classic are so vastly different that this is a non-issue. There are obviously going to be some outliers, but the great majority of people who love Retail will not enjoy Classic and vice versa. Further, they simply cannot "fix the live version of the game" because the things that made Classic so good (besides having strong communities - the exact opposite of what you're asking for in #2) are no flying, no lfr, no lfg, hard and long dungeons, 40-man raids, unique classes (which inherently means poor class balance) ... you cannot remove these things after they are implemented. Just look how pissed people were about delaying flying.
---
4. This makes no sense. You can still do everything in past expansion. You can level a character from 1 through all of the old content. In fact, unless you boost, you have to. I don't even know how they would implement what you are suggesting... AI?
---
Seriously. Go play GW2 (and I don't mean this to be mean -- GW2 is a phenomenal game). I think you will like it.
---
Good shit, I wanna turn up for every raid so I worried a bit but that‚Äôs awesome
---
I'm right there with you, I think I'll be leveling a Druid first then going Shaman.
---
I didn't know that you could do more than just autorun with that. I guess the guy who said that /runscript() could create ponies out of thin air wasn't lying.
---
Well even blizzard is open to feedback, and willing to make changes based on what the community has to say, but the problem is the people who get their voice heard are not people like me but instead streamers and youtubers who are nostalgia addicts that want to go back to their childhood when they lived at home and played wow, instead of developing a game that is good by 2019 standards and will evolve moving forward.
---
I dont think you know what shilling is
---
Your post just made me realize this sub needs a Ragnaros bot!
---
Shut up Mr krabs
---
I suggest playing without guides. And ask your fellow players for help as you go. As we did when WoW first launched.  We didn't have any guidance other then the official wow guide box. Oh and get to thott bot. Enjoy your lack of knowledge and unlock the fun of classic wow.
---
False, smaller gnomes can fit through some small openings in fences etc = faster leveling = game experienced = ruined = cancelled sub.
---
Me and my guild would raid (on live in the 3 most recent expansions) from 19:00 to 23:00 2 days a week.
---
22:30 to 23:00 isn't anywhere near close enough to progress through a raid. You might kill 2 maybe 3 bosses if the group has them on farm, but you won't ever get them on farm if you only raid 30 minutes. Even if you do those 30 minutes every day, it would still not let you progress as quickly as having a dedicated raid-night that's about 3 to 4 hours.
---
I played on a newer CRT through tbc
---
It's good that we have at least someone fighting for gamers rights. We truly are the oppressed class
---
Surprise surprise, streamers bring in a lot of attention and a lot of players, Blizzard wants more players to play their game, they would be stupid if they didn't give streamers priority
---
*Elemental Combat*
---
How did you not know that she was going crazy? lol
---
I find dr. disrepect intolerable and impossibe to watch more than 10-20 seconds.. that character was made for 8 year olds. Asmongold is just slightly sarcastic, otherwise, he's himself. 
---
But hey, if you enjoy, more power to you.
---
Here‚Äôs the thing , it is what it is 
---
You can always just play other games
---
It's not low attention span or instant gratification, it's that those players have full time jobs or family and just want to easily play a game at their own pace but still remain relevant to the core group of hardcore players instead of getting left behind. Which if they fixed the game issue I mentioned this wouldn't even be an issue.
---
Something I've noticed that for pretty much all races/classes the crit and dodge chance at level 1 with no weaponskill or defense was different on the beta compared to private servers. Also ranged AP and maximum mana seem to be calculated differently than private servers do it at least at lower levels.
---
I don't know which one does it right. It's just a difference I've spotted.
---
Streamers are the only way people can see classic. That seems silly to do on a wow classic subreddit.
---
Just no. The community doesn't want Blizzard to listen to you because 95% of people want #nochanges. You want changes, so go away and play something else.
---
When you have no personality its usually a good call to follow the crowd. Stick to cool buzz words like "salty" and never try to form an opinion of your own, that could risk you be excommunicated.
---
From your friends at twitch chat.
---
Just don‚Äôt play on a ‚Äústreamer server‚Äù and I doubt you‚Äôll see much of it
---
Believe me it was the most amazing guild i ever had. We made our own tacticts and whatnot. I had one of the most amazing moments in wow with them. For example we died to Heigan over and over because of the dance until i did it with only the tank when everyone was dead. ( like give them a break all had kids i and the tank were the only singles and actually still had attention span and were awake at haigan )
---
Like 38 people went on their knees before us after he was dead.
---
They're not the problem, it's their community. Trust me, streamers just want to play the game normally, like you and me. And it's kinda sad when their community doesn't respect that. Just see asmon playing eso and you'll see how fast he got tired of those spergs just following him around.
---
This isn't even a leap in logic, it's a complete non sequitor, that comparison just came out of nowhere
---
Also thank you for putting up the link!
---
It's the question about authenticity versus experience.
---
Everyone being better, less clueless, having better internet/pc/guides etc. completely changes the vanilla experience yes. Ragnaros will be killed within 2 weeks, nefarian/cthun/Kt will be slain 2-6 hours after release etc. People will know how to do things.
---
What you are arguing for is trying to recreate the experience that is vanilla, the difficulty, the challenge, so that modern players feel clueless and can enjoy the difficulty that comes from that.
---
I'm afraid blizzard is going for authenticity not experience, so you are out of luck
---
A decision being made has nothing to do with whether or not it can be discussed.
---
GM's could "fly" from day 1 if I'm not mistaken. There are a few videos on what  GM account is and how it works.
---
Priest is the clear fir for your criteria.
---
Probably the 3rd best solo class (behind Lock and Hunter), and the 2nd best class at finding a group (behind prot Warrior).
---
Everyone saying mage has never tried to find a group as DPS in vanilla at 60... everyone needs healer/tank.
---
Indeed. I definitely belong to the latter half and it definitely is quite a volatile mix. I don't watch streamers and don't have any care to, but it seems to be a very heated subject for people here. I'll be on the EU servers so it's unlikely they'll affect my experience.
---
I would laugh. I know why I want that ketchup. I don't care if someone else thinks I'm dumb. I don't know them. They don't know me. I would be amazed if anything. Mustard is better though to be fair. I might even ask them why. Maybe they have a point.
---
Why do you think I didn't?
---
My post had plenty of replies and 90% of them were wholesome :/
---
Addons were always a part of the vanilla game.  Yes progressive guilds required you to use some addons but nothing required you to raid with them or join them.  Nothing wrong with that.
---
The goal to Classic is to mimic vanilla wow as close as possible.  This includes all the great things it came with and even the terrible things.   This includes the overpopulation at launch and some server imbalance.  I do hope they offer server transfers if it gets out of hand.
---
Not sure about (4) because currently there is not expansion for classic, though they said they might be up for it.  Maybe you would like a good single player RPG instead.   I def would recommend Witcher 3.  It will be very very story driven with an open world.
---
And that 40 macros thing will be exactly what addon makers would do if the current workaround stops working (plus a fancy UI)
---
They have a vested interest in Streamers getting in because they can showcase the game to a large part of the community and increase the amount of feedback they can gain.
---
I don't understand why some people take such offense on this. It is ultimately a meaningless beta that will get reset. I didn't get in and that is fine, I'll just wait until it is out. Thanks to the fact that there are Streamers in it, however, I can see what is coming and how things are looking.
---
Streamers get some level of priority because there is a benefit and a use from having them in, but the amount of streamers in comparison to the coommon players is so small that is negligible. There is a legitimate reason for Blizzard to want some streamers in and I can't understand why some people are so upset that a handful people out of thousands got "priority".
---
That‚Äôs hilarious lol! 
---
Streamers push the boundaries, and devs throw hoggers down. Beware the wrath of the dev gods haha! 
---
Sounds like a blast honestly lol. I wish I was there to be a part of it.
---
That suffices :)
---
That's not what this is though, so why are you still bitching?
---
I always liked a Warcraft universe, and were folowing WoW since launch, but i never saw a dark portal like it was originaly. I folowed this game since launch of classic because there was always an article about it in a journal i used to read. In my head the dark portal was a very mysterious place, but i was able to see it only when woltk launched. So i am really happy that i finally managed to get to this location and take a look on it from a different timeline. Thank you very much Blizzard for bringing back an old world!
---
I‚Äôm u/aunitofcancer 
---
Baited. Switched.
---
It was either rebuild real id functionality to work on 1.12 or use the modern client. They didn't pick it to modernize Classic. It was a technical limitation..
---
My bad worded it badly! I meant start at anywhere between 22:30 to 23:00 it can finish at any time!!
---
Although your points are valid, I think people were hoping that the stress test would involve getting to actually create a character and get to level 5 and not just test the login, queue, disconnect, and stuck at character creation screen systems.  Not that I condone the reeeeeeee anymore than having to point out the obvious like this.
---
Then play Retail, it has loads of gear resets and welfare epics for you
---
I mean, i just hope all the streamers put out what realms they are going to ahead of time so we can avoid them. The rest, i am good with.
---
&gt; addons will once again ruin world of warcraft, including classic! You may not be using Addons currently in the beta, but it will soon become a requirement by clans and raiding groups 
---
Most raiding groups are only going to need you to have are a treat meter, dbm (if your not familiar with the boss), and a decurse/healing addon. Everything else is generally personal preference, I am not going to try and ruin personal QoL improvements for other people that i'll never see or notice...
---
&gt; \*\* Solution : Blizzard to make servers behind the scenes, you simply select region, and it switches you between servers based on alliance to horde ratio, done even by phasing without having the user log off 
---
You talk about addons ruining classic, when the biggest praise the game gets on this sub from beta players is generally, 'OMG I saw the same guy a few times in a week of leveling, had a few conversations, saw him in different zones/instances, wpvped a little when he saw you get ganked' ect. I don't just want to see a lot of random players I want to see my community, correct me if I am wrong crowd, but that seems more important to the classic community.
---
&gt; Classic just brings out some of the issues that Live has, and is in my opinion addressing these problems the wrong way. Instead of fixing the live version of the game to match what made classic so good, they are again splitting their playerbase. 
---
This isnt a "fix" they are revitalizing an old game, the way it was. Think of it as a completly different title, its basically true.
---
&gt; This was one of the biggest problems I had with world of warcraft, the fact I would log off and come back and not be able to continue the story where I left off, I would miss an entire expansion, because of the way quests and content was presented. I wish it was more linear.
---
This seemes like more a problem with the retail version not classic? Also if your looking for a linear game with easy pick up its seems like maybe something like a single player rpg would be better for you, MMOs are supposed to give the players a lot of choice and options to explore and experience.
---
I used to do my fishing outside the battlemaster in org. Caught Old Crafty that way!
---
**triggered**
---
I did not notice this back then. Warrior then Rogue to Naxx (same guild, different faction/server). Got both to rank 10 along with raiding, and honestly felt pretty boss on both (due to being so well geared perhaps).
---
Rogues are definitely not bad at any stage of vanilla I've experienced. What I haven't seen is a server full of T3 peeps,
---
&gt; The number one thing I'm worried about with layering in vanilla is the chance that you're somewhere in the world and your instance doesn't see the spontaneously occuring community event at that location. 
---
Do you worry that you're missing out on spontaneously occurring events on other realms or even in other zones?
---
I know I hate almost every change they've made over the years, but I hate it.
---
So what are the specs? curious how old of a machine we can use.
---
That would be better but I doubt anyone would take part, unless you find a group of people who work late and get up late.
---
I actually couldn‚Äôt get in even with the stress test beta invite. I kept getting an error that my account could not be found. Double checked everything and there‚Äôs no reason it shouldn‚Äôt have worked. Anyone else have this issue?
---
They actually made leveling slower with the scaling update recently and everyone hated it, including me. The thing is if theres no reward for leveling to any level aside from max it will always feel like a chore. If you make that slower, it's just going to bore the hell out of your players. I couldnt even get my alt to 120 because i was so bored from spamming dungeons and twoshotting mobs. The gameplay is fast paced but you still repeat the same step a million times until you hit 120.
---
I agree with what others said, the game has been focused on end game for years now and i dont see any way to fix the leveling experience unless they completely revamp the game and make lower levels impactful. I strongly doubt its worth spending resources into that.
---
This sub has been a whirlpool of cringe lately.
---
Good god.
---
I remember reading that they're open to the idea somewhere before.
---
You can't in classic well as a green/blue could be bis in classic where the bis in retail is just the obvious peice the made to be the best for that slot.
---
So I don't disagree with most of what you're saying except where you lost me:
---
&gt; Sometimes it seems people forget they are doing this for US.
---
This is the mistake people keep making when it comes to games companies, especially megacorps like Acti-Blizz. 
---
You don't have any friends at activision blizzard. They aren't your pals. They have never done anything as a favor, or out of generosity towards the fans. They do what they do to make money. Too many people forget this simple fact and then get outraged when these companies make a bad move.
---
Classic isn't a favor. WoW is dying. They're bringing classic back to get more subs and bring people back. It's fine to be excited about it, but please don't go around telling people Blizzard has our best interests at heart and is doing things for the fans.
---
Seems a little high but you probably got lucky. If you end up with 4 bags, then you know you have a problem
---
Gamers are generally entitled people.
---
I dont enjoy random. If I dont get picked, i at least want to watch my favorite streamer play it.
---
That's....... That's a thing?!
---
The rotation helper and the quest waypoint dotted line, were all things I used back when the Live game was still "classic"  and i'm sure raider.io and all of that will still be a thing. The fact that they think classic is going to solve any of the problems with wow, and people saying they want #nochanges won't fix anything. Addons are so complex now they will probably come up with even more crazy ones than what existed back then.
---
And nigth elves! And what the heck is up with the size difference between male and female darkspear?
---
Trick question! Goblins weren't playable until Cataclysm.
---
The new combat text makes white hits much less pronounced but they are a much bigger part of your damage in vanilla and should be more visible.
---
Didn't they adjust the height so gnomes don't have to swim through certain shallow water areas that other races just trot on through?
---
Its funny because part of a toxic community is division and name calling like this.
---
Welcome to Vanilla sweetie.
---
This is the reason retail fell to shit, you had more of these people on the forums which caused imo blizzard to think the majority of the playerbase felt like it was the general opinion
---
There always seems to be at least one late night guild per server. Personally I expect to see more in classic with more returning players having kids and jobs now that make them unable to raid as early as before.
---
" I've had my account since 1876" - Actually since 1875\* extremely early alpha. So.. where's my invite?!?
---
Aww, too grown up for twitch chat?
---
Agree
---
1. Sounds like a personal problem. Just don't use add-ons. I don't use most of the ones you describe, I use ones that fix things I find particularly annoying about the standard UI, or help with my personal mental/physical issues.  Thinking Blizz should ban add-ons because YOU don't like them is like insisting that the country outlaw drinking because you can't drink responsibly. (Note: we tried that. It was a bad idea).  
---
2. Nope. People are already unhappy about sharding making the entire world full of random PCs they will never see again. This would be the same, only more so.  Just make it one big server like EVE does.
---
3.  Okay, and?  It's a whole different game. It probably will split the playerbase, or at least give the "gogogogogo" types something to do between major patches on retail.
---
4. I kind of agree with this; I'd like my characters to be able to progress through time and storyline in a chronologically linear fashion, instead of this massive timey-wimey ball we get handed post-Cata. That includes allowing characters in the "present day" (current expansion) see the vanilla zones as they are now, not eternally frozen in their Cata state. (As it is, I'll be playing Classic just to see the pre-Cata world).
---
Hence the ud
---
Welcome! Stick around and ask any questions you have. It's rare to have complete noobs. 
---
Some unsolicited advice, a good beginner class would be priest. Very durable, versatile, and good power level in all aspects of the game. And the DPS rotation while leveling is straightforward and fun.
---
"dude lmfao why won't you just let people walk all over you :)"
---
The smaller the gnome, the further the punt.
---
Fair point, but wouldn't that exclude them from "in the game"?
---
I can‚Äôt wait until we can stress test the ‚Äúplaying a character ‚Äú system
---
Pointing out bullshit is not being triggered. It's telling that that's the only response you could muster, though.
---
Gods be good
---
Here's what you clearly don't understand. Blizzard are not bringing back Classic to "fix" or "solve" WoW. They are bringing it back because the community begged them to.
---
&gt;Everything felt different, and if you change the stats of vanilla they will feel different as well.
---
Shitters like you wouldn't even notice. You'd be too busy wiping either way.
---
Benedictus was the priest in sw cathedral
---
They are all lore names 
---
Some more obscure than others
---
A lot came here. No wonder.
---
I remember making more than a few gold this way when I hit 20 on my starter account back when I first started playing.
---
I can see that you think that from your previous comment, so no need to repeat that if you don't have to add anything else.
---
My experience on here has mostly been other people relentlessly shitting on everything private servers for no reason, when in reality every single one of us should be thankful for the movement the private server scene was the catalyst to.
---
Human priest &gt; Dwarf priest. More spirit.
---
Night Elf priests are shit tho.
---
Resubed with gold and got a stress test invite.
---
Really? What happened to all the other MMORPGs I play, let alone the ones I've heard about? Were they all cancelled last night?
---
You lower shadow settings to minimum and they go to blog form
---
2. 3. and 4. were all there like on the demo in vanilla. Most people just forgot how awful it was.
---
I see, I typically just punt them lol
---
Spoiler alert if you actually got in, you would just face overcamped kobolds or boars and not be able to complete the quest.
---
If it makes anyone feel better I'm not a streamer and started my account in 2004 and I did get a beta invite.
---
It's no coincidence that as subs to this subreddit skyrocketed, the level of toxicity also skyrocketed.  
---
I agree with you here and I'm not sure how all these people are missing why streamers get access.  It's like complaining that IGN or other game reviewers get early access to a game.  That is literally their job. Their job is to play your game on stream, build hype, answer questions, get people excited about the game.  They 100% should get access.  
---
It's not like Blizz is paying Non-WoW streamers to play WoW, all it costs is a beta key.
---
Gnome master race.
---
It's amazing how entitled you are. You seriously think anyone cares about your problems?
---
The gain is that you don't have high res character models in a world of much lower res armor, enemy mobs, mounts, building assets etc. They talked about this previously and having the new models would make everything else look much worse by comparison. Having a consistent world is better I think.
---
Mine too
---
But even if I had access I'd never level to 60 on beta only to do it again but I'm enjoying streaming it which I never ever did pre classic beta came out and I'm enjoying it a tons
---
I never said it would?
---
Have you looked at anything related to Game of Thrones lately?
---
I do agree that making leveling slower without fixing the rest is not the correct thing to do, but i was basically saying that slower leveling is one of the things that, combined with the rest of factors, make leveling feel much better.
---
Taking a no risk/no reward leveling process devoid of any interesting content or progression and making it slower won't help anyone, but if you make a more challenging and rewarding leveling process you can help it feel more rewarding and get people to care more about what they are doing if you slow things down a notch.
---
Basically i don't think we disagree, we all know changing one single thing won't make the whole process any better as it has changed too much, and as you say would need basically a revamp.
---
Haven't had much hype for Classic recently, but this is pretty fucking cool.
---
So for the first phase of 5 mans, it really is preference and is sort of a personal thing on whether or not you really feel like you need the prot talents to survive or if you'll be okay without them. Early on they help a LOT with surviving and you can still do stuff in the world with 30 points in Arms/Fury and the rest in prot, but it will definitely cut into your ability to world PvP and grind mobs a bit. So if you're playing on a PvE server over a PvP server this might be preferable, but either way 30+ point Fury/Arms with the rest in Prot is totally fine and will make the tanking easier. 
---
Full Arms or Fury is basically "optimal" if you CAN handle the damage in dungeons and it won't screw with you at all, because it's the smoother farming/pvp'ing outside of dungeons, but you can still get a lot done in the world with 30 arms/21 prot or 30 fury/21 prot, or some weird tri-spec with 15+ points in prot.
---
I've usually gone Arms/Prot until MC week (30 Fury/21Prot is basically as good just slightly different), switched to prot for MC/BWL/maybe ZG if I'm actually going to be a main tank, and then Fury Tanked once I got some AQ gear (you can switch in ZG and a lot of people do, i've just gotten stuck as full prot for my guild before lol) and not had any major issues. I did one server where I played with a healer I trust a lot and went Fury/Arms for our starting 5-man grind and that was very solid too, so also worth considering if you have a healerfriend you trust
---
There's nothing wrong with doing your 5-mans as 30+ point Prot either, it's really smooth inside dungies it just sorta makes the out-of-dungeon parts a lot harder, but if you can save your respec costs for that point in the game, you can swap 3-4 times before raid without really paying much.
---
Sorry I always end up taking too many words to explain this stuff but yeah I hope that helps, if I missed anything let me know because I truly enjoy rambling about Warrior shit
---
You think they do, but they don't.
---
Wetlands is extremely overrated. It's ugly and has zero memorable quests.
---
That‚Äôs my plan. I don‚Äôt mind streamer I just think its weird to use there odd terms on wow. When some one does something cool I don‚Äôt say upvote.
---
You won't see the classic relms on BFA separate relm lists separate installs. They are probably just new relms for EU.
---
Matto: wait for me guys!
---
t. white knight
---
They almost certainly will
---
I've been in the beta for a lot of games, Asheron's Call, Anarchy Online, Star Wars Galaxies, and original Wow.  I'm over all that now and am happy waiting for launch day.  I've leveled every character to 60 or more, except a warrior, in classic or or pservers.  I've seen it all, multiple times, I don't need to be in another beta to see it all again.
---
Am I the only one looking forward to this sub hitting 1mil and simultaneously watching r/wow trickle down to maybe 100k subs?
---
Seriously? Have some class.
---
I‚Äôm not saying only streamers got in, I‚Äôm saying 100% of streamers got in and 50% of everyone else. In a normal test, we would expect to see it 50/50. Not 100/50. That indicates a bias.
---
At a certain point, the server hardware itself becomes taxed to the point of not being able to handle additional incoming connections. It literally can't queue any more.
---
The point of the stress test is to find that point, so they can set reasonable limits to prevent hard crashes and errors from happening, and figure out how to set up their auto-scaling groups to allow for graceful failover.
---
I've played a lot at the start of BfA but it feels more like a hack'n slash looter game (see Diablo 3 now) with no real soul opposed to a real social game where everybody need each other to succeed in almost any way (not sure if I'm clear).
---
I agree but that doesn't make some points invalid. For one, beta invites shouldn't be completely randomized. People who legitimately played WoW back in the vanilla time frame, as they can tell from your account, *should* be prioritized. It doesn't make sense to have just as many people who only started playing in a later expansion - they have no comparison to make.
---
So he's on Chatturbate now ... that's not a though I needed.
---
&gt;I never sub
---
But you want changes that nobody else wants?
---
Makes sense.
---
Pretty accurate damn mspaint of Asmongold, butI think the character he portrays in streams is a toxic and self admitted neckbeard, so I would say that.
---
Not sure I care either way. It‚Äôs not going to feel like the original classic launch as we all know where to go but hopefully everyone being stuck together breeds some community while we wait.
---
They created the monster, so it's just as much a them problem. It's the price they pay for being a celebrity to a bunch of kids.
---
my man thank you!!! really hoping I don't have to buy a new computer
---
Maybe, but I am pretty happy right now.   
---
Maybe I am too good for this world.  
---
Or am I the baddie for being nice and all that?  
---
You can go and be toxic. But I don't like it and make a comment about it. You won't change and I vented. It's all good.
---
Glad you enjoyed it :)
---
Betting vanas-kos isnt getting updated. I really hope a kill on sight addon or similar emerges.
---
These long drawn out highly publicized betas are getting a bit ridiculous.
---
Nah telling people they are invited to play and then locking them out purposely while letting streamers in is a disgrace. I wouldn't have cared if I didnt get through the log in screen due to actual stress but being artificially locked out while others get priority without being told is fucking bullshit
---
If this is a list of realms its definitely incomplete given we know a few of the names already. Like Mankriks Wife.
---
Another server I would not be apart of that community at the time of an event or in the future. Layers are different because its the 'same server' fraction off into segments. Firstly the layers are supposed to be removed, so we will all meld together eventually. Secondly the layers are dynamic; so I could be in layer 1 today and layer 2 tomorrow which is apparent due to the ability to switch layers by joining a party. That means things are happening in the server/community that not everyone from that community can witness.
---
Stuff happening in another zone: that goes back to 
---
&gt;walking down the road and knowing that if anything is happening on your server at that location then you would be witness to it
---
You're right I'm not going to witness everything on a server no matter what, but at least in this case of simply being somewhere else there is a player decision as to why that happened. The goal imo would be to see everything your server sees given you're at that location. With layering that can't happen.
---
I don't even know what I expected clicking into this thread. This is just filled with delusional manchildren holy shit haha.
---
Blizzard hasn't opened a new server in over 10 years. There's no way it's new realms.
---
My your a tall one!
---
You can go ahead and ask them to be nicer in comments/replies, but making another post about "gosh does anyone else think this sub is bad" to go along with the other 5 "classicwow" bad posts on the first page just shits up the sub even more.
---
Not sure where you live, but everyone I knew back then couldn't afford buying a LCD. They were more common  towards the 2000's due to the price going down.
---
If sharding isn‚Äôt gone within 2-3 weeks Classic is dead for me!
---
Layering set to 3000 people per layer means roughly 1000 people per newbie zone (It'll be especially bad for Kalimdor if you're orc/troll since tauren and night elves aren't nearly as popular)
---
I've tried to raise the alarm on this since layering was announced.
---
Layering isn't for congestion. Layering is to avoid unscheduled server mergers by creating inevitable server mergers.   1000 level 1 humans in goldshire is exactly as unplayable as 3000 level 1 humans in goldshire.
---
aw i would play on broxigar
---
dm is appropriate in phase one but once dire maul comes out it needs to go.
---
[This subs reaction reminds me of the angry German kid smashing his keyboard.](https://tenor.com/view/angry-german-kid-agk-gif-5430908) I wonder how many keyboards died last night because of this community.
---
Well im playing since 2011 on private servers and everytime the server has problem with chinese players.
---
For sure, but I don't think we should hold it against them.
---
My friend tried it on a 2010 imac which was a no go
---
Wait...was this on retail? 
---
Isnt UBRS level 55ish to 60?
---
"If you don't agree with me and my favourite streamer you're a convenient stereotype to be dismissed"
---
Don‚Äôt know how anyone hasn‚Äôt said this but...
---
Can‚Äôt login? So far so good :)
---
Not to be like that but hes not the right guy to listen to when it comes to vanilla druid gameplay, hes still new to the game and is constantly wrong about things when hes talking on stream. Check out EBN on Youtube hes abit more experienced and his guides are easy to follow.
---
Oh wow, that's a long repressed memory.
---
I do. You create the problem, you get held responsible.
---
10/10
---
Even worse, blink has *half* the CD of untalented intercept.
---
These are the times we live in....
---
My boy ZG getting shafted even in comments about getting shafted.
---
Honestly, ‚ÄúBurthurt‚Äù I think is the most accurate description of the emotions being generated.
---
nailed it
---
Ion said they MIGHT do this just for fun, along with making C'thun impossible for the first week.
---
 I don't typically comment on these things but if you're going to slander  a community or smear everyone in a negative light, like these streamers  have and a few others I won't name, then they honestly deserve to be  called out. These people were regurgitating "popular" (shill) opinion  that was apart of the wall of no groups bizarre effort to gatekeep the  discussion about vanilla servers. They haven't just tried to sabotage  them but stop them from evening happening. Not because of any informed,  stance or actually valid opinion. Just 'because' to be dicks. Now  they're jumping on the bandwagon. They are parasites.
---
This just makes me sad. The narcissistic, entitled, idiotic behavior is just inexcusable. We need to all chip in for a sub therapist
---
Well, in comparison to Soda he is.
---
Was non elite dungeons damage ever verified?  This has 0 to do with bosses.  But I haven't seen a Blizzard post on it.
---
 I would say a person that  takes out all his savings and stays at home to take care of his sick  mother instead of pursuing an higher and more beneficial education is a  good person in my book.
---
maybe there are different ones for NA? i dont know just asking
---
Sounds like they found the average vanilla players.
---
I dont think this existed back then 
---
Blizz stated at one point that this isnt intended
---
Here at r/wow we prefer to use "cesspool"
---
You lost me at
---
&gt;will soon become a requirement by clans
---
That's Corsair K50, I bought mine in 2014, still using it today.
---
Truth is, r/ClassicWoW is like the normies version of r/wowservers, now THAT'S the most toxic subredit outthere
---
Awesome!
---
That‚Äôs so weird to me. His chat is always toxic, just not towards *him.* When they are, he gets really sensitive about it.
---
L I T E R A L L Y   U N P L A Y A B L E
---
‚ÄúHey man, uhhhhh... I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre supposed to be here‚Äù
---
Fair enough, but I can't really see the point in adding new realms to EU when so many low pop EU realms exist. Seems like a waste of time to me. My tin foil hat also points to the "incompatible" part in the realm list. Perhaps on Blizzard's end their BFA systems are picking up or 'recognising' the new Wow Classic realm hardware because of it's Legion-based infrastructure and listing them here because of that. I mean I'm no I.T guy so I can't really say but it certainly seems possible in my mind. The classic-y names also bode well, I mean, if they really were adding in new realms, surely they'd be based more off modern wow lore? Just a thought.
---
I got Jebaited lads
---
&gt;"that might be the most punchable face in the history of wow"
---
Most accurate PG friendly description I've heard yet.
---
I would be surprised if the vast number of comments are being generated by teenagers with no vanilla experience.  More likely the comments are generated by a bunch of us olds who‚Äôs fandom has gotten a bit out of control.
---
Definitely fell for this and got sad, until the cleavage and I roflmao‚Äôd for sure.
---
Well that‚Äôs because Blizzard cut the middleman and sells the gold now.
---
The number of people stuck at character creation... sheesh.  I hope name reservation allows character customization and not just reservation of a name so the early bird thing is worth more for our $7.50 that to make sure no one else gets XxLegolasxX before we do.
---
I was on at 730 AM EST this morning and I saw hardly any players in the Orc start zone so I did some quests. I was killing scorpids and then while in combat with one I was apparently phased into another layer that was much more populated. I hope this is tuned with the beta and stress tests because I want the layering to seamless if the system decided to push you into a different layer. I think it should only happen while moving between zones.
---
Yes
---
Why don't you create a better game? Be the change you wish to see.
---
So dont use addons? 
---
You can enjoy leveling without addons if that's what you enjoy. 
---
No one is forcing you to use them.
---
Confirm cans. Cans are used for canning confirmation.
---
battlemasters are a tbc thing, arent they?
---
This post getting traction will likely be more effective.
---
Good find btw. Gnomes should be tiny, Tauren should be huge. Should be an easy fix, hopefully it's done soon.
---
I would argue Ironforge is a lot easier to navigate than Stormwind.
---
Him being a good person or not has nothing to do with his online persona. There's a reason many of us feel that way about asmon
---
Because people don't want this sub to turn into r/wowclassiclivestreamfails
---
RIGHT!?
---
Why would anyone want to blow their load in beta anyway? I'm trying to stay as far away from WoW as I can for the next 3 months.
---
Join in, we might adopt you!
---
To phrase it generally, Fans of anything are generally entitled people.
---
Salt is a helluva seasoning
---
Lmao I remember when I upgraded my PC and got a flat screen monitor and saw the gryphons for the first time. Totally forgot that the CRT resolution cut them off.
---
She repossessed her body.
---
Yes. Yes it was a joke about Brexit.
---
Imagine never having to see twitch emotes spelled out in chat again
---
Much of the horde racials are BiS in pvp but Humans have the best racial for pve melee so I think that it will be equal.
---
No one is going to shun a priest. Ever. 
---
Even the hardcore progression guilds didn't do that in Vanilla. Especially when you have to fill 40 slots.
---
If you are someone that does happen to do that, then you need to get out more.
---
Sounds like this isn't the game for you in general. Good luck finding a game you enjoy.
---
When your level cap, quests start to give a lot more money as reward. Im assuming a couple people pooling their silver together can achieve that pretty fast.
---
tbh if it was real i'd be ok with it for beta
---
HGH
---
Why use the LFG/LFR addon when Classic have it inside the game?
---
just join the world chat, and say LFG Deadmines.
---
the addon is just a lazy way to find groups and ruins the experience of classic.
---
If you truly cared about the speed of finding groups etc. then you shouldn't be playing classic.
---
I didn't know they could stack shit that high
---
Stress Test and Beta are different servers. Mine shows 3 servers, last night there was one online, one locked, and one down.
---
There's a difference between sticking up for yourself and perpetuating hate through vengeance.
---
WOOOOO! Trust me once I get beta or the game releases I'm communicating with you. NA?
---
Honestly, when was the last time we saw this much hype around a wow release?
---
THis is actually a much more nuanced problem than it may seem. It appears while Gnomes were affected, height adjustments were made to a LOT of races.
---
If you happen to have beta access, try to make a report on any races you notice to be a different height than usual. The more reports with more information available, the less it seems like a comspiracy theory.
---
That‚Äôs exactly one of the reasons why gnomes were awesome in pvp. It‚Äôs like changing a racial imo. It‚Äôs an advantage the race has over others. Should stay the same, no changes ffs. You have all the horde pvp racial advantage honestly go fuck yourself
---
Haha, all good! Yeah NA, I'm on the stress test right now. It's packed with players.
---
Because their fans aren't all in beta. When live comes, the will show up in droves.
---
Lol!!!!!
---
Yep, troll post boys
---
A lot of people believe Druid are a hardest counter to Mages. It's just that seeing good Druids is super rare so it doesn't happen much.
---
It's a team four star quote lol
---
Smh, because that in every scenario personality does not equal views.
---
I dont have to imagine I can just come here.
---
Hope they ban add ons except damage meter. If people want to be lazy they should go play BFA.
---
I actually thought this was a troll post until I scrolled down further. You should seek some help man.
---
You say updoot?
---
‚ÄúThey are doing it for us‚Äù There doing it clearly for there own gain due to Live game being a complete failure. ‚ÄúYOu ThINk YoU WaNt iT but YoU dONt.‚Äù
---
Best comment.
---
I'm not really bothered about not being in the beta.
---
Would I love an invite? Sure, I would. But, I'm also not one of those people that feels entitled to an invite, like so many people on this thread seem to be. Yes, I played in Vanilla and I am excited to go back. I am content solely in the fact that we will be able to play classic.
---
This is almost as bad as the time when Orc shoulder armour turned miniscule... Those were dark dark days of endless fucking teasing...
---
Quiet easy to do a quick google search.
---
Link?  I just want the answer to the question tis all.
---
If it were the BFA team, NO. UNTHINKABLE. If it were the Wow Classic team? who knows?
---
Honestly at this point I really think people that got mad about streamers are really stupid.  
---
Why the fuck would you want to connect to the game to be limitated to lvl 5 while having HUGE lags ? Just connect on retazil and up lvl 10, you'll have the EXACT same experience without lags.  
---
And honestly, I've had a blast watching Asmongold at 3am even if I was fcking tired AF. Watching hiim react to all those boss spawn was fun.  
---
And seeing people like "Streamer having that much power to make GM spawn boss is terrifying" and that kind of bullshiit is so stupid as well. Dude, it's a stress test, they wanna test the servers stability in high amount. They wanted to spawn this mob that I can't recall the name in english, to see a big amount of people cast spells at the same time. Asmond asked for ragnaross, tell me one big reason why blizzard wouldn't do it ? It's a win/win situation. Asmon only gave them the idea. It wouldn't favorise Asmon in any kind of way, that would give them the result they wanted plus it gives show to everyone to enjoy and see.  
---
This is the kind of stuffs that you can only see in private servers, where GMs can actualy interact with the community because it's low. The GMs can just come randomly, pop a random boss and make a show for everyone to enjoy.  
---
Why the f\*ck are all those people mad ? Seriously ?
---
Next level of thinking that I think you can't even understand? 
---
I'm against addons because I want a streamlined experience that is controlled by Blizzard, I want everyone to have the same experience in terms of UI, map, questing, ect. 
---
I also didn't say I am in favor of Sharding. I said I wish that blizzard handled the way servers worked and did something to maintain an equal horde to alliance ratio in game. 
---
Guild wars 2, I didn't enjoy it, I don't like the the way the game looks, I don't like the lore or the character classes, I enjoy world of warcraft for the charachters, art style, lore, cosmetics, everything in world of warcraft looks like the ideal fantasy game to me, it's just missing alot of stuff that would bring that out more.  I didn't say anything about the community, in any of my issues you should read what I wrote, and stop pretending to understand why I wrote it.  Why do you think making the servers autobalanced on the fly 1:1 horde alliance kill classic or make wow pointless? I disagree, with you that people will want to play classic or those who love "retail" also it's not called retail anymore, it's because Classic is still the retail game, that term was used when classic was only available through unoffical servers. I really think you don't understand my second point at all, and you keep bringing it up and you really don't understand what I was saying and I give up trying to explain it to you, because the fact you call it retail wow makes me think you still don't know what words mean in the first place.  I will agree with you, that Wow community is defiantly "strong" but that has nothing to do with Classic, it will be the same communities from Live that will transition over to classic. The same players you are playing with now will be the same ones going to classic... don't fool yourself if you think you're traveling back in time and playing with the generation that doesn't play the game anymore because they are all retired and old will come back and make the communities great again, no it will be the same people you have problems with now. 
---
I hate that blizzard won't make changes to make the game better because they already offered something in the past that made it worse... like "flying" they could change the way flying works to make it better, but i guess that's to difficult so their is no compromise. just like how most people are... it's either classic or bust.. no compromise no changes, because they can't imagine how it could be changed to be better so they just want to go back to when they think it was better.
---
let me talk about 4 and "time limited content" so you can understand it, why I am sitting here explaining things to you makes no sense because it really doesn't change anything, but 
---
I wanted them to change the way quests work, to make questing linear, look up what that means. One example I can give is a single player game, you start the game and you do quests, I want them to delete all the quests in the game that currently exist, just delete everything, maybe I can make a custom server to show how I think world of warcraft could be better.
---
So all quests deleted, now I want blizzard to make all new quests starting from A to B.. all the quests are meaningfull story quests, that have full cutscenes, voice acting, no ability to skip dialog and that tell an epic story. When expanions come I want them to add to this story. I want them to make it so you can play these quests with other people who are on the same part of the quest as you, or with your friends or what not. If you stop at a certain point in the story you can come back and play where you left off. I want it so when you start the game you simply choose your race, then as you are doing your quests you are making choices and this is what chooses your "class" it's an epic story.. I think maybe I need to just go to an unoffical server and mod the game and make my own game using wow to show the mmo I wish WOW would be. 
---
anyway that's a glimpse of what I mean by 4.
---
You ain‚Äôt seen nothing yet. It‚Äôs going to be an absolute SHIT SHOW of crying over ridiculous shit come release. And I for one cannot wait to see it.
---
The complaints are pretty warranted. I don't think it makes much sense to quietly eat up whatever crap HBO/Blizzard shoves at us.
---
That sounds gross. Hopefully no one drank it.
---
Yeah and people playing back then should be well into their 20s or even 30s :(
---
there is no other games but maybe I can find an unoffical server that I can somehow mod to make wow into the game that I wanted it to be.
---
It's not forced. You can (and will) play on a non-streamer server.
---
I'm just arguing that said servers won't have its economy "destroyed" as you put it. No need for that ad-hominen at the end of your post, it's not proving any points.
---
REEEEEEEE
---
Your right you do not understand. But know this.. You helped Blizz yesterday with the stress test and thats all that should matter to you.
---
Totally forgot it was originally a different color :D
---
Yeah I looked into it (knew a gm from back In the day) and flying doesn't work, the command exists but it doesn't do anything. What does work however is turning on swimming outside of water, swimming has the same effect as flying but with swim anims, in other words your right, probably was vanilla
---
So would I. When I finally got to the character creation screen the first time, I winced at the ugliness of the models. Fortunately they are still better than EQ1's models, which I can't play anymore because I've been spoiled by better graphics in "more modern" games like EQ2, LOTRO, and retail WoW.
---
Who cares
---
Nice job!  
---
I really liked your Meeting Stone as well. :)
---
"Maybe I am too good for this world."
---
Good luck with that buddy. Tells me a lot about you actually. People like think that for a while. Until they find themselves doing something horrible one day while thinking it was right at the time.
---
yep thats pure BS
---
But how are they supposed to get their level 5 bis without being able to login to a 2 hour stress test, where characters are wiped shortly afterwards?!
---
Mid vanilla thing actually.
---
It has its flaws for sure. Well, you still need groups for endgame content. But it died down to literally no communication between the players
---
Wasn‚Äôt Broxigar what the PTR used to be called?
---
I would love to be at home playing the stress test but I have to work :(
---
Ikr? Even Blizzard staff seems more hyped than ever, lol.  
---
It's great :-)
---
Hi, /u/Apterygiformes
---
Is that you Justin Trudeau? What a trendy and hip answer!
---
&gt; The kids getting them knew they were meaningless.
---
Absolutely this. Participation trophies were 100% for the parents who couldn't handle that their kid wasn't special.
---
Typing lol and lmao repeatedly doesn't give the impression you're not a retard.
---
It still might
---
I hope not but too early for these circle jerk posts
---
Same as current.
---
&gt; swimming outside of water, 
---
I mean.. if you go back and actually read my comment, that's literally what I said man. Flying mounts didn't exist, but GM's can swim in air and teleport to any space, any height.
---
Nothing some code red Mountain Dew and an old sock can‚Äôt clean off!
---
When you summon a new demon, the old one gets stunned for like 10 sec. If you Abort the cast, you will just Keep your demon. Thats how it was on every private Server and most People, even the fullest classic veterans were absolutly sure thats how it was.
---
Turned out, it wasnt. Blizzard provided footage/patchnotes of the demon actually disappearing the Moment you start a new summon.
---
People were hella alot confused and thought Blizzard fucked up, but in the end they were right and everyone then was really suprised by that, although they were quite happy Blizzard goes so much into Detail, even about stuff like that.
---
And while alliance is doing raids horde waits in BG queue LOL
---
I'm pretty sure mob/player distance has always been capped at a relatively short distance.  Turning up view distance just allows you to see more of the world: mountains, trees, buildings, etc.
---
You will see, Wpvp happens natrually just due to how classic wow os set up. Especially between 2 raids competing for world bosses, or them trying to get to raid with world buffs and encountering another raid.
---
BfA has been at the top too
---
It worked out, it's my weekend. Only got to try and log in about 30 times yesterday, but got right in this morning. I'll be on a few hours, getting my fix lol. It's been years.
---
why would you put 2 points into imp starfire lol, just take 1 point and finish moonglow and the last pointo into nature's grasp, it's a must for PvP
---
Look, I get what you are saying, but to anyone with any sort of critical thinking skills would be able to understand what a stress test means. Yes, they could be slightly clearer. But it doesn't warrant this knee jerk reaction.
---
Your think considering the key selling point of vanilla is a game where you're not handed everything for free and you need to think critically while playing it would understand what a stress test is.
---
oh yeah, so you did, my bad
---
Neither. Combat swords with a slow mainhand and fast offhand is what you want.
---
Damn, your friend must know how to use the Hex Editor
---
I'm not gonna wait until a couple of days after launch, but I definitely don't care about the beta and did not resub to try and get in. I can't even describe how little I care about the stress test.
---
What horrible thing could I do? We all make mistakes.  
---
And thanks.
---
Well he did ask me how his lifestyle was less than rewarding
---
Where's the "slippery slope" argument that's always played on this sub?
---
Sure, playing favorites now and trolling during a stress test isn't a big deal, but what will they get over plebs when it releases? 
---
Priority queue? Faster GM ticket times? Name priority? Special cosmetics/items/titles? (I don't believe they'd do this but you never know)
---
When you consider that streamers get paid yo play, they record their work, and they are watched by countless others, it's really a no-brainer from Blizzards standpoint. You're getting a paid employee with a massive QA base who is guaranteed to play, all for FREE.
---
No matter how long you've been subbing, statistically, it's a better bet to get a streamer.
---
They feel joy. The joy of squeezing the life out of a horde member, that feeling of bliss as the light leaves their victims eyes. No sorrow, no pain, only happiness as their enemies beg for mercy. This is why the horde talk about gnomes as a joke, because if they talked about what gnomes truly are, they would never leave their filthy mud huts out of sheer terror.
---
I read that as "constant cluster fuck of **lightning** and was thinking "so Ele shamans are the thing in PvP DPS in classic?"
---
This is where I disagree with the "no changes" crowd. Sylvanas and named characters back then were from the same jank character creator we all use. I'd be happy for them to stick a toggle in the options to insert some new art assets in.
---
I mean, yeah. But at the same time there comes a time to just move on. Game of Thrones is over, there‚Äôs no going back to change it. There‚Äôs no next season. They aren‚Äôt going to reshoot seasons or episodes. If you were disappointed that‚Äôs fine, but let it go and move on with your life.
---
Yup!  I played on the Dell 2001 fp, or at lease I believe its the model, it looks exactly what I had.

Holy shit this is next level stupidity. Grow the fuck up.

I'm pretty sure gravity can kill you just fine. 
---
Getting pulled towards a black hole? At some point the difference between the pull on your feet and the pull on your head would be so large you'd get ripped apart.
---
Personally, I'm not entirely sure that they will raise the beta cap all the way to 60. I would like to see maybe 55-58 or something, but not the full 60. That way they can experience some of the late game 5mans and such, without having the full experience, leaving them hyped themselves for when they can finally reach it once classic is live, and being able to potentially cheese certain things or something. Idk. Either way I certainly agree that the devs are doing pretty much all the right things, and I think it's because this is as important and fun for them as it is for us. Nice to see them so engaged compared to the current standard for development teams (or so I feel).
---
Thats just reddit, someone asks a question and you see 20 comments but zero answers &gt;.&lt;
---
lets try to be nice
---
you could have left out the idiot part and still said the exact same thing
---
That doesn't make much sense to me... But then again, you are very small.
---
‚ÄúNazis were people too and deserve some love‚Äù what the fuck lol
---
#nochangesexceptfortheonesthatdontmatter
---
If nobody complained, we wouldn't have classic to begin with. If nobody complained, they wouldn't be trying to make it authentic. If nobody complained, the they'd just put in a cash shop in and milk people like you who whine about anybody that dares to criticizes King Blizzard.
---
I play retail every now and then because I love the lore but Classic gives me the Nostalgia of playing for the first time. I started playing in 9th grade on the last days of BC just before WotLK released. When I got in the stress test yesterday I got into a Hogger group and we beat him level 1. It was so great.
---
That's one thing i'm happy about not being on US servers. I feel the whole twitch "Lo0Ls" community hasn't spread too much internationally.
---
Not sure if it's a false memory but can remember seeing a message on Daggerspine EU that they needed to shutdown the server to feed the server hamsters.
---
You know very well that it's expected to at least be able to log in, create a character and enter the world. No one would've said anything if that would've been the case, but apparently the majority of people (me included) weren't even able to log in.
---
\#MakeGnomesShortAgain
---
Yes, yes I am!  
---
Do you see how I'm responding to you, sticking up for my point of view, while not being offensive or aggressive towards you?  Despite the fact you are being condescending, it's still possible to differ in opinions while still having positive interactions.
---
Benediction at level 5..?!? :P What kind of modded private server is this?
---
Too slow.
---
Aww thanks I appreciate that. I'll be posting a guide on how I made the stone at some point, if you ever want to make your own :)
---
Griefer guilds? We had one of those back in the day in DAOC. Fun times.
---
I honestly think it is a lot of people in their 20s starting statements with imagine and reee are more likely the source of toxicity. They'll throw off on people 3 years younger than them calling them fortnite babies and entitled like it makes them sound mature. So as it happens, being a jerk isn't age related.
---
Thank you it was fun to make!
---
This makes a lot of sense I agree
---
Only 1 person in my entire guild of 160+ from multiple geographical locations (even as far as Japan) was able to get past character creation, despite being ahead of streamers in queue and consistently trying for 4 hours.
---
I believe around the 5 hour mark someone got in. Stress tests are perfectly fine, that‚Äôs what we signed up for. What seemed to be intentional gating on certain accounts and IP addresses to prevent character creation is not what we signed up for.
---
Yikes! Imagine not imagining things, cringe! Yikers in the chat, boys. That's gonna be an OMEGA yikes from me, dawg.
---
The point being you're lecturing people self righteously. They're well and truely entitled to call these people out.
---
And music!
---
Naw never I couldn‚Äôt think of a good analogy
---
The gaming companies control the means of pixelation!
---
Dungeon.IO?? That shit ruins the spirit of classic and will turn people into elitist butt holes just like it does in retail.
---
Yes let's discuss the game none of us can play yet
---
It's so big.
---
giggle
---
The very brief moment where I watched him he just oozed all sorts of douchiness and pretension.  He dug a very deep hole, very fast, and I just don't care for what he has to say at this point.
---
Have  you seen dungeons?  It's practically Retail.  No need to improve there.
---
No, that shouldn't be expected during a stress test. The goal is literally to break the servers and see what kind of load it takes to make people unable to log in and to see how the servers and game handle it. This test wasn't at all about you getting to log in and play, this was purely about gathering data for Blizzard. Any expectations you had beyond that were unreasonable.
---
Don't y'all have any younger siblings or remember what it's like being a kid? People just want to play the game and are jealous of those who can and are just simply frustrated and venting. 95% of all this " toxicity" will go away when the game is out.
---
Imagine calling your little brother one of the most toxic people you know because he's pissed you got the last Capri Sun or something. Let's not needlessly create some weird Reddit drama narrative and show some empathy.
---
Idk what you're on about this is clearly a Blizzliuminati plot to screw over specific people by first inviting them to stress test a server and then locking them out of it; simultaneously annoying their playerbase AND defeating the point of a stress test. It HAS to be because otherwise that would mean we're all a bunch of overexcited nerds with hyperactive imaginations and a victim complex.
---
How sad is that you had to make up and post something like this to stir up drama?
---
Also, sets up the whole "boy who cried wolf" scenario. Easy to just dismiss the comparison as overused, whether it applies or not, when it truly is overused.
---
So right now im using cutlass in OH and chanting blade in main hand
---
Combat swords is generally the better choice, though you can make combat daggers work. People will tell you slow MH and fast OH but it's important to note that it's actually *Highest base damage per swing* MH. When leveling it's entirely possible that you get a faster weapon that hits harder than your slower weapon. You won't the highest base damage to boost your instant attacks (sinister strike, backstab). The fast OH is for poison procs.
---
You're a big gnome
---
As long as all those changes only affect the client in a visual and opt-in way, what difference does it make?
---
They still do.
---
That's awesome! I was a play the kid was had a lead in. I played some Wotlk, but all the changes killed it for me. I didn't like the game practically playing itself. So I spent most my time farming companions, then they added battles and I full on quit. Subbed early for classic. 
---
What race/ class you thinking about playing?
---
Ah yes, Internet Explorer, the truest of nostalgia!
---
hahaha great team work! :D
---
I noticed on my troll last night, if I strafe right, I run.  If I strafe left, I walk backwards (quickly).
---
I'm assuming this has been reported already?
---
Well I disagree.  I think the point is that you are trying to justify hatred and vitriol while I don't believe there is any justification for them.  I can see how you could respond that way to it happening to you, however, I believe it is an immature and not well thought out response.
---
Why do you think the community begged them to, because Wow had problems and the best way the community knows how to address those problems is to revert the game back to a time when they think those problems didn't exist.
---
I don't really think it would be personally.. Just an emote that has no impact on gameplay of any kind.. It'd let roleplayers have more options, too.
---
Well that's it classic is dead to me, back to the private servers
---
lol.  The guy/gal asks a simple question and gets down voted.  Not that it matters , but what's the matter with some of you people.  Sheesh.
---
Yeah, like back in the WOTLK days when the mammoths first came around you'd have an entire guild sitting in a city and all using potions and the mounts to stop you clicking NPC's.
---
Assholes.
---
/punt
---
i have been 5'6'' since i was 15. Im almost 30.
---
They are using the models that they had in vanilla.
---
Try r/wow lmao.
---
Agreed
---
Agreed. I wouldn‚Äôt want to see anything higher than 50. Then we can see how they find the new end game (like now by  for lvl30) without spoiling much of the 60 end game
---
I am 100% serious.
---
Dwarf priest or go home, buddy.
---
"Delete all the quests."
---
Yikes. You don't want a discussion about making WoW (Classic or Retail) better. You want a completely different game. That's hard to discuss. You don't want an MMO? Sounds like you want a 5-man version of Skyrim, maybe? That could be cool, I agree. But it has nothing to do with WoW and belongs nowhere near WoW Classic talks -- which Blizzard has said numerous times is their attempt at making a game 'as true to original as possible' (not a quote, but paraphrasing).
---
I hope you find the game you're looking for! WoW ain't it, nor will it ever be it.
---
p.s. You cannot dictate language (though you can try!). Just because Blizzard calls them Classic and Live, the community still very much uses Classic vs Retail, and I am willing to bet that will be the case for a long time. Shit, people are still calling Classic "Vanilla" ...
---
I got as far as the character creation screen but couldn't get further. I tried for about 90 minutes and called it a night (the server had been showing offline).
---
I'll be honest that I was a little disappointed, but I wasn't angry. I just wanted to play with new graphics settings and see the feel of it.  But I 100% understand the point of it all.
---
The best thing is that I'm sure the first few days of Classic launch will be slammed with queues/crashes/etc. It is to be expected, but that's when the real REEEEEEEEEEEE will come out.
---
I can‚Äôt remember off the top of my head, but skullflame shield will be another one people will be after
---
i agree, it seems unlikely that they would (if they really need maxlevel testing) jeopardise it for more streamer hype by slowly raising the level cap...
---
He is not prepared. When he pulls a second boar and get wombod to death he will just give up and go out
---
no i don't like single player games..
---
Can we stop pretending like people are upset about not being able to log on for two hours and Noth that they felt slighted about their beta access.
---
A lot of people were looking forward to getting a chance to experience classic (even in an extremely limited way) and got excited when they thought they were going to get the opportunity.
---
Instead they realized it was never about giving a decent experience or testing. It was purely a numbers game. The game was unplayable for the entirety of the stress test for most players. Then the stress test servers were down until about 12:30pm est. and a lot of people were already asleep and missed their opportunity.
---
This is about feeling slighted about beta all over again. I truly don't understand why stress testers can't get full beta access for some limited period of time (a week or two). You don't even feel like a tester when you're sitting in a queue. At least throw a bone to the people that slammed their heads against the login server for two hours only to come out disappointed.
---
It's brilliant! Hopefully it opens some eyes... "You think you want it but you don't..." My ass!!! ü§û

2H fury loses a lot of its steam without the /sit mechanic (or bug I should probably say now).
---
This definitely exists.  Someone hits the mob before you they have the tap.
---
A couple of things you may not be used to:
---
1. Dots dont tick instantly, so throwing a dot doesn't get you the tap if somebody else hits it before your first tick.
---
2. If you join a group with someone who has tapped the mob, it will stay grey to you until you hit it.
---
3. If you leave a group but someone tapped a mob before you left, you will still get credit/loot.
---
People knew it was just sold so poorly, nobody bought a snap like that because it wasnt genuine.
---
Spoilers below, but tbh if you haven't watched the finale yet you likely dont care.
---
What happened on GoT is a kid that was otherwise an angel, straight A student stabbing their whole class to death with a compass (more likely than one dragon destroying an entire city in GoT given the strength of scorpions the literal episode before) because the least favourite out of their 2 remaining dogs died.
---
Sure, sounds great! :) 
---
I "followed" you. I guess that means I'll get a notification if you post your guide.
---
No he called OP toxic for the way he portrayed ppl complaing about streamers/stress tests etc. Read his answer fully, his tldr didn't explain that part ;)
---
Classic hype had me join a Pserver back in January, and all my interactions with people have been pretty amazing.  I don't think I've encountered one person that was in any way a dick.
---
I do leave global chats though, so I'm sure there is assholes there, but in parties/out in the world there's not a one.
---
Ending the rant with xx...... Lmao /thread
---
&gt;I was in 2-3 guilds that had 0 progression until i joined it and carried the whole raid together with a tank.
---
As 1 person in a 40 man raid, I highly doubt you made the difference between a guild progressing or not.
---
&gt;when i played with my buddys back then we cleared the first heroic dungeons in BC with 64.
---
Do you mean at level 64? If so you're lying through your teeth.
---
I wish i could
---
Planning PTO NOW
---
If you want to progress as far as possible you should probably pick what works best with your racial. Axe if you are an Orc, Sword if you are a Human, and reroll if you are anything else.

Oh, a nerd with no life. I suggest you to vent your frustrations in the street, not in front of a computer.

Oh bummer.  Thanks for the answer.

I hated blasted lands because of that stupid warlock demon quest on that cliff
---
Jesus Christ this zebra dude is a real fucking asshole. The guy asked a simple question. And you took a large amount of your time to be a dick, rather than being helpful and answering. Also, this is a completely valid question so fuck you,
---
&gt; Trolls on the internet is not a new thing, just deal with them like anywhere else. So what I get from this is that you have social anxiety.. online? 
---
Have you ever been to twitch?  Go now, and look at the comments.  That's what chat will become.
---
a community of blind that follow blind men
---
I don't even WANT to play the beta, I'm waiting for the finished product. I'll play on day one, but probably not before that. You'd think people excited to play for nostalgia's sake would have grown up in 14 years, but apparently not. This subreddit has taught me just how many entitled, bratty adults are out there if nothing else.
---
Wait what the hell is going on with the Kul Tirans? They're all an entire race of Andre the Giants? Isn't Jaina Kul Tiran? I don't remember her towering above Thrall.
---
And they are glorious!
---
I have a new question that hasn't been asked yet. Does progression get wiped out after beta?
---
I am not planning to do so. Was just thinking loud. No way I am gonna pay so much money for sth. like that.
---
Especially getting TF and T3 will be worth nothing in todays "classic". It was Special back then in vanilla, but in 2-3 every Johnny will have TF and T3. In 5 years even more, because classic will never stop, but gear stops in Naxx. 
---
So calm down ;) , I will just Play a bit casually and farm my T0 this time.
---
I reached everything I could reach in vanilla and it will forever be far more worth than People doing the same in classic now :)
---
I don't know about you but I've grown a bit since I was 10 years old.
---
VeCo
---
I literally watched it being attempted as I wrote this comment. It didn‚Äôt work, you only get experience based on the amount of damage you do to the mob. You‚Äôre not getting 100%
---
Now *this* is the kind of community development we need.
---
Of course there is a bias. Why wouldn't there be? Are people so naive to think that Blizzard wants everything to be equal and fair? Streamers are going to get priority. They make Blizzard thousands and thousands times more money than you do. Life isn't fair, and the entitlement on this sub is actually insane.
---
People thought they could play the game. Many we're hyped for it and some stayed up till very late  (EU) to play game. They could not play game. They frustrated about this fact. They vent on social platforms like Reddit about it.  None of this is complicated and doesn't warrant  the dramatic post. Try to show some empathy people.
---
Not even OP,  but a lot of this "shit on the community, to make myself look superior" doesn't help foster the original community of vanilla either.
---
alright cool, thanks
---
As I said, no one is disputing that they carried out a stress test. However, given that the invite specifically states ‚Äúplay‚Äù, I think people read literally, which I think is fair. I think it‚Äôs reasonable that people are disappointed when they don‚Äôt get to play but instead spam the login server for two hours. Playing in heavily populated starting area could easily be interpreted as a stress test too and given how they packaged it, I think people were expecting that.
---
1 was absolutely not in Vanilla as someone who played 19 hunter twink and strafed nonstop extensively.
---
Hope so. You havnet played classic until you have spammed trade chat for hours looking for a group, usually a tank.
---
The problem with reddit is that you're all terribly sheltered, or at least you come across as if some of you either live in a bubble or haven't experienced the rougher parts of life. Criticism is not toxicity. That's just a very lazy way of using a trendy buzzword to avoid addressing the arguments that are often made. People don't necessarily hate streamers (some do) most of the criticism comes from the fact that certain streamers were part of the classic WoW hate crowd or at times seemingly carry more weight in the discussion than any other feedback. Occasionally I'll watch a streamer but not for long. They're (nearly all) just in it for the money and their opinion flipflops depending on what'll help their wallet.
---
I think he believes the way the original post was written was toxic, not necessarily your post.
---
Honestly, we all want no changes, but visual upgrades are very welcome! We‚Äôre playing what is a ‚Äúremake‚Äù not a ‚Äúremaster‚Äù. Frankly nostalgia wears off quickly, the cartoonish visual style of WoW helps it a lot, not many other games could pull it off. I for one wouldn‚Äôt say no to updated models, transmog is awesome, but in vanilla and pre cata? It means a lot as being able to recognise gear in pvp is something i miss.
---
1. Addons existed in Vanilla. They exist to make the game better and yes, sometimes easier, but never worse. If an addon goes too far in making the game easy, e.g a group-finder addon, Blizzard would ban it. If you wanna play without addons, go for it. You are not required to, and many people raid without them, but there is a noticeable difference between those who use addons, and those who don't. Just saying.
---
2. Ogres are like onions, they have layers. Sharding solves the problem of undercrowding, but layering solves the problem of overcrowding. You can still see a hundred people in one spot, all from your server, but your computer isn't completely fried in the process. If this is a problem for you, then your glasses might be a bit too tinted chief.
---
3. People want what people want. The players who wanted classic probably didn't play live. This is just Blizzard providing an marketable opportunity to the players they've lost. They only aim to gain subscribers here. Just think of it as Wow players vs ESO players. They're two completely different games. Same thing here.
---
4. That's just the nature of the game. If you can't play when the content is relevant, then that is just your problem. Wow is an evolving game that needs change, or people will get bored and quit, plain and simple. There's a reason why you can't pause an online game. And it's not like Blizzard could force you to complete all the raids of an expansion before moving on, because it would be completely impractical, and would become a shell of their former selves. With classic this may not be a problem to you, because catch up epics do not exist.
---
I'd be thrilled slamming my ballsack into a combustion engine for his monthly income.

Calm roddery*
---
#1 parses are about cheesing harder than other people. Unless it's a 100% single target fight without mechanics, which we haven't seen since, you guessed it, Vanilla.
---
We were definitely stuck on Nef for a week or two and killed Chromagnus a few time before we downed Nef.  We were not a try hard worlds-first type of guild.  Think we were the 5th or 6th guild on Kilrogg to kill Nef.
---
It's the only medium we have to classic wow.
---
Streamers ruin everything they touch, either directly or through their stupid ass fans
---
Wow 2.0 with the core tenants of classic -wotlk minus the detrimental things weve learned from hindsight.
---
How dare Blizzard take advantage of what's basically free advertising.
---
Indeed. Nothing like a live demonstration.
---
"You can't handle the pink!"
---
Fantastic!
---
People need to understand that entering a beta to help stress test is _not_ so you can enjoy the game earlier than everyone else. It's so the devs can sort out any issues before release so the launch goes well.
---
....of course.
---
This isn't early access.
---
Must fix.
---
Ah, true. Not only are the fights know. They are also easier because of the changes. So my point of the kills not really meaning anything is even more valid. 
---
On a side note, since I never hit 60 in vanilla trying the different patches would be nice.
---
Sweety Squad
---
The problem is that you are THE needed person if you are the tank. You can get subs for DPS and healers, but finding subs for your tank(s) is really hard. You have to make sure that you can be at every raid.
---
Dps warrior does not suffer from this because it can be easily subbed for.
---
Does the height setting work yet? Adjusting the value doesn‚Äôt make the bars larger
---
This kind of speaks to what I've been thinking all along.
---
The beta is to test the in-game mechanics, quests, items, etc., all the things that it would take years for a small team of devs to comb through and perfect. To find all those little glitches and weird oddities.
---
A stress/smoke-test is legit that. Often, they underprovision the actual service so that way they can see HOW the system reacts to being choked, and what breaks, in what ways, so that when it's properly provisioned, the things that broke previously are mitigated so the impact isn't felt (or the impact is very minor compared to 'Character Creation timed out' forever).
---
As you said, can we not just be happy that any of this is happening? At all? Several years back we were told this would never be a thing, time and time again. We didn't want this, no matter how much we thought we did.  And now that it's happening, and they're trying to make it as Blizzard-Perfect as possible, people are losing their god-damned minds.
---
Very cool! I'm hoping I get to it next month to give people time before launch (because none of us will be doing anything outside of playing at that point).
---
I love it
---
This makes sense.  I'm in beta and I got in.  My wife was stress test invite and got constantly booted.
---
I'd guess there is a sort of priority based on order of invite, with stress test-only folks being at the bottom of the list.  That doesn't mean none got it, but it would mean the spots were far more contentious.
---
project titan was the name of the game I wanted but it never made it out of planning.
---
His chat isn‚Äôt exactly great but it‚Äôs nowhere near as bad as he thinks it is. I couldn‚Äôt help but roll my eyes at that entire monologue, especially when his entire shtick is being arrogant and belittling people.
---
New favorite copypasta
---
You're such a troll :p
---
Better to upset now about the test experience than the launch experience later.
---
Ah so you are very salty huh? Just stop typing and stop looking so salty kid :p
---
Yep. You will be expected to not miss a single raid because tanks can not be replaced as easily as a healer or dps. MT misses a raid and it is often cancelled. 39 others don't get to raid because you couldn't make it.
---
I dunno I watch streams and, I'm 6'3 and in relatively good shape. Got a little chub but, a ton of muscle. I thought the meme was funny but, like most memes if taken seriously. It don't hold up.
---
But you can. I believe in you.
---
Shaman. But everyone has different preferences.
---
When people call this community toxic comments like yours are what they're referring to.
---
You think /r/classicwow is toxic?  lol.  You ain't seen nothing yet.
---
Hiiisssss
---
Ah I think you are correct, but I'm not sure why I was dragged to the PTR realm screen if that's the case. I was logged out due to being AFK on live, and then when logging back in the client displayed that.
---
I seriously sigh at all these Twitch words used outside of Twitch, it looks and sounds so stupid.
---
It's a fun video though.
---
Yeah but they‚Äôve got fear ward so they‚Äôll get in the raid before you lol
---
It is so cringy to hear people want to be a "tester" so they can get their fix.
---
well what server was it? What guild? Who was the moms character?
---
I could get behind a WoW 2.o ... but I like more old school MMOs (played everquest for years before WoW came out). Not a huge fan of action combat (I love good ol' tab target, but with interesting classes and spells). Unfortunately, I think we are years, if not more than a decade away from the next huge, amazing MMO. The market has just shifted so much to the casual, mobile garbage fest we are in now.
---
I think philosophically you are not on the same page as Classic.
---
I feel you though. Archeage, for me, was about as close as anyone has come to a perfect MMO until is was very VERY quickly decimated by terrible TERRIBLE business decisions.
---
&gt;That's what chat will become.  Pure cancer.
---
Barrens chat was a thing in vanilla too. 
---
&gt; Again, if you care about the game, avoid like the fucking plague. 
---
I want to be on a server that is alive. I would probably not join a "streamer guild" as I have ambitions of making my own, but being on the same server means there will be plenty of fun shit to do. I am looking forward to doing some great sniping of opposite faction streamers. Maybe I can even get someone clipping my PvP fails or wins depending on outcome.
---
I know this an old post now.
---
But as a horde I can confirm this screenshot to be correct.   
---
We were all watching as ghosts.
---
good to know. ive felt disuaded from rogue the past few days cause i keep reading how shit they are unless they get the opener and luck. but others say if you have all the right items and spec youll be unstoppable 1v1. ive never really played vanilla extensivley and i was young so i cant recall.
---
definitely still gonna main rogue.
---
&gt;And you have Wvyern sting, which can help you put a target to sleep, then you can get to ranged and get off an aimed shot! 
---
Does anybody go full survival? I rarely see anybody pvping without scatter and wyvern is not a good replacement for it.
---
:D So great haha. Does he use enemy nameplates always on and if not would he have seen them if he did?
---
Yup, 
---
I recall doing the same from time to time. My main point was that it was normal, for me and others of my friends/guildees, to use a capitol city as a place to LFG.
---
You've never glanced into r/the_Donald, have you? Toxic + batshit crazy.
---
His chat insulting him is funny, it's all in good fun and he goes along with it. But the past few months with some of the newer viewers, the joking has turned into straight hateful shit, not only about him but about his family and girlfriend.
---
Can you consider it reacting when a corpse has more of a pulse than he does?
---
Don‚Äôt forget about fear ward
---
And worst of all, he is actually Going to play on a PvE server.
---
Please post links to examples backing up your claim or stop being such a sensationalist. It's just a game, keep it in your pants will ya OP?
---
You had an addon that would change your hotbar making your rotation 1 1 1 1 1? that's.. the vanilla rotation for most classes, anyway..
---
judging by the verbage you use it doesn't really seem like you know what you're talking about
---
LOOK.. BEHIND YOU!! A THREE HEADED MONKEY!!
---
The title wasn't added until 2.x though.  They just gave it to everyone who had the mount.
---
*Gandalf has entered the chat*
---
i mean she killed everyone because she wanted to instil fear in all of Westeros so they would follow her, because she knew they would never love her, and also a little bit of anger at the people of Westeros for not loving her despite her previously being a good queen simply out of prejudice against outsiders and targaryens. Its all in the episode, maybe it should have been made more obvious for a wider audience, but they put in scenes to point out all of those aspects. Its not just anger at Rhaegal's death
---
Nameplates in classic are not really consistant I think
---
Yes I remember that. I also remember me warlock buddy summoning people there and letting them fall in the lava by standing just at the edge there
---
they never know
---
Same here. I'm looking to be the Enchanting king of the server. Get the rare recipes. Have lots of mats on hand. Spam the shit out of trade. (only a little)
---
When I first played, I started in summer 2005, so I was well behind the curve for that sort of thing. And I leveled reeeeealy slow. Now, I'll be 60 within a few weeks of everyone else and will be participating more actively with the community.
---
Lets get those server forums heated up.
---
Thanks! :)
---
???????
---
Another clueless comment, no its not about cheesing harder than others, when you got people in top guilds doing their first clear and still having higher numbers than people who clear it 3 weeks after, and you got patchwerk style bosses in every raid that comes out(bar 2-3 boss raids).
---
You guys surelly like to talk shit with 0 evidence or knowledge about what you're talking about.
---
Just in legion you had: Nythendra, Ursoc, Guarm, Krasus, Star Augur to a very small extent, Maiden and Varimathras that were patchwerk fights or had very few mechanics/movement on them.
---
Sure but was that every server or just tge one you played on?
---
Watching people freak out and blame streamers has been one of the best parts of the beta.
---
It's the asspained people who think that because they obsessed over a game that now it has a beta they are entitled to be in said beta and how fucking dare some Twitch streamer to get in but not they. Not hard to believe these days. Funnily enough, it is the same kinds of people who a month ago would attack you for your politics and bandy about the words "toxic" and "problematic" to describe anyone and anything they disagree with. Now that the Golden Ticket to Willy Wonka's gaming escapism factory is up and they didn't get in they want to storm the Bastille. Oh, woe is they, not even Moses could understand the suffering of these people because they didn't get in and now can't humblebrag to everyone from God to you and me about how awesome and elite they are now.
---
It's hilarious because these very same people are going to get into Classic when it releases and be the same boring complainers who drove Vanilla into the QoL bullshit that Retail has now become
---
Get YouTube video blocker extension. I have it and literally use it exclusively for blocking the dozen azmongold channels YouTube keeps trying to shove down my throat. I hope as many people see this as possible.
---
Whatever troll boy, to communicate effectively and differentiate from Deadmines and Dire Maul you have to throw a cardinal direction  at the end of the abbreviation to show that you mean a difference. Not everyone lives in your head buddy.
---
Extremely true
---
Barrens chat is infinitely better than twitch spam chat.
---
I understand why people say "Baldman bad" but what has he actually done? I like him cause he is what I imagine all WoW players as, some goofy kid (not kid anymore, but when I started watching) just enjoying the game and trying to push it as far as possible. People like him for his persona. 
---
That being said I'm still staying away from his server cause it will probably be unplayable, but it will have massive amounts of WPVP if you like that.
---
You're blinded by hate if you think that's the case, or maybe just trolling.
---
If it's the reddit I'm thinking about, those people not getting laid has no negative impact on the world whatsoever, and lots of positive impact.
---
i'm sorry but i do not agree. 
---
1) addons should not be banned, we have had them since vanilla and are a legit part of the classic experience. if you have issues with them then don't use them. my husband plays totally addon free (and has been since classic) and is just fine. 
---
2) not sure why choosing a server bothered you so much, it was and still is an extremely common practice for games. i feel like your solution is not at all a good idea, as it strips people of the community people are looking for even further. 
---
3) i see retail and classic as 2 separate games. i dont want  the majority of people i see who want to play classic are actually returning players, so they aren't even in the bfa pool of players. 
---
4) i dont think this will be an issue in classic. as for retail, you can still do a big chunk of old content as you level so i dunno why you think you cant?
---
That certainly took a sharp turn at the end there, lol
---
You know me too well.
---
Streamers also show the game to people that might not otherwise play. I don't see how promoting the game is so controversial.
---
Haha. I was being a sarcastic ass (playing off this image that beta is for TESTING and not for having FUN before everyone else). Sorry if that wasn't clear.
---
We don't care if we can't get in
---
We don't care if we don't have a beta acces
---
We just want blizzard to be honest
---
When we are promised a stress test acces, we should all be equal at the login screen. 
---
If we knew we couldn't log in versus the streamers, we wouldnt have even tried to do it, this is blizzard not beeing honest with their audience.
---
As a random, as no one, i was here and meant to test the queue
---
And its was not a priority pass for STREAMERS, it was a priority pass for BETA  TESTERS, that's not the same but that's nearly the same because they gave 80% of beta keys to influencers/streamers.
---

Stress test realms are on for about 24h or so.

Toxic is highly overused and basically has lost its meaning at this point.

Ugh the resistance stats

Then we are all fucked for those short jokes

I‚Äôm from NA and I call it DM. I nevertheless heard of vc till pservers.
---
It also depends on what timezone you're in. If you are in eastern europe then i western european guild might be something for you. Depending on where you are and where the guild is there could be a 2h difference between you. So if the guild raided at 21:00 it would be 23:00 for you

Obviously it can be different for all unique elite mobs, but the one I checked on stream looked fine
---
I mean, have you seen World of Roguecraft? Dude is naked with one grey dagger and mauls rank 14's over and over. Yeah, you can call it cherry picked, but if that can happen even once, gear doesn't really matter.
---
Was anyone able to log into a horde character? Everyone I know and saw on twitch was on alliance.
---
It's funny, I never put much time into professions back in the day. But I *still* miss little things from professions in retail. And holy shit was I triggered when I logged into Legion to check it out and saw that you had to have tailoring or some thing for first aid.
---
You play pservers? Cuz it happens with eu people there all the time.
---
Here‚Äôs Venruki‚Äôs longer video of the entire battle:
---
https://youtu.be/G0ldUv7z_7Y
---
Yeah, people like you are why this sub is so horrendous mate
---
Logged on this morning, had a great time. Was only able to make one character last night, but had a lot of fun watching the streamers. Exciting times.
---
It‚Äôs pretty condescending to tell me how I should feel. Knowing what I know now, I still would have done it, because I want a smooth launch. That being said they could have been more clear on what their idea of the stress test was and I think that would have managed people‚Äôs expectations better. Using words like ‚Äúplay‚Äù in the invitation I think could be considered misleading if their goal was to test the login servers.
---
That's probably it...people just don't want to admit they've been playing on pservers and not vanilla. Also, happy cake day!
---
small NA server full of Aussies in Classic? This sounds like Gorgonnash.
---
I made a post kinda like this but I said people are pissed cause they thought they were special. Man Reddit didn't like that lmao
---
I‚Äôve heard it from eu players all the time on pservers.
---
Depends. I usually play Horde Tauren Druid, but I feel like playing a Human Rogue this time around. It all depends on what you guys plan to play! I'm looking forward to making new friends so I can play Alliance or Horde, just let me know :)
---
I love Badlands and Azshara ... I was usualy alone there and no one bothered me

Hi, /u/IamTheWambo

Spoiling a 14 year old endgame... what?
---
I love this m√©m√© so much, I want to marry it.
---
You've got a lot of cultures clashing.  The older in age guys who played vanilla, the newer generation of stream fanbois and private server players.  Conflict is inevitable.
---
I felt like I was accomplishing something every time I queued again. I hope they got some good data for my hour of "work".
---
"City". Stormwind and Ironforge and Undercity are cities. This is a shanty town.
---
Who asks for dire maul and doesn‚Äôt specify which side?
---
Nah, definitely late vanilla. I can't remember how late, but I do remember queuing up in Org then running out to duel while I waited for it to pop back during my vanilla days.
---
what are you replying to?
---
The amount of times the word "shill" is used in that sub is beyond me.
---
He's part of a bigger problem, that is streamers like him are influencing a generation of kids who don't know it's a 'persona.'
---
First of all it's a stepping stone to more changes. Wow players have an insatiable hunger for ruining the game with their changes. Second, it's out of place. It's not the classic world. It'd also create two worlds essentially. Streams will differ, you'd have to hear about it from other players, etc.
---
not me lol.
---
Ahahahahahahahahahaha so true... Stupid fucking cucked streamer fan boys
---
&gt; cant add a zonewall to a world with seamless zones.
---
Of course they can, just put a wall in the bottleneck from Northshire Abbey.
---
Human warrior and pally, and NE warrior, druid, priest. That's the plan. I'll be warrior main, priest alt, wife pally/druid, kid warrior. 
---
We've never played horde seriously, just a character a few levels.
---
Yes, but it was funny for me, so I wanted to keep it in
---
And this is what those private server players forgot, wow requires money to play
---
Yes, the entire sub is an interesting antropological experiment, where you see the most different specimen of wow fan gathering and fighting. One of the think I most thank Classic Wow for is that now I have a sane sub where to discuss about Vanilla :D
---
&gt;you‚Äôre rewarded for the hard work that you put into things
---
It may not be considered hard work, but streamers at least put in the hours to get their followers.. Instead of grinding boars or organizing guilds as a guild leader, they pretty much act/perform/rhetorize for several hours a day several days a week... Heck, look at tipsout on the beta release weekend; what he was doing cannot be super healthy.. he had two 16 hours streams with only like 6 hours sleep in-between while having a regular cold (sore throat mild fever and so on). Again, they have a job that probably at this point is overpaid and very enjoyable, but that does not mean they don't put in the hours.
---
Carefully, he's a hero.
---
As you can see whenever he does not shield block he does get wrecked pretty hard, so that elite at least has pretty high damage, while other elites just seems to hit like wet noodles
---
And this is why fake news and ‚Äúfalse facts‚Äù are a thing. Because people like you won‚Äôt give your time of day to actually inquire.
---
[They also do fuck around on retail stress tests. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/5ypk4c/world_first_nomi/)
---
Booooooo, you're one of the enemy now!
---
I wish reddit would let me block people without having to specify a violation first.
---
Hi im single
---
I‚Äôm curious as well. I sure hope so.
---
Ahh. At work skimming through tbh
---
As an alliance player I never got into Azshara. Can't remember why... Lack of quests? 
---
It looks gorgeous, though.
---
you haven't been to r/wowservers yet
---
Well tbf they were justified in complaining.
---
Don't take a stress test for a real condition test. It's meant to stress the server at his max capacity, and then double it.    
---
This gave Blizzard real number about what it's needed, what is playable, etc ... but it not necesserly reflect what it will be at launch. When they explained layering, they explicitly said that there will be lot of layer a launch, and the number will be lower as people spread into differnt zones, day after day.
---
Since I have no clue how to Reddit and my post got locked for what I assume was a repost, here is a link to the gm saying "just checking things, see you" 
---
https://i.redd.it/7sehp5dk8vz21.jpg
---
It wasn't really a rant though, just clarification.
---
It is, but the title literally didnt exist in vanilla. Only the mount.
---
I just meant that they are able to rely on their fame to get things that other players would have to use ingame mechanics to obtain. I‚Äôm not saying everything falls into this, I‚Äôm just saying they often have armies of fans willing to donate thousands of gold, gear, consumables, etc. Most big streamers will never have to farm their own consumables for instance. It‚Äôs just something we‚Äôve not seen in vanilla before to this level.
---
Toxic toxins are toxic.
---
r/writing is the most toxic subreddit I am on.  Half the posts there are just complaining about people asking for advice.
---
Because they'd rather feel "righteous fury" instead of recognizing their ignorance
---
&gt; it somewhat off falls apart in Dun Morogh - mostly because I ended up at the wrong spirit healer.
---
I noticed that as well. I plan on testing out a few death spots today, hopefully find a spot that rezzes in Coldridge.
---
Well now you'll know what to expect for a stress test next time. There was clearly a problem and now they can look over the logs and try and fix it.
---
Good ridance
---
Sweet! Then we're in sync then. I play Horde because I love the faction lore wise but I want to do some PvP when I'm not crafting or doing PvE content so I'm doing this seriously this time around and Human Rogues do good synergy with their racials and stuff.
---
Not sure if it was mentioned here yet but auto loot seems to be working as it does in retail. You don't have to hold down a hotkey to auto loot mobs.
---
&gt; Personally, I couldn't care less about streamers but it means a lot when any individual can admit they're wrong.
---
I seriously do not care but I wanted to point out the difference between Venruki and Quin. Get a grip? lol, I honestly do not care one way or the other.
---
Reee
---
You'd have to be some kinda idiot to not like Gnomes man.
---
I like your thoughts. 
---
In the first 15 minutes of playing my Orc Warrior I was phased to a different layer twice. Both times I was in the middle of killing a mob and the mob just completely disappeared on me. The first time this happened I didn't even realize it was the layering, thought it was a bug of some sort. It was extremely jarring and rather frustrating; both times I went from low pop to high pop.
---
A few days ago I replied to someone that you can just take a look at the sub and see how toxic it is, since, 
---
&gt; Despite having almost 50k subs and ~500 actively browsing it as of writing this comment, most of the posts there are in the single digits in terms of upvotes, save for a few exceptions, and the rest is usually downvoted to hell. Rarely you will find posts there with 100+ upvotes. You can find the same negativity in the comments there.
---
which I wrote.
---
As a reply I got was 
---
&gt; [...] The population of private servers isn't any more or less toxic than the retail population and any other kind of reddit [...]
---
and 
---
&gt; I'm just not one to go and blame a certain group of people for the state of a sub. I've seen the private server peeps shoot some negative comments towards the retail players, and I've seen the OG vanilla people do the same towards players of private servers and also retail players.
---
‚ÄãCompletely missing the point that I specifically meant the /r/wowservers sub. Either that or they defended it. And as someone who likes  both Retail (despite the glaring flaws) and Classic (despite having been on the "no classic" side for a long time) who doesn't want to sanctify or villify either of the games but instead wants people to be realistic, it is astonishing how many people there are from the hivemind.
---
Best example is if you even mention the notion of not wanting to play on a PvP server. There is a ridiculous amount of people here who unironically call people who have no interest in PvP (world or instanced) pussies, despite the game being built and focused around PvE and many players beginning to play WoW because of PvE.
---
not too long ago asmongold was in a bad spot irl and was struggling mentally to keep streaming. im so happy for him, that his favorite game is back and that he can stream it for us and make happy moments like this one
---
Thanks for the reply dude. I really appreciate it.
---
So the same people, a month ago, attacked who for what exactly?
---
Hahah
---
Your beliefs are obviously not mine. Where I'm from you reap what you sow and you stick up for yourself when someone shits on you.
---
Both are just spam and filled with trolls.. What made Barrens chat infinitely better?
---
Yeah, better have the 20000th post of "look at my screenshot from desolace and give me karma", right?
---
That was it! That account is long since sold now though. Previous to that I played on Blackwater Raiders (and was the first Rogue in full Nightslayer) and I can't for the life of me remember the server I was on before that. I hopped around a little as groups of friends came and went. I really love 1 - 60 in vanilla and running dungeons.
---
Totally.
---
I felt most people were mad about the stress test showing the server was offline while streamers were able to play. Maybe people are mad about more than that idk. I didn't even opt in for the beta because I wanna wait for release.
---
It's like people think this is the ONLY time they'll get to play classic. You might not like the release date but we are getting it.
---
The rimworld sub isn't.
---
Oooga booga blizzard good community bad
---
Blizzard‚Äôs server logs recorded your attempts. 
---
They know.
---
That‚Äôs one functionality of server  logs during a stress test.
---
Why anyone even gives a fuck out the beta is way beyond me. .....it's a beta.........the only people playing should be the most hardcore min maxers and top hardcore private servers because they've spent years researching vanilla nd would be the best but hunters. It's a TEMPORARY BETA that is there to catch bugs only. It kinda of pisses me off people just want to play it for fun.
---
Back during Vanilla, Alliance outnumbered Horde by quite a bit, it's the reason Blood Elves we're introduced to the Horde.
---
There's a lot of (incorrect) thought that it's going to happen again on Classic. What many vanilla players are failing to realize is that the 'play for looks' crowd isn't going to leave retail. 
---
I expect far more horde than alliance on just about every server.
---
A very long time ago, during a discussion there on PVP, I said that there's a reason why PVE server are target as "Normal". You can imagine where the discussion went after that :D
---
Amazing how this thread hasn't been downvoted to oblivion 2 minutes in.
---
All I want is to be able to tame a fucking giraffe and have that long-necked bastard murder people all over the place.
---
SPECT! WALK!
---
Nah i wish i had screenshots for it but i dont have them. We were total stoners and were not sure when we could start those instances. It was the one where the flying boss comes in at the end right in the first BC zone. We cleared all besides that boss and nearly had him down. 
---
And on the first part.. my guild back then wiped on Haigan in wotlk over and over until me and the tank had enough and cont it with only 2 people and slowly killed him took an hour or more. 
---
Same was back then in vanilla with ma guild in classic. Mc they rarely made it close to .. cant recall the name. The boss nearly at the end where each group has to tank one guy and then kill the maingboss in the end.
---
When i joined with my buddies we cleared MC/Ony/AQ20 for the first time.We even made it deep into bwl.  This is not flexing or anything its just a fact. After i had issues with them because of addons and we all 3 left they went back to wiping in MC at the first bosses.. followed by the guildleader switching realms 3 weeks after and stealing the whole guildbank. 
---
And let me be wrong and we maybe killed that heroic instance at 66 but we nearly had it clear. We were amazed that the first boss dropped level 70 gear.
---
We played mmos together for many years and always picked the same classes aswell.. i leveled and played like 10 holy priests and never specced him anything else ..after a while you know what your doing.
---
if you call it DM whilst in Stormwind or Orgrimmar you have a smooth brain. Calling it DM in general chat whilst in Westfall however is acceptable.
---
You are... not alone.
---
It's actually a little bit maddening when you see people going "KappaKappaKappa PogChamp" in chat. If you want to use Twitch emotes, go play on Twitch! It's also super embarassing to hear people actually SAY the names of those stupid emotes on Discord. Like, insanely awkward. 
---
Also, Bridgeman, if it's seen as unacceptable to say "retard" then it should still be seen that way when said any other way. It's the meaning that is seen as bad, not the actual word.
---
frustration and boredom is a stinky cologne.

So not only is he a moron, he's a **Nazi sympathizing** moron. Wow. Was there a full moon last night or something?
---
Holy Shit thank you.  I've been searching for the words to describe all this fucking nonsense about streamers getting beta for a few minutes now.  EVERYONE READ THIS: Beta access isn't a RIGHT.  Its not a gamer's right, not a paying subscription's right, not a human right. Its a fucking privilege.  No where in your life have you signed something that guarantees you will have beta access no matter how old your account is.  
---
I can hardly take these losers complaining about beta access anymore.  The stress test complainers are just the cherry on top.. its the same people.
---
Wish I could read these. Can anyone tell me what was said?
---
Leveling while doing your professions is actually a very smart thing to do if you don‚Äôt plan on trying to be the fastest. If you max your professions out around the same time you max your character‚Äôs level, you‚Äôll already have a head start on everyone else for mats and plans and crafted gear and there‚Äôs much more opportunity to make gold doing so!
---
Not to mention all the people using streamers VODs to display bugs. I get people want in the beta, but it just seems like a smart move to me.

Well, the toxic people are usually on r/wowservers, the individual private server subs or forums and ofc /global or /world.

Glad this guy isn't in charge of classic.

To be fair, this season of Survivor has some BS.

Just so the record is clear, you believe that the term stress test can only be interpreted as stressing the login server. Correct?

Hi single, I'm dad.

The fight leading to this was epic, his team got their first and held the high ground and collapsed on the attackers when they hit the hunters' frost traps

Wait, you mean us non-beta and only stress-test invitees were only invited to stress-test server stability??? No way...
---
Not all gaming subs, it's usually the competitive ones that get toxic. Single-player ones like r/stardewvalley? No toxicity there
---
But I wouldn't have predicted the "classic is best because good community" to go down the toxic side
---
But what of the other half?
---
I'm rolling Night Elf Priest because of flips, stripper dance and turn invisible. I think I'll go for the Mechanostrider.

I wouldn‚Äôt mind if the next stress test had premade level 60 characters and everyone was stuck in Hillabrad on PvP though.

The only retail shit that i want in all this list is Transmog and it's not even improtant for me, so no i don't want retail, i didn't ask for Titanforge, for LFR, for Hero√Øc or Mythic dunjeon, etc. etc. so i don't know what do you mean by that.

The internet is truly a disgusting place sometimes

I mean, you can just use discord or an app to get the same result...

Thanks for this. I know item apperance doesn't really matter in classic but its still fun to look at sets and items on a character

They also start swimming sooner making some fishing nodes impossible.

U can't in vanilla iirc
---
This guy! Lol! You're probably upset about the streamers getting beta access too huh?
---
Haha obviously people have gone to extremes to get ahead in this amazing game, but back to my original point: the streamer hate stems from the notion that while the average Joe has to (mostly) work for their things, the streamers are just given it for being popular on camera. Take that how you will, but I‚Äôve seen countless comments that about how blizzard has given priority of beta access to streamers who have openly hated on or been unphased by classic while countless legions of fans who have actually played back then have been excluded from the beta. It‚Äôs tricky either way, and I understand both sides of the coin, I‚Äôm just saying I understand why there‚Äôs streamer hate and to not recognize the passion of the individuals who are upset about this seems strange to me. Streamers will be good for the game I think, but the bad taste in some peoples mouth towards them will continue as well.
---
We already have this thread.
---
For molten core and bwl which are faceroll
---
Personally, I wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing them add outlands and northrend, basically up till they did their combat upgrade.
---
I‚Äôm just talking about for me though, I had a lot of fun playing a DW dk, frost spec.
---
I know a lot of people will shit on that, but I had loads of fun with it, and I enjoyed the leveling in those 2 areas
---
Some of the people on this subreddit are seriously awful. Whether it's extreme hate being thrown at streamers (despite the fact that a popular streamer being in the beta means thousands of people examine everything that happens and it's all automatically recorded), or gatekeeping (I've had people flat out tell me that I don't deserve to play if I can only play a couple hours per day), or just plain racism or sexism (like the guy who told me that women can't be as good as men at video games), there's way too many assholes on this subreddit.

Interesting. I might consider going for warrior anyway since it seems to be good for DPS. And when end game comes up I can decide where I want to focus. I would really love to give a decent guild a good shot, and as a student I will be relatively free most evenings for raiding. I'd hope for a guild with a set schedule, like two or three raids per week rather than something insane where its every night.
---
Are you implying I can pay to get in the beta test? How the hell do I do that? Please tell. I am pretty sure that what Blizzard is charging people for is the ability to play retail/modern WoW. The beta is a free bonus, and not for everyone.  
---
&gt; which requires purchasing the game

You have access to everything up to the latest expansion with just a subscription.

You seem like you at least know what it means so can you explain what ‚Äújebaited‚Äù is?   I see it a lot on Reddit these days.

I can empathize with many people really wanting to log on and just play around, be a part of the community shenanigans and stuff. I wanted to do that, too. And when you see pretty much every streamer seamlessly log on while you and who knows how many others are doing the 'actual' stress-testing, it just hits home how unfair it really is.
---
That said, getting bogged down in what is fair when you don't really have a guarantee of playing the game or beta access at all rings a bit hollow.
---
Reminds me of my own cousin. 
---
We used to play GTA Vice City and took turns as soon as one of us died. I drove around for hours without dying and when it was his turn, he tried to steal a police car, got shot immediately and threw a hissy fit.
---
Today he's a drug addict who spits in his own mother's face. So far he's been avoiding jail time, but I guess his story won't end well.

Looking closely this seems kinda like fake news to me. Both of the pictures on the right are angled down significantly more (especially the profile view) which is IMO is the problem. Plus, it looks like the gnome is closer to the drawf in the "new" pictures by a few centimeters (and therefore on higher ground than in classic pic). 
---
I don't know if you are doing this on purpose or not, but lookng closely I really don't see a size discrepancy here - I just see some trick photography...
---
Just reading these things makes me really excited! Professions mattering will be so much fun!

He rarely does anything bfa related
---
It's asinine, especially considering that almost everyone wants to play (official) Classic for the community, I assume. Yet, there are a fuckton of people who'd rather want to rip out each other's throat in a discussion about whether or not someone wants to go through STV on a PvP server. A few months ago I've seen people on the wowservers sub argue that "you miss the biggest part of the game if you don't do world PvP".
---
So much for community in that regard.
---
No, not correct. Like I said, there was a problem. The problem was you couldn't get to the character creation screen and enter the server. Now Blizz will look into why a bunch of players could and why a bunch couldn't and see if there's a reason. The rumour about certain players or groups having specific access is bullshit.
---
"Righteous Fury" is perfect. Never heard that one. Seems like a great way to describe a lot of people these days not just stress-test/streamer-beta idiots.
---
streamers are more important than all of you slimes lol.
---
honestly though, as a watcher, who doesnt play, listening to the butthurt has been quite an enjoyable part of the experience  lol
---
I'm personally hoping to join a server with a minimal streamer presence, or none, because I think their fanbases tend to be insufferable. But I equally hate these dipshits who bitch and moan about everything these people do because *boo hoo they got beta and I don't* or *wow they don't remember this one thing from years ago? Fake fan!*
---
Streamer man said bad thing about classic and is playing it now? TRUE FANS LIKE ME NEVER WOULD HAVE SAID THAT YET WE HAVE NO BETA?! My vigil to "call out their bullshit" shall be unending!
---
Basically this sub is like a paradise for /r/gatekeeping and the WoW classic version of /r/niceguys
---
All 3 clients here are full 1080p resolution. I don't get your point
---
I actually tried logging on for 2 hours last night before i had to return to RL.  I was sad but realized that was pretty much what i should have expected and I'm pretty sure the devs got a lot of great data.
---
Regarding the toxicity, I'm pretty sure it'll be much more prevalent with classic than it was in retail vanilla.  Social media, FPS games and general internet anonymity have jaded us.  It took less than 90 seconds after logging into the stress test server before i encountered my first "vanilla gatekeeper" who laughed at me for pulling 2 mobs which I easily killed.  They'd rather laugh and tell me I'm a noob than actually help out.  THAT is not how we behaved in vanilla. 
---
I sincerely hope that I am wrong, but the toxic attitude of the gatekeepers looms.
---
WA and Nameplates in classic sound kind of like hilariously overdoing it. Nameplates in particular don't seem like they'd be very useful in Classic versus stuff like Legion or BFA and what the hell are you going to use WeakAuras for? Flurry procs? lol
---
I like this much better
---
I am also kind of happy i didn't get an invite. I really do enjoy min/maxing and i would be doing the same thing as many streamers are now currently. Going for the best gear possible, and doing random other things. But then i would feel pretty bad when classic actually does realease and everything i did on the beta would be for nothing and i have to do it all over again. I will just stick to watching for now. I'm enjoying the twitch experience for classic. Even most streamers are interacting with there audiences more than they normally do. Probably due to all the time running across the world but it's still fun to watch.
---
I read your post wrong I guess. I thought you said font sizes don‚Äôt vary between fonts.
---
Sick bro. Wish I was 6'3
---
Because they are only testing the server.
---
Try to look at it as this being the prototype server.
---
You test if the car drives before doing other tests if you understand what I‚Äôm trying to say.
---
They are just testing the server in general, tests about server location etc is not on there agenda right now.
---
To be honest, it would be stupid to not let streamers into things like this. It‚Äôs 1 beta key to give to someone and he gets 45k people to watch the game get played. While probably 40k people are just classic wow players that would play anyway, there are A LOT of eyes that just check out the popular streamers on the most played games. It costs blizzard like 50 spots out of thousands in the beta to get millions of views on all social media platforms and garner hype to make the game as good as it can be. Plus I would imagine the devs are probably watching some streamers or their vods to see what people are liking and disliking about the game, which gets them plenty more feedback than a normal player as well. 
---
Then on the other hand they could give it to some random salty ass dude from reddit that might not even report a single bug like the streamers are doing. Just wait for the game, all the streamers are doing is playing a classic server that‚Äôs capped at 30 anyway. You can see everything that is unique to classic wow through streams and if you really wanna play that bad there are still private servers up to test out classes you might want to play...
---
All professions 75/75 yo :D
---
Barbers? Dks? Jewlery? Kara? Totems? Sounds a lot like retail
---
gnomes were my favourite race before remodel... in retail their heads are so big they could be used as mounts. i hope they get reverted to the original models before classic is released, because i love old models(and old proportions)
---
REEEEEEEEEE, quit having fun.
---
Since this issue has been reported many times in the demo I'd guess it's how it's working on their internal 1.12 version.
---
I was planning to go Eng/Min because of the extra DPS with bombs, trinkets, etc. But I might go Alch/Herb for Flasks and such, aside from that I plan to do Cooking, Fishing, First Aid (you could do those even if you have 2 professions right?). It will all depend on what our set up looks like. I'm inclining towards Eng/Min because of the Extra Dps.
---
Resolution is upscaled, things appear smaller.
---
Yeah, first aid got removed. In retail you just have professions for minimal personal gain... Except alchemy, that shit is a goldmine.
---
All edgelords are going on DargonsalyerXx PvP
---
No they won't implement achievements.
---
No current plans. Nobody needs them. They were introduced in Wrath as a way to give people something to do when they burned through all the raid content in a day. In Classic, your achievement is your character. Not sure how something is "integral" to WoW when it was introduced after the game already peaked.
---
How can you play on p servers... i know they are a no no to blizzard, but i want to try one out. Any help?
---
you can do it with obs i think
---
If you dont care about getting to 60 quick its o. Just know that you will be spending alot of gold on it which will make getting your mount difficult.
---
I‚Äôll play whatever sever is at the top of the list
---
Can't wait till asmon reacts to this
---
Man I'm calling people will complain about shit way before anyone is in MC, it'll take like a week before everyone's like "is this how long it took to level in vanilla???? Seems off????"
---
You bring back wow on the radar of a lot of people that way.
---
But why are so many people on Reddit against the idea of a stress test in Europe? Every post about it get downvoted into oblivion. I'd appreciate any help understanding this.
---
Are you bro high?
---
It's bigger &amp; more accessible.  12 years ago my "gaming community" were the guys in my WoW guild, and we kicked the assholes out as soon as they appeared.  You're not wrong, but I don't think it's fair to compare.
---
For me it's what broke the game since vanilla, you are less able to encounter players &amp; high level players by adding more continent (so less social interaction, less world pvp, etc.)
---
You don't even need to be familiar with software engineering or architecture or any computer science related activity, just simple logic should allow you to understand this.
---
Thats why I said want to cap. nice read.
---
And you should know other countries credit card systems to understand americas is shit.
---
Lotr, my man!
---
I feel like this is an overly anal observation
---
I think it would be awesome if we could size change. We need this tech because while I would never want to be shorter. I used to get pretty jealous of my ex. She was only 4'11 and she could fit anywhere. You have no idea how jealous that makes me lol.
---
There was a link to a blue post somewhere yesterday where a dev said that they had a enough beta testers for the moment and that currently they were not planning on sending more out. I can't find that post rn so you'll have to trust me. (I don't have beta)
---
yea, i often hate, but i feel like theres always substance behind it. What some people ar elike though is just incredible
---
Yea, this needs more work. I would much prefer they use true sharding for the starter zones (Durotar, Tirisfal, etc.) and then use Continent-wide layering for the rest. Layering doesn‚Äôt do thaaaat much to help the cluster in the newbie area.
---
Imagine being unable to come up with any other response.
---
Pretty sure they came out mid Classic, before that you had to run all the way to the WSG portal in barrens, or the other 2. I spent much of vanilla in WSG and don't recall hanging around in the Barrens
---
Good Job
---
No to all of what you said.
---
&gt; I reached everything I could reach in vanilla and it will forever be far more worth than People doing the same in classic now :)
---
That‚Äôs not true at all, the new game is 100% what matters now and everything in the past is irrelevant now. The most you could get out of someone if you prove what you‚Äôve done is an ‚Äúeh cool‚Äù.
---
Nobody is going to care about your achievements of the past when streamers/celebrities of the future will be able to obtain things that make your achievements seem worthless.
---
You may as well pay for your epic mount with IRL money so you can spend it again when the fresh servers open up and this cycle keeps repeating.
---
fucking chodes lol. these guys have collectively well over 100k fucking people watching, that is called marketing.
---
its nice to see the usual gimme dats crying and whining though.
---
as a shareholder who wants the fucking value back up i want as many people exposed and dying to play as humanly possible, and twitch does that. so suck it up buttercup twat waffles. quit being pussy cancer.
---
So that they could consistently fit through doors, IIRC.

It just beens that someone has been 'baited' into something, like how Sodapoppin here was baited by a gnome mage to chase him, only to meet his demise behind a tree.
---
It's just Twitch culture leaking out, but it just looks stupid majority of the time.
---
Why the fuck do you pay to have someone else play your game for you?
---
A huge part of the enjoyment of Classic comes from levelling up, running dungeons with people and making friends.
---
Are you going to pay them to run your character through endgame raids and gear him up as well?
---
This one really exceeds the others imo.

---
irrelevant beta. And those people that cry so hard it physically hurt are those assholes that do not even report bugs. Those are the idiots that just play it for playing and not for testing and even when they play they most likely only complain. A fucking bunch of Kevins and Karens they are. Just be happy we get the fkn classic and be done with it. Leave beta to the people who are actually doing shit there
---
Why not ? they are beast after all !
---
I'm hoping they will invite some of us after the stress test, but who knows.
---
If you look at any FAQ on a pservers homepage you should be able to find information pertaining to playing on the server. It involves downloading the 1.12/1.12.1 client (for vanilla) and then editing the [realms.wtf](https://realms.wtf) file to include the server address so you can connect through the client. You should be able to find a step by step guide, if not there's always YouTube. Hope this helped!
---
Its not a public beta anyhow. It‚Äôs closed.
---
Hundreds of thousands won't be buying services lmao

fuck off bot unless you can get ATVI to 80 bucks

Imagine being lied to that you were going to get passed the login screen and then you never get passed the login screen which Blizzard never wanted you to get passed but didn't tell you that because they were afraid you wouldn't try to login for the test because Blizzard is selfish and only cares about itself. If there had been a disclaimer that not everyone would get in then i wouldn't be upset with how last night turned out. Honestly there is no reason to participate in the stress test because you wont be able to actually test anything. Now if Blizzard wants to tell everyone to "lets break the login server" test then fine.

That sounds like you would also be against different language versions of the game.

All Client side, it doesn't affect the game itself, and streams would look different and "Create two worlds".

Well that's what a beta/stress test is for, one would assume. For them to gather data on what could (is) go(ing) wrong.
---
No one cares. Of course they want money. This isn't news. This is just butt hurt about not being in beta. Believe me I am butt hurt too. Been playing since 04 and, have played on private classic since about 08. Been on the classic hype train for over a decade. Still no invite and, no matter how many I'm a special snow flake why dont you love me. Emails I send to Blizzard they still won't comb my hair and tell me everythings going to be okay.
---
I know what you mean, I was just inquiring because I could not find any information related to the topic. It makes sense though; at this point in the game's development there was a much higher emphasis on the char being the achievement itself rather than an arbitrary tab which might or might not be indicative of a player's own skill.
---
Have a look at some strategy videos. There are many made for this specific issue with regards to private server releases. One of the first things you may actually want to do is go on a flight point run. If you know about the backdoor in the valley of trials, head straight for the ratchet FP. if you die just res at the spirit healer outside it. Then, go straight for the Crossroads, Thunderbluff, Freewind post, Splintertree post and so on. I know this can be long and arduous, but you'll be so grateful for it down the line. When you've gotten all the points you want (you can even head over to Eastern Kingdoms if you want to), hearth back. Hopefully, you'll be around level 3 or so from all the map discoveries you will have done. Although many will be a higher level than you, you'll still be ahead of the curve in  terms of travel. 
---
From this point, the fasting leveling will be grinding, bar none. Get in a nice spot outside the VoT, and spam any instant cast you have. if you don't have one, spam auto attack (not shot) and tag mobs one at a time. Don't be afraid to be a bit cheeky with tagging, but remember, some courtesy can go a long way. 
---
It'll be a good idea to head to a slightly higher level area (6-8) if you can, as there will possibly be less traffic. If you find yourself completely unable to tag mobs reliably, group up with 1 or 2 others. More than that, and the XP won't be worth it compared to questing. If you really want to do the quests, get in a group, and go through them as quickly as possible. Spread out your group for a wide coverage, and don't bother helping each other out unless needed. It's a starting zone after all. Good luck!
---
"nostalgia wears off quickly" totally. its the gameplay &amp; world we're all craving, anyways.
---
Thank you for your reply!
---
Honestly, chat being toxic is his own fault. He acts toxic almost every stream (e.g. talking shit to other players, checking wow forums' comments about himself and opening people's armories to make fun of them, saying how he scammed people, and so on). You want a wholesome chat? Start for being wholesome yourself. Just look at Esfand, he plays the same game and his chat is most of the time positive.
---
But hey, we are on Reddit so we are all haters and spergs.
---
You don't have to dig far to find that 80% of what people see on stream is a character. That's true for most streamers however. 
---
Still an arrogant neckbeard dweeb though. I'm a fan.

Please dont level as tank. For leveling dungeons the tank tree is actually inferior than the other two as it focuses on mitigation and survival.
---
Mitigate too much and you dont generate enough rage. Your weapon damage is crap, so you dont produce a lot of rage, therefore an actual tank will lose aggro easier than a fury or arms warrior in leveling dungeons.
---
Best abilities in arms and fury tree: tactical mastery and enrage. As prot you get crap like last stand which you will use like 5 times until level 60.
---
Going prot is 100% a waste and makes your job as a tank worse.
---
lmao ok
---
The point of the layer system is ideally to avoid what sharding does: Which is that the player is suddenly swapped into a more populated phasing.
---
To quote the original post about layering:
---
&gt; "Instead of balancing players around shards of zones and combining players from multiple realms, layering will allow realms to create a separate instance of themselves to balance their own population. However, unlike sharding once in a layer, players won't leave this layer in favor of a better one whenever they move or change zones, removing the awkward phasing present in retail. The only way to change a layer will be to enter a group, which will have all players from the group in the same layer."
---
In otherwords, the phasing was most likely intentional for some form of testing or another, most likely how solid it works when a large amount is placed inside a layer instantly at launch (my guess, anyways). By the time the game comes out and the layering system is finished, the goal is there to be minimal-to-none phasing issues. You *will never* switch layers.

Man, I love dwarves and IF, but I can't quit horde no matter how hard I try.

They have 3 different models actually. The big model you're talking about, the standard human model and a scrawny model. I believe the playable ones are all the big model.

No, no and more no.

Have a nice day.

Yes but the max distance players/mobs can be seen has always been hard capped server side.

As someone who didn't listen to the intro speech for my Nightelf the first time around, I was completely surprised to find out Teldrassil was a giant stump.

I don‚Äôt mean spoiling in the sense that you‚Äôre thinking of, like a movie spoiler. I mean, the level 60 content will be fresh and done for the first time (in many years) on launch. I meant it more like spoiling your appetite before dinner.

who says for not playing the game? For not paying a monthly subscription fee. I guess I played more Vanilla than 90% in this Sub. (and paid Blizzard for it for 5 years)
---
Yeah, forums are always going to attract the worst sorts.  I was just backing up the nicer players don't take part in the discussions statement. 
---
I don't leave global for toxicity, but just general spam of silly memes.  But I'm sure there is also toxicity.
---
I get your point. But blaming or being negative towards a company like Activition Blizzard for doing things that will make them more money, is crazy imo. Ofc they will do everything in their power to capitalize on it, that‚Äôs how the world works. It‚Äôs predictable and therefor nothing to be upset about. I am a huge classic fan and can not wait to play it. But I will not waste energy on being mad or sad about not having beta. I would rather spend my energy on other things. Especially when the reasons behind me  or having beta, is so predictable.
---
I'm hoping when 8/26 and 8/27 comes that streamers get to level 10 before anyone else :)

Correct. Blizzard is going to do whatever is financially rewarding. Making sure the 150k viewers saw a seamless beta experience is crucial. I think they just over invited and got the hopes up of too many people wanting to experience the test window.
---
Serious question, and I'm not trying to lead you anywhere, but do you think that Blizzard (while getting hundreds of thousands of log-in attempts) were able to pick and choose who to let in, and let streamers access the stress-test server over other people? 
---
I don't know anything about how servers work, but wouldn't think they'd have that power in a situation where they are literally in the process of breaking their servers.
---
Isn't the add-on just a chat filter? I haven't looked into it and don't really plan to further than this but surely automated stuff like this wouldn't even work, auto grouping etc?
---
I bet its closer to 50/50 than current live. There rare a lot of forces driving peoples decisions and a lot of compelling reasons to choose either faction. faction balance isnt really an issue for me, being on a 50/50 realm with only 150 people in 8 months seems much more likely.
---
But blizzard has the technology and capability to mitigate both scenarios.
---
can I get a link to said server list?
---
googled but nothing but private servers came up
---
I agree for the majority of what you said (be ready to get downvoted by this sub tho), wanting to tank as a prot pally myself.
---
This has been discussed a lot though and poll based changes are what I believe will be implemented in the future (2+ years).
---
However Blizzard needs to first regain the trust of its player-base and, right now, this is done ONLY by delivering an authentic, as close as possible, experience Vanilla WoW.

Sorry work was also keeping me from replying to you, but yes exactly what /u/Masterrein said. 
---
Should've included that in the tldr
---
It's not a miniscule detail. It has some impact on gameplay. For those playing gnomes, those playing with and against as well.
---
The point of this sub is for the community to help Blizzard recraft the game that once was. Pointing stuff out like this is an important part of that.
---
Post above you shouldn't have gone off like that, but you shouldn't have either. That's what has no place here.

Ah okay if it's just two ranks per spell that's a lot less intimidating. Thanks :)
---
24/7 bro
---
Bam quit suckin' my ding, I got work in the mornin'
---
of course it hurts, can't disagree here.
---
But why making it a money grab instead a real beta test? 
---
I bet they earn millions trough resubs of vanilla players waiting to get a beta invite.
---
Considering their is only 1 slot in raids for main tank. No and this opinion is stupid.

---
It was a stress test! They were purposefully testing things out. Are people really complaining about that? You should also complain about high level raid boss spawning in starter zones. That is clearly not a Vanilla experience and is detrimental to your immersion.
---
Are you saying that because I haven't played on a streamer server for 18 months I can't possibly know what it will end up like?
---
Gee bro you've never shot yourself in the foot before, have you? How could you POSSIBLY know what it would feel like? Don't be a downer dude, just do it. Stop complaining.
---
Will this be a pain in the ass for blizzard to fix?
---
Not trying to change anything chief. Just getting some thoughts out there for a silly and pointless debate.
---
as a shareholder seeing the sheer amount of interest, even crying, i am encouraged. you fuck faces better pony up in August.
---
Lmao ok bud , what is it like to be omnitient?
---
Sorry but you've definitely eaten all my patience, and you're obviously willing to lie to make your point so it's useless talking to you. Have a great one tho, zingshidu (siq name)
---
Nope. If you can heal you're PvE balance is tied to that. I really missed that about vanilla, and I can't wait. You're just gonna have to wait a couple years for the possibility of playing on an official TBC server.
---
If you really think that then you are one sheltered, naive dude. Really, just go into a certain pserver subreddit and see what toxicity is. Heck, sign into one of them and see the sheer hate, racism and backwards thinking of 70% of the people there.

---
You really are a dense one aren't you?
---
Starting to "balance" classes leads us right to BfA. Do you want another BfA? 
---
Imo, 1.12.1 vanilla wow is the most perfect iteration of class balance Blizz ever pulled. 
---
Sure warriors top charts and are the best tanks, but they face so many pitfalls and hardships vs other players and in the world that it balances out.
---
Same goes for every class..

---
Probably changed for PvP reasons.
---
it will
---
don't worry I don't waste much energy on that :) just want to discuss how others see that.  
---
Again all I am saying is, making it required to pay money is the big issue here. It's not a problem making the Beta limited.
---
This was super helpful! Thanks man! I think I will probably end up doing the fury prot for 5 man's. Gonna be on a pvp server, but my friend is going to be a pocket healer for me so by the time we're 60 we should have some really good synergy. He's also a total tryhard so he will probably learn his class well. 
---
My goal is to try to become an OT for a guild. Will I have a hard time getting geared this way? Long term I wanna be a fury prot tank or just a fury tank if that's possible in raids. 
---
I like tanking but I hate not being able to pvp at all! 
---
Thanks for all the advice again
---
Why were you watching him then? Just don't? Why subject yourself to something that clearly triggers you?
---
Yeah you can do the others. I'm going to keep up on fishing/ cooking/ bandage. I feel like putting in the time for engineering, when I don't really want it will suck. I kind of feel like doing chanting on the main. And gather something. I'm not that worried about the extra dps. Probably tailoring on the priest. Idfk, I just want to bash things, hold aggro on 5 mobs and lol as they die.
---
Blizzard still wants as many people playing as possible. They want $... everyone must accept that sharding allows more people to play and not sit in queue which gets them more players with the potential of more $.
---
Is this wrong of them to do? 100 fucking percent... I rather sit in queue for 4 hours than have this phasing bullshit they call layering.
---
Instant log in now. No problems.
---
always bro :) how's your day?
---
No. Warriors are hard-countered by just about everyone else and are strictly defined by their gear. They have to be boss of SOMETHING, or no one would play them.
---
I got the character creation timeout repeatedly for the first hour or so then it finally let me create it and get in. All you had to do is keep trying and eventually it worked.
---
in this case it's the word though. retard on the internet basically means idiot, it just has a bad rep because it's a derogatory term for people with learning disabilities irl. idk where pepega fits in that category as i don't watch twitch but i'd guess that it's not specifically targeting disabled people but rather people who did something stupid in a game.
---
I understand, this is why I suggested having two types of servers.
---
I think being on the same balance patch for two years will get really stale, really fast. If there's an OP class, it will be OP for two whole years lmao.
---
I think maybe I'll just play and level a druid, then stop playing the game when I hit 60, just to get that nostalgia fix.
---
Whoa man I'm not complaining just showing what it looks like. I reported every instance I got layered. I know this is exactly the thing they're testing for lol
---
Dang it then either my memory is faulty, or the rank 11 mount was exempt of that restriction.
---
Stressful
---
Legion?  You have become the very thing you swore to destroy!
---
people suck /thread
---
Having an open discussion about future is healthy, or so I believe.
---
What's wrong with your original post tho is some of the things you suggest are 100% against Classic philosophy such as barbers and (god forbid) transmog.
---
I've said this before in this sub but I'll say it again, if you need someone to explain why transmog does not belong in Classic, you should reconsider playing or be interested in a different game.
---
But surely you know what it's like to wait in line for free swag or food only to have them run out by the time you get there. 
---
Not saying it's mature, I'm just saying the behavior is easy to understand and isn't representative of some sort of "toxic trend"
---
Awesome. I tried for 3-4 hours then gave up. Glad it worked for one person at least!
---
What you‚Äôre talking about is gone. If you can‚Äôt do it in Retail, you can‚Äôt do it in Classic.
---
I mean retail is unbalanced imo..  Classic is also unbalanced but not terribly. There's 3 or 4 specs that aren't "balanced" but idk
---
no, they are literally manchildren on the spectrum. this is not for fun, these peoples have very real emotional issues.
---
i feel the same way when my stocks are tumbling and i feel powerless.
---
hopefully we all get happy come august :)
---
*ill hold my breath though, these awwtism fucks are deporable and ruin everything*
---
So you've got a group of people that have a board, and like the content on the board, and as classic gets closer, and the beta comes out, it sees waves of new people come in and start circle jerking over streamers.  You suggest the people that started this board and watched it grow, go make another board now so they can enjoy what they had before it got overrun with streamer fan boys?
---
I mean the disclaimer is that the whole thing is prefixed with "beta" in the title. Beta was always enter at your own risk, this is going to suck probably or maybe it will be okay, who knows, it is what it is, we said beta cause it's not finished and fully ready. So anyone who gets mad at anything really just doesn't make sense for me. It's a proceed at your own risk. 
---
I think people are so focused on just because the first to find a flaw and make the most noise about it so they get the most attention. Rather than actually just trying to use it for a few hours then go back open a ticket and say here is my feedback on what I found today, hope this helps... This would actually help the community not just get you more followers on twitch that doesn't really do anything for anyone. 
---
It's a game, yes I pay for it monthly, yes I've been involved with it for over a decade but it isn't the end of the world. It's also a BETA.
---
100% this. I was trying to point this out yesterday and was getting nothing but downvotes and people just outright fabricating information.
---
Nazi is the new cool word retards like to spew. It‚Äôs like the ‚Äúeverybody got aids‚Äù song from Team America movie.
---
This is just moving the goalposts. I think it's what, the third time Blizzard has done that? Sure, layering mitigates that one issue, but that's barely a solution. It's just sharding with a mask on.
---
Considering they still plan to have server-sized populations on each layer, they aren't even solving the population problems, which is the argument every Blizzard defender used when they announced they were going to shard the starter zones. (Where are those people now?)
---
And of course, if a month ago I said "they are totally going to shard the entire world, and not just the starting zones" I'd be chastised  for it. And guess what, that's exactly what they are doing!
---
We know that if you join a group or a different guild, you move layers. We know that if the layer population gets too high, you move layers. We also know that the layers share one world and one economy. To think that it won't negatively affect the game is incredibly naive. To think that Blizzard won't move the goalposts yet again is extremely naive.
---
After you've had some time to think about what an entitled jealous crybaby you've been, you'll be logging in for Classic along with everybody else.
---
It was a BETA STRESS TEST and it served its purpose.  Every player who was bit-banging on the login server, but didn't get in, contributed to the data that Blizzard needed to help ensure a better launch in 3 months.  So you didn't get in after a measly 30 minutes of trying.  So what?!  Were you going to cure cancer in those 30 minutes if you spent it elsewhere?
---
You really need to get over yourself and stop expecting the world to stop and start at your convenience.
---
that's my bro &lt;3
---
The wording of the entire stress test process has constantly stated the stress was about being *in the game world*, not being at the login server or character creation screens.
---
Otherwise why bother with a level cap?
---
I mean... is this so hard to comprehend?  People wanted to stress the **world server** not the login server or character creation.  A certain amount of frustration is warranted.  These are people that wanted to so very badly to play and now the goalposts of "stress test" have been moved so you can tell them to sit down and shut up.
---
What? Whats the definition of hybrid then? Why do shamans have  to pay hybrid tax if they can only perform the same amount of roles as a warrior then?
---
Eh. I dunno. People still wear some of that tier 2 on retail and it looks okay. You see it both on heirlooms and on transmogs (i.e. judgement).
---
So if I act immature and cater my streams to 10 year olds and get massive viewership of toxic memesters I get access to Classic WoW beta, but being a long time Blizzard game supporter since Rock n' Roll Racing on the SEGA isn't good enough. Got it...
---
I think it‚Äôs more the catering to someone who is just playing the game to make money (like Towliee who‚Äôs openly said he hated vanilla but is playing it since it‚Äôs top on Twitch) vs the thousands of fans who have been dreaming of the opportunity. It‚Äôs also the whole, streamers seemed to get a special entry into the stress tests while everyone else had to sit and wait. Again? I understand why blizzard does it and the economics behind it, I‚Äôm just explaining that people don‚Äôt like feeling left out because someone more popular than them gets the things they want easier.
---
when you have 120 levels to get threw in less than it took to do 60 in classic the ding and GZ loose a lot of value.
---
there is a reason why the main team has talked about compessing the levels back down to 60. personally i think as a system 60 levels base game and 10 levels for the expantion is just a feel good point.
---
you're just looking at a facade and thinking it's the entirety of who the streamer is, maybe it is, maybe it isn't, the fact is you quoted only people you liked and then generalised all the others without prior knowledge or research.
---
Good luck, so many people will be playing Warr *because* it's OP at everything. They don't want that taken away from them or to have to compete with others.
---
But but. I'm a streamer. (Lol my channel is small and no one watches me) and I dont have beta. ITS NOT FAIR. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE3EE!!!1!!1!!
---
But all seriousness. I am a small streamer. I would love beta. Blizz please.
---
I've participated in a lot of game stress tests, and in none of them I wasn't even able to log in for 3 hours. My expectations are built upon those experiences.
---
Yes, the goal is to break the system, and I'm pretty sure that anyone here understood that. It's just that there's different possibilities to do so. What people actually expected was to log in, create a character, play, and see how the performance degrades over time until the server finally crashes. Then, it's time to test the recovery system and see how fast, and on with which complications, the server comes back up again and people are able to log in and play again, until this repeats.
---
I think that's a reasonable stress test scenario. What actually happened here was that a very small percentage of players could log in, obviously I don't have the numbers and people who didn't get in are the ones posting here, but feelycraft says that there have been a lot of people who couldn't log in at all.
---
Because they‚Äôre only running 2 servers and if they give all of the stress testers access, the realms will be full. 
---
Why do people feel entitled to play the beta like they‚Äôve earned it or something?
---
Layering will not affect this in any way. From every indication, Layering was active during the tests. The layers have 3000 people, which is about the same as a Vanilla server pop limit. This was just like a new server launch in Vanilla.
---
Requiring an active sub for the Beta sets a bar of dedication. You're paying to play the game, therefore you're more likely to play it.
---
100%
---
Okay, without making this overly-political, it makes sense that this sub is a bit toxic.
---
This is a "conservative" sub-Reddit.  What I mean is, it's a sub dedicated to the good days, to hearkening back and reclaiming those good days - to "conserving" that past.  Why are the good days past tense?  Because things changed and progressed and, in the opinion of those folks, got worse.  The game was changed to cater to "others."   And so these people (the others) that like this inferior product must be inferior too.  And so we hates the others, my precious.  The only way to reclaim those good old days is to back to the past.
---
This isn't a commentary on conservatism in general, since it doesn't *have* to devolve into hate and vilification of "others."  But it often does.  That's why so many seemingly disparate ideologies often overlap - the common denominator is that they like to find an "other" to vilify and blame, and look back to an irreclaimable past as better (coincidentally, that past typically marginalized or nullified the "others" they now hate).
---
I mean, even if it does get fixed, it could still regress and having a tool like this is legit helpful regardless.
---
Wow thanks for the insight
---
I‚Äôm sure if he waited five minutes he would be in the queue just like everybody else.
---
You'll not be able to keep all of them up with your level unless you spend days not questing and focussing on them.
---
1 gathering can be tough enough to keep up with your level.
---
True. Thats why I always go for Dwarven skin armour on my Tauren Druid.
---
I can't have fun in Classic?
---
Reading is not your strong suit is it?
---
One button One action pt. client is okay... So you can't really report anything
---
Experience is converted to gold when you're at a level cap. It's been a feature since 2006.
---
Most humans are below average intelligence with entitlement issues.
---
Water is wet
---
When you're at a level cap it gives you extra gold in place of the EXP you can't accumulate.
---
Stress test cap was level 5
---
As someone in the same boat with beta, something funny happened.  I was invited to &lt;HOME&gt;, soon figured out it was a streamer guild, stuck around a bit.  The guild chat is twitch chat.  It is nothing like a vanilla guild chat.  
---
Not to suggest vanilla guild chats were great, some people never shut up so I‚Äôve always had a tab without G Chat to use when needed.
---
What happened during the stress test is exactly what was supposed to happen. The servers got stressed and now Blizzard knows that they need to prepare much much more for the official release!
---
Yeah, all of these babies wouldn't report a single bug if they got into the closed beta. They think beta means demo.
---
Having two types of servers opens a whole new can of worms (population split, two servers? why not three or four, etc?).
---
Again, as I said, in order to regain its player base trust, Blizzard needs to deliver what they promised, even if that means emulating some stuff that weren't really good in the first place, because you take the good with the bad I guess. I even made my own thread about everything wrong with class specs in Classic and I got murdered by this sub.
---
That said, poll based implementations in the future is what I believe will work the best for the long-term health of Classic, like OSRS, if some change request doesn't get at least 80% (or 90%) approval rate, it's not implemented. That way you evolve the game at the same time you don't "offend" it's sensitive player base.
---
Hell yeah. Ironforge is so good and I had finally convinced myself to play ally for classic and then I saw venruki stream that horde domination in arathi and that was that.
---
"Jebaited" is an emoji on Twitch pretty much, and typing it is basically a chat code for an emoji of Alex Jebailey head to appear. So the 'je' part is from 'Jebailey.'
---
Why did they remove the view distance slider?  Not for objects but for landscape?
---
Ppl who say ‚Äútoxic‚Äù are the most toxic.
---
Hit level 5 on the stress test and felt the urge to go goof around with the alliance in Elwynn.  After a long journey I finally made it to the human starting zone.  To my pleasant surprise I discovered a horde raid was already occupying the area.  I joined up and this is the result.    I am 30 years old now and can say that in my many years of gaming, it's been a long long time since I've had this much fun.
---
Get a job in corporate america for a year. You‚Äôll understand how corporations operate, and realize that as a public company, Activision/Blizzard only does things for ‚ÄúUS‚Äù (the consumer) if it has a long term, growth-oriented revenue generation plan, or, if it has a short term spike in revenues and they don‚Äôt plan to maintain it. 
---
There is NO scenario where a publicly traded megacorp does ANYTHING that doesn‚Äôt have the effect of increased revenues and resulting profit. 
---
This isn‚Äôt about you, it‚Äôs a product, and you‚Äôre a consumer. They chose to do this ‚Äúfor us‚Äù because they are seizing an opportunity to reclaim a massive amount of their lost consumers. If they were sinking costs on this, it simply wouldn‚Äôt be happening.
---
You'll have to run some tests on what ranks are most optimal given your gear level. Once you hit a certain threshold of +healing and MP5 gear, you might be able to downrank one further than before. It may be optimal to keep 3 ranks, depending on your role (raid healing vs. MT healing.) Low rank heal for topping people off, mid rank for decent damage hits, and max rank for when it's really needed. Just go through the leveling and gearing process, make friends along the way and run lots of dungeons. You'll get the feel for it.
---
Yeah, the cry is ridiculous. The idea is that WE help Blizzard make the release date be as smooth as it can and people are getting rage because now Blizzard know they need to improve the servers. Imagine being that egotistical.
---
We SHOULD rage if the release is like that, not the beta tests.
---
There is no server list currently.
---
How dense can you be
---
1.12 balance isn't perfect, tbc got class balance much better than vanilla.
---
Warrior are top dps AND top tanks, what is it about the hybrid tax that doesn't apply to them? Why? I think the dense one here is you, being obliviously dense to the hypocrisy.
---
I don't even play BFA, Never played wow after Cataclysm.
---
He did this last night when no one could play for longer than like 10
---
Minutes
---
Transmog is definitely a hard no. The game lost a lot of immersion the day you couldn't determine someone's power just by how their character looked.
---
Two words man: ring sling. Total game changer for my wife and I as pur little had colic. Being able to still have him close and use both hands was amazing. He lived in his ring sling for a few months.
---
I guess I see what you mean. Wishing you good luck and hope you‚Äôll get your invite mate! Cheers
---
I never understood what you see through the portal as neither the blasted lands or Outland look as luscious as in this image..
---
What Barbers change about the gameplay and social interaction between players ? Nothing. For Dks i said if you have the corrupted ashbringer your character become DK, its not realy serious and then even who will have the Ashbringer on your server ? 2 or 3 people ? Jewlery why not, what's the problem with this profession ? Karazhan is a BC raid and its a good raid designed by the guy who did the BRD dungeon and his location is in the vanilla WoW so what's the problem ? Totems are just skin so... hum ok if you say so...
---
oh... I'm dumb
---
Sadly I can see that happening. The streamer favoritism is insane nowadays.
---
wtf lol cant I have my own fucking opinion?? what is wrong with you
---
I mean your rationale is sound and it's logical. I agree more clarification  would definitely be nice on the fact that stress tests may mean you don't get to play.
---
1) Feral druids are more than worthy off-tanks, and with dedication can even be good main tanks for many fights.
---
I'd agree one of the main flaws of classic is raid balance, but that's how classic was. If you try to rebalance you're going to cause so many side effects, and ultimately that's not Blizzard's goal with it or what the community wants. The goal is to recreate the game as it was, warts and all. In the end every class is viable in every part of the game, just not every spec. Some classes get multiple viable specs for some raids(warriors), some get specs that are viable in more areas of the game (locks, hunters, and the hybrids to a certain degree). At least you know what you're getting going into it.
---
i see
---
Rock on my dude
---
I'm crying night elf tears of elune rn
---
im using wallpaper engine, it doesn't have the toolbar customization but there is an animated dark portal background
---
No, however I have been able to get under Stormwind in the stress test, so there's that
---
It's not the same, but if you're a hybrid spec and you doing your best will only amount to 40% of a rogue's dps, why would anyone ever bring you to a raid? Your utility doesn't even increase the raid's dps much to justify you being there.
---
&gt; If you are stupid enough to think
---
Nice work showing that this place isn't toxic.
---
Just because we are all playing a game that came out in 2004, that doesn't mean you still need to talk like you did back in 2004. You've had 15 years to refine those social skills mate.
---
too bad it sucks
---
It was capped but still adjustable, and it was farther than what is currently available and unadjustable in the beta client
---
Thanks for your input. I was mostly directing this question at the end game healing but that helps paint the picture
---
&gt;all of his savings
---
The guy is a millionaire FYI and he made that money being an insufferable douche to people online while filming himself playing video games in his mom's basement. Just sayin.
---
yeah I dont, I think its funny how you people protect your streamer guru
---
So what are they supposed to do? Stop using the sub?  
---
It hasn't even been a week since the finale.
---
God I feel old.  I know all of those words but nothing about that made sense haha
---
Unironically using Streamer privilege, lol
---
Um... you know it's just part of the regular sub, right?  Chances are many of them have *already* ponied up and are puttering around in BfA hoping their active sub gives them a classic beta invite.
---
Does anyone know if RecipeRadar is going to be updated?  Or a known alternative?
---
Waiting for the rest of the group to make it to the tree. Caocai might have been world first to Hyjal on the stresstest server unless some other came before.
---
Class balance was pretty much shit in vanilla and the best time in this concern was for sure tbc!
---
Im gonna enjoy being able to user ranged weapons as a second weapon on my warrior again.
---
Not like he had that money when his mom got sick. That was way before he started streaming.
---
Even if there is toxicity, the vast majority of us are grassroots MMO lovers who enjoy a challenge. We aren't zoomer stream monsters or flavor-of-the-month gamers, we have genuine passion for a game that many have wanted for over a decade. 
---
Every community has toxicity, but I think you should be the change you want to see in your community. There is a difference in pointing out a flaw, and doing something about it.
---
Group with people and focus on questing. It's going to take a long time, as it did during Vanilla. Enjoy talking in general chat, party with people, join a guild, etc. It's going to feel like a grind but as long as you aren't trying to race, you should enjoy it.
---
It's using the new video settings menus from the retail client not the old vanilla client menus so the options have changed, not sure if they will bring it back for classic
---
They also said if the community wanted it the game could go a similar way as OSRS, interesting to say the least but we will see what happens.
---
it's only authentic if u get bannered
---
If only there was some way to automatically test scenarios like this this without requiring the help of thousands of real people.
---

This is not correct. Soda loves WoW and it is one of the games he plays off-stream. His viewers are not the biggest fans of WoW and thats why he acts the way he acts. Soda litterally cried at Blizzcon  because he was so excited for classic.
---
You seems upset, i said in the original post that i understand why people don't want transmog, but i said as a roleplayer i would not mind it, i think you take my post with you much serious, is just a game boy wake up, i played vanilla like you, and i hated all the extensions after it, i stopped at WOTLK and tried BFA and stopped too.
---
Three items I remember pretty well, the ghost wolf boots from getting general rank, the deep earth spaulders that a full time resto shaman passed on for me a full time PVP guy, and the maexxena amulet, because I was one of the last healers alive for most pulls to cast poison cleansing totem.
---
That's pretty much how you can tell it's a private server transplant. The second you praise Blizzard in spite of layering/x/y/z, you're suddenly a blizzard shill lol
---
The issue with this opinion is there are raid slots for more then 1 healer. You only get 1 main tank. So warriors have to be able to do something else.
---
It's not hard. Decide to preserve Mana or toss big heals. You will have equal to or less buttons then your retail equivalence.
---
All publicity is good publicity. But subscriptions generating publicity is the best kind in this case.
---
That's one possible scenario of a stress test. Layering is untested tech, this was literally the first time it's seen public use. That was the main thing being tested, to see exactly how the servers and the layering tech handled it all, and it resulted in lots of problems. Now they take that data and refine the system and likely come back with another stress test later.
---
People dont know whats good. Or forgot how freaking far the GY runs are after getting ganked
---
I get paid to do what I love, but I don't make millions of dollars by being horrible and toxic towards people. That's the difference and that's what people don't like about him, his excessive toxicity and hatefulness.
---
do you have a source on that?
---
Looks like someone doesn't understand the words "MAIN" tank. The off tank is normally a bear because they are better for it.
---
 ***illiterate*** troll, see my suggestion to have your classic server without changes forever and a server for people (like OSRS) where they change some things based on polls :)
---
The fan bases thirst is not quench able
---
Reminder to never join a streamer guild
---
I wouldn't care so much but having everyone capped at 30 looks like a ton of fun. A normal beta is usually a small portion of a game that you will get to experience when game comes out. The experience to play with a level cap of 30 is either now or never.

Her motivation for the past eight seasons has been to claim the iron throne. Kind of makes sense that when she sees fear as the only way all her lesser aspirations fall by the wayside to her arch fixation.
---
I feel like I'm turning old because of my feelings towards these kinds of stuff. I really am only 25 though.
---
But you know, I probably used to do a lot of stuff in my childhood that made people cringe. I guess it's only fair I do let people have all their Pepega's, Jebait's, PogChamp's, Kappa's, 4Heads and whatever else they think is hilarious to use outside of Twitch.
---
I got one in the second wave. Tho, to be fair in my defense, Ive had EVERY Blizzard beta since Wrath, and ALWAYS submit dozens of bugs
---
IE: If you get in, and want to keep getting in betas.. actually test stuff.
---
People have been spouting ebic may mays for 20 years to be fair
---
Yeah, no. Blizzard have had 15 years of stress testing.
---
Their infrastructure for logins, realm lists, the realms themselves, and layers are all separate. There was no excuse for anyone to sit in any queue; they could've handled all of it.
---
The queues were manufactured. The character creations were turned off after x number of chars limit reached.
---
Blizz just stuck a huge middle finger up to those that sat in a queue for 2 hours and couldn't get in the realm once.
---
They should've been honest with their intentions, instead they used the fact everyone wanted to be in to ensure they hit their internal limits. Once those limits were hit, everyone else were shit out of luck and should've been told to come back later.
---
Tauren will probably have the most peaceful start.
---
for me I think they should let us choose in options which models we want to display on the screen, I know it's for some people not an option but for me it is.
---
Is the camera in combat working as intended? I was playing a hunter and i noticed when strafing, my character was backpedalling to the left, but running normally to the right. PRetty annoying tbh, not sure if its a bug tho.
---
Agreed. I have a guild of players that want to role play and PvP. Give us our server blizzard. They had them in Classic. No reason not to make at least a few.
---
Fixed it with a macro, something like...
---
/stopcasts
---
/cast Raptor Strike
---
It might be stopcasting or something I forgot.
---
You're moving the argument for layers to be used as a means to balance population as a whole though, which you can definitely make a case around, but that is not the subject that brought it into focus. It was to balance a server's *established* population in specific zones until the population normalizes and spreads out over the game.
---
If you want to talk about it being used long-term to balance an entire server's population permanently you can do so, but it's a different subject really. Other than that, naturally it's sharding in disguise. It's there to serve the same purpose as the initial idea to use sharding but with modifications done to make it less jarring and annoying because people *really*  didn't like the idea of implementing modern WoW's sharding technology as-is.
---
i take a different route on fresh servers
---
I explore. It is a little slower, but you can get to 5 without the chaos and pick up some key flight points en route.
---
Undead, my normal, i explore Tirisfal then go Silverpine, down to Hillsbrad, into Arathi, die a few times, up to Hinterlands.
---
That nets you level 5 in 2 hours, sounds horrid i know but better than fighting for spawns.
---
I never got an email or anything to indicate I had beta, I just checked the launcher and had it. Just in case there is anyone just checking their email and not the launcher.
---
I've been experiencing the same, both, but the camera thing is REALLY bothering me, hard to kite
---
like a glove
---
This is wrong, you're calculating with 500 rep per quest, but in classic it used to be 200 rep per quest instead, meaning you'll need 210 turn ins or 42000 of the insect parts
---
standing around capital cities looking at transmog and mounts is EXTREMELY bfa related though
---
So you are going to decide your class/race based on their performance in the starting area?
---
You are going to play that character for a long time, but you are going to leave the starting area after an hour or so. I wouldn¬¥t worry about that at all.
---
ok this is epic
---
I'm seeing how "sensitive" the playerbase is lol, thanks for your well thought replys.
---
Being an annoying asshat is a schtick, now? And you people eat it up?
---
The overall and massive downside to Warrior, unlike all other Hybrids, is the lack of self-healing or healing at all. No, Bloodthirst doesn't count.
---
Yeah this is correct. I'm not sure what that guy was talking about. There is obviously only 1 main tank
---
Same here. Been having a blast
---
I played on a 17" Viewsonic LCD flat screen on release.
---
An insult to actual cartoonishly large buttplug streams
---
I understand entirely but it won't matter when you sleep/wake up the first 3 or days.
---
So many people will be taking off since it releases Monday in NA and that follwoing Monday is Labor Day, plenty of people have taken launch week off.
---
That mixed with the layering bullshit who knows what we'll be able to get through the first couple of days.
---
Humans and undead don't have the 2 races but sure are more popular and will be much more populated than any other starting areas.
---
&gt;Well I still have it now of Course on my lvl 85 warri which I stopped during Wotlk :D
---
Yeah dude.
---
To throw another server in as comparison that averaged 8-11k players depending on the time of day you didn't often see the devilsaur set go for more than 250-300g, and that was with inflation. Early on I bought the gloves and legs for about 90g √° piece.
---
Besides, as said we're talking inflation. Fair reminder is that the economy is effectively hard reset at the start, it will take 2-3 phases before the economy stabilizes enough for inflation to properly kick in. Arcanite Bars would probably not be more than 15g (to possibly 20g) until phase 3 at the least, and even then I have my doubts about it raising that much as supply vs demand plays a role, and arcanite crystals aren't that hard to farm as a resource. Of course I'm basing that on a private server so it could be subject to change but I hope you get what I mean. :)
---
Edit: Original post was removed due to mentioning the server's name, my bad. Apologies if you got the message twice.
---
I did that in 2005... i didn't play much
---
My friend and I made a pact to go to 60 without Google/YT. I know it's gonna be tough but it will be nice to relive our teenage years this way!
---
I tested it [harder](https://imgur.com/a/kDTZu2k)
---
The classic philosophy is having a real community and having to sociabilize with people to win the game, what transmog would change about that ? Nothing, just that people would not guess what my character is wearing but instead of that, i think it's not realy much a bad thing.
---
Yes master. I will spend my life savings
---
That is a good point, something I didn‚Äôt think about.
---
I remembered what was fun for me, didn‚Äôt factor in how it affected other players
---
No, I‚Äôve already made my decision as a troll priest. I‚Äôm just saying for anyone who hasn‚Äôt made their decision yet. If I was rolling a Shaman and didn‚Äôt care about race, I might think about doing a Tauren due to it being far less populated.
---
They did it because of economic realities. The devs at Blizzard have to convince their overlords at Activision. That classic will be a good revenue stream for them. If they can't then they will be hamstrung by bean counters before they even begin.
---
I am 100% sure for the classic Dev team this is a passion project. I am also 100% sure they have bosses who only think in dollars and cents. They have to navigate that. It's sad but true.
---
I'm not saying you are entirely wrong, you may very well be correct, but those are really bad example pictures.
---
You took a picture on a sloped surface and not in the same position (you can clearly see the gnome on the right is physically closer to the dwarf than the one on the left).
---
Why not go inside a building where all ground is level and take a picture next to a wall, it will be a far simpler comparison than what you currently have.
---
Yeah, not sure on bwl. Then again he seemed to talk about the Nefarian LoS strat with conviction, as if had been there. I don't watch his stream enough to be sure.
---
Yeah, and what server will have the more player created shenanigans going on when let's say the gates of AQ open? For most servers it will be similar to it happening on a private server today, while on a big streamer server it will be something new and unique.. A true "I was there moment"
---
Yeah, I've hit a few bugs so far. Nothing major, but I have been reporting them. Was harder to tell last night, lots of lag due to the stress test. Barely got to play. At least I got to play though.
---
Yeah, I played GW2 on shrooms once and that was quite enjoyable. I imagine WoW would be fun as f also. I have a friend who's go to activity when tripping is LoL, everytime.
---
Basically, you want to try to avoid the servers with larger streamers on them
---
I've already had hate from saying I don't want engi. I'd be doing a disservice to everyone not having it, lol. I'm not going for a server first anything though, just some good old fashioned fun. Wife going to gather skin/mine, I was thinking herb/chant. That covers any mats needed for gear and pots, and creates cash flow. Ultimately a guildie main for each prof is ideal, and the mats will be helpful to all. As well as tailor on my priest, kind of covers all the mat bases nicely. People can laugh at the tank doing chants, I'll just duel them, slap them with my fiery 2 hander. Lol
---
he's a sellout then
---
I‚Äôm think Tauren will be the least. They have only a few class selections and many people don‚Äôt like how they look.
---
UD will be awful due to the bulk of the casters being UD for horde.
---
You're missing utility. For instance, enhance shaman provide improved totems. The reason they may not seem as high is because they're rolling nightfall for more utility. 
---
Druids are similar in that they provide leader of the pack and faerie fire. They also will tank, even if they may not be main tank on progression nights.
---
They both still deal fair damage. If they dealt damage on tier with rogues or fury warriors, they wouldn't need rogues or fury warriors because they don't provide utility (save for improved battle shout). 
---
Tldr, balance of utility. Every raid will have feral druids and enhance shaman. Roll what you like, you'll provide something to the raid.
---
A hybrid is a class that can perform the roles of multiple archetypes, such as healing/melee dps/ranged dps/tanking/support/control. "Pure" classes in WoW can do maybe 2 of those roles at best. For instance, rogues can do control and melee dps. Warriors can do tanking and melee dps only.  Paladins heal, melee dps, support, tank in some situations, and can control with repentence/HoJ.  
---
Shamans have ranged dps, support (totems and purge,) are top tier healers, have utility  abilities in the form of the various shocks, and can do melee dps.
---
ITT a bunch of men who pay other men to watch them play video games
---
1. Nice post, looking forward to 27th of August! 
---
2. Burthurt is my new favorite word.
---
The stab yourself with a rock and fall into industrial runoff was actually good read.
---
You can do that with the fucking BNet client itself, believe it or not
---
The daily "i'd like to see these changes thread". Worry not, there's like few thousand more people like you, i hope all of you get your changes. A true classic indeed.
---
I only ever had 2 ranks on my bars as a shaman. Max rank and a "sustain" rank that you could just spam almost indefinitely.
---
As a shaman this meant 6 total. Healing Wave (+downrank) Lesser healing wave (+Downrank) and Chain heal (+downrank) although for the most part the spam was mostly chain heal, and telling the rogues I was peeing on them because of the graphic. 
---
Keep in mind you really only did this once you had a decent level of +healing, as otherwise it was just useless. You needed the +healing gear to carry the spell, not the actual spell itself. May not be viable until kitted out in pre-raid BIS gear or even Tier1/2 mixes

0.25 Blizzbucks have been deposited into your account. Thank you, Shill#837918272717.
---
It probably will. It's a disgrace.
---
What the actual hell did I just read-good god
---
It's not going to be a level playing field and it's not supposed to be.
---
If you don't think streamers will have their epic mounts months ahead of you and me... you are crazy.
---
They will have and get everything they possibly can from their armies... it's why them releasing realm list before name reservations are important; to be able to see what streamers are going where and then you get to decide if you roll there or not.
---
"oh cool another 100$ donation... I MEAN WOW 100$"
---
The clearly cavalier and indifferent lifestyle these people live is not something I think is healthy or anything I want to be around.
---
BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON
---
As long as you're not on a server with one of the top 3-4 streamers you'll be fine
---
Maybe it'll die down here. Polls  and the ever growing divide between the pvp and pve crowds keep it going pretty strong over there. The pvp vs pve debate isn't so bad in Wow since you don't lose your shit or anything relevant really.. and there aren't polls. So hopefully those who dislike it will just leave once it settles down.
---
so, we're down to complaing about font sizes now. cool, cool.
---
To Facebook? I am not a streamer so who knew
---
I wonder if anyone did it with ghostlands etc
---
/r/factorio is another great community
---
I just don't want to be on a server with Asmongold. Is that too much to ask?
---
Forking the player base is a good way to make sure both populations suffer. No thanks.
---
Layering *is* sharding. It's just sharding with a couple tweaks to it and a rename to keep people happy.
---
Someone else had posted an example of cross-realm functionality still existing in the classic client. I understand that it's a bug, but one doesn't accidentally program cross-realm support, but they might accidentally leave it enabled. Layering isn't new.
---
Many people don't like steamers, esports and the like and feel that it cheapens the entire game experience. 
---
Even if the steamers are just a small % of the people who got beta invites they are the most visible ones. Many openly admit that they never even played retail vanilla and again this cheapens and even possibly delegitimitizes the beta a bit as less of an actual beta and more of an advertising gimmick, which frankly it doesn't even need. This again seemingly points to Blizzard prioritizing appealing  to the younger gamer Market who actually pays attention to streamers and to profits over loyalty to the players who have been around and subbed since the original vanilla. 
---
I mean, all this is pretty obvious if you're paying attention.
---
Maybe it will bring some people out of the woodwork, that haven't messed with Wow for 10 years plus. Hopefully that nostalgia vibe will grab some new subs.
---
...and we'll probably see alot of it.
---
And what those polls would be, preserve vanilla and add content or turn in into BFA? If you advocate for balance, you will end up with something that has absolutely nothing to do with Vanilla.
---
Balance kills the RPG part. Homogenization is inevitable.
---
video clips on reddit dont help the devs much, he should simpy use the report button instead of screaming "whaaaaat?"
---
All I want out of this beta is to know where the streamer zergs are going so I can find a normal community server, I don‚Äôt even care what class or faction anymore.
---
Dont ruin it for us, let us quietly make our cowboy hats in peace
---
Why tf would they not have changed this back?
---
Blizzard, don't let things like this slip please. And why is the server not automatically acting like an old one? A lot of changes from retail are being carried over into Classic WoW (and not in a good way)
---
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little noob? I'll have you know I graduated top of my guild in vanilla, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Ahn-Qiraj, and I have over 300 confirmed DKP. I paid for everything on the trainer, every rank, and I'm the top shaman in the entire raid. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on Azeroth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of GM's across WoW and your character is being tracked right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that cancels the pathetic little thing you call your subscription. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, while resto spec. Not only am I extensively trained in restoration, but I have access to elemental and enhancement and I will use them to their full extent to chain lightning your miserable ass off Azeroth, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit windfury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.
---
Taurens and night elf also are the only druids. 
---
I think people are underestimating the amount of druids there will be at launch too so I'm not sure if any place will be less packed than another. 
---
All comes down to layering :(
---
This sub needs a fucking xanax.
---
I love that blizz seems to bring back the funny attitude with classic 2. more pls
---
r/factorio is not only non-toxic, but chocked full of creative and varied content, and inhabited by the most helpful and unpretentious people I‚Äôve ever encountered in a gaming community.
---
Explore.
---
Shhhh, you're not allowed to complain about streamers on /r/classicwow. The streamer's ~~pay pigs~~ fans will just tell you that you're jealous because the streamer is more influential and you just suck at the game and you can't deal with competition (literally I've been told this here).
---
Was this on the server Illidan? I was in a guild called tempest on illidan and I remember a moment like this haha
---
Having an active sub or not has no correlation whatsoever with whether the person in question is a 'real' beta tester or not. Reading the forum post was actually sad. Players raging out they didn't get invited to bets even though they have the oldest account possible. It's incredible how oblivious so many people are.
---
I try to hide chat for every single stream I do watch, the spam is distracting to me atleast
---
100% true
---
I was thinking the same thing... But they will also have higher pops potentially which is also fun, so I am torn on what I'm going to do.
---
The only thing I know for sure is I'm rolling Priest again, probably Human this time, though I do love my Nelf... I know that fear ward is great but I got by without it once, I can again.
---
That's fantastic, isn't it? Just brings the kid back in us adults who used to play this game as a kid. I sure can relate. 
---
I've lost my interest in WoW ever since WoTLK although still playing on and off a bit but it's never been able to give me the same kind of magic that earlier expansions and vanilla did. 
---
And now, after all these years and not even in my wildest dreams did I ever imagine them going to actually release a classic server of WoW again. I'm so hyped I can't fucking wait.
---
I did after the clip ended bro. Just a reaction obviously. I'll send you the clips of me reporting if you want? Lol
---
And also. A streamer who sees a bug can discuss it with his audience, and have more people see it than individual players. Much of what we might think is bugs could just as well be features we forgot along the way. 
---
I have no issue with this. I don't even want in actually, I wanna hype and get ready for launch baby.
---
Well fuck me. You're right. Apparently Blizz condones p2w as long as they're getting their $14.99/mo for each account. That's sad. At least the few pServers that allowed multiboxing had rules against using them for Pvp. Oh well.
---
I could not care less.
---
You did it. That's some dedication.
---
ty!
---
Yes, turning classes into the homogenized mess of BFA by killing the RPG aspect in the name of balance, will surely bring back people's trust.
---
Unpopular opinion:
---
Make a new type of server "Streaming" (alongside RP), and make it bannable to stream in other server types.
---
I play retail but I called blizz last week and they were able to find my account from 05! It could be in my head but I still remember logging out of my mage back then and it was in the same spot!
---
Can you make a phone wallpaper
---
Its never a level playing field on any server, even back on vanilla. Bigger streamers at least have said they aren't going to take freebies in Classic WoW, but we'll see how long that lasts (Asmonbald probably won't last even until 60).
---
The only big negative for me is going to be the insane queue times on those servers. Whatever server Asmon or Soda pick is going to be a 2 hour queue time for a while.
---
There are other ways to advertise that don't alienate players and discriminate based on socioeconomic status, btw.
---
Or, you know, the actual Funimation Dub of DBZ had that line too.
---
Nice to meet you dad, can i talk to this female horde?
---
What a fine day for some gnome slaughter! FOR THE HORDE!
---
Most are below average... you realize that makes no sense :-p
---
If most people are not intelligent then that means the AVERAGE is just lower than you would expect.
---
Arkham?
---
Watching Asmon‚Äôs stream it still showed thousands of people in the layer at launch.
---
It‚Äôs going to be chaos with layering a shit show without layering.
---
nerf lucifron
---
Perfect, this is exactly what I hoping to find. Can you elaborate on rogues golden shower? What animation causes that? Sounds hillarious
---
fair point.
---
Tbf I wouldnt care if I got it, this sub already "proved" to me I am worthles as a beta tester as I have played on a Pserver at least once.
---
You know ... I'm really happy that you made this post because it's important to speak out about these issues.
---
But I'm also really UN-happy that we live in a world where this happens and we need posts like this one.
---
You may already know who is at end of Strat Live and the nature of the relationship between Majordomo Executus and Ragnaros but a lot of us are still waiting to find out.
---
Who hurt you?
---
Just when you thought you were out, we pulled you back in. 
---
I'm gonna go rogue, so I'll just spend some time reliving my days stealthing around IF and mucking around with people, instigating the odd battle, etc. And appreciating the view :)
---
TBC sacrificed RPG elements and fun items to achieve a slightly better balance. Got even worse in WoTLK and continued to get worse all the way up to BFA.
---
Not completely true. The servers that streamers will play on will frequently be full of the streamer‚Äôs fanbase, making it a lot harder to log in and do stuff since a major portion of the server will pretty much revolve around them. A lot of people would rather just not deal with that shit.
---
Dude, the thing is that I don't care about their deepest darkest secrets. As longe as its legal, they can eat dirty diapers and drink chicken blood. I don't care and I dont want to care. Keep that shit to themselves. And I can only talk about streamers I have watched. And why would I watch people I dont like in the first place? Of course I was gonna talk about those that I enjoy(ed). 
---
I could talk about streamers who lead WvW raids in GW2 or that main my favorite HotS hero and it would just fall on deaf ears. There are many good ones. I'm not generalizing anything. And if you like drama streams like Helenalive, sure, go for it. Whatever rocks your boat. I just dont like them.
---
are streamers able to save their names for so no one can take them? if not... maybe we should build an army of people that just go on to all the classic servers and hopefully beat the streamers to their own names lol
---
Classic WoW also didn't have layering, loot trading, right click reporting, launch phases, Streamer Communities. They did have RP-PvP servers.
---
Yet here we are.

Was gonna complain that the monitor is too old but a lot of us were playing on those monitors through the early 2000s either because of hand-me-downs or how little people upgraded their PCs back then.
---
But nah I'm gonna complain about the keyboard being too new. Even an older corsair keyboards are solid hardware wise. Just clean that brushed aluminum chassis and it'll be fine.
---
ONLY to facebook, that's what makes it so pathetic
---
I agree that you can't make a correlation between the Devs and the Management. I am talking 100% about the management of Blizzard.
---
I'm debating what I want to do. I started as a human lock because friends were alliance and when i asked what class was least played i was told warlock. I remember being given bags but no gold by my friends which probably was the better help.

That said I am unsure if ill do pvp or pve horde or alliance. This is a chance to restart truely.
---
And her motivations were to do so to 'break the wheel', to avoid the deaths of innocent people, to be nothing like her father.
---
Nobody is surprised she snapped, everyone is just disappointed it happened in such a dull way in the space of one episode.
---
What...? People complain about streamers constantly on here and the default position is that they are bad. Why does everyone feel it necessary to represent their "side" as the less popular, contrarian side? It's like people that only like bands that are unpopular and stop listening the second they have mainstream success.
---
Do you envy them for making more money than you or that you cannot afford to donate the same amount yourself?
---
Screw haters man. Play the game your way. The game plan sounds nice and just as long as everyone is pitching in and helping each other out it's fine. If they don't like it they can play with someone else. Let's just have fun and bask in the experience that is playing with your family. Trust me, your son is going to remember this for a lifetime. I really wish I could do something I really enjoy with my parents. It's going to be an amazing experience.

I'm not a streamer and I eat only Green-Bio Pods.

But for sure I am not a retard toxic kid like Alexsensual that literally hate this entire subs nor a sheep sucking his dicks while posting :)
---
I had an LCD in 2001
---
Like CX debate? I spent most of highschool was devoted to that and WOW. Also... that whole community is full of toxic edgelords, I should really sub and get the immersive classic experience
---
I was on there this arvo, mucking about trying to get into Northshire and whatnot. Went to work, came home, and the raid group was still freaking going.

I remember in Classic, Gnomes used full sized demons. Do they again? I used to love standing groin level to my Succubus as she cracked her whip.
---
They scaled the demons down in Cata? and it is lame

We should make a cheatsheet for the oldies. (I don't need one or anything, Kappa)

Too soon Blizzard, you have spoiled the end game too soon! - Ragnaros probably

&gt; What we really need is a gameplay/theorycraft related subreddit.
---
What *you* need / want is a gameplay/theorycraft related subreddit. I don't mind this being a meme factory and given what kind of content is being upvoted it looks like many see it similarly.
---
Well if the ‚ÄúNot A Bug‚Äù threads and the proof that Elite damage is in fact accurate is anything to go by... Private Servers have gotten quite a few things wrong.
---
Wrong. I stated that the small UI changes were easily noticeable to most vets. 
---
When I talk about how people feel towards the small UI changes my subject is "some people" aka the small minority who I can understand but don't necessarily agree with. Didn't deserve so many downvotes, in my opinion, but maybe people misunderstood like yourself.
---
I'm almost 100% sure that anyone that got invited to their event in January of this year and were guaranteed for the closed beta will most likely get their names reserved before it's open to the public.
---
Hi, /u/LSFJew
---
I think someone made an animated version of the Classic wallpaper featuring a ragnaros raid there aswell? We'll call that plan B. Thank you!
---
... are amazing!!
---
I‚Äôm thinking rogue as well. Mained it since MoP so I‚Äôve never experienced it in vanilla outside of some very low level private server play.
---
This tactic can be used to solo the first boss in DM:N on a frost mage, neat little tactic.
---
What do you think a stress test is for?
---
Can try.
---
Well the point we kinda discuss is that calling kills world first is valid because game is kinda different in many was than vanilla was. The fact that kills might be easier or meaningless does not change that. I personally think fights will be easier (at least for people who knows what they are doing).
---
Krusty Krab font classic wow here I come.
---
Hopefully not, but I also wouldnt be surprised. Blizz shouldnt be playing favorites for anyone.
---
You seem a very credible source to know their network infrastructure based on a one realm stresstest. Based on a CCEI with many years experience behind it? Or based on configuring your mom's router (; 
---
You're totally right. They clearly aimed to stick it to their community - it was all a rouse! How could I not see the strawman in the field of despair laced with salty tears.. thank you for your wealth of knowledge! 
---
Did you by chance know that login servers are a separate thing from game servers? Permissions, establishing link and all that, and that dropping that link to see what interaction would happen can be useful, see what redundancy you can put in place - make it spike harder and all that is useful? 
---
Also, did you know that the tech field is constantly evolving, that code can be a bitch (especially netcoding) and you can't just copy paste and expect same result regardless of experience? You test it. Thoroughly. Then one more time. 
---
- but hey, provide any evidence that their intentions were not to actually stresstest the hell out of their servers and rather to sit and giggle over those who can't login and it'll change my mind. I'll spin on a dime,  be confused as all hell but 'when I've recovered from the shock, I'll take a compas and carve 'fancy that' on the side of my cock'.
---
Not until recently
---
Yes I do.
---
The biggest communities are in the EU, idk what you are even talking about
---
&gt; eats at the chillest restaurants
---
That would require him leaving the house.
---
Which is their right since they own the game.
---
Imagine feeling offended by a drawing.
---
Dont worry dude, I'm sure milionnaire Asmongold/Soda care when you donate $3 just to hear your message on text to speech
---
Fuck streamers, tbqfh
---
I mean just like the top guilds ruled their servers back in the day, the streamer guilds will do the same. 
---
Just pick a different server and you‚Äôll be fine.
---
It is. Things like this is game design that most people don't understand. That's why current wow is shit, blizzard caved to letting players design the game.
---
Did anyone say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
---
will likely be removed once the real game hits, but report it as a glitch for now.
---
Yeah and you can ask for that in two years after they give us the game as it was. Now is not the time for Classic reforged requests. Muddies the water. #NoChanges
---
No, it is not. Especially if you are looking for a private server like experience.. Aka just enjoy the game itself.
---
Good for you bud!
---
'only REAL gamers will play classic!!!1'
---
try this
---
My suggestion is to play on a vanilla p server in the mean time. I got into the stress test and it feels very similar to any other vanilla private server out there. Give it a shot
---
Hardcores will bench you, more casual guilds will take you. You don't need 40 elitists to complete a raid, you don't even need 20. Stop caring about you DPS and look further than raids. Classic is more than that, and you "weak" ench shaman can oneshot people in PvP. Also warriors will be forced to tank 95% of the time, and the dedication to make them viable as DPS/PVP is trillion times as much as any other class. But you are too busy looking directly into the tunnel.
---
You aren't vanilla player, you have no idea what vanilla is and what you wrote throughout this thread shows this. You never wanted that game, so you come here and preach for someone to take care of you.
---
I think most of the streamer hate comes from for one jealousy. Which is fair. There are players who have been subbed to this game since vanilla who didn't get a beta key and then keys are given to IRL streamers who don't know anything about the game and are only playing it because it's in the top 3 on twitch. 
---
I understand it is good for the game to get more and more people watching it and excited about it but i can see both sides. Blizzard tends to award people who have a following rather than people who have been following blizzard for years.
---
Now there are real problems a streamer brings into the game when they have an audience in the thousands. One problem being mob tagging in classic. As we all know it's first come first serve on mobs. So streamers can have full groups of 5 people feeding them mobs until the quests is complete while normal players have to compete with them. Which honestly if it were just 5 people it wouldn't be an issue really. But lets take someone like Asmongold for example. So far in beta hes normally around 50k viewers. Now imagine if just 5% of his viewers decided to roll on his server to play with him. That's 2500 people. In the same starting zone tagging the same mobs. Obviously this is a problem, with layering the problem is less but its still going to be there.
---
Now imagine the economy on a streamers server. People love to just give there gold and there loot to streamers just to get there name heard on stream. So In classic with a brand new economy streamers are already going to have control of any market they want. Any boe is basically free to them. Shit even Asmon said yesterday it's been over a year since he created an auction. He doesn't need to.
---
And now imagine playing the opposite faction of a pvp streamer on there server. You can be out and about questing your way along and at any moment have a 100 man raid come in and spawn kill you over and over and over again. 
---
At the end of the day to me it really doesn't matter just pointing out the problems that streamers bring to a game like classic. Asmongold and Soda are basically the only streamers that i plan on actively avoiding. Which i plan to play on a pvp server so that eliminates Asmon anyway.
---
The posts sustain me. They insult, celebrate, parody, applaud. They are triumphs of human ingenuity. They are disgusting. I love classic wow.
---
We need more memes. #bringmethememes
---
Discord for chat; private server for play
---
That depends on what you want the function of raids to be. If you view raids as an ultimate challenge then, yes, they are excellent on retail. 
---
If you want raids to be an environment where you can hang out and continue to foster social connections, then the complexity of encounters on retail doesnt really promote that goal. 
---
On the surface I think most people would say they want raids to be hard - but it might be another "you think you do but you don't" trap. People like vanilla wow because it is an immersive world where you build meaningful relationships, and I think old raid design does a better job of that than the new raids.
---
RAGNAROUS
---
Seems like reddit on mobile bugged out and I didn't reply to you directly but the entire thread. 
---
Mobtagging doesn't work because the experience you gain is based on the % of damage you've done to the mob. None of the things you mentioned is the problem. 
---
You're suppose to be gaining 100% of the experience if you tagged the mob.
---
That would be awesome. I think thats a great idea. Let all the big streamers have their own server... let their fan bases follow them. I certainly dont care to get wrapped up into a mob of people because of one person.
---
Didn't want to take it out, but I played Vanilla Beta and after that 5 years happy paying customer for them. 
---
Does it make me better than other Beta testers? Of course not.
---
Does it make me better than any Twitch Streamer? Of course not.
---
Does it show if I am a Classic Fan? I would say so.
---
In the end all I am saying, without being actively subscribed I should have a chance to play the Beta in the coming 3 months with the history of my account and my bills paid to Blizzard. But they make it required to sink money into it first without any promise I can ever play the Beta. That's what I am critiquing. 
---
They could solve problems like this with e.g. Open Beta Weekend. Or just applications to the beta without an active paying sub.  They don't :)
---
You're going on an irrelevant tangent there and missing the point.
---
Short : Don't talk shit about stuff you don't know and act defensive when you get called out on it, end of story.
---
&gt; Where I'm from you reap what you sow and you stick up for yourself when someone shits on you.
---
Justifying negative actions because your experience or upbringing trains you believe they are ok is also not great.  If you perpetrate hate or violence on others you are part of the problem, regardless of your justification.
---
Racist people raise their kids to be racist, does that mean it's ok to be racist?  It doesn't really make sense to say "where I'm from it's ok".  Well where some people are from women don't have rights, children are used as slaves, ect..
---
Like I said before it's an immature to react to hate with hate.  It's an understandable and certainly human reaction, but it is immature and/or not very well thought out.
---
I don't bitch about the priority, it makes so much sense to have it. I just wish streamers like Asmongold would stop thinking they don't have it. They do, and it's obvious. He spent a bunch of time with a tinfoil hat on last night making fun of his viewers because they said he had priority and he thinks he doesn't.
---
He is most certainly right,  vanilla is far from casual friendly for a lot of reasons
---
Yea, that's what I'm suggesting. This is par the course for any game sub.
---
Where was this announcement made, of there being almost no further invites? Sounds like maybe you fell for a hoax?
---
That's how it worked in vanilla. I grouped with shamans on my UD lock back then and mobs wouldn't attack totems unless it was the fire turret one and it attacked them first. It's why earthbind totem is useful - if you're getting chased by a high level mob drop an earthbind and it will slow them down as you get away. If they killed the totem it would be useless.
---
Its the most casual friendly iteration of WoW. There are no daily quests, there is nothing you have to farm every day, etc. There is no fear of missing out on necessary progression if you don't log in everyday.
---
You can be a hardcore raider or a casual raider. You can choose to not raid at all. You can fish and gather all day, or craft. You can farm mobs. You can play the economy and AH to try and accumulate gold. You can do BG's or participate in wPvP. You can just quest on alts forever.
---
You can do whatever you want, at whatever pace you want. If you like WoW, and you want to play it casually, Classic WoW is literally the best time to start playing again.
---
test
---
Classic WoW isn't out yet. Doesn't mean they can't fix things. 
---
Why do you want character models that weren't in classic WoW? Especially when it changes the size?
---
How does that even happen?
---
Who mentioned BFA?
---
Me, I stopped playing in WoD. Haven't played retail in 4 years.
---
OP mentioned TBC.
---
Did TBC homogenize classes and made them loose its identity? 
---
People in this sub seem to think there are 2 types of class spec design:
---
1) Perfect, cannot be changed, don't you dare mention changes, WoW Classic class spec design;
---
2) Dog shit, streamlined, everything feels and plays the same, BFA class spec design;
---
How can a literall link posted to the official forums yesterday transform into a hoax conspiracy over night ? 
---
The people here are insane.
---
If he played and raided in vanilla it sounds like this isn‚Äôt an elevator pitch. 
---
He also already played it in a pretty casual way, so it sounds like he‚Äôs well educated.
---
It‚Äôs almost as if these same vocal minorities are the ones that got the game to the state that BFA is in now....
---
And how exactly does it do that? If people are watching the streams, they aren't playing the game.
---
They're not toxic towards each other though. Not bad anyways. There's always some.
---
Nice I'll give that a look at after work. The censorship is real here lol
---
Just click the three dots, press not interested, then click tell us why on every single one that comes up until they no longer get recommended.
---
WOWC Community is going to be cancer.
---
Then we are 100% in agreement. That being said that's always who management is... so about braiding my hair and telling me everything is going to be okay... (weeps silently into pillow about no beta), not nearly as /S as it should be lol.
---
Agreed, it's all about the fun. If people are pitching in, donating to gbank, we can make a lot of things for everyone. Bags, gear, pots, chants. Makes all the difference. Having people with your mind set is what made the community and guilds so good. The guilds I was in were like a family. The level 50's had np power leveling people. Burning extra mats to enchant greens. That's what I look forward to.
---
Not replying to you
---
The look on his stupid face was awesome
---
This has become the new talking point, but it's not what people were told. The invitation email tells people to play up to level 5, not test the login server.
---
Yeah, we still need a meme subreddit too, but rarely does a single subreddit accomplish birth memes and theory.
---
I'm prob out of the loop, gen question: Do they require an active sub for beta? In that case I'd be tempted to buy a month to try and chance my arm at getting in
---
Double stack is irrelevant, humans and undead are going to make up \~20% of all players on the server *each*. Night Elves and Tauren will have the easiest go of it.
---
It‚Äôs basically a re-skin if a chain lightning spell but with yellow beams that kinda look like pee streams lol
---
Meanwhile, there's literally have a guy that hasn't gotten into the beta who has instead drawn several very detailed pictures of him logging in, creating a character and playing. I haven't seen *him" complain at all.
---
The Overwatch Closed Beta had a massive following too. So did Sea of Thieves. I don't think this is more than par for the course.
---
MAKE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE
---
You should reply to the person you're replying to
---
I've resorted to uninstalling youtube from my phone. Wasted too much time in that clickbait hellhole.
---
Then they should be honest about the fact that ~content creators~ will get a privileged status over everyone else.
---
Blizz stole the line, champ.
---
I just want pleasant to play with.  As the main tank, I kept a pretty greuling pace.  I think I minimized people's contributions.  I definitely was not understanding of others real life obligations: ran raids too late, replaced people who didn't fit my nature view.  I made it a hardcore guild in what was probably not a hardcore group
---
Crendor probably beat you to it.
---
Yeah, I'm sure there will be enough Dwarfs for fearwards. I'll be going human and enjoying diplomacy and a little more Spi. I'd rather not have to be on fearward duty anyways lol
---
I thank all of you for your services o7
---
They should know how many Beta invites they made.
---
I paid $200 for a TBC beta key back in the day.
---
The size changes don't really make sense, I agree with that. At the same time I do feel like you should have the option to use the new models if you prefer the looks of them over the old ones. Especially some faces on the new models look much better than on the old ones (Hello Female Dwarf).
---
If the size really has been changed that much, im all for scaling it back down. But having the option to use newer models would be pretty nice, same as the lighting choice you currently have in the Beta.
---
i think hes saying. reddit users think org was different in WOTLK when they started when it was the same. it didn't change tell Cata
---
I think (am quite certain) that people will race for the first kills, and it's 100% fine for me if people want to do it. I just view it more as speedrunning than actual world first race as there is less if any exploration of the unknown involved.
---
&gt; This test wasn't at all about you getting to log in and play, this was purely about gathering data for Blizzard. Any expectations you had beyond that were unreasonable.
---
This talking point is becoming a popular defense, but the invitation email specifically tells people to log in and play up to level 5.
---
We‚Äôve had a filled drama calendar for like 3-4 years, it‚Äôs memes and still toxic af lmao
---
Hi, /u/jangobett
---
Yea I dont browse r/2007scape for in depth discussions about gameplay. It's about memes, community, and fun
---
Warriors can do top dps, can tank, can reduce armor, can buff with shouts and bring utility, can do ranged pulls with throwing weapons and ranged weapons, have top tier mobility with charge.
---
Everyone: THE BEST PART OF CLASSIC IS DEFINITELY THE COMMUNITY
---
[This sub:](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/471/227/dd0.png)
---
Because, if you actually played vanilla, you would know like 90% of ‚Äúholy Paladins‚Äù were actually ret.
---
There was no armory during vanilla, so as long as people could stack bodies nobody gave a fuck.
---
The top guild on our server poached our prot pally for naxx, despite prot not being a ‚Äúviable‚Äù spec.
---
Recruiting a capable friendly reliable raider, is a completely understandable action as opposed to telling a person how to fucking spec. (Despite the fact that we missed our raiding companion)
---
In fact i would say that there is more of a problem with granting access to the beta without having a sub.  You need a sub to play WoW.  end of argument.  Whether this is retail, or Classic, or Classic Beta, or Classic stress test, or PTR.  You need a sub to play WoW.  
---
I play on a private server but i didnt feel right since it is still technically Blizzard's IP.  Even though i didn't really like BfA, i kept my sub active while i played on private.  Not exactly justified, but it makes me feel better about playing on stolen property.  
---
The game is a subscription business model.  no sub, no game.  If the streamers are pulling in more subs, great!  More game for all of us.  If classic is a success then we get to look forward to further legacy content.  (whether that be more level 60 content or Legacy servers for TBC and WotLK is another argument entirely)  Keep it up Blizzard.
---
Doubt that it's the largest, the ones that are ravenous are just loud. 
---
Plenty of people won't go back to classic because of the time investment - even if they admit it's the better mmorpg out.
---
The echo chamber that is Classic WoW rings very loud because of 2 primary reasons.
---
1. People love mmorpgs but there are zero out that justify mass amounts of people logging in and playing together. 
---
2. BFA is in a terrible place and the appeal of "modern wow" will and has rapidly decreased since Classic is so close.
---
Classic wow will be very successful - but no where near the millions of players they once had.
---
As far as the closed beta hype - it's because it's limited access and people are able to play/stream/watch the adventures of those playing.
---
Its been a week and the hype will die very quickly when it comes to the beta since they won't be inviting anyone else.
---
Who even notices this shit
---
Your ding is very nice.
---
I'm glad it wasn't just me...
---
What's the drug of choice today pal?
---
GMs haven't even touched classic. Everything you've seen is developers and quality assurance.
---
Look for yourself and decide if you like it?

Do you know that you can get a rank 1 parse on patch day by being one of the first people to kill a boss? You are aware of this correct? It‚Äôll show that you had a historical 100% parse on your character page. But it‚Äôll be overtaken by better/stronger/luckier players soon after.
---
After a patch has been out and the volatility of parses has evened out, most parses above a 95% are good players that have their rank primarily dictated by factors they can‚Äôt control (crits and proc timings or lack of mechanics being big factors). So being rank 1 in this case means you aren‚Äôt the #1 solely off skill, you also had luck on your side which could have been screwed up by a multitude of things.
---
If you don‚Äôt comprehend that or acknowledge it, then it is not I that has poor understanding.
---
I also never said he was bad or anything, just that a #1 parse doesn‚Äôt hold the value you (and others) put on it.
---
Then you would bitch about sitting for 4 hours in queue. There's a lot of people out there (myself included) that want to actually play the game.
---
in preparation for this I'm heading back to my alma mater, kicking in the door of Elizabeth hall 112 hooking up my tower and telling the terrified students that im their 3rd roommate for the semester... 
---
Hopefully they don't mind the scattered taco bell trash and empty PBR cans littering the floor as i blast early 2000's pop punk obnoxiously while grinding late into the night. I'm also sure my wife and kid will understand... At this time i would like to be considered as an officer for the vanilla times simulation guild.
---
Last night in the NE starting area with all of our Guards turned into Hoggers, at one point we got an admin message like that that said something along the lines of "I may have gone too far" haha.
---
thanks I did not know about it!
---
LMAO goddamn thats funny. Read it in Phil's voice.  Im still chuckling.
---
All current players in the beta right now had to tick the classic wow beta box in their account page in order to get in. So everyone in the beta right now has shown interest in joining the beta test. Now the next question for Blizzard is to choose whether the pool of beta testers is limited to active subscription accounts only, or there's simply no limits. I guess you could argue both ways which is better, but the way I see it is that it's easier for them to limit it to active subs so there's a higher chance the invited accounts actually play it due to already possessing an active subscription.
---
The more I think about it, the more I feel it's a very subjective matter. It's quite difficult to definitively argue which one is the right way of doing it.
---
INB4 "WHY DID THEIR FRIENDS GET INVITED AND NOT ME". As long as there are closed betas, there will always be those who believe that they are getting neglected and deserves more than others. Pretty much how humans work.
---
I agree the hate for streamers is unwarranted. With that being said, I disagree with some of the things you said. Streamer servers will most likely be very overpopulated as well as unbalanced. That's why I want to avoid their servers. It has nothing to do with the scarab lord since I probably won't be getting that anyways.
---
Also the scarab lord gets a cool mount, that's why people want it.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=416/scarab-lord#screenshots
---
The way I see it is that of course any company will prioritise their paying customers over those that don't pay a cent.. and if their paying customers are enough to conduct the beta test (and there are millions of them), then why wouldn't they just... Use their clients? It's not just business, but common sense. Imagine being a paying customer and getting left out over someone that hasn't subbed in over 10 years.
---
I think the best part of the game is realizing that it is 40 people coming together to do something.  I never got into the 20 man runs as much in TBC because it lacked that magic of 40 people trying to do something.
---
I always wondered if there was some secret room with a tiny door that only gnomes were small enough to enter.
---
I mean yeah, at least the classicwow hermits took longer than 3 episodes.
---
You can't simply stop balancing my dude. TBC had BETTER balance but still had NO balance. If you open the gates, then how do you decide how balancing will continue? Joe got his retri paladin fixed, except Jeff shaman still sucks. Jeff also wants to get what Joe got. If balancing starts ONCE, it will absolutely result in BFA after few years. There is either NO balance or homogenization. Do you think they can perfectly simulate TBC's balance, especially with Polls? What those polls will be like then? "Uh we are blizzard, should we buff stormstrike damage by 3%". I bet the majority of experts will fully review and run the numbers instead of simply clicking "YES!".
---
People that think "small changes to balance" can or will fix anything, are simply delusional. TBC didn't had good balance, TBC was just that &gt;one&lt; step that brought us closer to BFA.
---
This is why I want the sub fee. It keeps out a lot of undesirables.
---
I agree, tbc had great balance while also making every class feel unique.
---
Surely shamans were still not top dps (and never were), but they were at least competitive and now they brought bloodlust, so you could always bring an ele/enh shaman and trust them to at least do respectable dps and help the raid.
---
and depending on what professions it can help you with gear. I remember making some bop blue rob on my warlock. It was interesting when someone asked me to make them one when I said where I got it and i told them no. It took a while to get them to realize that stuff you craft can be bop.
---
Someone needs to notify Chuck Norris for his killing roundhouse kicks stat.
---
Vanilla beta was very sought after. Very few were invited.. some even had to do it via a leveling tournament (like myself and joana did).
---
bgs are not out until phase 3.
---
Also your post starts with a shitty cliche, and ends with some factually questionable conclusions.
---
Well you move camera with mouse and binds you spells idk what to say, bindings are all personnal
---
I've sat in queues before, I can handle it... I understand people born after 2000 "want to actually play the game"
---
&gt;there was a much higher emphasis on the char being the achievement itself rather than an arbitrary tab which might or might not be indicative of a player's own skill.
---
I look forward to unashamedly rocking Tier 1 despite people's BiS lists.
---
They said the last 2 hours today will be something special.
---
People constantly defending the privileged status of streamers is like poor people defending millionaires. I hate to burst the bubble, but they don't care about you no matter how much you fight for them.
---
You loot thunderfury from a quest btw
---
I like the way his contents are either +300 or -300. No middle ground with this fucker
---
Just imagine the hype when they blue ball you for 3 months!
---
Guild wars 1 had 3-4 (can't remember if eye of the North had one) expansions that all had separate campaigns. Best bit is you could start in one campaign, get to max (which was only level 20) and then go into a next one once at max level. For such a small level cap, you went through A LOT of content.
---
Awww who would downvote such a innocent and memorable post lol, anyways yea if i got it i would use it for sure.  I remember getting a Krol blade from an abomination in WPL sold that sucker for 600 Gold!
---
Well to be fair, all streamers are basically sell-outs. When people go full time into streaming the point is then to make money. And the best way to make money is play the games people want to see. Its the nature of the beast that is streaming. Why do you think everyone and their mother play fortnite.

Likely, no.  It has a lot of hype, but you're just seeing it from being subbed here and the quick hype from streams. 
---
Off the top of my head I can only think ArchAge, but I'm sure there have been more.
---
Same people that want post naxx content. Is sub is diseased.
---
Garrosh: "until I fucked everything up."
---
Look up Dark age of Camelot phoenix server. Actually play a good challenging rvr/pvp game. Learn to play.
---
Come back to WoW and kill everyone. There is your guide. Have fun.
---
jesus christ do people actually care this much about afking in elwynn?  the tests were for the devs not for users, that's the whole point of tests.  I'm super hyped to play classic too but i'm not so fuckin obsessed that i care about getting into a stress test
---
One piece of low res in a high res environment isn't nearly as jarring as one high res model in a sea of low res.
---
no, if the streamer is in and you're seeing whats going in, it makes you want to try and get to log in so you can experience it too. Like what happened yesterday with the boss spawns
---
&gt; Nevermind the fact that Blizzard has created a videogame empire and done Billions upon Billions in revenue, while this guy is probably still struggling through English class
---
Ah, yes, money is the only thing that matters and the only sign of success.
---
Definitely hunter, especially for world pvp and solo bgs. Warrior will get kited around endlessly without backup, and hunters are basically gods at that level.
---
The example I'll always remember is the Halo 3 beta.  You could 'buy' entrance to the beta by purchasing Shadowrun for the Xbox 360, as it came with a key to the beta.  Shadowrun is (was) notoriously average to below-average, but in the first week sold about 1000% more copies on Xbox vs PC (I wonder why... herrppp).  
---
If Blizzard said "buy the 15th Anniversary Collector's Edition for guaranteed Beta access" the thing would be impossibly difficult to purchase.  Guaranteed.  They probably missed out on some money, there.
---
They've never tested this version of classic with the modern backend and architecture. They also haven't ever tested the new layering system.
---
I'm sorry :X
---
At least we will get more free hats that way ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
&gt; old definition of insanity is doing the same thing over again and expecting a different result
---
That's an example of insanity and not a particularly good one. Good thing Einstein stuck to numbers.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve heard anyways lol
---
It‚Äôs a CRT, they don‚Äôt work well with photos
---
So you don't know what a hybrid is.
---
&gt; And the capital cities are constantly spammed with anal this, and anal that. 
---
Um... Yeah, isn't that just the authentic Vanilla WoW experience?  I mean, Trade Chat and Barrens Chat became jokes for a reason.  There weren't big name streamers back then causing it.  It was just a thing people did.  You could remove all the streamers, and you'll still get "Anal [Cleave]!" or "Hogger used to live in Kalimdor until Chuck Norris moved there."  And let's not forget Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseekers.
---
Goodness, if the chat channels end up being super mature suddenly (or, worse, dead), I'm going to be incredibly depressed.
---
.... we got classic wow to become a reality. And a release date. 
---
Legit what more do you want? The game is coming out. We can play it, very soon. 
---
WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED?
---
L E E E E E E R O Y   J E N K I N S ! ! !
---
I guess. But I think going online and creating conspiracy theories about how the people who were ahead of you in line received preferential treatment is still a bit childish.
---
I appreciate your feedback dude, does anyone know how would the game run on a dell xps 15 ? I guess it should be fine right ?
---
everything except pvp
---
[Here](https://www.wowhead.com/guide=875/the-art-of-effective-keybinding)

It's important to note that keybinds are personal preference, but this will get you started.
---
It's not an issue.
---
Okay, we will adopt you. Good sales pitch! Lol. We are thinking the same. It's going to be fun.
---
Just because voting kind of works in osrs does not mean it will in wow. They‚Äôre two completely different games.
---
Nothing seems off to me and I'm definitely normally one to complain about things on a computer screen being too small. But it was totally fine for me. The only thing that was small was chat font but there's a setting to make that larger so that was fine as well.
---
Thank you for any feedback
---
Solution: Remove Gnomes entirety.
---
That way Human casters don't have to feel statistically inferior. 
---
After 14 years radiation finally got to 'em.
---
Thats sounds like a reasonable assessment to me.
---
This subreddit has become a karma farm for self righteous pedestal posts
---
It‚Äôs still way too much. You would get like 25-40s for max level quests
---
I felt this.
---
Oh, shit no more beta invites coming? I'm deeply saddened what I'm gonna do not until release.
---
Do you knows that ALL players in vanilla did want some changes and new things too ? We always wanted more in the game even in vanilla period. An improtant part of the game, if you want or not is that players all expected the game to become better but the game turned in the wrong way more and more. So it's just an opinion, i don't say my ideas are the best for the game, or something, but my wishing list for the game is almost exactly the same as it was back in 2005/2006
---
Suggestion sent. Fingers crossed.
---
No thanks
---
They never said it was random, They said invites look at a variety of factors.
---
what is it that makes this sub toxic?
---
i dont get the criticism :o
---
What about all the other people that got in? thousands of people tried to log in and if i would only listen to the sub i would think only streamers got in, whilst in reality thousands of people were online.
---
Clicking slows down your reaction time. If you're doing chill/laid back content then it doesn't matter if you prefer to click.
---
Harder Content / PvP, clicking will hurt you pretty bad. You need keybindings and using your movement keys in combination with your mouse camera to give you precision timing.
---
Hold down mouse camera while using your AWD for clean movement, S is rarely used, but I never unbind it. 
---
By default, your spell bar is 1-=, if you want to begin practicing the feel, start pushing 1, 2, 3, etc with your fingers as you kill mobs/do quests. As you become comfortable, see if reaching to 5 or 6 is possible. Everyone has their preferred reach.
---
When I began keybindings, after I was comfortable with 1-5ish, I began keybinding Shift+1, Shift+2, etc. Now I've progressed to Q, Shift+Q, Ctrl+1, etc. Some people enjoy Alt keybindings, see what fits you.
---
Start small, add a little at a time.
---
You arent even listing archetypes anymore youre just listing specific warrior spells. Tank and melee dps are the two archtypes of a warrior. Dont just add fluff to make your point
---
Sure
---
I don‚Äôt need to play the beta, I already played when vanilla was live. I‚Äôve been checking asmon out and a few vids for the hype because I am hype but I am enjoying this few months I have to get my life together to fully throw it all away again like I did my 20‚Äôs.
---
Not to mention that the grind is something I‚Äôm not exactly looking forward to, not trying to grind on a beta to have it mean nothing. 
---
Unfortunately a large portion of the people whining and complaining are kids who were too young to play back then. I think real OG‚Äôs know what‚Äôs up and have our expectations tempered.
---
Because they are advertisements. They just live and breathe. It's no different from giving review rights to certain publications before a game is released.  Money or goods are exchanged, and advertising is sold to potential consumers. Don't want to he advertised to? Don't watch top streamers.
---
&gt; Best part is that people are burthurt over the streamer race for ruining the stress test when omar gonzales our lord and savior (lead developer on classic) was joing in on the fun and running around silithis with esfand. What is with the entitlement it was a stress test not the actual beta, I do not know if they were actually letting streamers in ahead of people but if they were thats fine it allows those who didnt get access and those who failed to log in the chance to watch it from many different views.
---
Of course they were prioritizing streamers. That's what makes your comment all the more absurd. If it was supposed to be a no-nonsense stress test, there would be no reason to prioritize streamers or to watch them play, because it's just a test of the login servers, right?
---
gota give kudos for people listing their hw specs as $200
---
CBA to look for it but I seem to recollect that Ion mentioned it during their  Blizzcon panel
---
&gt; people are just hypersensitive weenies these days.
---
This to the Nth degree.
---
Doesn't seem any worse than CS1.6 or Halo 2 or RuneScape 2. Definitely worse than I remember old WoW being, though. I'm hoping all of the reasonable people are just keeping quiet.
---
Imagine crying about someone taking a cloak in a beta.
---
I'm an avid PVPer and will be rolling alliance. Please roll Horde.
---
As long as it doesn't end up like Live with 200 almost dead servers and no escape unless you want to pay a fortune.
---
I am not sure if you are just trolling at this point... you make it seem like the whole game is tanking and dps charts, so I will bite and assume all you want to do in this game is to raid.
---
One could argue that warriors are hybrids or not, but lets start with the premise that warriors are indeed a hybrid class, which by definition is a class that can fulfill 2 or more roles in pve content. Now you are crying that warriors have no hybrid tax, but I would suggest you consider the harsh levelling process of a warrior, the absolute shitfest it is to solo world pvp, especially vs mages, and pretty much never hitting your targets because of no hit% talent and how long  it becomes to  hit cap a fury warrior.
---
Before topping dps charts and being the best tank comes a very tedious levelling and gearing process.. and also being pretty kitable in pvp without a pocket paladin.
---
So I will push my point even more... 1.12.1 is the best class balance ever made... just not how your bfa brainwashed brain can understand ;)
---
Because that's 0.1% of the population getting a privileged status for something that according to the defenders is supposed to be a no-nonsense test of the login servers. You're seriously okay with that? What's the matter with you?
---
Who cares about what happened in vanilla? We are living in the current year and I care only about the experience happening today. How to speck is not "how to fucking spec", it's saying dude, we need you for this role, you need to be able to buff this or be good at this. Like saying priests to go for power infusion to boost dps.
---
You should expect to be doing a fucking ton of downranking. Like have at least 5 ranks of healing touch bound
---
I saw something similar on a stream and asked people about it on the forums. They said that Alpha server is mostly Blizz folks and since it's a modern client, the tech is still turned on.
---
I get that, but they really need to turn it off already.
---
I did my part for about 1.5h, unable to login, character creation timed out and so on. Went to sleep, woke up, leveled a Undead Warlock to level 5, had fun, can't wait for release now. Life is good
---
Classic gnomes are harder to click on, this is a massive nerf
---
shut up, i play ele/enh shaman on pserver vanilla religiously. I can insta-burst anyone and it has its own unique playstyle. 
---
But all you care about is pve, you casul.  Go back to pve candyland BFA. Hybrids are pvp classes, you cant change my mind and warriors suck.
---
Play a rogue, get to level 10, then just stealth around and collect the materials. This way you‚Äôre leveling up a money making profession AND you can add that ‚Äúedge of your seat‚Äù feel for your kids when you‚Äôre trying to run away from adds to stealth and repeat.
---
You can use sap (I know it‚Äôs a pre level 20 ability but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs available at level 10) to incapacitate targets on materials and since it‚Äôs a ranged ability you won‚Äôt actually be engaging in any combat. Problem solved. You can do pickpocketing too, though your wife may frown on the stealing part.
---
Another thing is fishing, may not be the most exciting but if you add some commentary you can make it about whatever you want. 
---
Another way to go is to play a priest, then just heal people. You can sit far back and to where you can‚Äôt make out the combat and just heal your group member.
---
1337 AP is E L I T E.
---
Well we're not using that functionality in Classic so they need to turn it off.
---
Can we get a check mark if we like more than 64 polygons?
---
I guess you only have 15 seconds to leave the barrens then
---
Think op was referring to his own health issues.
---
I don't think it's Nostalgia that is bringing players back.  It's the fact that there isn't a game on the market today which offers the immersive world and reliance on the community that Classic WoW had.
---
Honestly the neckbeards are back to WoW. People act like vanilla WoW was HARDCORE AF NO NOOBS ALLOWED. Bro I was like 10 years old playing vanilla WoW and I survived. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúthe dark souls of mmos‚Äù people act like it is. I keep seeing ‚Äúyou aren‚Äôt cut out for classic‚Äù wtf does that even mean. Vanilla WoW is just a slower more social version of WoW. Fuck off with all the elitist bullshit. I feel like these people don‚Äôt even remember the real vanilla.
---
Trivia: Dopefish is also the creator of the meme laddergoat
---
wasn't able to in vanilla, at least at first. I forget when it became allowed.
---
i killed hogger like 10 times today
---
Haha I remember inviting you to the group! We were in the same group. Had a blast, and then couldn't get out of Tanaris lmao.
---
Posted mine on twitter banner: https://twitter.com/mabusgaming

Awesome! Well thank you for my longest and most pleasant conversation thread on Reddit, I have to keep working now sadly xD. Feel free to add me on Discord (JadeSorrow) and on Battle.net (GrimHorror#1966). Feel free to chat me up any time and I'll contact you as soon as I get beta or if not as soon as WoW Classic Launches!
---
First MC kill will be a collection of whatever players hit lvl 60 first. Unlikely it will be a whole guild who's waiting for everyone to level. 
---
Asmons guild will also not at all get the "most dedicated players". If you're more on the hardcore side of the WoW playerbase (classic or retail) you are for sure not watching Asmon's stream, lol. He's pretty much the casual WoW community personified. The same is true for most big streamers, although Asmon is definitely on the more casual end. Anyway, why would other streamers join his guild?
---
"a guy called Dopefish"
---
No, no, no.
---
THE guy called Dopefish.
---
Privie alert!
---
He's funny because he reminds me of all the neckbeard weirdos I've met over the years but to the extreme in every regard. It's the same reason why people like Filthy Frank and Boogie during his Francis rants were funny. A persona magnified to the extreme.
---
Well in the example you provided you would still be on the threat table and therefore the mob wouldnt attack earthbind. 
---
In OPs screenshot the shaman is not in range, therefore not on the threat table.
---
Dude, I don't even know what the fuck your're talking about. And why are you so mad over it.
---
&gt; So it's okay for others you know to have personas but other streamers are all nasty pieces of shit, right ? 
---
I have no idea what do you mean by that. Everybody is allowed to have a persona. Maybe you're not an irritable dingus IRL.
---
There are lots of good streamers, some that I know and some that I don't. I just said that I prefer the ones that act responsibly, especially when it's their main form of income. And I thought different people were allowed to enjoy different things, until the opinion police came knocking on my door because I made a comment on a meme.
---
No, people that are anti-sharding wouldn't bitch about sitting in a queue for 4 hours, because that's the trade off of having no sharding?
---
You're getting downvoted for this but that's the exact sentiment a lot of disappointed people have.
---
Buy an mmo mouse from logitech or corsair. It may feel weird having 12 buttons and your thumb but that muscle memory works fast.
---
At this point Blizz should just take a stance and make it known.
---
I'm getting tired of all the whining about them, that's for damn sure. This op was actually funny, but all the whining and crying about them is just insane.
---
make mage.
---
start keybinding blink only
---
then start keybinding other spells
---
 Because him, Esfand, Josh and Miskif have all said they are? And I think other Method streamers are.
---
get in groups of five to help increase your odds of getting quest kills. be patient. kill non quest things for exp and come back later.
---
I'm OK with some visual updates (hell, there was a very popular repack of private vanilla servers that had HD textures...) as long as it doesn't effect the hitboxes/collision boxes. There's absolutely some instances where the height makes a big difference between gnomes/taurens. Spots where only gnomes can get into, where only taurens CANT get into, etc.
---
I think you mean the Elite trash. People are still asking for it in the official post on the blizz forums. No word/evidence from blizzard on that specific topic yet.
---
You should check retail. Literally every thing youre asking for.
---
Never assume anything with a hyped up fanbase. I'd have no trouble testing login servers. Just wanted to know that I have slim chance to actually play. I'm sure a loy of people who spent their evening feel the same. They're just expressing needless anger.
---
don't. The Blue posts already said don't sub for chance at beta access (and has been soundly ignored by a lot of people). And they're pretty much done in terms of beta participants.
---
The stress tests might require more people, but they'd announce a new round of stress test invites if they feel they don't have enough in the pool.
---
I imagine they might do an open stress test in early to mid July once they feel they've got enough systems in place to see what the servers do when you really open the flood gates.
---
Creating bis list for leveling seems rather silly. You get what you can and continue leveling, bis list are usually for pre raid or raid where you aren't constantly progressing new content like you are with leveling.
---
Why would you put a sword in your offhand?
---
imo it doesn't matter to much for PvE content. I use a stupid accounting mouse, so I just bind all my important keys to the NUMPAD buttons that are normally out of reach.
---
Of course ~content creators~ were prioritized. All the major streamers got in despite a mad rush of thousands.
---
If this was just a no-nonsense stress test, they'd have the same login problems everyone else did, and there wouldn't have been all these special events and interactions with the devs going on.
---
Honestly gw1 hands down one of the best games I‚Äôve ever played. I remember running my friends from Ascalon to LA when they first started.
---
There are notable quest rewards like crescent staff and tunic of westfall. Most people get the notable rewards. Should be able to find a (mostly) complete list of big items.
---
You know that you are capable of being wrong without being an asshole, right?
---
I love the look of dwarf priests in priest armor sets. Apparently I‚Äôm alone?
---
That‚Äôs how it mostly works on retail, the premise group finder just puts people that essentially whispered you already on the list for you to communicate and decipher the best fit further...
---
you do need an active sub but to the bitches saying it's just Blizzard trying to squeeze more money out of people need to get a clue. I'd be surprised if there'd be many people who re-sub just on the low likelihood of getting a beta invite. Maybe those that were on the fence so to speak but again, I doubt too many.
---
Guess waiting is all you can do =) Did you get stress test invites ? 
---
I think they only will invite players to future beta waves if a majority stops testing the beta. I mean its only august .. not forever.
---
Glad Star Citizen made my patience infnite.
---
if you think this sub is toxic wait until everyone here is playing the game
---
I feel this. I also don‚Äôt have an active sub so i can‚Äôt get in anyway.
---
I wish. But i guess constant drama and toxicity on hourly basis for some reason doesn't even deserve a "we don't know".
---
It wont be forever
---
Coming here to watch fellow players shit on fellow players and find a high horse to sit on. God forbid this ever mirror the official WoW forums.
---
And if you dont like it, just remember it is what it is because of changes.
---
Yea but how do you notice some clipping here and there
---
It makes perfecs sense.
---
God I hope I got as lucky as you when i get home.
---
Just managed to get my account back today, finding it extremely hard to get back into it though lol
---
I hate how all of the subreddits of things I like almost immediately turn into toxic cesspits where if you say anything outside of pure orthodox doctrine, discussion is snuffed out and downvoted.
---
why don't you kill yourself?
---
Yes.    
---
Old client: had view distance setting.  
---
BFA client: has view distance setting.   
---
Classic client, missing for some reason.
---
What about old ironforge?
---
Why Manadar? I thought I was a Tauren warrior in classic
---
The 4 looks like ps. I call fake
---
True, however its still more or less the same game regardless of the Elite damage
---
I was worried about this too but I had seen people only using 2 ranks which makes it easier. But I felt better after playing last night's stress test and realizing how intuitive it is to figure out which rank to use. After healing a few people it was easy to see that I was healing more than I needed and using a ton of mana. Tried rank 1 instead of 2 and it healed plenty still, casted .5 seconds faster, and used less mana. Obviously with 5 ranks or so at max it's different, but still I think after a bit of trial and error it will be easy to see which to keep on our bars.
---
Didn't there used to be a blog by some GM for Everyquest (or something) where he did shit like that?
---
Just roll on a PvE server then. You knew what you signed up for. People are going to camp streamers even if they're not streaming, they always have.
---
How many times did you die along the way?
---
Worded for the uninitiated haha
---
Oh well, those temporary disruptions are worth it.
---
The alternative of having everyone be in the same server instance at the same time just won't work.
---
nah, i couldn't care less about that actually.
---
It‚Äôs harder now because of how spoiled we are with games imo, I couldn‚Äôt get over the fact I couldn‚Äôt jump after playing gw2. Add in not as many people are playing and all my old friends aren‚Äôt there, it‚Äôs more of a memory lane for me.
---
How about the mods don't allow posts encouraging suicide.
---
I love memes just not shit ones that are bad rage faces from 2010
---
Idk, as far as I know they haven't released the names for the classic realms
---
Indeed. OP is talking about totems aggroing on their own, not taking aggro off you the player. E.g when you're in the lyceum and leave a totem behind when running forwards that aggros all the respawning dwarves.
---
Wait did someone say fresh!? wen
---
This needs to be sidebar pinned.
---
I don't think it's smart to base the decision on which char to play for thousands of hours on the first few.
---
But probably one could roll an alt before main due to the launch differences.
---
Realized this a bit too late.
---
Is the base damage the lower or higher of the two numbers?
---
Yea, at least I tried. Honestly, it would be help if they increased the level cap a bit so that beta streamers can faceroll the harder content and increase awareness to this issue.
---
The only thing we can genuinely be upset about is that "summer of classic" was a complete misnomer give summer ends like 3 days after launch
---
Actually if you're just running by a mob and it aggros you, you're on the threat table yes - but debuffing a target should put the totem on the threat table too. If you do nothing to the mob but get in its aggro radius, you'll have like 1 threat at best. 
---
Back in vanilla - the way totems worked was that unless they attacked a mob with a damage dealing ability, they were off the mobs radar in terms of being a threat.
---
Wowservers is 1000% more toxic, you shill
---
If you're a human, and/or if it's a fast sword
---
I kinda doubt I'll be even level 50 before they remove layering. Well see I guess.
---
K sweety.  Keep downvoting
---
&gt; why would I watch someone else play games instead of playing them myself.
---
To learn from better players. Usually people do other stuff at the same time as watching streams too, like playing WoW. It's not like most WoW activities requires your full attention, especially in classic.
---
It was good to see what I named my toons before I came up with coatsman in runescape at least.
---
"Destruction leader"
---
"Green hair machine
---
"Dervish advance
---
"Range and hunt"
---
I went in there to try a forsaken priest, planning to main a shadow priest...
---
Then I tried a Tauren warrior and was loving it (my first character was an orc warrior in vanilla) so now I‚Äôm even more confused and my roll a Tauren warrior haha
---
*Wagnawos
---
You're absolutely right but I have so much time before release and this sounds fun to do. 
---
I guess the biggest arguement I could make against your reasoning is that if I'm leveling a spellcaster, what areas provide the best quest rewards for spellcasters. 
---
The difference in gear power while leveling, probably isnt substantial. But I bet, if you knew where to get the best gear while leveling, you could level more efficiently.
---
I hope it's only implemented only in the starting zones up to lvl10-15, then every one just enters the same layer
---
Locked stress test server. I hope I don't see you in there. It's my server.
---
Don't worry about it mate.  This will all be forgotten about when classic launches.
---
Although definitely expecting people to complain about login ques when the game launches!
---
The backend of these servers today is not remotely the same as it was in 2004. In addition to that, they‚Äôre also still working on implementing layering. It also gives them an idea of what type of issues they may encounter during the actual launch so they can have a plan for them. There‚Äôs a huge benefit.
---
No lol
---
Not even close
---
The game was released 15 years ago and there are P servers.
---
The only people dying to play are ones who couldn't figure out or didn't know about p servers
---
Keep in mind that all the people who were refreshing the sub every day in hopes of a release date probably aren‚Äôt on the sub anymore and are now happily doing something else while time passes.
---
And the same can be said of you, jackass.
---
that is incorrect. Some streamers got keys directly from GMs..
---
It‚Äôs just the bonus gold from being at level cap lol
---
McConnell is the reason
---
they probably quested past level 5. When u cant get EXP anymore u will get increased money as a reward.
---
Shudders in XP
---
&gt;First of all it's a stepping stone to more changes. 
---
This argument is dumb and unfounded. Why haven't the improved water graphics and amount of ground clutter in classic lead to more changes?
---
Layering/Phasing is another example.
---
Adding a toggle so that people who **wanted** to use the new models, would not ruin classic WoW. Nor would the whole "high res models in a low res world" argument as these people are OPTING in to using them and know full well that their character would stick out.
---
crits are always nice
---
Walljumping &lt;3 hope this will be also on the live server working
---
If the cabinet still has the original hardware inside, its an Athlon XP 2400+ 2 GHz - 512 MB ran. according to [cnet](https://www.cnet.com/products/fujitsu-scaleo-600-mdt-athlon-xp-2400-plus-2-ghz-512-mb-120-gb/)
---
Mhm, game ruined.      
---
I mean, why would they test new tech during a beta?! Just fix it.
---
Source?
---
For that to work you have to assume it's possible to find empty layers you can move to and abuse.
---
If they do it right, all layers should be equally populated or close to it, so by moving to a different layer you will find the same situation of where you came from, difficult to abuse nodes and mobs that are not there because people are already actively farming them.
---
People don't understand why players were upset. It's not that there were login problems. It's that if you went to Twitch, all the major streamers had gotten in and were holding special events and interacting with devs.
---
People want to dismiss this as a no-nonsense stress test, but then they also want to defend prioritizing streamers for free advertising. Well, then it's no longer a no-nonsense stress. It's a special media event you were told by email to play in but actually weren't invited to.
---
Well ingot in perfectly fine, I think yall just  need better PC‚Äôs tbh. And before you @me to say that PC specs don‚Äôt impact it this sort of thing is like to remind you that I work in tech and actually know what I‚Äôm talking about.
---
Ahhh yes this makes much more sense now!

Ive been playing classic private servers with updated models and map textures! If i can, blizz for sure can too..hell they could draw a howl new set of textures for everything if they wanted to invest. To me it seems shareholders gave the greenlight for classic cause there is little to no investment cost in it? They dont want to be spending big money on developing an old ass game.

‚ÄúElf of Life‚Äù ‚Äúspartan warrior‚Äù ‚ÄúI hide you will‚Äù
---
Safe to say naming characters when I was younger was probably not my strong point. My RuneScape name ‚Äúsilver knig‚Äù because silver knight was taken.
---
It‚Äôs nice but I‚Äôd prefer it if it was made from the skin of dead Alliance players
---
Oh yes. And I‚Äôm still paying for it lol
---
So vertical walljumping is still impossible, but at least horizontal walljumping works. Good to know!
---
Might be. Has peoples interest from a lot of angles: Blizz Fanboys, old players, twitch people, retail players, mmo enthusiasts.
---
Yea i believe that will be the case. Not sure how much "exploration" of unknown there is in retail nowdays since we have PTR and raids are cleared before the actual release. All the bosses, their abilities and basic tactics can be found from ingame guide. Mythics are hard and needs min maxing and exceptional players but i don't think they call those kills world first because of the "mystery of unknown".
---
Nice! Congratz! I thought I was the only one stuck in the limbo of character creation. You receive an invitation by email for the full beta?
---
I tested the beta client on an HP Compaq 8510w - Core 2 Duo T7700, 4GB DDR2 RAM, 256GB SSD and an NVIDIA Quadro FX 570M. Windows 10 as OS. At the native 1680x1050 resoluton with 100% render scale on the lowest possible settings, the fps was between 25-60, which I consider playable.  
---
I also tested an HP Elitebook 8540w - i7-820QM, Quadro FX 1800M, 1TB SSD and 16 GB DDR3 RAM, Windows 10 as OS. On the "Classic" preset at 1600x900 resolution and 100% render scale, the fps was above 40 at all times, and the game ran very smoothly.
---
If I get a Beta Access I will do it for free...
---
The mans acts autistic to appease his audience because that's what his fans want. They want someone to act like that so he acts like that.
---
I think what people actually hate and just don't realize yet are not the streamers but their fanboys. You can play a game with a streamer without even knowing it but when there's a posse following someone else around in-game, spouting twitch emotes (cringe), loads of people talking up someone you don't even care about in world chat, acting like a streamer is more entitled than you, or shoehorning them into forums like this one, It can be pretty intrusive to your experience.
---
That's not to say a streamer's personality can't be loud, obnoxious, entitled or shitty. Also there's probably some jealousy going on because "content creators" get special treatment from developers but I'd say thats a little different than blind hate.
---
&gt;except you can travel between those soon-to-be-merged Servers 
---
which is a huuuuge downside.
---
this whole layering thing is just newspeak for sharding in my eyes. its only tolerable because it will go away, but i dont like how it went from "only the starting zones for the first week" to "the entire world but only for a phase 1". 
---
to be frank, im sweating over here.
---
Somewhere a teacher just had an aneurism as he read that.
---
There were scourge in hyjal in classic?
---
They could actually do it by just creating more servers as opposed to layering them, and it would work but the problem that causes is the potential for dead servers later on. 
---
This is a necessary evil for the health of the game in the long run.
---
&gt; And let me be wrong and we maybe killed that heroic instance at 66 but we nearly had it clear.
---
No you didn't. Heroics required level 70 and you initially had to be revered with certain factions to enter them.
---
Oh cool, I did not expect the downranked spells to have a faster cast time! Nifty tidbit of info there, thank you
---
Best gold making profession in my option, got myself a super secret fishing spot that rakes in about 75-100g and hour can‚Äôt wait to hit max fishing and have some sexy fishing gear
---
Yikes. That awkward moment when I never downvoted you.
---
But it will be for 1-60, which is when it matters.
---
You're trying to be funny, but you just sound stupid braindead idiot.
---
Rebind these keys:
---
A = Strafe Left
---
D = Strafe Right
---
Q = Ability
---
E = Ability
---
Currently A and D are keyboard turn by default. By removing them as an option you will retrain yourself AND gain two additional convenient ability keybinds.
---
Was just going to say that Stardew Valley is probably one of the most wholesome subreddits out there. That game is so chill that it just rubs off on people.
---
It was definitely the case on Hellscream, Shadow Council, and Argent Dawn.
---
It didn't have the improved water graphics or increased amounts of ground clutter either. Nor did it have layering. 
---
Team NoChanges is dead.
---
Hi, /u/Yesyes_ouioui
---
So here is the issue. What is casual? If as you say you cleared Naxx. That puts you in the less than .5% of the player base that did so. That‚Äôs the hardcore of the hardcore. 
---
I raid a LOT in vanilla but never got past C‚Äôthun. You could easily look at me as a ‚Äúcasual‚Äù compare to your level of commitment needed. 
---
My brothers did 5 mans and pvped a little bit. Never stepped foot into raiding before BC hit. You could view them as casual compared to me. 
---
All of us enjoyed the game as it was. At every level of commitment Vanilla was engaging and rewarding.  Thank you for your time and see you in Azeroth.
---
This is just stupid. I'm simply pointing out what it means for classic if they go ahead with it.
---
&gt; wtf did you expect from a STRESS TEST?? the whole point is that it pushes their services beyond the breaking point
---
If it was supposed to be strictly a stress test of the login servers, then there would be no reason to prioritize streamers and have special events in the game.
---
That is inaccurate, the layering is world wide and isn't attached to specific zones. The layers will be merged when Blizzard feels the population has stabilized.
---
You *think* you do praise Omar enough, but you dont.
---
but you got to beat all those dead horses. How else will the forsaken get mounts?
---
&gt; There are players who have been subbed to this game since vanilla who didn't get a beta key ......  Blizzard tends to award people who have a following rather than people who have been following blizzard for years. 
---
Blizzard has not done anything to reward old faithful players for the last 10 years or so, why do they expect any different treatment now? Streamers on the other hand are worth a lot in advertisement for Blizzard. 
---
&gt; One problem being mob tagging in classic. 
---
The tagging mobs problem is equal for a streamer and everyone else. You can't get credit towards quests in raid. So at max only 4 of the 2500 Asmongold followers would be able to tag for him... Everyone else would actually ruin it for him.. In fact I believe it will be harder for him in those earlier levels than for avarage Joe because chances are there is a significant amount of trolls in those remaining 2496 players willing to do everything to tag a mob from him to create reactions. And if you compare an individual to a group of 5 people I have bad news to you. The way you "survive" those early stages of a server launch is through either beeing creative (jurney to STV or Darnassus/Undercity, if you are interested I can explain why)  or group with 4 other people as fast as possible.
---
&gt;Going to have control of any market they want. Any boe is basically free to them. 
---
The same is true for hardcore AH goblins as well and this does not influence the other players on the server particularly much.
---
&gt; opposite faction of a pvp streamer on there server 
---
You get free content.. A server full of active players doing shit... And anyone can spown camp you in PvP and it will happen regardless of streamer or not.. I doubt a PvP streamer is going to care enought to camp exactly you for hours :P
---
Oh what really? I'll be there online WAY ahead of time then!
---
And they were shit.
---
CRT had refresh rates up to 180hz as early as 1999. Also no input lag compared to 10-20ms on older tfts. The only thing flatscreens had going for them is weight/space.
---
I still have a 21" professional-grade CRT in the cellar. The beast weights 40kg lol. (88lbs)
---
I don't want to disclose my favorite WoW Streamer of all time (he streamed already in Vanilla that I can say)
---
But I am following some streamers which openly said they got the key from a GM they know from the old times. + some GMs even join their streams and chat with the community.
---
Again nothing wrong on that, but there is for sure some invitations didn't go trough the normal criterias. Can't blame them :) good for the streamer, good for blizzard, good for them game. And again don't get me wrong I have nothing against good twitch streamers. Emphasizing good :)
---
They have confirmed it will be across the entire continent.
---
Beta is only for betas anyway. Real alphas like us deserve better.
---
Excellent.
---
Lol, this is part of the classic experience.
---
Every time they opened a new server it was a fucking madhouse for the first 10 or so levels.
---
If you want to just make a small change, try rebinding A and D to strafe.  Now you're forced to turn with your mouse.
---
That was awesome!
---
Nah they didnt i know it for a fact because i did them. This thing i did here : https://youtu.be/SSCi5OubxNQ?t=24
---
Before reaching 70.. let it be 64 or 66 i cant recall. I did it in heroic until the endboss that comes flying in. It was on german servers. 
---
No matter what you say .. i know it to be a fact.. maybe in the beginning you didnt need to faction.. maybe you had enough faction with them after questing.. i cant recall.
---
What i can recall is that i did this before reaching 70... I even held on to one of the blue items until i reached 70.
---
On the contrary. Actually being able to joke about any community drama actually points to less Toxicity overall. I imagine a truly toxic sub would have a meltdown.
---
I just hate that so many quests don't reference the quest giver / turnin person and their location. I'll grab like 10 quests do them over the course of a day or two and then be like...wait where is the turn in for this one? Off to Wowhead for the 90000000000th time.
---
Both. It's the damage range. If you've got one that's like 43-72 and one that's 41-74, well they're so close that it doesn't really matter, but I go off the higher number since I'm an optimist. SS takes your weapon damage and adds a static amount and your weapon damage can be anywhere between those 2 numbers.
---
Nope playing human warrior. If the newby zone has the same 100 players as was in the stress test then I will level by exploration to Dwarf/gnome starting zone the grind mobs to 10.  Hopefully by then I will be ahead of the pack.
---
I think there will be more than the representation of them initially in vanilla, I fully anticipate Mage/Priest/Warrior to dominate the character creation early on.
---
That was pretty entertaining, during the stress test last night it was impossible to do any of the quests in the starting areas because there were so many people killing all of the enemies in the zone.
---
Seeing as the beta goes up to level 30, these talent bugs with rogues should be easy to test. I can't confirm any of these as I don't have beta access.
---
I ask if a fellow Rogue friend could confirm if the following class bugs and features exist in the current beta:
---
1: when sword spec is taken, either all procs, or offhand procs reset the main hand swing timer
---
2: When fist spec is taken, it applied its crit chance to the offhand when a dagger is equipped
---
3: Hemorrhage was exempt from the weapon speed normalization pass on abilities that include weapon damage in their calculation that happened in 1.8. This skill was exempt from this and still had the additional benefit from having a slower main hand aside from the damage increase slower weapons had. Not sure how easy this would be to confirm, but I remember it being part of the reason why after the Rogue review that Subtlety had a massive damage increase other than having native partial armor bypass built into the tree. I specifically remember specing into this and picking up the GM fist weapon (2.9 speed) and using sub and hemorrhage hitting ridiculously harder than sinister strike despite only dealing "weapon damage" without modifiers.
---
For the last bit, I wish I had more solid evidence. I can only recall getting mid-high 1k crits (1.4k+) with hemo, while only getting high hundreds to low 1k crits with SS (800-1.3k, combat claw) when raiding with this weapon in the day. I know it does dip into its own debuff, but that I believe would be a flat damage increase thats only added on after ability calculation.
---
&gt;Second, I'm using a custom font. Here is an explanation of how to do it. The Font I am using is Calibri Bold. This doesn't impact the font sizes, default font would show the same thing.
---
I'm not saying the default font won't show the same thing, but different fonts *definitely* can be drastically different sizes at the same nominal point size. Even on a well-behaving font renderer the width can vary, but on a less well-behaving renderer the height can vary a lot too. You should compare the default font to the default font.
---
Hi, /u/Rockthered_2012
---
Yeah if you have a dedicated bro to heal you it's a smooth ride. I really like the ones with the prot points early on because it still helps in PvP a lot and it's a lot easier to get defense cap etc. Tanking with the full DPS to spec early is doable but it's the ultimate bravery, lol.
---
Also, it sorta depends how your guild works (most will probably be loot council, which ends up being pretty straightforward and chill for tanks). Generally there's just a tank priority, and it trickles down the line, but if even if you're 3rd/4th off-tank you'll start picking tier gear up pretty damn fast because none of your DPS-main warriors will be vying for it at first. Realistically tanks get their tier gear faster than the other overstacked classes like Mage/Rogue/Priest because with those classes, every spec/player wants it, and if you're the primary offtank there's even the chance you get a double drop of a tier piece the first kill and get it night 1 on the boss, lol.
---
A lot of pieces that you'll use for a long time are BoE's (big quel'serrar), craftables, or obtainable in a 5 man/from a quest that will last you a long time, so even those slots you don't necessarily have to worry about for a bit.
---
You'll eventually get DPS gear this way too after a while once your fury warriors/rogues have it, not super up-to-date bis stuff but a surprisingly good amount if you play for a while.
---
oh OOPS!
---
The osrs community is toxic af.   The osrs subreddit is full of great dank memes.
---
There is also going to be many more severs at launch with their own layers each. I wouldn‚Äôt base too much off the stress test
---
Do you think it is more or less effort to integrate this technology rather than just let the servers go, throughput be damned?
---
I tried randomly to get in not constantly. I did crash twice, both times right after accepting a quest. Also reported a few possible bugs, but admitted I might be wrong. like i went to westfall to try to get that /chicken hidden quest and pet, but it didn't show up. Sent a bug but admitted that there might be a level requirement I didn't know about.
---
True. The thing is, if you are ahead of the pack which about 20% of the people that put more time in/play more seriously will do, you will pull ahead much further and faster.
---
If you've played runescape where hopping worlds is a feature of the game at any moment, you'll have an idea of how useful it'll be even in crowded areas.
---
[Fedex!](https://i.imgur.com/sL47lwJ.jpg)
---
I hit lvl 5 in 1:05 with [these](https://i.imgur.com/XbrcwHN.png) flight paths while 100+ were running around Northshire Abbey - and I need to redo the route a little bit to account for things different on beta / stress test than on private servers. Sub 50 minutes seems easy enough to manage.
---
Can't test the 5-10 portion of the route yet, no beta. But it's a (mostly) competition-free 1-10 that should take about 3 hours total, regardless of how many other people are playing.
---
I was looking at mine last night haha!  I found that and a lot of the old prima books and stuff from back then.  Good times!
---
Pillar strat. Mountain side hop to near under the pillar lip, soft hop to the pillar lip, circle around the pillar to the wedge, jump timely into the mountain side, run up to the rock pancake, side jump onto the pancake's side, run to hyjal, mind the drop.
---
with eagle eye, you can stand at the bottom of barrens and see players/mobs at the top end of barrens as long as youre still in barrens. You still have a draw distance of your camera, but it effectively moves your camera with the spell so thats why tracking and stuff works. Though I'd agree it would be pretty taxing if they rendered/loaded stuff in another zone without you ever having the possibility of seeing it (except with eagle eye :P)
---
The invitation email told everyone they'd be logging in and playing up to level 5. But I'm sure it was very helpful for the devs to interact with ~content creators~ on stream.
---
Report it, pray for it to work, please my friend
---
Same, but also the "toxicity" keyword. How would they measure toxicity? Is it on a gradient scale? Certain words? IS THERE A METRIC?
---
There are basically two schools of thought;   
---
1. Keep them CC‚Äôd the entire time. This is harder to do vs Mage because Blink removes stuns and Ice Block removes everything. In theory you can sap someone and get infinite combo points with cheap shot restealth, then do your 5 point Kidney shot, vanish, cheap shot again, prep vanish again etc.  
---
2. Burst them down. This is almost impossible without a strong MH dagger but if you are specs into improved Ambush and Backstab you can do about 3k damage in one GCD. This can kill a Mage outright sometimes but they can also avoid the backstab if they‚Äôre fast enough with the Blink. Then you need improved sprint, pvp trinket, Vanish and Blind to close the gap and kill them.    
---
There‚Äôs no cloak of shadows or shadow step in vanilla so it‚Äôs not nearly as easy to kill casters as it was in TBC
---
&gt; experience first-hand the fluidity of the new client/settings and combat.
---
&gt;stress test
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
In the last season a player named Rick almost won buy simply winning every challenge and finding all the hidden immunities in the game. He basically worked his ass off and no other contestant wanted to work with him because he would definitely win if he got to the final 3. The community was going crazy over this, calling him the worst contestant ever because he didnt play the social game to win etc.
---
Those people are silly. It costs money to host a server and develop software.
---
Torille
---
I've got a copy of the WoW atlas (hardcover), a copy of the dungeon guide, and a copy of the instruction manual that came with vanilla wow.
---
There are several factors to indicate that it was indeed not a "proper" stress test.
---
* It was done on a weekday
---
* It was done in a way that excluded atleast one major timezone
---
* After roughly 40 minutes, the server status changed from "locked" to "offline" preventing further players from entering the server
---
Now I am sure they got to test whatever it was they needed to test, but if this is their magnitude of stress testing, I do not hold high hopes for release day.
---
But hey, more stress tests to come, they might figure stuff out, who knows? :)
---
I only have so much left after the last barrens chat, mind you.
---
I'd do it all again.
---
World of RogueCraft :)
---
They are gonna go ahead with it, that doesn't mean they aren't working on it.     
---
If you think they'll let abuse like that happen, you're being kinda silly.
---
Grats
---
Very interesting. The invitation email said nothing about this, of course.
---
I got this as a present over a decade ago. Glad I held onto it.
---
I want to see peoples reactions the first time they 10 man undead strat or Scholomance/UBRS&gt;
---
I am assuming they will be able to.
---
I twinked 49 as warrior with crusader enchanted taran icebreaker. When crusader procced, people died.
---
I just need unit frames, cast bars and the ability to shift-compare items.
---
same here. along with the versions for BC and WOTLK
---
&gt;All 3 clients here are full 1080p resolution.
---
when you don't understand the principles you are referencing.
---
I asked a steramer to check, he is lvl11 undead priest, his rank 1 smite said 15-20.
---
They are blizzard, they can simply have more servers, more realms at the beginning. Or they can have "layers" which you chose upon picking your server, which you cannot hop around on and will be merged whenever the population dwindles on one.
---
Of course there are probably many other alternatives but i'm not paid to think of them, they are.
---
On the contrary: the pride event happened and the sub melted down for over a week over 7 game tiles.  Them joking about it months after doesn‚Äôt change the meltdown.
---
Except I‚Äôm not wrong.  I wasn‚Äôt an asshole at first but when someone is willingly dodging my question I gave you to either A: give me the source you think you‚Äôre talking about or B: come out and straight up say ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôm wrong I was thinking you could‚Äù.  And then you go ahead and double down on your incorrect statement, then yeah I‚Äôm going to be a dick to you.
---
It‚Äôs statements like this that spread misinformation to others who might not know better and instead of correcting yourself you stand your ground on your obviously wrong statement then you should be mocked.
---
So once again, where is this patch you are referring to bud?  Or how about a video showing your glitch?  Or even a forums post of someone referring to it.
---
See it even crosses over to here.
---
Well people attempt to do it when there‚Äôs one server. Everyone remember the mad dash after server restarts because all the bots and Chinese gold farmers would be uprooted for a minute and you could actually farm for something other than selling gold irl? Or was that just my server
---
No the old horizontal wall jumping is not working, I'm using in this video the new difficult wall jumping from BFA, it's the same as BFA in Classic actually
---
Could you not put custom fonts in classic files?
---
Ahhhh let's all pity bob
---
He's rich but thinks star citizen is coming out. 
---
Poor guy
---
more likely this is dramatically different than current wow so they are trying to test a variety of things that could go wrong based on log on attempts and things that might happen the first few days like dramatically more people in the same zone at the same time and doing the same things and being on a new enough world game thing because they had to rebuild it means that this was research to me.
---
No point getting mad. Just figure out which servers all the streamers are going, and...don't go there.
---
The game will be ours in August.
---
There is going to be 500 people in Northshire day 1 regardless. The layers are still going to have like 2500 people on them. They're doing in layering in place of sharding, so everyone in that layer will be visible and interactable by everyone else on the same layer.
---
So, the starting zones are still going to be crowded af
---
Yes its open for 24 hours. Will close this evening.
---
Yeah... having to carry around multiple sets of gear was good times. Fire resist set, shadow resist set, nature resist, etc.
---
The invitation reads:
---
&gt; Play up to level 5 and help us make sure we can provide the best experience possible when World of Warcraft Classic launches August 27, 2019. Once the stress test period is over, you‚Äôll be able to continue playing on the stress test realm (up to level 5) until Thursday, May 23.
---
It very clearly paints the picture that everyone was supposed to be logging in, playing up to level 5, and testing the layering tech.
---
&gt;It can be pretty intrusive to your experience.
---
It's a true MMO, not what retail has turned into (a single player game in a MMO). There will be famous people on any server that has to build a community like classic WoW almost forces you to do.
---
You have very low standards for memes
---
issen't it incredible how people in 2019 does not know this?
---
Yes this new wall jumping is working on live servers since the end patch of TBC to BFA, but the old wall jumping from Vanilla to TBC is not working
---
Why didnt you just link the esfand clip you wasted a lot of time there.
---
since you literally regurgitated his words ill respond to him. esfand is tiptoeing around the fact that giving it to streamers is just marketing 101. People aren't (or shouldn't be) taking offence to streamers getting in because thats just how it goes these days. (Look at recent games like apex who pay streamers to play for exposure for example)
---
What they CAN be mad about is blizzard hinting at everyone having a chance to get into the beta as long as they opt in and have a subscription (because its just not true). As i said this is marketing 101, advertise the beta which requires a sub. Hand it to streamers to drive up hype for the beta and the product as a whole with the goal of driving sub numbers back up. This process has worked quite well so far in terms of helping their hurting sub numbers, something many popular content creators were quite vocal about. Sure having more eyes on the beta helps a bit in terms of bug reporting but come on, are we gonna pretend like they don't have enough of that in game already (which is proved by the blue post saying they have enough people for testing already). Like they need 60k+ people from twitch chat writing in saying things like "lol aggro range is broken *insert dumb emoji here*", or spam reporting the bug they they just watched a person report.
---
Streamers were always going to get priority thats just how it works these days, it drives up exposure and sales because of that (and pretending this isn't true is hilariously naive [some of you need to google the word priority]). Like i said people shouldn't be pissed at content creators thats just how it is, thats how marketing is done these days you pay streamers to play the game and drive up sales. It was always going to go to streamers, some friends and family list ppl, and yea a small portion of early subs (from around 2004 - 2005 era), along with some others who meet very specific system specs so they can test edge cases.
---
Either way launch will be fun, the game looks good and everyone needs to just go outside and chill a bit lol.
---
Oh... I cry
---
It's not dumb and unfounded if you've paid attention for the last decade. 
---
All else I can say is thank Krishna the classic devs have sense and hopefully they fight the good fight the entire way through.
---
Yeh blizzard said from day 1 this will go on another 24 hours after stress test is done
---
I am leaning either hunter or warlock - basically i am looking for the smoothest leveling for ranged class and have never played either of those classes before. Not really concerned about min/maxing for endgame. With that said, what are your opinions on either class to start classic?
---
Hey, no pity needed. Certainly not rich but it‚Äôs an enjoyable experience for me so I don‚Äôt mind spending the money from time to time. It‚Äôs a game I can sit and play for hours and have fun with so for me, it‚Äôs worth it
---
video about streamers? no thanks
---
It‚Äôs pretty bad if u scroll down far enough
---
Maybe...but the angles also look different.
---
In Dominican Republic for my anniversary. Told my wife to not see me for a solid week once we comeback though. Little happy I‚Äôll miss launch by a week to let the starting zones thin out a little hopefully.
---
Damn, you're lucky. I checked and after stress testing I now have no access at all.
---
.... Like nothing has ever been abused in wow ever. I don't know where your people's faith in blizzard is founded. If they can't be bothered to even consider other idea's, they won't be bothered with this.
---
They've already said they just want to allocate as few resources to classic as they can. In this case there's no way they can prevent abuse because it's literally going to be integrated into how the game functions.
---
Found the toxic guy.
---
Wholesome
---
Just don't fucking shoot the mobs up top in Rend Blackhand's room...
---
It isn't that he makes millions playing video games, it's that he makes money treating others like garbage and acting hateful and cruel towards others. That's the difference and that's why he is hated more intensely than other streamers.
---
Well you got played, thanks for testing that server out for free bud.
---
Yes, and after the stress test finished people have around 24 hours to play up to level 5.
---
I just wanna know what the mouse pad is a picture of.
---
Shill? I‚Äôve played the game for 15 years.
---
Idk, no one else has said they got their beta invites today. And Blizzard did claim a lot less people would get invites. Does seem hard to believe.
---
Sounds good! Thank you
---
Hurry and go get your pitchfork. I'll wait.
---
First 5 lvl are more fun for me then actual bfa :/
---
So....if I sub today can I still get in? I have a 2005 account.
---
Yikes kid
---
well you can also get there with an epic mount an noggenfogger from the field between IF an menethil.
---
Someone literally bid 300$ for access to my account so he could play beta. It's crazy out there.
---
I played on an LCD for a long time.  2004 I know I had one..
---
As soon as people realized they weren't going to be able to log in, they just watched the streams instead. I realize there are a few weirdos who obsessively dual monitor streams while playing to try to get in with their favorite streamers, but they're a non-significant percentage.
---
Oh i see it now! right on haha
---
Is this the Master Guide or what exactly is it? I own the Atlas but I am looking for the Master Guide, they are around ¬£50 on eBay with heavy wear and tear.
---
We can hope :)
---
Not really. I don't see what the problem is.
---
if i wasnt stuck at work id go home and prove it. ah well, believe me or not. doesnt really matter.
---
&gt;Some things I'd like to see:
---
&gt;\&gt;make prot pallys and feral druids worthy of at least off-tanking
---
They are at least worthy of off-tanking.  In some cases they're better at tanking 5 mans.
---
&gt;\&gt;make enh/ele/bal/sha/ret specs do at least 80% the damage of pure specs
---
Could you cite something that says they don't? A large sample of parses of dps meters? Or is this just based off one person's anecdotal experience?
---
&gt;&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt;And to balance this:
---
&gt;\&gt;make raids harder
---
No thanks, I'd prefer a game that isn't retail wow. And that is the road this post is wandering down. If you don't want hybrid tax, don't make a hybrid.
---
What do you do for work?
---
Tips is a scrub
---
This is working as intended. This is how it was in Vanilla. This is not a bug.
---
No, I didn't bother because I saw this coming a mile away.
---
I want blood elves on Horde. I would have been way easier to convince my girlfriend to play horde If we just had one non-ugly race. We aren't all dating goth girls. Blizz needs to throw us a bone.
---
This is critical information. Thank you.
---
I'm looking forward to trying to collect a many recipes as possible.
---
it's time to put the keyboard down my guy
---
Was just going to post this lmao, Tips just a few days ago said he was a "really good at dueling". Resisted almost every stun and still lost.
---
It actually took until the middle of the night for the realm to be unlocked.
---
Congratulations! Especially well done for not going on a whinging spree.
---
Was there, it was a lot of fun!
---
Just read for fuck's sake and you'll understand.
---
I'm not criticising you liking someone, what I'm trying to show you is how you accept similar behaviour from people you like and attributing to persona but completely dismissing it to other streamers you don't like and have no qualms talking shit about when you can't think for a second and just generalise things.
---
That's what I'm talking about.
---
It's almost like a majority of people don't have a beta invite and the only way they can peek into the promise land is watching people who stream it.
---
I used this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbwVvK5XLb4&amp;t=206s the guy says you need a mount but its bullshit
---
You do think that you‚Äòre superior than those individuals that you are describing but creating the 16458433th whine thread about whiners doesn‚Äòt make me think that.
---
Oh shit I completely forgot about that. I had this on my pc :D
---
Free Hat!
---
I refuse to change your mind. Because I love this environment returning to the internet. ‚ÄúCombatting Toxicity‚Äù is such a shitty concept.
---
That was cool. 
---
I cant wait for classic to release.
---
To me the Dwarf looks taller in vanilla, when you compare it to the fence.
---
Larger player base means it's much harder to price fix... The streamer isn't going to price fix,  mat availability will always fluctuate based on the number of players, it will be the same as any other highly populated server. And as for people giving the streamer stuff and giving away the occasional rare item, that effects you in literally no way what so ever. Who the fuck cares? It's 1 copy of the item. That will change nothing.
---
 I couldn't care less about streamers one way or the other, bit every whiny post I've seen on here has boiled down to people crying because they have more friends than you... They do nothing that no other large guild does.
---
Its azeroth on the other side of the portal because you're about to step through to wow.
---
I never played Runescape so I don't know how it works but I know retail WoW very well and I see how effective is server hopping there, it happens all the time since WoD.
---
On retail though there is LFG allowing people to create custom groups specifically to hop and that makes it a joke, we won't have that on Classic, having to do it "manually" will be a hell lot more time consuming and less effective.
---
Also on retail there are literally hundreds of servers you can hop to since Blizz never merge anything, we won't have that many on Classic.
---
Those ahead of the pack will mostly concentrate on leveling more than farming (resources), there could be an impact but it won't last long since layers will be progressively merged down while tourists quit and will be disappear regardless before phase 2.
---
In any case, I expect the merging to happen fast enough to not have a meaningful impact on the game, since tourists quitting fast is the reason why we'll have layering at the start.
---
Thismeans breaking castbar addons too. No thanks.
---
Hey when you learn how to use text to communicate and pass language arts get back at me son
---
its all the scum from /r/wowservers
---
I too dont like Tips.
---
It looks exactly like what I remembered horizontal walljumping to be, so I'm not sure what you're distinguishing as the difference between old and new here.
---
so then the alternative is having a few thousand people in your starting zone
---
It also implies that you have people to invite you to any of the given layers they are in.
---
If they weren't trying to break it, why were they dropping in raid bosses?
---
I'm just glad they made it the 26 hour period instead of just the 2 hours.  I was pretty salty I didn't get in the first 2 hours cause had to smash my face again Uu'nat for 3 hours after that.  But after grabbing some food post raid, was able to log in at 1 am, make a NE druid, and get to level 5.  For not having beta that really helped quench my thirst.  If it was just 2 hours and couldn't get in at all, talk about a getting blue balled lol.  So I know I was able to stress test the login servers for 2 hours, then later on stress test the nelf starting zone, I did my part.
---
Well, Blizzard told people by email to log in and play up to level 5, not participate in a social experiment where they were secretly moved into a "Fake Connect" group to test queuing for two hours.
---
Found the guy who liked S8
---
Im prettey sure i never was nor ever will be horde scum.
---
I see Esfand, I upvote
---
They are not using the legion client. This is misinformation. They are using 8.x, a build based on bfa now.
---
But then they can just give free transfers...
---
I wonder if reporting bugs are noticed anywhere on your account info and help to get beta access or not.
---
Yes but there weren‚Äôt launch events that concentrated the entire playerbase into a handful of zones. They also have sharding and phasing to alleviate some of the issues that Classic will experience. It‚Äôs uncharted territory in a lot of ways for them.
---
love the man
---
It's just a beta... This is Hearthstone and Overwatch all over again.
---
They‚Äôre level 30. Stuff is kind of wonky until you get to 60. At 60 though he should have his shield out while dueling the rogue.
---
Agree with the first two things you said. I never said the mob tagging would be a benefit for streamers more-so just a problem for anyone who is on a streamers server. Including the streamer. 
---
And the difference between streamers and AH Goblins when it comes to the Ah is that Goblins are still going to have to work at the beggining to get there market going. While streamers are just going to be able to buy anything they want whenever they want. In classic with a fresh AH i guarantee Streamers are going to be using other peoples gold to buy upgrades whenever they feel like it, or whenever there is something rare on the AH. Which means less loot for everyone else on the server. (Not that big a deal in the grand scheme of things i know but some will still view this as a problem.
---
And the last part i wasn't saying that the streamer was going to be the one camping you i was saying the followers would. Imagine yeah you get killed by the streamers raid no big deal it happens. You run to your corpse and rez they have moved on sweet. But now you are going to have to deal with the followers. The people that didnt make it into the raid that are watching the stream and following behind the raid. They see you and say "Hey that's the guy that just got killed on stream get his ass!" And you get killed again. Also i understand this is a pretty niche situation but it will happen. Like i said before i don't care either way. And i do believe streamers are a valuable part of the game. And are really only helping the game. Just trying to explain why a lot of the community doesnt want to play on the same server as streamers.
---
It was Crackdown that you had to buy. Or did shadow run also come with the deal? I never bough shadow run, but I do remember the demo on the marketplace was quite big!
---
&gt; If they can't be bothered to even consider other idea's, they won't be bothered with this.
---
How do you know?
---
&gt; They've already said they just want to allocate as few resources to classic as they can.
---
All competitive corporations do this.
---
Humar the Pridelord! Epic skin, but afaik he has normal cat stats.
---
Echeyakee at least has a fast swing
---
&lt;Insert asmon overreacting and saying "DOOD THAT'S CRAZY" here&gt;
---
&lt;Link to asmon smashing his forehead on the keyboard for fucking up in the mage tower goes here&gt;
---
Peak maturity.
---
Damn, those Chad memes really got to OP. Salt levels through the roof.
---
Go spend a day in the anthem sub. This place is like picking daisies!
---
prolly why i dont get in tbh, i fuck around 1 afternoon and uninstall beta and wait for launch with all betas except ow that i got
---
Lmfao /u/jeisot
---
Nythendra doesn't have adds.
---
And let me quote:
---
&gt;that were patchwerk fights or had very few mechanics/movement on them.
---
The Herculean effort it will take by multiple players burning to max level and then farming it will take to take advantage of this will not even matter after 6 months in. You really are over valuing these farmable materials. 
---
Also guildies will be layered together.  
---
So unless your server has 10s of layers (which it won‚Äôt) and you can coordinate players across multiple layers knowing what layer they are all on (which you won‚Äôt really be able to do. No where does it say ‚Äúyou are in layer 3‚Äù) it won‚Äôt matter. 
---
This is a non issue.
---
Please don't delete this mods, memes is all i have atm :(
---
Nothing else better to do with their time I guess?
---
I'm with you on this one. I'll check out this subreddit periodically and maybe catch a stream here and there but im more than content on saving my strength for the real McCoy so I can plow through the grind without burning out. Its more fun just looking for like-minded people honestly!
---
A stress test of the realm servers.  Never got to the realm server.
---
OMG...you guys know how to make it fun at any level.
---
No, the alternative is to have more servers. That's all the layers are, servers stacked on each other. Once the population normalizes, they merge the layers. It's to prevent low pop servers later on.
---
What you're talking about was never a thing
---
&gt; content creators
---
Beta testers.  Most of the Beta Testers got in and yes many of the content creators are Beta testers
---
Berserker rage is at 32 and did he even use fear?

this sums it up:

we do not know how long each phase is going to be
---
Glad to know we're spending our time and effort where it counts the most
---
And 40 Canadian Dollars is 30 United States Dollars you dunce.
---
Lava packs were a small nightmare for me since my fire resist set was pretty meh. Was always praying to be in the group with a pally for fire resist aura and watching that fire ward button like it was my job.
---
Wanting classic+ is cool, and so is being a classic+ fan. You do you.  
---
This is the classic reddit though. Classic fans don't want the same thing you do. Please realize this and form your own community if you want classic+, this is not your home (maybe harsh but its the truth).
---
i wouldn't really say it's a "little" culture considering how popular twitch is now. it was kinda the same back in the day with people using some of the "/" emote commands outside of WoW
---
He‚Äôs not rich, he kick started star citizen with blood money, why do you think he‚Äôs an amputee?
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be upset with the more up to date graphics for the entirety of the game.  Playing games like Skyrim and The Witcher have made me very spoiled with lifelike characters and zones.  I understand that they would actually have to invest into redoing classic in a more up to date fashion and probably push the game back from the release date given but, imo, it would be worth it.  
---
Also wouldn‚Äôt mind them updating the mailing system to how it works now.  Not a huge change and doesn‚Äôt really affect anything.  Might affect server economy a bit but I‚Äôm scratching my head to figure out how.
---
Even though the invitation email said otherwise.
---
How the heck does a level 1-5 human get to Hyjal in \~2 hours? How many times did you die?
---
Your mom is so fat she level capped at 60 because she couldnt fit through the dark portal.
---
There‚Äôs a reason people used to say ‚Äúding!‚Äù In guild chat and receive gratz all around. The good ol days of pride and accomplishment.
---
No excuses dude, hes in full blues going against a green geared rogue. He also resisted half the stuns, you don't have to be 60 to have a shield and 1 hander out, that was just bad plays from his part.
---
My dudes I was in the exact same position... until I downloaded wc3! Holy hell is that campaign fun, and it sets up classic wow perfectly.
---
Ye he did but you don't see it in this clip
---
It's a shady, scumbag business practice. Which the video game industry is currently full of. But the consumer keeps willingly supporting shit like this (see some of the comments in this thread) so it'll keep happening.
---
Example: people keep buying EA games.
---
Except typically your focus on that gear means you're progressing slower overall. Like, I'm sure there's a balance: grinding through specific zones means you'll undoubtedly pick up specific gear; however, if a certain dungeon has a "bis" for that level, that usually means more than one run through that dungeon to grind for it.
---
Yes. They absolutely are.
---
there are 2 months to go that certainly isn't a decisive statement
---
I hope this whole thing is ironic.
---
Logged in for a few minutes, 6 hours after the stress test was over, and realized that if I want to play the first day of launch I'm going to need to find a few people and a secluded grind spot to try and bypass the starting quests. The alternative feels like it'll be 24 hours spent at level 1 trying to tag mobs.
---
Much felt
---
All the beta invites? So what, 10-20 streamers got in among thousands of people and they took all the invites? Somebody's just bitter and jealous...
---
Need to go full sensationalist for the clicks, then hit them with an update a week later
---
^update: ^we ^later ^found ^that ^the ^victim ^of ^the ^bullying ^did ^not ^commit ^suicide, ^instead, ^they ^only ^quit ^the ^game
---
The also made them larger so that they wouldn't start swimming in puddles other playable races walk through.  I remember that change announcement in a Q&amp;A video.
---
literally the next sentence lmao "We‚Äôll regularly reevaluate the need for additional invites as we go through the testing process."
---
The problem is that if this was meant to be a no-nonsense stress test of the login servers, there would be no reason to prioritize ~content creators~ and host special in-game events with the devs.
---
Shame on me... I can name most of items in his inventory from memory... And i played priest back in day!
---
I get that, its sorta spoils the release. I used my MoP to level a panda warrior from 1-85 and sent in a log about the entire experience. (I didn't want to spoil Pandaria at all)
---
what about the right to pursue happiness bitch!   /s  
---
please don't feed me to your bear colony
---
You should try r/freefolk. S8 changed that wonderful meme machine into a whine factory.
---
 i camped that tree by his spawn for a week, first pet  i really went for... then wrath came out and  it was a regular model you could get from Sholazar Basin which was... disappointing.
---
Half stress test is everyone putting abilities on spell bars :d
---
Blizzard defenders are in full-on PR mode today. Don't talk about anything even remotely critical or you are "entitled."
---
Do you think a Ryzen 5 2600 and a RX570 8GB will be having any problems with 1440p? I'm in the market for a new PC mainly for Classic. I want the built to be the best bang for the buck without sacrificing the crispiness of modern day resolutions (got a Macbook with Retina Display as my main workhorse)
---
Good, on pservers sometimes it literally feels like they get their shots of from melee range. But it has to do with batching and server lag, on pservers a hunter can start "casting" their shot and you run into their deadzone but still get hit, in reality however the shot will stop the second a player enters the deadzone and this is a good thing. A good hunter should be able to get you off their deadzone not rely on server lag to win.
---
I had not thought about that, makes me kind of wanna play a tank because i like dedication like this. Thx for ur reply even if im not the original commenter :p
---
I think we are talking about a couple million tops. Maybe China breaks my expectation on this but it would strike me intrigued if the US put up more than a million by itself.
---
Yes, and people are allowed to play until 6:00 PM PDT today, long after the actual stress test window ended, and get to level 5 so even if they couldn't actually get logged in last night then they can likely log in at some point today and do it.
---
I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs not bad, I‚Äôm just saying there are scenarios where stuff gets weird that can explain gear/level disparity. There used to be a way for low level rogues (like, level 5 if memory serves) to get to or near 100% dodge. And the reason I mentioned shield/1h at 60 is because I honestly can‚Äôt remember what level you get certain abilities at that make it more viable.
---
A LOT less hair on top.
---
Actual Blizzard invitation email:
---
I understand if people were upset they didn‚Äôt get into the stress test successfully after the hype and FOMO kicking in, but either way we all get the game in a couple months. We want it to be successful from a dev standpoint and marketing no?
---
To piggyback:
---
Non-streamer servers will have the organic events. This will be complete with shenanigans. 
---
Streamer servers will have more people at these events, but I'd imagine a large portion of that increased number of people is purely entourage. Low leveled toons, people afk, and trolls (not the Darkspear) just there so that they can get Asmongold to fart in their direction.
---
Obviously, not all fans of big streamers are like this, but there are more than zero of them.
---
Is that skull supposed to be Archimonde?
---
Badass, really appreciate this
---
Where? please send pm?
---
Demonology was a real lost cause for blizzard, they could have made that into a proper tank and almost have a couple times.
---
That said, does retribution Paladin and Enhancement Shaman not fit the idea of melee magic users? Paladins with big hammers and holy smiting, shamans with big 2handers or 2x 1h now and shocks into lightning bolts etc.
---
Because the chat is meming back.
---
For example with the old horizontal wall jumping from Vanilla I don't have to take this long path, I just have to jump left and right on the same side of the mountain directly to the top but with this new wall jump I can't do that
---
&gt;there's way too many assholes ~~on this subreddit.~~ everywhere
---
Better get that sub quick then friend
---
The vast overwhelming majority of players that want classic wow absolutely loathe the achievement system. We hate it. Blowing a kiss to Hogger is not worthy of a trophy. Why do I care how many squirrels you've /loved? No, keep that shit far, far away from us.
---
Yes Shamans are great.
---
You‚Äôre the same person?
---
Ohhh
---
I'm learning as I go, thanks!
---
I‚Äôve used this font for many years because it made the damage values much easier to see versus default damage value font. It‚Äôs purely subjective, obviously
---
r/wowservers wants to have a chat
---
Imagine not showing your own name.
---
Interesting! Must have been a Mandela effect in action again.
---
Any idea what happened to him recently? He was pushing things out constantly. Then he got beta access, streamed for a day and then nothing for the past 6 days
---
&gt; That means many of you won‚Äôt be able to log in.
---
Unless you're a major streamer, of course.
---
I edited my comment i hope people are happy now.
---
And you think people would be okay with merging servers, when they started doing it in retail there was huge outrage about server identity.  
---
You're trading one "evil" for another.  
---
my point was, say there were 10,000 players on a server.
---
That server had 4 layers each with 2,500 on it. Inside that there were 500 players in each layer in Northshire.  
---
If you remove the layers then that would put 2,500 people in Northshire.    
---
      
---
**Obviously** these are made up numbers, but you get the idea.
---
What‚Äôs your plan to buff Ret or enhance and not make them literal gods in pvp?
---
I thought you were talking about future bitcoin's price at first.
---
Wow, I‚Äôd almost forgotten what it looked like before all the changes. It‚Äôs more humble.
---
Isn't that weapon really fast?
---
But this is just someone doing testing the game, not really a complaint form what I‚Äôm reading in op
---
One question, I see mention of dishonorable kills which is a new term for me. It's been a long time but I believe I recall the terms HK's for enemy kills. Do dishonorable kills differ from that?
---
Asmongold won't be your friend just because you defended him on Reddit.
---
elemental shaman is absolutely amazing to play. You can do a spec where you can also heal, it's not optimal but you might get raid invites to heal. There's no way you can dps in raids as shaman so you will have to heal, but gearing for elemental is actually fairly easy as a resto shaman because a lot of the healing gear you will receive gives spellpower not just healing.
---
I'm not a streamer and all I've played is BfA and I got 2 beta invites
---
The point of that blue post is to temper expectations. Will there be future waves, 100%. Is everyone going to get beta, no probably not. If you have an account from 2004-2005, odds are pretty good that you'll get something before it comes out in August.
---
hold shit TF has no lvl requirement? 1337 as hell man
---
There is another way. Idk if it's against the rules to mention but I see them mentioned all the time in relation to retail vanilla values. (rhymes with Shmivate shmervers).
---
I'm in this picture and I don't like it.
---
No I'm not, that was Patricia
---
I didn‚Äôt even watch S8, I just don‚Äôt think the memes are anything to write home about
---
I just assumed when the stress test servers said offline they weren‚Äôt going to work for me
---
Retail has automatic teleports to dungeons with a premade team...
---
Yeah fair
---
Yeah......... but the same font is being used in all three screenshots and it is clearly smaller in the second two.
---
Might be an overly anal observation but totally within their development scope if they're making sure the lampposts in Westfall are true white.
---
Agreed, the tiny font really distracts me after years playing on pservers. My hits just feel weaker with this skinny font.
---
UBRS was 15 man and later reduced to 10 man.  It didn‚Äôt become a 5 man until Cataclysm if memory serves.  Scholomance was changed in 2006 to be a 5 man so it likely won‚Äôt be more then that in Classic.
---
They were in a queue, but they didn't get disconnected like most other people.
---
Someone is mad they didn‚Äôt get in beta lol
---
&gt;2
---
That battle in Arathi Highlands was so hype imo. Made for great content and the streamers viewer count confirmed that.
---
But how will I know if I like the game if I don't get to watch x_P00nSl4yer_x play it first?
---
I couldn't possibly form an opinion without hearing someone else's to base mine off of!
---
One of the reasons I'm rolling Horde is to avoid the Purge spam and inturrupts/tremor totem. (I'll be a Priest, I just don't want to deal with it lol)
---
Shamans shine in group PvP. They can provide utility, and if other targets have the enemy attention, you can go all out damage with Ele.
---
Classic isn't really balanced in terms of pvp; especially Wpvp. If  a rogue has cooldowns they generally win; yes even against geared warriors.  It's not really until end game that warriors getting geared out allows them to have that one shot power that lets them win. 
---
Could tips of played this better? yes... Am I surprised he lost; not really. There's a reason a lot of low level twinks were rogues.
---
It most definetly isn't xD You can go on the stress servers and look for yourself if it hasn't been changed.
---
Yea you can always hear him flip the switch the moment he stops streaming, but he's often in discord with Esfand, and everything he says is much more calm and serious, not a constant meme.  His goofy memeing is what makes his stream entertaining.  When he gets serious about a discussion, he's really informative and well spoken.
---
&gt; Why is streamer privilege a bad thing?
---
Are you for real?
---
People who work for Blizzard have always had a Friend and Family list that get first priority on these kinds of things, so that's not really new that streamer got put on the employee's list, even if they were not family or a close friend.   
---
I got into several closed invite ptrs when I actively raided because I played with an employee -- and  only told me later that I was not "randomly selected" to stave off begging.
---
Thank you for this comment! Everyone is acting like it isn‚Äôt a big deal... but it kind of is for players who want default UI
---
I just wanted to see how much blizzdrones would defend a broken system. Deny the truth and downvote facts.
---
yes.
---
I have the opposite problem, I cant stop seeing all of these types of posts as elaborate trolls. I cant imagine people seriously being this dumb.
---
Buy a naga mouse. Make your turn buttons into strafe buttons....
---
I had to get a special plugin for Chrome just to get his homeless face to stop showing up on my YouTube feed
---
&gt; To be fair, if they get streamers in there, they're gonna get more people logging in.
---
No, people will just watch the streams once they realize they can't log in.
---
Even looks like Asmon.  Except its missing the free Tusks of Mannoroth or Chromanitc Sword he was given
---
Tips resisted everything and Perp still won
---
but how else will you know how you are a good player????/
---
Does anyone have an opinion on Orc female vs male animations? I'm rolling Hunter but am not sure which gender to pick
---
I‚Äôm the Chad for once. But in all seriousness, it‚Äôs nice to take a break from games, workout, and enjoy my summer before this game takes my entire life away.
---
Oh my god I've just seen it, that was such a waste lul.
---
I could be wrong, but I remember something like that happening at some point in the past.  Your spells would do slightly more damage as you level, but it's not the same as a rank-up.
---
I get it from both sides. I played until mid/end of Cataclysm, so it's been a few years since I was an active sub.
---
I get rewarding/prioritizing active subs over non-active subs. There's a lot of reasons to do that. At the same time, having older players who might not sub to retail for a variety of reasons come back and playtest is also desirable, just as it is to have people who never played vanilla.
---
I'm not too twisted up over it. If I get in, I get in. If I don't, I don't. August isn't so far away, after all. And, while I'd love to playtest a game I love very much, I'm honestly more excited to actually play, build new relationships and reputations.
---
It's not confirmed it can still be changed lol, there's 3 months until classic. The stresstest was there to test things, after tests you make adaptions , that's how testing works.
---
By what right do you exclude the public?!
---
what kind of productive discussions to u want to have regarding a 15 year old game
---
Im gonna fight over the starter quest mobs for however many hours it takes and im gonna love every minute of it
---
I see your point but I disagree with your comparison. Slash commands were not just popularized by WoW, but if that is where one learned of them I can see the difficulty in differentiating.
---
And as for the size of twitch culture, it's pretty subjective, and it's small to me :p
---
Multi layer farming devilsaurs and black lotus will matter.
---
I wish his name was Sodapoppins :)
---
Yea this is something that's bothered me. All the other font stuff is whatever, no big deal.
---
The heirloom vendors were present in Vanilla as regular NPC's? TIL!
---
This pretty much got me off of being a keyboard turner and clicker. 
---
It works great for just about any game, and outside of WoW I play BRs like Apex or PUBG and it‚Äôs allows you to keybind all sorts of fun things to your mouse. Totally worth it.
---
All these 2004 boomers thinking Undead is better than Troll for spriest PvP. Get with the times, grandpa.
---
So you‚Äôre saying it will still seperate me from thousands of people
---
Will 10 man ubrs be a thing or will it be the 5 man version considering the patch we will be logging on
---
It would be great to not spam their bug tracker with unnecessary stuff we know that weren't there.
---
Lmfao
---
Yes.. they can... but if they did that they'd get a whole different group of people complaining how it ruins the community because people will be transferring around, losing their character name potentially, and maybe even allowing for more ninja looters because people can ninja loot and then when they get a bad rep server transfer off.. and break guilds up, etc.  You can't make everyone happy.
---
Did they? I'll needed a picture of that, too.
---
I have the Beta and I feel like this. The problem with the Beta is that its on a shitty Server with very few People playing. It doesn't feel like Classic. Not to mention the Server is on NA and is full of Retardo-Streamers and their Fanboys.
---
Go Tauren if you want best chance to avoid starting zone problems. Night elf also might not be bad.  Everyone is rolling human on alliance side.
---
fkin casual
---
I would take the lower range for leveling/grinding for consistency, and the larger top end for PvP, for the biggest possible numbers xD
---
I was a Druid all through Vanilla, BC and Wrath, it feels like it would be "Home" but I wonder if more of the familiar is the best choice, kind of looking for things that might lean me one way or another.
---
Started out 35 people, was hard to get horde to attack us so I decided to go solo
---
Yep you're right, damn my old 30-something brain that was ruined by Vanilla wow and Halo 3.
---
It was 6 hours because I was testing the other paths. Furby entrance/exit southbound requires wallwalking or mount+slowfall. Northbound takes you to the troll village. The blue dragon area big tree path requires wallwalking at the final part, that's been patched long ago. So the lone pillar method is all that's left until mounts.
---
‚ÄúMmmrrrrggggllll... (sigh)‚Äù
---
No I don't think it will. They have said that will only be in place for the first couple of weeks. So I guess yeah for your first trip to 60 sure, but beyond that no.
---
Ye it's a conundrum, idk lol.
---
I feel this.
---
Why do hitboxes matter in a game of targeted abilities? There aren't any skillshots.
---
Can someone translate Retard to English?
---
No they don‚Äôt, we have to summon people...
---
Once again I‚Äôm talking about the premade group finder not the LFG/LFR finder.
---
I really don't care if the server community gets disrupted 1 month in. Any friends you make can agree to transfer to the same server. I would much prefer this to the sharding system that is going to enable no life autists to become fucking barons and monopolize the economy.
---
It was fake lmao
---
But I'm not dismissing anyone. QT was a bad example, I just wanted to give a name that people would recognize. I don't know if there's something shady on his stream. I wouldn't know. Citing a bad example doesn't mean I condone shit behavior. Just means the sample of time I had watching his stream is not enough to affirm that he's a "good" streamer.
---
It could be an hypothetical streamer. Just insert a name you know on the characteristics I described. There are many people who gave me a good first impression but turned out to be despicable people. Thank good I can just stop watching.
---
And if you didn't notice yet, english is no my main language. If theres anything that sounds incoherent, just tell me and I'll try to paraphrase. I have a feeling we're arguing over semantics here.
---
Here‚Äôs a good example of old school rogue stealth walking: https://youtu.be/QUeAEntM-Qo
---
ServiceNow is the new IT god.
---
Well my original post was just meant to be a joke, cause 500 players will be a lot in a starting zone, but to the people who want no layering then it would be more like 2000+ because otherwise they run into the issue of creating too many servers, then the future issue of merging and whatnot which IMO would be a much bigger problem than just doing layering or a month or 2.  
---
Blizz can't win, so they're just doing what they can do.
---
Pretty much. He embodies the elitist asshole. It's funny.
---
Yeah, they removed him from the faction too and I don't think Horde can even attack him. Sad.
---
stfu
---
Can we get Tips' POV? For, uh, personal reasons.
---
First drop Nefarian? The staff. First in server. Number one mage for miles.
---
People literally came to Orgrimmar to check me out flexing on bank roof.
---
I don't expect to have that again, i know this, but I also know it will be an experience that's similar at least - and that's a lot more than anything gaming has given me over the past decade.
---
Oh really. 
---
That's disappointing.
---
Mine is coming in today ! Gotta love eBay
---
yeah, Payo is flipping disgusting
---
No one is crying in this thread. This is how constructive feedback works, all games go through this process internally before launch as well (I work in game dev).
---
With this attitude, things would not get improved or fact checked in any field which would inevitably lead to problems in a final product.
---
Same goes for disagreeing or bringing up something to test, even if it turns out wrong, that is a positive contribution. Science works on this premise as well, even negative findings are good to confirm something is not true.
---
Nope you're wrong. You are just destined to be a streamer. Quick, make your twitch account and collect your millions.
---
Night Elf is very bad also, at least if private servers are anything to go by.
---
With a raid pug? Any healer. 
---
5 man? Most will want a priest. 
---
Pick the healing style you like the most and commit to it. I am going alt a dwarf priest. Fear ward will give me a slight advantage in getting into pugs/alt runs but in the long run it won‚Äôt be that big of a deal. Druid have the hardest time in 5 mans due to the lack of reliable Rez. But for pugging raids it won‚Äôt matter that much. Everyone will need healers always.
---
Cry more, your tears fuel the fire, peasant.
---
Making cowboy hats out of human leather has a way of making folks tread a little more carefully around you Rimworlders.
---
It was a horrendous time sink to earn 1000g in those days, but once the economy grows up a little and demand is there for crafting, you can make a tidy business farming the raw materials and selling them on the auction house - the actual items you can make don't sell nearly as well.
---
Last night in the stress test I really enjoyed the "classic" button in the video settings. It makes it look like classic. I used the "recommended" option and it was very nice looking. The water was fluid and has reflections. In "Classic" option it looks like it used to. 
---
I like having the choice.
---
Pepperidge farm remembers.
---
Yeah, I have no idea how he couldn't land a single hamstring. Those orc resists are great though.
---
Everyone should take a Game Design 101 course. Or make friends with actual game devs. They'll learn how games are made, prepared, and tested.
---
Let's not confuse Classic and Vanilla.  Classic is 1.12 - a castrated version of the overall Vanilla experience.  Keyword:  Overall.
---
What's funny is that their day job is playing wow.
---
Big streamer: I have just worked my fingers to the bone playing wow. Really put in a nice 10-hour shift of playing wow for my viewers. 
---
I can't wait to crack open a cold one and log into wow.
---
I totally get it, but it does sound a little silly.
---
How in the literal fuck do you notice 90% of these things?  Not saying they shouldn‚Äôt be fixed but honestly... how?
---
We should replie with ‚ÄûDo you want some cheese with your whine?‚Äú Just like in the good old days. üòÅ
---
Sure. It's been reapproved.
---
You dodged the point. The stress test was supposed to be about testing in-game.
---
I always see people bitching about how their subreddit is the most toxic like it's a competition. Most of the time I don't even know where they're coming from because I don't seem to be seeing what's so toxic about them. Maybe grow thicker skin so you can handle when someone disagrees with you but they forgot to write a paragraph on why they respect your opinion?
---
Basically. Classic is the only thing currently stopping me from fantasizing about murdering my boss all day long for being a greedy fucking pig.
---
Gold making is a skill. Some will make it very fast. Some will take a year.     
---
With exalted: its 900g. Still a lot and a good gold sink to keep inflation down.
---
vQueue mostly scans General chat for keywords and organizes them according to instance - so all of the "Scarlet Monastery" spams are grouped together. I can live with that level of functionality, but any automation beyond that is really too much.
---
Lucky...
---
IIRC LCDs were about $650 for a shitty 17" with 15ms refresh timmer. 
---
No thank you!
---
Character models are the only thing that looks really bad. If you max out graphics the rest of the game looks really good.
---
I don't think he's comparing to live. He's comparing beta to a private 1.12 client.
---
Good! NO CHANGES!
---
That grenade stun was nice. Well played by both.
---
I sorta hope they push a new build out, fixing a lot of the bugs we have reported, then up the cap and send out more waves. 
---
Get the server operating with 2 layers so we can test what that does to gameplay, and extend the playable range for more testing. 
---
Ive leveled to 60 on my original vanilla class and i dont intend to go ham minmaxing at 30. I submitted a bunch of bugs during that time, but they arent paying me--in fact, im paying them--so im not going to go bash my head into a wall farming gold to respec to test more.
---
Ah yes, strawman arguments.
---
But I'll humor you.
---
Revenue absolutely is the most important key indicator of a successful videogame. What other argument is there? 
---
If you make a game and few people buy it relative to your investment, it absolutely is not successful.
---
And when it comes to a gaming Corp? Money absolutely is one of the most important things. Period. If you think anything else you're clueless.
---
Making a game the people love contributes to those sales, but ultimately, any company making a game "the people love" but not focusing on money is an excellent way to go bankrupt.
---
And finally, if WoW has been around for 15+ years and is still a commercial success, then that is proof enough that Blizzard knows what they are doing.
---
Don't agree? Do better than them and prove me wrong.
---
You say the tight fit is satisfying, but to me it just draws my attention in an unsatisfying way.
---
Dwarf priest ~ fear ward will secure the raid spot :)
---
Well yeah, we didn't assume they'd just be stretched up
---
it looks so good!! the thing is, I don't think the stealth walk was the only thing affected by this change. it seemed to be an across-the-board normalization of step speed to reduce gliding/sliding for multiple animations (see wolf/cat mounts, backpedaling also).
---
Almost as if there was a prioritization system or something.
---
Its not even that bad lmao.
---
It is crazy how much people were crying about the stress test, though.
---
They can always implement a global cooldown of some sort on layering swapping
---
Can't tell if /s or not.
---
Well if you don't want it...
---
Short answer, yes and yes.
---
The counter-circlejerk is always the strongest.
---
Would this also be because in those 2 levels you gained intellect increasing the damage of the spell?
---
Went from one to the other over night.
---
There will be guilds raiding at all times of the day, however the vast majority will start/end somewhere between 6 pm and midnight. Your quest now is to find one that fits your schedule, which will be very difficult, but not impossible. Good luck :)
---
No changed! Same graphics too
---
Swords are the best but if you want to have fun you can use the dagger/ambush spec. Basically you almost have a 100% crit chance on ambush after you killed a mob (45% from improved Ambush and 40% from Remorseless Attacks). This spec is really fun at PvP, you can literally one shot cloth classes.
---
"umad?", the dumbest of dumb arguments.
---
Yea I hope the OP's just joked and didn't submit it.
---
V P N ?
---
Refuses to use sub mode but rails against dark souls players for being the most toxic community ever created because random kids in twitch chat called him bad. Bit cringey.
---
Nice!
---
And to think, about all i did was visit the Park District (after getting to 5) because i legit couldnt remember what it was like when i started in mid-Wrath.
---
In vanilla, the stealth animation was exactly the same whether you sprinted or not, and also didn't care if you had high rank stealth, low rank stealth, spec'd stealth or not. The animation was always the same, only the movement speed changed.
---
Silence, peasant. Enjoy knowing that I get to go home and play the beta and you're stuck crying on this sub, because you didn't get to play to level 5 like you wanted.
---
It would be great if Luna worked in Classic - this is a better version of Grid that has become very popular on pservers over the last few years.
---
The nosgalgi for me is the gameplay. Having the new models would only be a plus
---
Haha they are yeah, but doesn't make up for lack of skills. The rogue in the video was dueling another warrior who was gnome earlier and couldn't beat him because that warrior actually knew how to play.
---
Druid is the only one I could think people being a little wary of due to not having a res, generally won't matter if someone else in the group has one but its just something people might think twice about.
---
I stopped trying after half hour because it became clear to me that the severs were full and I wasn‚Äôt going to get in. I did my part in the test and moved on. I tried again this afternoon and got in.
---
Played in a Chinese item selling team and visited a gold farming company in wotlk. Good times.
---
Yes, it will put you in a group of 3000 out of however many the decide to put on a 'server', or however they will determine player groupings prior to the removal of Layering. But that's not the point. Putting every single player on the same server was never an option. Which is the only way splitting us into the groups of 3000 would matter. Vanilla wow had servers opening all the time. Even with the pop limits in Vanilla, about 2500-4000, it was dynamic, the starting zones were absolute nightmares to try to quest in. Which is the same number of people there will be in the starting zones with layering. 
---
The entire reason they even considered any form of Pashing/Layering/Sharding was due to overcrowding in starting zones. The starting zones **will still be** overcrowded with 3000 people. Their choice of Layering does nothing to address this. If your entire argument is "3000 is less than 10000" or whatever, then you have no argument. No official server has ever had a pop that high, and anything much over the average 2500-3000 people for a 'full' server in Vanilla would break server economy.
---
OSRS Mobile beta saw a lot of similar ‚Äúbeen playing since 2001‚Äù QQing and got pretty contentious due to different dates for iOS and Android betas.
---
I'm a turbo-nerd, and my character's animations are like muscle memory for me :)

by posting this and trying to illicit a reaction from social media you are no different from him.  look at what you have become.

Wasn't it only one server?

Correct.    
---
What I / We want is a Classic Experience.  MMORPG.    
---
Classic Wow provides that, and games need to expand to bring out new content.    
---
The expansion model has proved to be a money marker, but also the WoW killer.

Lots and lots of time.  Start saving early.

If you watch Quin for more than 5 minutes you might realise, he doesnt care about money, has never told anyone to sub with twitch prime, never plays a single ad, tells people to use adBlock and plays games he enjoys playing, not games that offer him a larger view count. So yeah... ummm....
---
Depends on how dedicated you are too gold farming and what professions you have.  Maybe a few weeks if you're not super trying to farm gold but at least putting some effort into it.  Also depends on the economy on your realm, for example rightous orbs were selling for something like 70-80 gold on my realm, so only about 20-25 live strat runs.

I'm torn between my hatred of streamers and my love of being proven right about Classic being big.
---
not ignoring those 18 frames per second tho. its almost old enough to drink...
---
Well, and to add to the other poster -- While raiding, you'll probably not want to dump huge heals on anything other than the main tank, but you might want to have access a bigger heal that your mana-neutral rank. And especially in vanilla raiding environments, risk-adverse leaders tend to bring too many healers, so you'll be sniping and be sniped on heals with much fewer ways of regenning mana. 
---
When I played my hpriest seriously in vanilla, I hardly ever fully cast max rank Gheal on anyone other than the tank for timed damage spikes, but you better believe that I had at least 3 ranks of Heal, Gheal, and (whatever the third heal that wasn't Flash) hotkeyed.  
---
We always had at least one new-ish healer who would go all out for the first minute of the fight, not downranking, and run out of mana and items and be useless for half the remaining fight. The ones that already knew about downranking and could manage their resources until near the end of the fight (or asked questions) passed their trials -- frequently irrespective of their actual output.
---
Yeah I just meant it‚Äôs not gonna be like that when the game launches, those quests will give you maybe a silver at 60. Phrasing is hard
---
I here I always thought the black mold in his room would kill Asmongold first.
---
The same rogue couldn't beat his warrior friend though who was playing gnome and had worse gear than Tips.
---
So, Blizzard needs to ban add-ons because you personally were unable to control your voluntary use of them? The Volstead Act is that way --&gt;

---
PvP got added in 1.4, five months after WoW was released and suddenly that's the only thing the game was made for lol
---
Literally.
---
Night Elf male priest is the obvious choice, imo.
---
&gt; Ah yes, strawman arguments.
---
That wasn't a strawman argument. You said Blizzard created a "videogame empire and done Billions upon Billions in revenue" and mocked the other guy for struggling in school. I was accurately describing your argument.
---
&gt; Revenue absolutely is the most important key indicator of a successful videogame. What other argument is there?
---
Success varies depending on goals. Some people make art for no money.
---
The flaw in your reasoning is that you think that because Blizzard has lots of money, everything they do is right and correct. Having money isn't necessarily an indicator that someone is intelligent or correct.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure this Stress test was designed specifically for the worst possible circumstance, I bet between the servers and the first week layering it will be tolerable. I‚Äôm running a dwarf warrior anyways so I‚Äôm avoiding the two most popular spawns by default.
---
Imagine the ganker you're hunting with a higher level friend disappears, and you know he's not off but actually doing same shit on another layer.
---
But muh "Classic wouldn't exist if I didn't play private servers therefore the community owes me"
---
His viewer account is far from "diminishing". He's been very stable for a long time now.
---
Rocktusk farm remembers
---
These are the cancer cells that ruined WoW to begin with. Just need to do the correct thing this time around and actually ignore them instead of thinking that they matter (they don't) enough to appease every endless demand they have.
---
He is joking more often than not when he geta mega douchey, I'll be real I get a little triggered from time to time even though I know this.
---
It pretty much is the expansion I get to catch up on stuff I missed from previous ones, just like WoD was. Thanks Blizzard! /s
---
Here's what I do:
---
Instead of using WASD to move, use ESDF (shift one key over).
---
This allows your hand to be in a more centered area of the keyboard, so you can reach more keys. Of course, you could also move with RDFG, but I like that there's the little nipple on F so I can find my way back to home base in the dark.
---
My actionbar hot keys are:
---
1: AQZXCVWRTBGH
---
2: shift-A, shift-Q, shift-Z, etc.
---
3: control-A, control-Q, control-Z, etc.
---
4: alt-A, alt-Q, alt-Z, etc.
---
5: 1234567890-=
---
It takes a little bit to get used to, but it's SO worth it.
---
He lands two hamstring tho. Perplexity is hamstrung at the beginning of the video and after he lands another one but Perplexity gets out of it with escape artist.
---
Yes they did
---
At least it's all classic here. In r/wow 75% of posts are classic.
---
Idk.. I feel like I've seen more of these type of posts than I have of people complaining..
---
Those people are morons then.
---
You probably want to search thru good greens from quest rewards, create a big list of goodies. Then eliminate anything requiring a dungeon. Then eliminate things by area so you're staying in a close path. For instance, shimmering flats to tanaris to un goro is good, but shimmering flats to blasted lands to un goro is a lot of unnecessary travel.
---
Then further refine the list so its the quickest and most linear path, with favoritism to areas you won't get ganked as much, or would expect to see more of your faction around you, or personal preference.
---
Yup. I'm not planning on subbing until the last week of August so I don't really expect to be able to play pre-release at any point. Streamers let me see what's going on in the beta.
---
intellect only increases mana pool and crit % chance
---
It‚Äôs clearly a head piece
---
1 stress test and the world is falling the game as we know it is ruined those first couple weeks will destroy everything
---
LOL. 
---
anybody who truly feels this way needs counselling. 
---
You.are.owed.nothing.
---
Finally your warrior got rage instead of mana. Nice :)
---
It's 10 silver
---
Yeah I leveled a bunch of warlocks. Fastest was 30 mins, getting somewhat lucky with the Scorpid respawns.
---
I did a few experiments and to everyone planning to either (a) get exploration xp or (b) grind mobs outside the crowded starting area either solo or grouped up: it‚Äôs not worthwhile. It‚Äôs still faster to do the starter quests.
---
I loooooooove it. We use it for an entire states IT
---
Yeah the hybrid tax argument never held *any* fucking water, *at all*. 
---
Warriors are not penalized in any way, shape, or form. Fury is one of the best (*THE* best??) DPS specs in the game, Arms is an incredible PvP spec, and Prot is the only viable raid tank in most scenarios.
---
But 2/3 Paladin specs *MUST* be unplayable. It's only fair because they can heal amirite? Same for Druids, Shaman.
---
It's literally just what spot you get in que. Thousands of people hit log in with milliseconds of each other. They have to come through in a certain order.
---
 People are crying about streamers, but they did the same shit. There were several times 1 or 2 big ones would make it and the rest wouldn't. There were also a few where none of them made it. Soda played peggle for like 30 minutes straight one time because he missed it. This sub is nothing but abunch of confirmation bias whiners.
---
Wait a minute, do u need an active sub to get the beta inv??? I thought u can get beta inv but need an active sub to play it. 
---
My game time runs out tomorrow and I don‚Äôt want to renew it since i havent logged in for the last 2 months
---
Exactly. People are trying to apply some rhyme and reason to a \*giant\* system connecting people from a million places to a single server. Sometimes some weird shit is going to happen. I'm in the standard beta (not stress test only) and I didn't get in last night.
---
No, its 10s. 10g is the tabard
---
Why do they need to be open about it? We know it to be true. Why do they need to admit it to the world?
---
The only people mad about this are the ones that don't understand what a stress test is to begin with.
---
He seems to be implying that the models are the 'new' gnome models rather than the old ones from actual vanilla. That is why I provided screenshots of both beta and live in an easily reproduced location so now he can go there on a private 1.12 client and post a screenshot of that location. 
---
The location he is using as a reference is uneven ground and on top of that hes not standing in the same spot on both (the one on a private 1.12 client is clearly further away (and therefore lower on said uneven ground) than the beta picture he provided.
---
&gt; Character models are the only thing that looks really bad. If you max out graphics the rest of the game looks really good.
---
Right, because the characters are so close, take up a large part of your screen and are always visible.  Character models are one of the main graphic options I try and put on insane or mythic settings.  I know there was already a massive fallout from the modern wow server when people were banned for modifying their game client to show more appealing character models.  It is a client side effect and having the WOD model remakes would, to me, make me play more of the game and feel as though my subscription length was worth extending.  
---
Maybe they are not hard set on the models from beta wow.  I guess it could always change in the future right?
---
Can you still get behind AQ walls?
---
I really don't mean to take a dump on your opinion or rain on your parade, but wotlk naxx was literally the easiest multiboss raid WoW has ever seen, by a large margin, and is not much of a measuring stick D:
---
I played on an RP-PvP server in vanilla (Emerald Dream). I don't remember much RP, but I remember a lot of Guild vs. Guild PvP.
---
[That was my Warrior at the end of Vanilla.](https://i.imgur.com/CCYv4F7.jpg) Still no idea why I used the fucking Might Gauntlets in that Screenshot. Probably because it gave me more AP than my Stronghold Gauntlets.
---
so its not that you want a dedicated melee dps that uses magic...its that you want another one?
---
I mean are we even speaking strictly about classic or wow in general?
---
Cause I hadnt even thought of DKs...I dont believe in windwalker so Im not really sure if their damage is physical mostly or not--and DH? I mean Ive just resigned myself to not learning how they work.
---
Im not sure id agree with the idea that they are all in a good place. Healing classes lacked real options. For the size of raids, the comps were pretty rigid, and 16 debuffs just neuters some potentially useful abilities specs. Its fun, but its not good. Classic could be so much better tuned and balanced while maintaining the feel and pacing, but thats a conversation for 2021 not 2019.
---
Good spot, hope they change this on launch
---
Not sure if this has been reported but the countdown that appears in duel when you are too far away from the duel area, does not disappear when the duel is over. As shown here:
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/CharmingDeterminedWolverineAMPEnergy
---
Thats probably why, you don't have any context.
---
I love you OP, i cant belive how entitled some people have been concidering its a freaking stress test
---
Logs into Private Server, not the same anymore
---
People whining about invites and pretending they‚Äôd do a better job beta testing than whoever are so annoying. Its obvious they just want to play the game. There are certain servers hosting the exact same game with no level cap or invite gate... Stop whining and go scratch your itch.
---
Good point, but imagine, in a Deadmines group: 
---
"I was farming herbs in Elwynn before we started" 
---
"Me too lol, but then some warlocks summoned few infernals that wrecked the area"
---
"Oh really? Guess I was on another layer... But at least I have some herbs haha"
---

In combat there is rarely a time to back pedal--its so infrequent that many people feel comfortable unbinding it. That said, until you know when (tanking, rare instances in melee to realign target) just use one of the above methods. 
---
Strafing offers the advantage of not showing your back to the mob, so you should use that in most situations where you might otherwise think back pedaling is the answer.

dont think so.  I dont think you have the drop down or the "Play" button on the launcher if you dont have a sub.
---
It was described as that being the goal. The whole point of stress testing is to see how much it takes to break the game by overloading the servers and that's exactly what happened. Last night went exactly how a stress test is supposed to go.
---
I really love these. Keep them coming!
---
Yes, there is. That means more people get alerted to the stress test in the first place and they get a better sample representation on their server load.
---
Hacks!
---
Or dwarfs are smaller??
---
Did you both check your skill levels? Weapon skills effect things like this
---
Because mods were having to delete them as they popped up every few seconds last night.
---
Please show me anything that's been that easily abused and not fixed.     
---
If they for some really weird reason just stop testing and release as is, then i'll be the first to admit i'm wrong.       
---
But even a 5 year-old could tell that they won't do that.        
---
It's been about a week of beta testing, part of it specifically for layering, out of 3 months, if your mind is deadset that this is the way it's gonna get shipped than no argument is gonna change your mind.        
---
Enjoy your cynical view until release :)
---
Well it‚Äôs probably not worth watching it just to have context. I did see some of the clips of the more egregious stuff like the small council meeting at the end and it was as bad as people were saying
---
Since using tMorph is still allowed (they unbanned everyone who they deemed having used it for only modifying their own character), you can probably use that in Classic.
---
Or it's just, you know, a meme.
---
Testing with local connections is different than outside connections. There's a reason why we've always done public/closed stress tests.
---
The easiest way to get into raids is to heal because you need a lot of them and it‚Äôs a less popular option - but actually really fun.
---
Either Paladin for more buffs or priest which has a viable DPS alternative spec.
---
Giving certain accounts priority to be able to log in doesn't preclude other people being able to log in.
---
Battlegrounds.
---
They added them later on and they were very popular. That's why we want them from the start.
---
Depends on the implementation i guess. I feel like the governance of it just kills productivity
---
I'm horde all the way, but it's hard to argue, sw and iron forget are the best looking cities in vanilla :/. Is what it is though
---
Battle shout?
---
I have Beta Access so I wanted to login and saw a fucking 1min Queue. I waited for it and then when I saw all Servers are offline, I gave up.
---
People like her is why games are such utter shit that caters to the lowest common denominator.
---
OP would rather have mile long server queues for a month, followed by 2 months of ridiculous resource guarding, followed by 2 weeks of actual decent gameplay, followed by dead servers, followed by server merges, transfers, and every ballache that goes along with them.
---
I'll take the layering for a few weeks, thanks.
---
I don't know if they do, but I know that not doing so doesn't seem to have an effect.
---
I've gotten into every beta Blizzard's ever done (obviously not the internal only ones etc), including the first wave of this one... and I rarely report bugs.
---
Not because I'm against doing so, but I generally don't play the betas a ton (don't want to spend too much time something that won't matter once it ends) and usually don't run into that many issues during the amount I do play.
---
I'm actually playing this beta a ton compared to my normal habits though, for some reason... but still, I haven't really found any bugs to report.
---
If your goal is end-game raiding, playing a priest or mage is never a bad idea, they're "purist" caster classes - priests will find an easier invite to any group than a mage or lock, but people LOVE mages for the sheep, water and AoE... you're craft services for the group/raid, enjoy making lots of level 55 food and water.  
---
Faction is your preference, mostly based on aesthetics choices.  Mages/Priests I'd argue have stronger utility than locks - although in Classic WoW, summoning is more valuable than in retail.
---
Bruh, did you not show up for orientation? His life is basically The Truman Show. Everything revolves around him ;o
---
Just disappointed in the way Blizzard handled the proceedings.
---
It's all gonna be okay, champ.
---
Tipsout is so fucking trash Jesus christ
---
I can only talk about myself:
---
Im EU and find it sad there isn‚Äôt one.
---
But having a second server in the Eu or not will not change or add anything for blizzard regarding this specific stress test (except maybe more beta testers)
---
In gaming subs there is always a lot of criticism about the game and I and many others don‚Äôt want ‚Äûwhining‚Äú in this sub.
---
I guess most posts complaining are formulated bad or just got caught in the ‚Äûdownvote whining‚Äú.
---
These are all just guesses I have tho.
---
Everyone get green! Hurry!
---
I was hoping the Stress-Tests would be on the real Beta-Servers. I was ready for the Lowly Peasants to look at my glorious Level25 Warlock with his mighty Uncommon Items and my cute Westfall Chicken.
---
That's so sexist
---
Aw man wait until you see the animations, it's like butter compared to the new ones.
---
No more bouncy run animations (thank god) and vanilla swing animations feel like they have more weight behind them in my opinion.
---
Some people are born to be tools. They'll defend every instance of favoritism out of a knee-jerk resistance to "whining" and "entitlement."
---
The old models enhance the idea of us being unknown characters with messy beards, even smaller gnomes, weird ass looking running animations. How could a vanilla character have a title like Champion of Azeroth?
---
Everything was set up perfectly for having a nomad experience throught the world
---
Which is ironic as that is the complete fucking opposite of what classic wow is
---
By the time I had my 40 mount I was lvl 43. Can't exactly remember the time frame of my epic mount but it was definitely a similar delay, but professions helped.
---
Obviously, you haven't thought about it in years and you've made 20 posts in this same thread, each and every one connected to how you're big mad because streamers got "priority access" and you didn't.  Life's not fair Big Mad, you'll accept it sooner or later.
---
Blizzard already alerted people to the stress test by email.
---
Hunter is the best PVP toon in the game untill Cata. Easy Choice, but super high learning curve.
---
So you basically never liked wow, you still don't like wow, but you want wow to change so you can be happy? fucking hell man, entitled much lol
---
I'm getting it the same day I hit 60.
---
I didn't know other countries used quotes like that. Don't cry too much now
---
Best NA warrior dueler btw. Imagine having that little self awareness.
---
Yea but definitely not in vanilla. Thats most likely one of the Legion client carry overs, one of the worse ones.
---
Streamers bad, hurr durr. Seriously, how stuck up and anti-fun can you be with that " Holier-than-thou" mentality.
---
I think classic wow players cause of play old school graphics/models  
---
I dont know is it good or bad idead to option for models
---
It's not clear it is?
---
I connected with my guild mates and we spent 2 hours trying to login together on voice chat.
---
We *are* home.
---
yeah, [this route should still work] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0B9HU808xg&amp;list=LLXfDG1l4-kIsspy9-2gPwew&amp;index=690&amp;t=0s)
---
&gt; I want everyone to have the same experience in terms of UI, map, questing, ect.
---
Why? what has other players experiences got to do with you? just play the game without addons if that's what you want.
---
Good luck determining what layer you are on and determining which to move to with any kind of accuracy enough to matter. Honestly if a group puts that much effort into the grind. More power to em. That‚Äôs Method levels of coordination and effort bud. 99% of the population won‚Äôt put forth that kind of effort. 
---
Even then that will only put them ahead for MC/Ony progression at best. Other guilds that put in a 10th of the effort will still be on the same gear/progression level as the try hards that no life the shit out of the game to try and take advantage of layering by BWL. 
---
Mountains out of mole hills.
---
This is big. Need more testing on other spells/classes.
---
I would not care so much about class, but about other things like; D*oes he knows tactics ? Is he a fuckup ? Does he stays the entire raid ? Does he brings consumables ? Has he attended on "my" PUGs before ?*  
---
Yeah sure if i need a Hunter i need a Hunter, but then i would rather bring someone i know or someone else in raid can vouch for, or just an alt.  
---
 **Dont base your entitire Classic journey, on what class will get you invited more**. That would be extremly stupid, play what you think sounds like you would have more fun playing. Dont base it of anything else.
---
I honestly can't imagine being such a peon.
---
When i go home i wanna try this. Can i ask where you get this engine from? easy to setup? WOW already uploaded?
---
Sorry, should've mentioned that there were no buffs.
---
Yeah. Naxxramas attunement is buyable.
---
We tried to do a 80 man raid on Mulgore but the two raids got divided into two different layers.  Incredible immersion breaker
---
Not really. 
---
It was a stress test of a single server and Blizzard is getting their shit together 3 months in advance.  Plus, if the starting area is a crapshoot you can really just run somewhere else to quest and in the process of getting there will level up a couple of times. 
---
I‚Äôm sure release will be a cluster, but yesterday was pure chaos and that‚Äôs exactly what blizzard wanted.
---
It would be stupid to not take advantage of literal thousands of dollars worth of free advertisement.... Is the average person really this clueless to how the world works? Getting Soda and Asmongold and any other streamer on that absurd level into the game should be #1 priority. That's just, fucking duh.
---
The stress test was not presented as a test of the login screen, and you know it. People were led to believe they'd be testing the layering tech in-game, not acting as guinea pigs for the login server while ~content creators~ played with the devs.
---
U can't eat it it's magic
---
Same race? Different races have different base stats.
---
Most of the people whining about damage values were probably expecting the official servers to be more challenging anyways. Doubt they‚Äôd admit it. They‚Äôre better off scratching their itch on private servers, where the discrepancy in numbers at least lies in their favor.
---
My guess would be one of you doesn't have Defense maxed out and the other does. Beyond that it could be a difference in buffs. Beyond that idk. I would have liked to see the skill bars of both characters.
---
I know it was not that hard. But for a guild that only has time to play for a total of 4 hours on the weekend i still find impressive. Or impressive is maybe a bit to strong. Its just hard to get a raid coordinated in that little time. Hell our tank had to drive to a buddy each time because his internet at home was to weak to even play online at the time.
---
It really varied person to person and how dedicated you are to farming.
---
Some people can farm that in a few weeks while others may take a month or two.
---
I was in a pretty large guild during Vanilla and we had several people who never even bothered with their epic ground mount simply because they didn't feel it was worth the time.
---
Actually it's mostly been conquered by NON private server players. The amount of shitting on private servers and their players/devs that happens daily is huge.
---
Perplexity is VERY experienced and skilled. Don't think many can beat him in a fair fight.
---
I also found this to be true on both Hunter and warlock
---
Fuck off then carebear
---
Why does coca cola and McDonald's still advertise?... Use your noggin buddy.
---
This was much rarer in late 2004/early 2005 before people knew how to work the economies... it'll come much faster in classic because people have the knowledge.
---
Forgot to add the /s apparently.
---
It worked similar to a shard. You don't choose your layer but can switch layers through party/raid invites. 
---
I also don't think it went bad. It was designed to strain their tech so they good get a decent sample size for analysis. They do need a few more of the tests though.
---
damage font is absolutely wrong. if you notice, the damage font numbers get larger as you zoom your camera closer to the first person pov. the closer your camera, the larger the dmg font numbers appear. its something that bothers me because i absolutely abhor the retail damage font change with smaller damage fonts.
---
hope they change this honestly, seems like an easy win for them. but they're passing up on a lot of easy wins so i guess something like this might not get traction. its worth noting though
---
in accounting
---
I understand this, however there is a difference between completely unplayable and an area jam packed full of players.  In the stress test last night, Northshire got to the point where you couldnt interact with anything or move.  If there are no layers then this will be the game on launch.  On the flip side, they use layers to the point where you are still able interact with npc's and attack mobs.  Still a ton of people competing for the same 5 mobs but at least players wont be able to say the servers have died.
---
Na dawg. Back in the day, no lie, I played on an emachine (if it wasnt that bad it was still a prebuilt basic pc) with a CRT. Not sure what my FPS was but it was ok for the time but if there was a lot of action going on it would be a slide show. Raids were fine, not great but doable. This was the family computer as well. Wasnt until later in vanilla I had my own computer to play on.
---
I remember before that having played diablo and starcraft on dialup. Dont remember when we got DSL but thankfully we did or else playing wow would have been impossible.
---
At this point you must just be choosing to ignore what a stress test is meant to do and the fact that people being able to play up to level 5 was not even close to being the primary purpose of it.
---
Nah i had a hunch.. but i was not sure.
---
Show us buffs and weapon skill
---
Women want equality
---
It depends on what was described as being stress tested. People were told to play up to level 5. There was nothing to indicate they'd be put into a "Fake Connect" group to test the login screen.
---
It's not witch hunting or brigading.  It's tagging someone who is active in this subreddit.
---
They are Retards and I wish we hade a seperate EU Beta Server so I did not have to play on the same Server as them and their Fanboys.
---
Someone's a little butt hurt
---
Seriously! I'm amazed how many intelligent adults take everything he says at face value.
---
good try son, im proud of you nonetheless
---
OFc I went to the movie, with the post I wanted to point out venruki's fun stream and Charles.
---
I hope you didn't
---
"somewhat"
---
How can you not expect honesty?
---
Hey now, I'm an adult and the only PTO I care about is Paid Time Off.
---
We ran into this very same issue directly outside of Ratchet. 
---
Lost plenty of valiant men, unfortunately.
---
I Usually skipped the  [Vile Familiars](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Quest:Vile_Familiars)  quest Due to the population making it not worthwhile but the dagger helped to much to skip.
---
I was not aware they unbanned people. Source?
---
They used layering in the stress test. Its probably still going to be a somewhat similar experience.
---
No, I guarantee they were not placed in the "Fake Connect" groups.
---
Much appreciated the response mate! I went into hibernation since i didn't get into the stress test! but you nailed it!
---
'shammy rez me pls
---
I enjoy watching the beta from outside, cuz im no where near ready to put my social life on hold atm lol
---
Ahh, the good old bat boss üßõ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
You cannot turn off XP gain in vanilla, so you may want to factor gear in to your selection. If you need a rare dungeon bow for Hunter that may not drop, but warrior has a BoE you can buy, warrior might be the way.
---
That said, you'll probably want a money maker. Hard to fund a super legit 49 with level 49 money.  Even the enchants.
---
Good luck.
---
Ohhh that makes sense. Did you accrue a penalty as your DK count climbed?
---
Only skill I never leveled up. And won‚Äôt do that this time in classic.
---
I‚Äôm sorry but this is just terrible play by all five.  Hunter doesn‚Äôt even pot. The lone healer runs headlong into Mage AoE and then stays within kick and gouge range while using slow heals and no totems. Gets zero heals off.  Rogue is useless, stands there getting evaded instead of sprint switching to disrupt the mage. Warrior chases mage instead of focusing rogue for at least some overpower damage. The second warrior who sat in sheep most of the fight literally just runs away instead of finishing mage who‚Äôs oom and out of cooldowns. The two-man team did well, no doubt, but let‚Äôs be real, this is five people shitting the bed.
---
I know right? hence my hibernation for a day while it all blew over.
---
Lmao without all the Chuck Norris jokes tho. He can slam a revolving door btw.
---
Yeah this makes sense, generally I'm a healer at heart, so if I am a Druid, Priest or Paladin, I will be equally content with my play.  I just know when i do have time to raid, I want to be able to maximize it.
---
'Unsuccessful Pussy Hunter Learns to Appreciate a Good Ding'
---
Fair point
---
Everyone's desperate to hate on streamers right now for some reason. How dare they let, like 7 people in out of hundreds of thousands so they can get huge sums of money worth of free advertisement...
---
Welcome to v1.x WoW... hunters finish pretty strong and powerful at 60 though, with a lot of "oh, we're full on hunters -- sorry."  If you play your class well, and don't mind tranq shot and spec'ing marksman, you'll fight for the 3-4 raid spots... and much like druids, hunters think all the gear applies to them.
---
&gt; Blizzard, can you please revert these modern client font changes that are impacting Classic!!!!
---
Sounds like complaining to me. Especially because if font size is the type of thing that's "impacting classic", then we have nothing to worry about.
---

Perhaps my next submission will meet your true patrician standards.
---
Dude i'm telling you full blown stream and army behind me we've got three months to build a following and then it's off to the races!
---
no stream advertising here please.
---
He got married. I made a toon on stress test with his name. People went nutter butters when they saw me lol
---
Yeah this is not true.
---
They‚Äôre not gonna come out and say they show favoritism towards certain players because the beta selection is supposed to be all random. We know it‚Äôs not true. They don‚Äôt have to tell us for us to know.
---
I never had a problem with the DK or the Monk in theory. It was the execution that made them awful. I am also completely okay with healing classes like Shamans, Priests, Paladins and, Druids not having good dps Options in raids. I think this is better for game design but, this is an opinion. I think trying to have classes be able to do multiple things in raids is part of what made the game get so wonkey and out of control.
---
I will also add for pvp. Priests, Paladins, Shamans, and Druids all have very good and deadly specs they can run.
---
Stabbing your way to westfall man that sentence gives me so much joy! thanks for sharing bro!
---
Lucky/unlucky rng I suppose.
---
Orange man bad
---
I asked what a good class to play in vanilla was (in the offical what class should I play thread) cause I have tendonitis and need something with a less intensive rotation.
---
I got called a troll and a huntard lol.
---
Looking forward to it! Hopefully I get a Beta invite or another Stress test invite where I can actually get in.
---
Exactly this... Goid old days of whole day spamming lfg or trade or world chat...

I'm killing time at work. You need to believe that I'm having an enraged meltdown and that you totally owned me with a Reddit comment. You called me "Big Mad" to mock my emotions because you're ashamed of your own emotions. Nobody who is a happy person does what you're doing right now.

I'd like a good UnitFrame Addon. I tried Luna but it has a weird bug that fucking Fades out my Chat when I enter combat.
---
I feel like a good approach for people who are really bothered by it is to not frequent reddit, just like most of us didn't back in the vanilla days. Game forums in general can be pretty toxic and fuel peoples' toxicity and hate in general.
---
The advice that it is worthwhile to compete with hundreds of people for a few quests over other proven methods to get ahead of the pack. üôÇ

Feel free to share your constructive alternative.

I spent a day testing it out. Grinding never dinged before 40 mins, questing was 30-35 mins. Exploration xp was actually retarded.

I didn‚Äôt even get an invite but I just wanted to say this might be a good thing to report to blizzard!
---
Since bitching at this point won't make it go away for obvious reasons, here are your options.
---
Avoid streamer mega servers so layering will be gone faster on your smaller pop server.
---
Don't play for initial launch couple weeks until a server has spread out pop and they remove it.
---
This is Classic, not 2004 vanilla. Just consider it part of the initial gameplay from the start and plan around it if you wish to profit off it. And something to look forward too going away.

Right but we're not doing that in Classic. You're seeing other players that aren't on your server, playing with you on your server. It removes the sense of community that we're trying to achieve with Classic. The expectation was if lower pop servers needed to be merged, they'd be permanently merged. Connected Realms is a Retail thing.
---
Do you have mob suggestions for the level 5-6 to kill in groups from the start, for Orc/Troll area? I think this would be the scorpions just outside of the starter zone?
---
I was about to say...
---
90% of the army. It's awesome.
---
I'd say it's much less committal, but more hardcore. C'thun and almost all of Naxx have really steep requirements of both time and farming. The consumables you might need are just plain crazy. 
---
OP, rope him in with BWL, which is more attainable and was just out of his reach previously. Aspire to his favorite class from TBC and what loot he can look forward to. If he was into in TBC, he'll be in to this, but he doesn't want it to be a job. See if he'll level with you. I'd bet you can get him into a 30 day sub, but maybe not for a few weeks after release (you might need to have an alt just for leveling with him).
---
I'm talking somewhere in the Vanilla, TBC, and Wrath era.  Back when spells had ranks.  A lot of the low-level spells got an extra 1 damage here and there as you leveled.
---
Like the stealth idea, thanks. Someone else suggested Druid for animal reasons - do they get an equivalent of Sap or similar in cat form?
---
RNG gods play their dice diffrent ways
---
yeah so no news..
---
I enjoy healers and tanks most, because there's more responsibility most of the time in dungeons and raids. 
---
But honestly, go with flavour/feel. Pick the class you find most awesome. That's my advice to you.
---
Just to be clear, you're okay with secret favoritism.
---
&gt; Also warriors will be forced to tank 95% of the time
---
Uh....then why do so many raids run with 5+ fury warriors? Your math doesn't check out at all, lmao.
---
&gt; you "weak" ench shaman can oneshot people in PvP.
---
Warriors do this as well.
---
&gt; the dedication to make them viable as DPS
---
Get hit capped, now you're viable. Wow that was incredibly difficult. I'm sure no other class in the game had to go through that struggle.
---
&gt; PVP is trillion times as much as any other class.
---
This is so fucking funny for so very many reasons.
---
I was able to play on the stress test realm this morning after work. When I got to the character select screen I scared the shit out of my husband as I let out a loud squeal and said ‚ÄúMy female gnomes are cute again!!!!‚Äù
---
üòäüòäüòäüòäüòä
---
I mean I used to do the campaigns 100% like that. My last play through I tried hard mode and I only made it to the final level of the undead campaign in roc and had to drop it to normal.
---
The game mechanics are so good. Use priest dispell to instantly kill an army of skeletons. Stay ontop of your pally heal. Honestly on normal it's not too bad. If I were you I'd try it on normal, and drop in whosyourdaddy if things are getting frustrating.
---
You were level 63?   ü§ì
---
&gt;and much like druids, hunters KNOW all the gear besides plate somehow applies to them.

On sale now for 30$. Was 80$
---
Is an instance so that's fine. Connected Realms is just you running around Durotar and seeing someone from a different server next to you. It's the sort of trash we see in Retail.
---
Okay if you are competing against a few people or no one it is not worth it. Sure.
---
no its papa london school
---
Eh, to me that's a species of vertical jumping. Not the same as the "straight up the side" jumping that you could accomplish by turning perfectly in a cardinal direction, but still upwards rather than sideways. This is the sort of jumping that I've always called "horizontal", to distinguish between the walljumps that allowed for impossible character positioning halfway up a cliffside.
---
Yo guys! Hope you like the video. I had a lot of fun in the stress test and decided to make this video. AMA! :)
---
Pally is best healer
---
Dwarf priest most wanted tho
---
Fear ward is good especially in a pug. You don't ever really need it but it's nice
---
Most important is playing with people you enjoy playing with, regardless of faction.  It's a toss-up, some servers are fairly faction balanced, others are quite lopsided. Without the races that came after vanilla, horde has some really ugly characters.
---
Hope there will be filter to show only my hots. Do not want to see all hots frpm other 20 healers... I miss this function from grid2 bcs ir is not in grid1 from old wow eras.
---
They're stopping the invites anyway.
---
What kind of pathetic person takes this seriously? 
---
OP and people pointing finger's act like they have never changed their opinion on anything or joking said "omg x is awful ima kill myself" This smells of hate and jealousy from miles away.
---
This is pretty false, 2 dormant bnet accounts were invited along with my wife and she doesn't even play wow just SC2. So 3 bnets of mine and 1 of hers at random.
---
Have you followed the news lately? He would be in prison if a sitting president could be indicted.
---
Imagine being brainlet enough to downvote this... yikes
---
Gnomes: J.T.R.H.T.S.A.D.
---
I don't think comparing the levels of hate in a subreddit specifically made for hating something vs a video game subreddit is a very fair way to determine how "toxic" the video game subreddit is.
---
Its a video game and people are literally pissed off that they were in a stress test, or that they can watch streamers play in a beta where no progress goes towards the live servers.
---
These people need to chill tf out.
---
Alright lets look at this statistically say they invited 10000 people for stress test (probably more or less just an example) there are say 15 streamers that got invited and 1000 people never got to log on so 9000 people were on think that means that they out of the 15 streamers that 13.5 would get on now dont get me wrong i have no stats to prove these figures im just trying to say is use your brain.
---
Like you said, playing with friends on your least favored faction is superior to playing alone on your preferred faction. 
---
If Blizzards twitter poll is believed to be accurate we're looking at 56%/44% split between Horde/Alliance. Favoring the Horde.
---
Personally I'm still rolling Alliance anyway because I prefer NE to Tauren for Druids, and Druid is my main.
---
The starting area was very crowded. Outside the starting area was basically empty, due to the level cap.
---
So it was best case scenario for grinding outside the starting area and worst case scenario inside it.
---
I know that private server techniques say otherwise, but this wasn‚Äôt a private server.
---
Because you're willfully ignorant about the purpose of the stress test and keep repeating yourself that "they need to test all regions" which makes zero sense
---
A video clip of raggy spawning and his face just getting bamboozled with how would be 10000x times better than a picture xD but yeah was epic
---
Love this, glad the devs are having fun with this.
---
I got 4 hours of queues and then also sharding when I finally got in. What part of that process should we have faith in?
---
Yea I'm not sure which ones have what cast times, but for Lesser Heal Rank 1 was 1.5 seconds, while Rank 2 was 2 seconds. Huge difference. Looking at Classic Wowhead it seems Rank 3 would be 2.5 seconds.
---
Yes because the original complainers are so useful üôÑbegone troll
---
cringe
---
Some of the old models were better.
---
*Some*
---
There are still some ugly as fuck ones tho.
---
Well played by the streamers... The other five; or four if we're real, did absolutely everything wrong. It's almost comical as to how much they did wrong.
---
They all offer diffrent playstyles, maybe do some more research. And you will find the perfect fit for you. 
---
What ever fits you the most, is what is going to be best for you. And the fact that you want to maximize, is just going to help you even more. You bring consumables. Know how your class works, weakpoints and strong points. 
---
Its all contributing to you getting invited more. I have held pug runs on P-servers for years now, what usually happens is many of the people who attended before attend the upcomming raids. 
---
So as a PUG-Raidleader, you learn names pretty quick. And that is what gets you invited more or rather more than others. Play with people, be social make friends :)
---
Hope they will ban it, and break it and everything. I hate these addobs on retail. And I will hate them in classic where they have no place at all.
---
Same ..... wtf? I wish I had been doing this on retail for the past 10 years lol
---
Updated op!
---
People obviously enjoy his content if he makes money from it so just don't watch it if you don't enjoy it. I find it hilarious when someone bitches about him and he gives snarky responses back, because what else do you expect? Literally hundreds of people bitching at you is going to either wear you down or cause you to return the favour.
---
Yes... and it isn't close
---
Pvp wise you will most def get picked on. But dont let that discourage you from playing on a pvp server
---
The devs have stated RP-PVP is a smaller niche grouping of players. Probably the smallest niche group. 
---
I hope they can create 1 NA and 1 EU RP-PvP server for you guys though.
---
You're showing us 7 attacks worth of damage. That is not a large enough sample size to determine anything when RNG is involved. Even "several" duels is not enough.
---
apparently its acting, if you heard the real him in uber exclusive cool guy discord you would get it.
---
Can you test a small thing for me though? It goes fast. I can mp you if you want.
---
Yeah that would help.  I'll play druid so I'm gonna want to at least see other rejuvs and regrowths so I dont waste casts.
---
Vanilla had native 1920x1080 resolution
---
I‚Äôd be playing a beta for 16 hours a day too if I had thousands of viewers basically paying me to play the game.
---
What do you think is going to happen after Naxx?
---
1) you're bad at search 2) lol https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/brwzov/new_blizzard_response_regarding_beta_invite/
---
Not widescreen.
---
Can anyone confirm, because I NEED to know, can gnomes still jump over dwarves?
---
So, you proved my point? Remove those systems and force cooperation.
---
That's my point. If you think complaining is stupid, and you're complaining about complaining, then by your own logic you're an even bigger idiot
---
Ah, so your mistake is thinking that stress testing only involves being actually in the game. Authentication server overload is pretty damn important too.
---
Updated op, the guy that hit me harder had less defense and skill in swords than my character!
---
minor detail
---
Retarded in what way?
---
Well, this is gonna sound sad but I could good permanent morning shifts, 6am until 2pm which I wouldn‚Äôt really like but it would allow me to attend every raid, I‚Äôm tempted but idk if I wanna sacrifice my social life for wow haha hmmm
---
What does that make you?
---
Cool thanks.
---
It was always between troll and orc for me anyways so im not changing things up. Planing to go troll mage, and if ever feel like making an alt it will be an orc rogue. Never been into undead and i reckon i wont have time for a 3rd alt which could have been a tauren shaman just for varieties sake.
---
I played on the stress test lmaooo.  Don‚Äôt try to belittle me to falsify my jnformation. Maybe you have bad data. 
---
Duo+ grinding outside is better.  Exploration to level 4 and hearth back to grind if you are solo.
---
Same, first wave too.
---
Can you install Teamviewer... I'd like to recreate [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw8gE3lnpLQ).
---
mind sharing what your specs are so I can compare to my own?
---
"Holy shit man, seriously, there is a LOT of anger in you but I fear neither playing Classic nor attacking people on reddit is gonna solve that."
---
Are you going to be the one to tell the Fire Lord he can't go on a midday stroll through the forest?
---
I wasn‚Äôt belittling you, lol. Why the defensiveness?
---
&gt; servers will go into complete meltdown during the AQ event
---
On one hand, I want that again, on the other, I kind of hope that architecture is better this time around so it's not a literal slideshow in the moments after [this image](https://imgur.com/9lKzzbR).
---
Yeah. I agree. I can't take anyone seriously when they say all of the old graphics were better. You're just not being objective if you say that. Female Orc faces, male troll faces, and female Tauren in general were not particularly good after playing retail.
---
Is there a link to that vid
---
They said only phase one
---
Phase one length still tbd
---
With the amount of times the word retard and retarded are being thrown around in this sub it feels like I've taken a time machine back to 2005. When Classic was first announced my hope was "Vanilla WoW but everyone is now a mature adult that knows how to play"
---
I really don't know why I thought that might happen
---
to bad im going the voljin mohawk (and mage lol), best hairstyle in game imo.
---
That happens because a lot of the streamer fans joined this sub after they saw classic beta streams. I think this is leading to lots of the toxicity.
---
Yeah but with more precision, the old horizontal wall jumping worked like the vertical one, it was as easy as the vertical one, and in the TBC patch 2.4 the vertical and horizontal wall jumping was both fixed, but the horizontal wall jumping was fixed at 90%, so a new horizontal wall jumping was born since patch 2.4 and this was working in all the expansions, BFA included and Classic beta too because Classic is made with a Legion client
---
How are they retards? And lmao I was in the original wow beta and I didn‚Äôt get an invite. Playing in 2004 isn‚Äôt the great achievement you think it is. ‚ÄúWrath babies‚Äù have been playing for over a decade so cry about it. Now go back to your private server where you think you‚Äôre good.
---
I mean hate them or love them, stuff like that makes for entertaining content for everyone involved even if you're just participating in the battle ingame without caring about the stream itself.
---
Glad we could help.
---
All three are great classes.  You will have a tougher time gearing up a shaman or a rogue though.  Rogues are hard to get into raids just because there are so many, and shamans are easy to get into raids but you won't get a lot of gear because you'll be fighting with up to 8 other shamans for it.  
---
Warlock is probably the most satisfying long term to play in pvp of the three.  If you stick with warlock and get geared in the later tier raids it becomes almost impossible to lose a 1v1 - plus you can pvp in your raid spec and do very very well.  Rogues are always good, but they just don't get that satisfying climb from ok, to good, to very good, to "Good Lord I'm powerful" that a Warlock does.   Elemental shamans get a nice post in later raids but not quite as big as Warlock.  
---
I think you need to ask yourself if you are fine always being dps, or do you want to be able to switch it up every once in a while and heal.  One thing to note is that Shaman is going to be the most expensive to play and gear of the three.  You'll have to spend a lot of time farming gold if you want to balance raids with pvp in elemental spec.
---
I should've recorded video, we tried atleast 3 duels, as I've said 4 damage difference stays in all of them, each attack. I encourage everyone who can to try the same.
---
similar delay in time, not levels, wow you're a genius thank god we have you
---
Should be higher up. We need to be upvoting actual issues like this. Good job testing this OP!
---
Lol, as ugly as the Horde are those models are nostalgic for me, but yeah at the moment I plan on playing Ally just for the friends but I was just seeing if I could find any reason to sway them back to Horde haha.  My friend had a good point too that basically if we are mostly PvPing then whats the difference what character model we are shooting at.
---
Because it wasn't always about some dumbass streamer.   That alone makes it better.  Also, Barrens chat is famous, because it mostly happens in the Barrens.  This will be everywhere.
---
It'll probably be a little sub-optimal as mob experience will get split, but it's totally fine. You'll kill stuff and do quests faster and be less likely to die. Just kill some extra mobs while traveling and it will make up for it.
---
Oh I only did durotar, I should clarify that. I started one undead but the mindless zombie spawns were even worse than scorpids.
---
Great pvp class. Requires a lot of attention in pvp. Need to know when to use ur support abilities and when to use ur dps. Try not to use chain lightning every time it‚Äôs up Bc it costs more than 2x a lightning bolt. If you‚Äôre with a good warrior follow him and give him wf and grounding twist if necessary. Just support his ass and he can wipe a crew. Only burst if it‚Äôs the right move. Takes practice to figure out what I mean but a great shaman is what can propel horde to dominance along with a very good priest. Otherwise eat paladin shit.
---
Schaman lol
---
OSRS approach hopefully. Would love to see more level 60 content. I think that will happen
---
I've just seen it. How was it a waste?
---
[deleted]
---
That would make sense.  It wouldn't make sense to hold off testing anything.  It is a beta after all.  If they did hold off letting people get to 60 it would piss people off way more if they finally got to end game content and it's bugged because it wasn't tested it he beta.
---
tell me why it is more noble to need a thousand memes to laugh instead of a dozen
---
Yeah im still amazed when stuff like this happens and people react the opposite way you think they are
---
You have to feel a connection to your character that keeps you logging in. I feel most comfortable on gnomes and dwarves, I guess I like the shorties.
---
&gt;  lost control over his life...
---
You really need to re-evaluate your own life if you care that much about how other people play a game lol
---
woops yeah my bad was thinking this
---
The thing is, there is no real reason to hate streamers other than jealousy, they aren't doing anything wrong.
---
&gt;When Classic will actually launch, for the first weeks,  I think the number of viewers will be the HIGHEST ever recorded for a game on Twitch.
---
I wouldn't be surprised.
---
&gt;Maybe at that point you will revise your opinion that "a page of twitch streams three months before launch means absolutely nothing". 
---
In respect to the thesis of, "this game will have a ton of initial hype, and then lose most of it's players after a few months"...yeah.
---
I don't know if it will maintain huge numbers and rekindle the fire it started way back when, or if it will die out, but it will be interesting to see in either case.
---
I think there are definitely people who are looking for that 'grind' and the challenge from Classic. I also think there are a lot of people, including many of those streaming and getting hyped who will thoroughly enjoy leveling...and then when it comes to doing it again on an alt just say...nah. The allure of the leveling changes kinda fade after a while. Many forget...heirlooms were actually an exciting concept at release. Many of the recent complaints regarding leveling were that there were sections (like Wrath areas) where leveling took too long. Getting psyched about leveling slowing down, and becoming more of a challenge could truly go either way after a few months.
---
My personal 'best case' is that Classic does well, sustains players, and Blizzard uses that model to implement something like "hardcore servers", which are the retail game, but don't allow character transfers, sending in mail from outside the server, boosts, heirlooms, etc. and remove the level scaling component which waters down the process.
---
They're clearly just carrying on the characters from the Classic Alpha?..
---
Why do you care?..
---
This won't be how it works in Classic anyway, because these are test servers used for testing purposes?
---
Most people are happy that streamers got access. I've never heard people get angry about a company doing what they always do.
---
I don't even understand whats the negatives of giving beta access to streamers?
---
I wall-jumped in there with slow fall in Classic. Once your in there there‚Äôs no way out. The door is locked and the gate is too high to jump over. Good memories.
---
Welcome to the gaming community in 2019.
---
Don't think so, someone has to make a clip out of it on Perplexity's twitch channel. They were dueling like 1 hour ago so look at his latest stream and go back a lil bit maybe you can find it.
---
Mental image of a speech bubble somewhere in the crowd, "IS THAT A VAGINA"
---
"If Classic WoW goes live without the original combat text font, the game is absolutely dead on arrival. Just dead." -staysafetv, probably
---
I mean a few days ago when the Classic beta opened, he had in his stream title something anti-classic. I found funny. Then next day it was "best ret pally in Classic". Took less than 24 hours to turn him around i guess. Just needed that invite.
---
I like quinn though. I only watched him for d3 stuff.
---
Did his sword have a sharpening stone on it?
---
They want players that are dedicated to WoW to actually test the game. This isn't like a simple reboot. They are porting Classic to the newer platform that has had 15 years of improvements.
---
This is an actual beta, not a fake beta.
---
The purpose of a beta is to test.  The hype is a bonus.  People will be super pissed, and rightfully so, if they get to end game content and it's buggy because Blizzard never let people test it.
---
Weapon skills should all count as maximum in PvP.
---
this video convinced me to roll an orc instead of a troll, despite trolls looking way cooler as shamans.
---
&gt; Now people will say mimimimi .. of course!
---
&gt; Let's discuss openly please :) 
---
Right.... one can really see you want to discuss things openly.
---
Is venruki Bryce Harpers brother?
---
The vast majority of guilds will be 2-3 nights a week with a set schedule so that shouldn't be a problem.
---
The only thing to keep in mind is that going into raids as a fury warrior, you will still be expected to keep a basic preraid tanking set with you so you will have to farm that. With that said, just tank all your dungeons and grab your fury gear as you go. As a tank you will be able to choose who comes in your group so just fill it with hunter and casters.
---
yeah i made a report about them when i was done. the respawn time for them is insane when being the very first quest you receive as undead
---
You have to be an absolutely filthy human being to have and use a keyboard like that. If he has that little regard for his own health and hygene, I can't imagine the relationship he has with the rest of the world.
---
~10-11 hours on the right class farming the right spot.
---
1. If it's your first time, go in blind, choose what you think looks good. The cost of respeccing isn't THAT high initially. 
---
2. If you want the world to feel more dangerous, go for a PvP server. If you want to relax a bit and only go into combat when YOU want to, go PvE.
---
And yes, other players on PvP servers can camp quest areas and quest NPCs.
---
I can't be the only one who wants to see that guy crumble and fail
---
funniest thing ive seen all day thank you man lmfao
---
One of the many reasons I don't want to play on a server with streamer. People give them free shit to the point they are OP. Then they run around with superior items wrecking people saying something along the lines of "get gud" all the while feeling genuine accomplishment. The genuine accomplishment part bothers the f outta me.
---
Many spells at the lowest ranks have faster cast time. Be aware that the effectiveness of +healing/spell power gear is also dependant on the cast time of the spell, so faster is not always better.
---
TIP: AV mount is 820 I think... if you are not in a rush and you're a healer that needs the off-hand.
---
Doing gods work.
---
Plenty of people own multiple monitors and play games and watch streams at the same time.
---
No changes!
---
But then it wouldn't be the authentic Classic experience.  Blizzard playing 4D chess to bring back the 2004 social experience as well.
---
I mean, she wasn't entirely wrong about there being a toxic group in the classic community. A group that hates retail as much as they think retail players hate vanilla.
---
That being said, anywhere you go on the internet there will be toxic people, and her sorta behaivior as a reaction is just as bad.
---
The dwarves and gnomes combined also equal the elves probably.
---
Oh interesting thanks for the correction
---
Hunter is fast and smooth leveling. Little to no downtime and lots of money as you only have to buy arrows and pet food
---
Can‚Äôt duel inside Ironforge anymore. I don‚Äôt think there was any other way except for fear?
---
Halo 2 was better tho so halo 3 was a disappointment.
---
As all badies should.
---
He's doing the right thing.
---
If you say anything negative about layering here the fanboys jump it so fast
---
That was never in the live game lol.  The link even says beta model, c'mon
---
Paladins can't use swords at level 5.
---
5/7 perfect guide
---
Friend who never played classic -has access to beta.
---
I mean it can. That's all about tracking and filters. That even more so falls on your management rather than the system its self.
---
Dude you're literally pathetic if you think I care about their popularity. I was just giving to the user above some examples of why he shouldn't roll on a streamer server because the other user said he didn't know how to give good examples. That's all but it's nice how you thought you assumed things about me based on my comments, projecting much? :)
---
Who gives a SHIIIIT!
---
I did via the F6 thing in game.
---
Lol no they weren't. They were literally just hitting the mass market and the response times were awful for gaming. Most people made the switch closer to the early 2010s
---
What‚Äôs F&amp;F
---
Not sure if im with you on this one, no offense.
---
That‚Äôs not Classic. That‚Äôs not nochanges
---
There needs to be an actual solution, not facetank level 5s as a group of 5
---
BUT WHERE IS SHIFTY!
---
So there are limited scenarios where priest is better. But they cannot sustain a max HPS rotation for very long. Or any healer but paladin. And no fight is designed where you should be having to use it. Your goal is to be mana efficient not pump out max HPS unless you're wiping. 
---
Priest/Shaman's biggest advantage is offensive dispel/purge, which is for the most part useless in Vanilla PvE outside a few specific fights that involve mind control. 
---
With luck, buffs, and consumes even early in the game paladin can last a very long time with a very high HPS rotation relative to other classes. And obviously late into the game you don't need luck you can just cast forever.
---
In reality priests should just be spamming heal and canceling their spells. THey don't because they're bored not because they play in an optimal way
---
Horde plebs think priest is the best healer. That's why people say that
---
A lot of guides say so, but more info from screenshots won't hurt anyway in case formula is wrong.
---
Indeed some dank crossovers in there. Thrall, Illidan, Thanos AND Wise Old Man..!
---
I‚Äôve been getting a headache at people claiming that the stress test was a failure due to them not being able to log in. That‚Äôs the whole idea! I swear the level 5 cap is higher than their IQs.
---
Yeah. I kinda like the grass effects. Mulgore looks beautiful with it.
---
yeah its just a program on steam
---
Oh man, completely forgot about that guy :)
---
OP, I sincerely hope you name your character 'Burthurt'
---
P.S agree with all your points.
---
Troll master race represent
---
Are you sure you‚Äôre not thinking of people that grinded Bloodsail rep being attacked on sight by Goblin town guards? Because this was definitely not a thing in any live version of vanilla. There was no way to go to war with your own 4 race factions.
---
&gt;To fill our pool of beta and stress test participants, we‚Äôll be choosing dedicated players who meet select criteria from both the WoW Classic beta opt-in and the standard Warcraft beta opt-in. Participants will  also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account. 
---
These were their words exactly, pulled from the website. Interpret this as you will. i guess it doesn't say they will/won't give you beta access without a sub, just that you can't access it without one. I had just assumed it was the former. As another user said though, there was a blue post after the stress test which said they really won't be inviting many more players, as their testing pool had been filled to their liking.
---
&gt;can't we all just be happy Blizzard even does a public beta?
---
Sure but it's kind of expected of them if they want peoples subs to be going towards a working recreation.
---
friends and family
---
Friends and family
---
1: it does cost a lot after some times. but don't worry about a few respecs as the first ones are cheaper. most people change their spec when they hit 60 anyways.
---
2. they can attack you on sight(except when in the first few low level zones). they can camp quest areas if they want to yes. but I figure there wont be much camping like that in the first few months because everyone will be busy leveling and then gearing. I recommend playing on a pvp server though. it will give you some amazing moments in the game. (and some tears)
---
It's not hyperbole, it's inevitable. Godwin's law
---
ah shiet

haha im not sure if im with you either, i will absolutly try the new max grafic settings.
---
I mained a Blood Elf Mage for a large part of Retail, race changed to Human in MoP. Will be on a PvP server, mainly doing PvE, but dabble in PvP. Easy groups is important. Raids also important eventually. 
---
Torn between the following for classic; my overall allegiance leans towards the Horde.
---
Undead Priest: Spec doesn't matter. Fine with being heals.
---
Tauren Shaman: Again, spec doesn't matter. Would probably level elemental and switch to resto. (aesthetically I don't like other shaman races)
---
Tauren Warrior: No problem tanking... I just have limited knowledge of higher level dungeons or raids.
---
Undead Mage: The old standby.
---
or... Human Mage/Priest/Paladin
---
Friends and Family.
---
Thanks! Was wondering that as well.
---
Gnome they dont
---
You are flat wrong on all counts and have not been following p server raiding meta. 
---
1 OT bear (your 3rd tank) who can tank Vael and some other encounters is ideal. 
---
I will have to find the parses, but esp on hoard side, Druid will be assigned MT duty and will keep rolling hots and spamming HT in addition. They can get top of meters this way.
---
Tryhard feral cat with pshifting and MCP can do roughly similar DPS as an average Rogue. Here's some of Shedo's numbers: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1t54jrxlp4YaJJ1tmZMik4ksqqEvlyEUL
---
Not the master guide, but it‚Äôs pretty similar. It came with the battle chest I got years ago along with one for BC.
---
You said "squeezing a horde member".... #snicker
---
Yupp all of this makes sense. With there being far fewer spells to choose/keybind I guess it isn't THAT big of a deal to have 2 downranked spells for each.
---
Yeah I agree... lvl 30 current beta is kinda wonky . For example playing shadow priest, u don‚Äôt even get your shadow form till 40 I believe.... a lot of classes just don‚Äôt have enough compared to others classes at 30 cap.   PS: perplexity is considered one of the top rogues in the wow private server scene .
---
&gt; But, prove me wrong.
---
Nah, I'll pass. I can tell already that arguing with you will be like talking to a rock, there is no meaningful exchange to be had. Based on two responses I made where I didn't outrightly state my personal stance on it other than "I'll accept it if they keep their promise to remove it" you went on a personal rant about how Blizzard can't be trusted and "we were right all along" and how I'm a blizzard fanboy that will protect their every decision.
---
All I can really say I'm glad I'm not as terrible at handling discussion as you. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Cant wait for it, man i tell you, its been some time since i was hyped for a game that much and than its a 15 year old one, oh dear me.
---
yeah its too bad theres nothing you can do when the people are meeting a certain level of maturity
---
"Bro, just try it...you might be surprised how much you like it. All the big streamers who said it wasn't be good have now made videos about how amazing it is."
---
Eh, I would say I'm fairly addicted to classic but I have no problem just watching Soda until the actual launch. This is much more than that.
---
Playing the game blind is by far the most fun way. 95% of this subreddit envies you
---
I can't tell if you're being deliberately obtuse.  I don't mind streamers in general because I think the visibility is good for Classic WoW.  That said, individual streamers have behaved badly in the past, and even where they themselves don't behave badly, the follower ecosystem for particular streamers can affect the player experience for other folks in game.  Those are both 100% legitimate reasons to hate streamers that have nothing to do with jealousy.  
---
As for the folks hating on streamers simply because the streamer has beta or stress test access?  That's mostly a jealousy issue with the veneer of a fairness concern.
---
Didn‚Äôt they say they were going to shard starting areas?
---
0/10 no gurubashi arena trinket
---
Outside of group quests and dungeons, we honestly never grouped up even if we were around each other. We didn't want to split the XP from mob kills, and since a lot of quest objectives are drops from mobs that aren't shared with party members, we felt like we were competing for drops with our fellow party members who might finish a quest 5 minutes before we do even though we killed the same mobs.
---
That said when you do group with people it's just more enjoyable, and I honestly don't even know if our math checks out for thinking that soloing was more optimal.
---
Melee attack range is based on a hit box, as a gnome rogue main please leave us the size we are, i like being a bit further back so i can see more of a fight than a big toe.
---
Is the gnome bigger or is the dwarf shorter?
---
God Damn it's almost been 20 years and survivor is still on?
---
Paladins can use swords :D 
---
10 silver to Stormwind Trainer.
---
Playing Classic on today's tech is just as exciting tbh
---
How is this toxic? Comments like these do more harm to the community than OP‚Äôs post.
---
I knew level 5 shaman would be op. Shock, rockbiter, totem, and heals. You got everything from ranged attacks, to strong melee, to instant range burst, decent armor, and healing. When there‚Äôs no interrupts at this level you can‚Äôt be stopped unless outnumbered.
---
WHAT!! THIS IS A THING&gt;?!
---
way to bury something cool.
---
Poor rogues, i feel for them. Everytime they go to ORG, and someone killed him and you have to wait for respawn.
---
Not only will, they double up but they will pop into a layer gut a specific resource and vanish. No chance to pvp them or anything.
---
This is accurate
---
This sub blows with low quality posts
---
WC3 is a national treasure. 
---
Cherish it, love it, know it... There‚Äôs no telling what you‚Äôll come across in WoW:Classic that is directly correlated to very same campaign‚Äôs you‚Äôll play in WC3! 
---
The fact we get both WC3:Reforged and Classic in potentially the same year is heaven-sent.
---
Half of me agrees with you on that.
---
However, the other half sees why some of the older crowd don't like them. Twitch streaming is such a big thing now that it actually has direct impacts on games; People's server choices are going to be influenced by them because they are undeniably going to cause artificial impacts on realm populations.
---
I think this paranoia had snowballed a bit and is actually not going to be as much of a deal as some worry. As I said before, I think that streamers will be forgotten about by people other than fans once the game actually releases.
---
Nythendra controlled players that you had to deal damage.
---
What's the ideal talent tree for an elemental shaman?
---
It‚Äôs like 770 if you also get rank 3 pvp
---
Depends how you farm and how much. Lot of people never got their epic mounts back then, even an epic mount was a bit of a status symbol back then.
---
Cool name lol.
---
Still, what on Earth is he eating/doing over his keyboard for it to look like that?!
---
Well I didn't say you hate streamers.
---
And still, hating on a streamer because of their audience is also dumb. And there's a difference between hating streamers in general and hate the idea of being on their server.
---
Eat bananas.
---
You can go a step further with wallpaper engine
---
Manpower is where big money is involved. Depending on what other work they have ongoing it wouldn‚Äôt take them an obscenely long time updating graphics slightly. I would say they have a horde of textures packed away. 
---
Depends if they plan on updating visuals incrementally or in huge chunks. I‚Äôd say a lot of it will also come down to community feedback.
---
On a small scale, I‚Äôd be upset. If they sent out 50 beta invites. And 30 of them went to content creators, then yeah I‚Äôd be upset with the favoritism. Because there‚Äôs no way that all the creators were ‚Äúrandomly selected‚Äù
---
But if they send out, let‚Äôs say, 10,000 beta invites, and 30 creators get selected, am I to really get uptight over that? That‚Äôs 9,970 people who aren‚Äôt big names who get in. And then they send out more and more. But I also see why they did it.
---
They want them to promote the game, show everybody what fun it is and get their followers involved so they get people playing a project they didn‚Äôt want to do in the first place so it doesn‚Äôt look like a complete failure.
---
Plus. Content creators are creating so much hype and discussion around this game. They want them to go in, test it out, keep creating more discussions.
---
It will work but not real well
---
see if you are using mana for DPS then you will go OOM especially as a druid
---
Sure, I don't want to be on their server either, but they have a right to play this game as much as anyone else.
---
It is true at all ;) 
---
Get over it little kid. 
---
No one will give a single fuck about anything beside the world firsts which will all go to private server veterans who played classic for many years ;) 
---
In 3 years there will be dozens of players with Thunderfury in IF and no one will bat an eye. 
---
Back then there were maybe two on a usual server online at the same time ;) 
---
Having raids on farm status meant something. A guild raiding naxx was damn rare and special. 
---
Today every little mechanic is known, there are thousands of guides and BiS item lists. That was not the case during vanilla. 
---
If you saw a char full epic during vanilla then that guy was ‚Äûsomeone‚Äú and you remembered his name. 
---
No one will give a single fuck about someone clearing BWL in classic if it is not world first. During vanilla the first nef kill on a server was a big party reason and hundreds of people gathered in stormwind to see its head ;) 
---
I bet everything that on your upcoming classic realm no one will give a fuck about the first nef kill ;)
---
Yeah never warmed up to the new models either
---
This comment +9000
---
Where else are they going to go to do consistent PvP? There are no arenas in Vanilla and doing BGs takes forever to setup if the majority of your server is sided towards the streamer's faction.
---
Can you get a screenshot of their paper doll with the strength etc showing?
---
You are a warlock, harry.
---
Imagine getting a invite to the stress test, but because of a minor bug with 2 ptr accounts. blizzard denies u access because u got one removed.
---
Mind asking your 'friend at blizz' to add me too? :D
---
What happened that was not supposed to happen?
---
It's shocking to me that the majority hasn't realised that tipsout has been playing wow since legion.
---
I always thought it was Alterac, and that this is some random portal not THE portal
---
Should only make leveling faster.
---
Only downside is being on the same quest and not getting ahead of each other.
---
Priest
---
I've been acting like a kid again about this game and I love it. The feelings of pure joy even just running around at level 5 during the stress test are amazing, been awhile since I've been going crazy over a game like this.
---
With all these counter examples I'm surprised no one is mentioning the beta for WoW itself, back in 2003/2004.
---
*puts on sunglasses* I don't need beta anyway I don't even know why I wanted it, hah what losers getting into the thing I wanted to get into but I didn't, and now I think it's dumb and stuff haha yeah now I can go outside like a real person unlike the rest of you kiddos who are busy with dumb beta
---
I don't think we want videos that start with the words 'Fuck women, fucking whores' shared here, thanks.

This is assuming everyone selected one server. There will likely be dozens of servers.
---
"is there a boss in westfall we can kill"
---
why is this person even playing the game
---
Their entitlement and arrogance is what makes me dislike them
---
We don‚Äôt like that Sharding word here ....
---
Se use ‚ÄúLayering‚Äù
---
1/4 resist stun btw
---
I care for streamers covering the game, because it means people who just browse twitch to see the newest fad sees WoW being the #1 streamed game. 
---
They now may check it out and you perhaps gain another player.
---
Having 200k new potential players means more revenue meaning Blizzard is more interested keeping vanilla alive and well. 
---
Exposure is exactly what we need currently.
---
I thought I remember watching a video of a boomkin main in classic talk about how certain consumables really helped the class avoid catastrophic mana situations. Not totally sure if it's applicable, but maybe that could be a bandaid?
---
Seems like your bitching about people being bitches. Bit hypocritical?
---
Why do I see so many smart people say "I wanna level tank", do they not google anything? It's 2k19. Google it.
---
nO cHaNgEs REEEEE
---
yeah it isn't with all the classic hype there is too many people online!!!
---
I can't seem to get the FPS to dip below 57 FPS, even if I turn on V-Sync with my non-gaming monitor. Stays steady, and very high. I didn't get into the stress test, but I'll be curious to see it in a raid down the road.
---
The server is still up. I couldn‚Äôt get in last night, but I got in this morning and rode that shammy train all the way to lvl 5 baby.
---
There are plenty of zones to go to for quests, maybe you'll end up doing a few more q's in a grp than you would solo, but you'll reap the rewards.
---
Is there a 9 Armor Back Piece for Warriors available on horde side  in quests?
---
It's crazy how many people won't even bother with doing anything in this stress test. Some of them aren't even trying to hit level 5 to stress starter zones and will rush to the nearest capital city, sit in trade and exclusively complain about streamers.
---
So I have to wonder what's worse. Those who use their access to undermine a stress test to sit and complain or streamers not everyone may like who engage the content?
---
You are upset that people post game of thrones memes in a game of thrones meme sub?
---
I recommend to watch the whole video. Its amazing :)
---
I was a tauren around camp narache. There were 7 or so of us, all be slaughtered by the 8 or so I'm spawned hoggers surrounding the spawn point :p
---
Feral/resto works fine
---
Balance/resto works as well , albeit more mana intensive
---
I feel like these decisions probably have to do with common resolutions and aspect ratios between then and now.
---
The ones you like the most.
---
This is a Christian subreddit
---
Ur wrong
---
Just make sure not to look at the Helm of Endless rage on a tauren.
---
"or listening". I'm able to just have my headphones on all day at work.
---
certainly possible 
---
but your group may not want you DPSing at all
---
you are probably better off kitty dpsing when you can as it requires no mana
---
Hi, /u/yeetlitty
---
Common, simple questions should google.
---
I agree, the only scummy part was requiring sub as they Knew people would sub for it and just a fraction would get in.
---
Streamer prio etc is just how things are, not bad imo.
---
Stresstest is there for a good reason!
---
Ok, now tell me, where did I say that it was ever in the live game? I compared the models that were existing at one point. I don't understand out of what ass you are pulling out the fact that I said that this model was in the live game.
---
Addons were never a problem. Wow screwing up everything ruined them. Discord was awesome.
---
If you are going that deep in resto, you want Nature's Swiftness.  Other than that you're fine for dungeons.  No one plays a single-tree druid.
---
I am betting it will be 50/50 on most pvp servers. only servers with steamers and prominent pve guilds will be more likely to be skewed on way. source: most private servers of last 6 years.
---
Undead/orc rogue and undead mage
---
oh is that why our magmadar post got moved? or was it because the chosen one content creators didnt post it?
---
Thought about doing this myself lol
---
While it helps more people see classic, it doesn‚Äôt exactly mean a good thing.
---
It will attract good and bad people, at all times, no matter who streams it. The downside here is though, a lot of the community streamers attract are what a lot of actual gamers consider bad. 
---
All of the twitch chat going on in beta at the moment is the main example. If people want a ‚Äúclassic‚Äù experience, that‚Äôs gone due to how popular is - a big cause of that is being the big streamers - so if they were REALLY wanting that experience, then blaming them is accurate, even though it‚Äôs less the streamers fault, and more the community around them. 
---
There‚Äôs other valid reasons, but that‚Äôs the main one a lot of people being angry about it are mad about.
---
I agree with this, most subreddit fan communities have a meme offshoot. This is definitely needed here, especially as the community continues to grow. As much as I enjoy a chuckle from the meme posts, I'd like to have a place for serious discussion as well.
---
3 hours in login queue  without being able to even create a character was refreshing.
---
His point is that the gold sellers didn't get busted somehow, they just lost a job since blizz stole three gold themselves. That job is coming back in classic
---
This whole butthurt about the CLOSED Beta and Stress Test is almost as cancer as people "paying" to play the BlizzCon Classic Demo.
---
I'm just looking forward to the game.
---
Haven't received a Closed Beta invite.
---
Wasn't able to get past character selection screen on the Stress Test.
---
I'm not even mad. Say what you want about streamers (I'm not really anti or pro-streamers, somewhere in the middle), but at least it gives us a platform to view the current stage of the game.
---
On that point, building hype is a really good thing for Classic - as it does require a fairly large playerbase in order to be successful/worthwile for Blizzard to invest their resources into.
---
To be fair, anyone can beat Tips.
---
Even though I didn't get to play at all one thing I'm pretty happy about now with the stress test is seeing how many of my names are easy to get. gives me a good feeling about reserving the ones I want when the time comes.
---
Spot. Fucking. On. "I've been so nice to you Blizzard, you HAVE to put out for me." This mentality is disgusting. It's a damn video game!
---
Or dwarves smaller? ;)
---
Yep, there is no arguing with that.
---
Layers would make you less likely to see that other person, and you wouldnt really be able to group with them for DM
---
Vuhdo is getting ported too. The interface and setup is.....interesting, but once you figure it out it is really good.
---
i didnt say it was useless
---
If you criticise things you are toxic in this day and age. The only way to not be toxic to these people is to cheer on ever idea and every opinion, Unless it's not their opinion or idea then you are toxic for having the wrong opinion.
---
Elemental Devastation?
---
Lightning Shield can crit, and should proc it. I don't believe totem crits will though.
---
Weapon Mastery increases your weapon damage, so the white hits/crits, not any of the flametongue procs, but should increase windfury damage stormstrike should be increased as well.
---
I'm curious how bad it will be at launch. Still going to be hundreds of people per zone, I'd guess.
---
Well, if you knew how to read you would see that I said that paladins are a hybrid class. But you don't so you made this post.
---
Anyone that mentions BiS in-game is gonna get blacklisted by me.  None of those 1337 shenanigans allowed here!
---
I always saw her as barely sane anyway so it didn't surprise me when she snapped.
---
More like you got played by Blizzard. lol
---
The first few days after launch, due to the extreme populations in the lower level zones, if you dont have enough hours to over level people and get into high level zones early, will dungeons be an actual decent way to level?
---
I don't care what they call it. I want to be able to actually play the game.
---
Sweet! This makes me feel way better about raiding and stuff. I haven't cleared the content before so I feel like there will be a MT ahead of me for sure, plus I might occasionally have to miss a raid. 
---
This seems like a fun wow life tbh, I'm pretty convinced. 
---
Can I ask you more stuff? Will people judge me for my race pick? So I know threat bottleneck is what holds raids back in vanilla so troll is best for threat gen because of berserking, but orc kinda looks cooler lol
---
pog u, easy clap
---
Hey now I resemble that remark.
---
:^)
---
Yeah nothing like wasting resources to write an algorithm to pick entitled dumbasses to a beta.
---
Lightning shield does not crit.
---
Might be better off skipping and buying one at razor Hill tbh
---
But I don't
---
&gt; And why is the server not automatically acting like an old one?
---
You do know that there isnt a "Classic" button they just press to get everything to their old values right? They basically have to reverse engineer the game back to how it worked in 2004.
---
I couldnt tell if you were joking or being serious.
---
It's really ridiculous how absolute these people are. Even though classic is already full of changes.
---
My fault - misremembering that part then.
---
Blizzard obviously isn't evil (in this scenario at least) and no one has the right to be super upset, but with almost all the streamers playing this shit every day, all day, and most of us not even getting the shitty stress test that was capped at level 5 anyway, it's understandable why a lot of people are upset and acting like children.
---
We see this exact type of post in every single gaming subreddit at some point. Whenever there is an outcry from the community, be it deserved like with Anthem or undeserved like it is here, someone always has to be the "voice of reason" and call out all the morally inferior members of the community for getting upset over a video game and then reap karma and gold from it.
---
Most people who defend no changes no Sharding etc
---
Will just change their opinion if they get into the stress test
---
You never had to after playing patch 1.6 and later. Check the notes.
---
Yeah I‚Äôd like to know what servers the streamers are playing so I can play on the servers they won‚Äôt be active in.
---
Seriously fuck this sub.
---
What a great way to prove his point.
---
Tip: Recommended videos are based on history of watched videos.
---
They have already stated that you can change layers by grouping up with someone on a different layer, and that they will try to keep guilds together on the same layer. Tgat's not my original position, it's been talked about by other people on this sub since they announced it. And yet, you somehow fell for them renaming sharding.
---
This is where you could be feared through the wall into 'old ironforge' right? I need this back.
---
Classic is also revealing that pretty fast lol just look at any of his pvp/duel clips.
---
Hey can I be a friend of ur friend? Pm me bro!
---
This. This is what I'm going through. I try to play other games to pass the time, but they all feel so very hollow :(
---
It's actually ridiculous how absolute the "no changes" folks are. Considering classic already has changes...
---
Don‚Äôt you have to be lv 10 to use 2h sword
---
Combat swords is arguably the best/preferred spec because of the simplicity, damage, and better sword progression while leveling. However, I enjoy daggers and have leveled both specs. It‚Äôs up to you really and your play style that you enjoy. Both are fun and viable!
---
That was a thrill to watch, I felt the feelings u feel (feel) when u feel vanilla.
---
People begged them to because they hated the Cataclysm changes. Blizz lost like 5M subscribers in a couple months.
---
There was nothing wrong with Wow pre Cata. It had subscribers coming out it's ears.
---
Dad is that you?
---
Information. If it breaks, that's still information too, but mostly it's "how much does this stuff affect the servers" in all ways you can imagine or even may not know about. I don't know what you know about hardware. It's a test, but not necessarily a "what's our limit test" as you can extrapolate from there with a large enough dataset.
---
If it breaks, you just don't have to do that last step, which is nice.
---
So actual context behind this clip:
---
1. I've been testing several builds in the beta to see how certain things line up with Private servers. Because the respec cost on the beta is at original values, I (and many others who are experiencing this problem) are hardstuck in certain builds. In this clip, Im stuck in a prot build that I tested 2 days ago and dont have the 25ish gold for the respec. This means I don't have tactical mastery, which allows warriors to retain rage between stance dances. Without TM, you effectively can't swap stances and use a Hamstring for example immediately, which is the problem that happens after the intercept. The build I'm in is just terrible in this situation and again because the respec costs are blizzlike on the beta (I personally think they should be removed for testing), I am stuck it in for now
---
2. Against a rogue, you want the improved shout talent to give demo shout the distance to keep the rogue in combat. Otherwise, the rogue can deadzone you as perplexity does here until they drop combat, stealth, and sap/cheap shot which perplexity does so well here. You can see me clearly Demo shout at 00:20, but because it is not talented, it does not keep him in combat which allows the restealth.
---
3. Perplexity is one of the best, if not the best rogue 1v1 dueler in the world. Here is a video of him vs. Monkeynews, one of the best warriors in the world. He wins almost every single duel in their series:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtMsTlNowQ0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtMsTlNowQ0). I believe there's also currently a clip of him and Kraun 2v5ing some people outside RFK on this sub. The guy is literally in a tier all his own.
---
4. Rogue v. Warrior is a tough matchup, and the level 30 meta doesn't help. Not going to try and bring out excuses, there were a few things I could have done different even in this gimped build, but the reality is a warrior's kit pre-40 is insanely bad compared to other classes. 
---
5. I am not even close to being in BiS here. I see a lot of people saying I'm in full blues, etc. Absolutely not true - missing a ton of key items. Again, not an excuse, but let's actually speak with the facts please.
---
Yeah if you're set on using BS at endgame I'd just start leveling it at 60. You can use your farming gold to fund it rather than taxing your money while leveling and building up to your mount, repair bills, skills etc.
---
Skinning means you'll grind a little slower, but you'll also Regen health while you skin, and eventually you start making a lot more money off of vendoring, and you can drop it eventually when you're ready
---
Well if streamers weren't running a multi-thousand dollar tournament on a beta that's 15 years old, I don't think some of us would be mad.
---
Now delete all 8 characters and make a paladin to 5 :)
---
I didn't know if Natures Swiftness was super important or not (again I never touched classic haha). Taking one point off of Improved Rejuvenation and adding it to Nature's Swiftness would probably do the trick right?
---
idk if you need to be arms for pvp. swifty was fury, but take that with a grain of salt because he was top 1% at pvp.
---
Is 49 bracket the one with pendulum of doom?
---
If so, warriors with engi and faps own that shit. Oneshots everywhere
---
no, dungeons are too late. by the time you have the level for that, you can already spread out wide in the world.  maybe RFC in orgrimmar is a bit of use for horde players
---
I hope you're right!
---
You do know that it's not rocket science, and far from impossible to roll a game back, or release as it once was, right?
---
I couldn't tell if you were being a condescending douche for no reason or not.
---
Yawn blah blah who gives a fuck.
---
He doesn't remember playing games that had a difficulty high enough that actually achieving something was worthwhile.
---
"The reason Vanilla is casual friendly is because being max level isn't the goal. The goal is to have a journey at your own pace, and to have a community around you. Progress is slow but rewarding. Friends are made while waiting for a rare spawn. This means that whatever you do you will have fun, which is entirely the point of games."
---
Lol. No
---
Where did all these retail babies come from? Our sub is infested with them now
---
ay boy
---
In Classic the graphics has more "glow" (highlights are brighter than in Vanilla). https://imgur.com/a/tgcCuFP
---
* Yes, the Vanilla shot is from a pserver. Doesn't matter, it's the official Blizzard Vanilla 1.12.1 client and lighting is not set by the server (it only sends the time of day, which is irrelevant in an inn).
---
* I don't have beta access but I have friends who do and they confirmed that neither the "Lighting quality" setting nor the "Classic" button affects the glow. (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/535557756166340618/581120792956239872/low.jpg) (Good and High look exactly the same from "glowiness" standpoint.)
---
It has nothing to do with popular opinion. It's all the anger and unnecessary arguing. Like the streamer example you provided is such a pointless thing to get angry and rage about. Who the fuck cares? This sub is filled with people with anger issues who rage and throw a tantrum over completely meaningless things.
---
Yeah. Agreed.
---
Warriors should fear rogues when they waste one of their cds, especially during evasion and tips feared the rogue because he dropped to 60% hp and got scared.
---
Some baddies like asmongold will be running off to PvE servers, but the ones that love PvP will stay on PvP servers and I'm pretty sure said servers will have really amazing world PvP.
---
I'm thinking of rolling in a server with people like Cdew and Venruki
---
Same. It was great for a while, and a good way to stay in the loop. Now it‚Äôs just extreme complaining, toxicity, bashing, downvoting for no reason, feels nothing like vanilla community now. The game will be way better. August 26th, last day we gotta read this fuckin sub!
---
I feel you! I'm trying to pass the time by listening to some Barrens music.
---
I know what you said. I'm not disputing that Paladins are a hybrid class, I'm disputing the fact that Warriors are not. Looks like you're the one that struggles with reading comprehension, not I.
---
Depends on what your wife wants to do. If she's cool with playing a healer class then any combination of tank/healer or dps/healer will work well. "Pure" classes might be easier for her to understand if she has never played a MMO before. She will have a defined role and can focus on getting good at that role. Playing a hybrid like shaman or paladin could be fun for her too since it would let her do something other than just heal you while you kill stuff. Talk to her and find out what she wants to do and base your decision on that.
---
She goes hunter, and you heal her ass (priest/pala/shaman/druid)
---
No lucky fishing hat. /fail
---
PoE is my all time favorite game.
---
And I will say this, the community is usually amazing. Especially towards the dev and team (it‚Äôs very deserved)
---
However, as soon as something goes wrong, even their subreddit turns into a lot of hate, against each other. (Not so often verse the devs. The one time that majorly happened, Chris said he was disappointed in everyone... and literally everyone, even those not included, felt like shit afterwards)
---
In all honesty, people will be people. No matter where you are, there will be people with different opinions, and some of those won‚Äôt know how to conduct the difference peacefully.
---
Good ones weren't. I bought the first 2ms GTG TFT panel in 2004.
---
Bro my level 1 Hunter gun sounded like a gosh darn sniper rifle!
---
Without the no changes folks (people who like vanilla as it is) you wouldnt be playing wow Classic stress test at all.
---
What he described is best for straight pve
---
If you intend to scrap often with your rogue, which you should, because you‚Äôre a rogue, dagger build is a better blend of pvp/pve imo
---
So let me make sure I have this straight.
---
 1. It restores more HP and Mana than any food and water in the game
---
 2. It cost 70 silver for 5 whereas the the level 45 food and water both cost 40s for 5 each (meaning 80s to get both)
---
BUT it is not cheap
---
Ya OK whatever you say buddy. I'm sorry you are too poor to afford food and water at level 60.
---
Perplexity is a REALLY good rogue though.
---
I do prefer the idea of having a physical copy which is why im glad I have mine still from years ago.
---
It's the opposite.  Echeyakee has the basic 2.0 speed. Humar has 1.3 speed.
---
I think they should stay in BWL patch. They bring life to MC, and make more PUG runs happen.
---
&gt; ecksdee
---
wtf?
---
We are all glad you got into the two hour stress test and stayed for 20 min.
---
Evidently.
---
There are plenty of legitimate reasons to dislike the big time streamers.  
---
\- They command legions of mindless minions that do their bidding. This has a big impact on whatever server they're on, be it anything from the economy to (in classic at least) world pvp. If you played the opposite faction you would need to keep tabs on said streamer in order to avoid the angry swarm of bees, consuming everything in its path. Have you seen what it looks like when people like Asmongold or Sodapoppin sit outside of Stormwind? They're surrounded by a hundred people, you can't even see their character in the mess.  
---
\- As a result of all these drones that just suck up every word, a tiny negative gesture or offhand comment towards a person will literally get that person hatemail and often even death threats. The power they wield is insane.  
---
\- They represent the game we play and by extent our community to the outside world. I don't know where you live, but where I do it early on was social suicide to publicly state that you played WoW. It took a long, long time for that stigma to subside even just a little bit, and having emotional characters like Asmongold, McConnell and Quin just constantly sperging out on their webcam is not a good look, even if they are just on-screen personalities.  
---
     
---
\-Then there are the subjective, human emotions that stem from insecurity. These hold no value in an objective debate - but it is nonetheless very understandable that people can't relate to someone who can fart and make a 100$ donation. Envy is a real emotion and to me a legitimate reason for forming an opinion. It's just not objective.  
---
As for why some people will be avoiding streamer servers like the plague, personally it comes down not to the fact that I dislike them or have some blind, unexplainable hatred, or that I'm envious. It's because it would legitimately change my experience for the worse. There will be a huge subcommunity of streamer fans on their servers which will impact the day to day business, faction balance, economy, server events like raid releases, AQ War Effort / Gong, World boss competition and more. Anyone who has played on something like a 10/90 split server can testify that it's a much worse experience than anything close to 50/50.  
---
Big streamers are objectively a blight on both the community and the servers on which they play. Even if they're good people behind their on-air personas.
---
&gt;hopefully they fight the good fight the entire way through.
---
Well i'm sorry to break this to you but they already failed that fight when they added in high res shadows, high res water, increased ground clutter, layering/sharding, right click reporting, etc.
---
Not true the servers had plenty of room after 10pm PST
---
Made that sound kinda mean sorry about that meant to say think about this logically
---
What's even your argument here? Are you agreeing with me that paladins are a hybrid class and that warriors are a pure class? Or did you just want to pop off at someone on the internet?
---
Dwarf anything, fukwitme.
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Autoloot according to this shift+click auto loot was introduced in 1.9 and full auto loot which we have in the current game was introduced in TBC.
---
It's a team game where you're matched with 9 other randoms you don't know and you feel like you need to rely on the 4 other randoms on your team. How the fuck is it not going to be toxic?
---
It's designed to be just like retail is designed to be anti social unlike classic.
---
I guess another thing I should mention is that I played Paladin in vanilla, so I kind of don't want to play a hybrid class this time around, and would rather be a pure tank warrior or dps.
---
If she goes hybrid she can heal and do other stuff as well so she's not just my personal healbot and is actively engaging.
---
Obviously companies value the exposure of influences and streamers. They know if makes them $$$. It's capitalism at its finest
---
Yeah, and I'm not even mad ! Ha, because you are the looser and you are mad, not me !   
---
And like now I got stuff and things to do other than playing this stupid game like you early access losers !
---
How does it compare to Jira?
---
The frost shock resto shaman is always fun.
---
&gt; The players who wanted classic probably didn't play live. I think you would be surprised at how many people want to play vanilla again without using a hacked server.
---
P R I V A T E S E R V E R S , Fuck waiting around, play yourself.
---
I think most of it is directed towards the obnoxious fans of the streamers.
---
I have! No response yet though. I‚Äôm not too bummed being the stress test beta but it worries me for the full release lol.
---
Most people either A) Level an alt that has a much easier time farming gold such as a Mage, Hunter or Warlock, or B) they develop efficient ways of farming gold such as teaming up with a healer and doing DM jump runs or becoming an enchanter and getting your hands on some rare recipes.  
---
It's also worth saying that you definitely do not NEED to be arms to do pvp, its just the best spec.  You can pvp as warrior in any spec as long as you group up with people.  A solo warrior is going to have a tough time regardless of spec.
---
Nah it wont change anything, people will still play combat Swords or Daggers. However.  
---
**Alliance** rogues will be a little more forced into daggers, since fury warrior compete more for the swords.  
---
On **Horde** side, Swords are little more common, since there is less competition, there still is ofc. But with many beeing orcs, you have a better chance of getting them.
---
How do you still not understand?
---
I'm saying that by using your own parameters, Warrior is a hybrid class and should be subjected to the same hybrid tax as everybody else.
---
No fishing competition this test.
---
Huh. Alright then.
---
I'm going for my old 0/21/30 frostfire Mage spec, not really a unique build but it was the most fun I've had in WoW.
---
No I'm saying the blame doesn't rest solely on the tools but the community aswell.
---
All those 3 classes level very differently and will have a fundamentally different journey to 60. If you have a job you will probably spend 2 months + to get to 60, so play what you think is most fun overall, not just for endgame or you will burn out.
---
Damn, me and a guy were talking about going last night once everyone started getting in, but this is the only way I knew to get in and I thought it needed a mount for sure? fffffffff
---
&gt; but it's pointless to lie about it ecksdee
---
You must be new to the internet oh sweet summer child.
---
You know that's literally the point of the upvote down vote system yeah? It's not an "I like this" thing.
---

---
- Warrior does not yet have mortal strike, which is a huge deal in terms of damage.
---
- Warrior does not yet have zerk rage, which is the main reason the rogue was able to get off the bandage &amp; kill him.
---
- Rogue has MoTW &amp; BoM.
---
At level 30 a mage in no gear could beat a Warrior in full gear. Using blink, nova, and rank 1 frostbolt. There are pockets of levels where things like this happen. Again, the Warrior is doing things wrong ‚Äî never going D stance being chief among these as well as not using sword/board, giving the rogue his back over and over, etc. ‚Äî but my whole point is that this is not a great judge of overall ability of a player for the stated reasons.
---
I wish I enjoyed RTS games even a little bit. I feel like I'm missing out on amazing stuff but I've tried RTS games for 2 decades now and not one has clicked with me.
---
Oh well, not like I'm short on games to play till classic is out.
---
Most warrior who main fury will do 2man stealth DM:E farming or even bring in rogues and sell the sayters bow for 10-20g to the rogue. 
---
Warriors that main prot will do Strat Live runs and reserves the first 1-2 righteous orbs and will also have hunter/mage alts for farming gold. 
---
You can also do a 31point arms/fury and put the other 17 in prot  but the spec isn‚Äôt very good. 
---
You can tank all dungeons as a dps spec just not raids.
---
So you're saying theres a chance...
---
Please please please don't be pvp scaling!!!
---
&gt; I bet it's from a private server.
---
Dont take manhoney, it's all i have left...
---

Again, the Warrior is doing things wrong (never going D stance being chief among these as well as not using sword/board), but there are other factors
---
Why is it so hard to understand that people want to go back to the way it was. We don't want your proposed changes.
---
Yep, probably not the best. But it's purple and shiny!
---
Yes, but I haven't figured out how to do that for classic.
---
It's something I noticed when I went to E3 once. People have various reasons for going to E3, but surely quite a few of the people just want to play their favorite game before it comes out. So they've spent hundreds traveling to LA and get a hotel, then stand in a line for 30 min to 2 hours just for the chance to play their favorite game for maybe 10 minutes. It seems to be a really REALLY strong motivator with some people, to be able to play the game as soon as possible.
---
my ding ding dong?
---
I would go windowshopping for a guild before I made any drastic decisions like that :p
---
I mean we'll find out at 3 or 6 PST, not a long wait to see if it was a bamboozle.
---
Comparing "fake news" to a photoshopped blue post on WoW forums that reads absolutely nothing like a fake or joke post with the exception of two words is fucking laughable and you're actually a retard if you think real news on a news website can even be compared to this. God I fucking hate people like you
---
I'm in the same boat with my girlfriend. I actually think Mage Druid is a really strong combo with you playing the druid. I think Mage is a really solid class for beginners. It can obviously be very high skill cap, but the basics of "cast frost spell slow the target" is pretty intuitive and being a ranged DPS makes positioning and moving a little more forgiving for a new player. Also there's just less expectations and responsibilities for DPS. Having the other player be a druid let's you fill all roles effectively if you group for dungeons.
---
Only issue is that on ally druids start about as far away from mage races as possible. Tauren isn't nearly as bad, but still.
---
If you're going ally Pally Mage is also a decent option for the same reasons, pallys are just a little worse at both tanking and dpsing.
---
Whether people say "this is beta!" or not. This can absolutely not happen at launch.
---
Unacceptable and I hope Blizzard knows that.
---
He dueled either Mn or Tribe, literally two of the best in world who both have escape artist as gnomes, which is huge against crippling poison. Again, not gonna make excuses but there's a tangible different.
---
not sure about that
---
Locks have to compete with Mages and Priests for cloth gear
---
All sp mail gear instantly goes to your shams unless you have dumb hunters that think it is hunter loot
---
Probs easier to gear a sham
---
So many excuses from tipsout. Perp has no business winning this duel after getting, what, four resists? Y I K E S. 
---
That said, there‚Äôs something so satisfying about watching a Female Gnome humiliate a Male Orc lmao.
---
Sounds like something a BLIZZARD EMPLOYEE would say, eh, TheFoxGoesMoo?
---
No changes reeeee! 
---
Also I love the idea of layering. As long as it‚Äôs disabled in p2 it‚Äôs a brilliant idea on blizzard part.
---
With layering, it's probably possible to obtain within 24 hours.
---
Waiting for you to counter a single point I just made. I'll keep waiting.
---
There sticking very close to patch 1.12. 
---
That means no horde paladins and no alliance shamans. Factor that into what faction you decide to play.
---
&gt; The Dark Portal was created through a joint effort between the human mage Medivh, possessed by the Dark Titan Sargeras, and the warlocks of the orcish Shadow Council led by Gul'dan as a means to allow the Old Horde, under the demonic influence of the Burning Legion, to invade the world of Azeroth. Nearly every draenei prisoner who still lived was brought to the base of the Dark Portal. At the moment the ritual began, Gul'dan drained all of their life essences in an instant, giving the massive burst of power needed to cross such a large distance.[2] The Portal bridged the cosmic distance between the worlds of Azeroth and Draenor, and was at first only large enough that individuals might pass through it. Gul'dan immediately dispatched scouts through the Portal in preparation for the coming invasion. After the Portal was widened, the armies of the orcs poured through it into the unsuspecting Kingdom of Stormwind, beginning the First War.
---
Hrm.  That's fair.
---
Yeah imagine this during a world boss raid..
---
Why did I know someone was gonna say something in this fashion the moment I identified OP as a female.
---
Ideal shard size is 1. I don't want some fucking strangers I don't even know to **ruin** my MMORPG experience.
---
If she's new to MMOs she's likely going to struggle to hold aggro on targets and struggle to stay alive. I wouldn't recommend that.
---
Thanks for posting this, I don't feel so bad for being left out anymore.
---
Don't worry, once you are actually in game daddy Blizzard will ban any bullies that kill your character or call you mean names.
---
Well you'd need to give me specific examples of what kind of conduct they are doing that gets hated on. I mostly watch Soda and from what I can tell he's pretty level headed. When doing the race to AQ yesterday he healed someone who was getting attacked knowing he would pull agro and die. When trying to farm items he takes into account the idea that he shouldn't ask people for help who wouldn't benefit themselves while helping him.
---
RP servers are great to help keep the trash out.  keeps the chat cleaner, keeps the names cleaner, keeps most of the bs out.
---
We're all waiting
---
You know the view is distorted when you use a wide screen resolution on the 1.12 client right? The game squishes the image instead of increasing horizontal fov like it does with 3.0+ clients.
---
They hinted at TBC expansion. So I'm going to assume they are going to do WotLK as well.
---
I expect further expansions will not include the talent changes of Cataclysm or I will drop classic like a hot cake.
---
PvE/PvP dependent
---
And also dependent on group/solo play
---
Horde are better solo, better racials in a duel....For the most part
---
Alliance is better than horde in most scenarios in group combat. Fear ward &gt; UD racials. Paladin &gt; Shaman
---
Good, fuck those little shits.
---
If you want a game with every class being within 5% parses on raids, you are not going to have a good time playing classic. Just pick a class you like and have fun. If you have any sort of personality you can make friends and enjoy all aspects of the game.
---
Cant say I've ever tried Jira, but it's super customizable and people with ServiceNow certs make BAAAAAAAANK
---
I wouldn't recommend a tank for a first time MMO player.  It's the hardest role, has the most responsibility, get flamed alot in groups if it doesn't go well, etc...  Pally is probably solid though, and ret would be very simple to play and still have the heals and bubble.
---
This is why people fucking hate some of the streamers that got in, They are only milking it for the money. But you have nerds here who will fondle their nuts till the end of time.
---
Ok day one fix or so help me god I'll riot
---
Ahh well for effeciency I just wouldn't trust a new player to do the healing or tanking.
---
With her as a hunter, her pet can tank, plus she gets to pick a (cute) pet
---
And if you heal her and saves the day, you might be in for some brownie points.
---
But honestly anything can work. as long as you are two it's gonna be way easier to quest than going solo :)
---
i never said there was an email.
---
I'm not a shaman expert but something along the lines of this: 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hqbuVfMqZZxcbt0Lo
---
The 30-0-21 is the best spec, some exact points might be a bit off.
---
They said in an interview that there will be no sharding.
---
Anal
---
Not on my list so should be good to go bud.
---
Go in blind and play how you want. Look at builds when you hit 60.
---
Pvp server have non consent pvp once you leave the starter zones (level 1-12) 
---
Pve servers in all zones require you to physically type /pvp to enable you to be attacked. Any one can attack a pvp flagged character. Attacking a pvp flagged character will then flag that person aswell.
---
Yeah I‚Äôll ask on here closer to the release date lol :D
---
Come on guys. Why so much hate against tips out? Many would lose against Perp.
---
Nice passive aggressiveness. Brother it's 2019 you know. Leave that stuff back in 2010 and grow out of it. Just being toxic at this point.
---
It's a toggle in the options.  It seems to be there intentionally.  It's single target only though.
---
So you have poor reading comprehension. Understood.
---
It's part of the true classic experience
---
But you had OP 25% stun resist and did indeed resist like four times. I‚Äôll take that over one (1) Escape Artist against a rogue. 
---
Stop making excuses man you sound like a little bitch. Just admit you‚Äôre subpar and never again say you‚Äôre a good dueler. Have some humility.
---
Looks same height to me
---
Not a streamer, March 2005, I got an invite.
---
My advice it so play whatever class you think you would enjoy the most.  They all have pluses and minuses and its a long journey to 60.  Never play what someone else tells you is best or fun.  
---
There will be a lot of people who already know what to do and where to go, and there will be a lot of people who are learning just like yourself.  Level up and get into a guild with these people and go learn what to do!  I would love to have the chance to do that again.  
---
It doesn't matter what class you play, 90% of getting on a raiding team is showing up on time and being fun to play with.  Your raid leaders will tell you what spec is the best and if you are serious about helping your team then you will learn how to play your character in a way that benefits the raid the most.
---
I like to call them Scrotum Swingers.
---
Dude no point in defending yourself, just enjoy duels against good ppl and dont let the haters drag you down.
---
Just laugh it off, and arguments dont work on ppl that want to hate you.
---
Thanks for getting the guys into beta.
---
I‚Äôm playing PvP and leveling with one other person
---
What a fucking nerd
---
And here I am just finishing some games that are on sale till release
---
You mean size of the number right? 
---
Then I agree, dont remember that
---
Edit: Idc if this will be in on launch, even if not ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù - not that idd guess many would, but you never know in here
---
mate tips, just ignore these kids, there's no saving their silly need for drama, perp loves you man i'm sure you know it, you're both good players and obviously perp is insane you don't need to make excuses or even reply to these morons
---
5:30 PM PDT happens when this comment is 5 hours and 59 minutes old.
---
You can find the live countdown here: https://countle.com/3xyIdaG-g
---
Even just using the best 2h weap you can find with windfury and no enh talents/gear will still give you a nice burst option in melee range vs non-weapon targets, and then you can switch to the best 1hdamage weap/shield vs a rogue, warrior or ret paladin.   Especially in vanilla where the weapon buffs only buff your weapon damage rather than spellpower /etc that happened later on.
---
Not sure why you're getting downvoted. It's true immersion in the world.. of Warcraft!
---
Wew...
---
I feel really bad, now. When I started this dialogue with you, I was under the impression that you were just stupid. Now that I know I was arguing with a retard I feel terrible. I'm awfully sorry big guy. You have fun believing whatever you want! I think you're sooper dooper cool! My cousin is special needs, so I can commiserate with your plight. Hang in there.
---
Fuck off mon
---
Because he's a leech, a child, a braggart and a moron.
---
Alrigth thanks guys for answer :)
---
I get that the guy is almost sarcastic always, and he is pretty funny sometimes. But one question in my head keeps bugging me...are all the soda bottles around him legit? Or he just places them there to show off a shut-in vibe?
---
Aww buddy, im perfectly fine with that
---
Glad they didn't close these off. Had a lot of fun exploring CoT and trying to find ways to walk through the instance portal and go to a secret instance
---
Well  I would like to not see them from other droods. I play drood too and on some pservers I must say it is quite bad that I am not sure if this is my hot or the hot from other drood.  And in old wows you were just overwriting the ohter hots, it is not like we have now on retial where you can have 10 hots from 10 druids on a tank without issues...
---
Tbh I think they were legit surfing on an anti-Vanilla hate wave by conviction rather than doing that for the $$ . Money is one thing, but if you've spent time on YT comment sections or on WoW Forums before Classic announcement, you certanly realized there were tons of people with such opinions, and they were mostly non streamers who didn't make a single penny out of it. 
---
**"Muhmuh I like retail, people who play Classic think retail is trash so I hate them !"** \-- that's how it goes. And since they spent time around people who all thought the same, they stood that ground. But now, playing Beta has forced them to dive into the other side arguments, and they start enjoying it. Maybe money influences that, but it seems pretty genuine to me. A good example of being narrow minded and not listening to other people that is. These streamers just ended up embarassing themselves.
---
Just saw a post in r/wow that said he got hateful striked by patchwerk for almost 28000 (on almost no armor since he was lvl 1)
---
That's at least 1 data.
---
Also very, very curious about this.
---
Lmao so funny le meme xD
---
submit bug reports
---
pretty large discrepancies
---
I have never seen him stream other than his class guides so I had no idea.
---
I don't have to counter your excuses, you're still bad even if you're right about all of them. I just wish you'd stop streaming, you're a leech, a child, a braggart and a moron, and worst of all, you're a disgrace to all warriors. Bad in PvP, worse as a tank.
---
Spouse and I always end up as Warrior &amp; Priest. You pretty much get to call the shots for your entire WoW life. :)
---
This is the only answer that matters.  People who pick a class based on what someone else told them is the best end up being miserable at 60 in my experience.
---
My keyboard got pretty bad like that after not properly cleaning it for years. Spent about 3 hours cleaning each key with alcohol wipes and removing all the hair that had built up inside. Never going to let it get that bad again.
---
Ok wait, what if SHE goes warrior (not prot) and I go Shaman? :thinking:
---
Oh the nostalgia. reminds me of vanilla wow
---
Not as long as you think.
---
They have 1% hit on them.
---
I also did a hunter today, died 0 times. But did forget hunters could not auto shoot and run at the same time. Also if your auto range and click a melee at range you just kind of stand there doing nothing.
---
I hear you.  I was just playing devil's advocate for ya. Both sides have pros and cons for sure.  But this is the side blizzard took so we have to more-or-less go with it at this point.  Or vote with your wallet (or just wait until phase 2 when it's been disabled).
---
Tbh I'm pretty sure that I think people don't even read comments or replying. They just come in and vomit their opinions and rehash old threads about whatever topic is at hand.
---
That's 39, you'd want Kang the decapitator. Still if you're willing to bust out the faps regularly (or role with a healer), you'd definitely be a beast. For OP who says they only have a few hours though, i'd stick with hunter.
---
Combat swords is better than dagger at most times so don't worry.
---
Did you just attempt to "I'm rubber you're glue" me? Calling on someone to correct their behavior is not passive aggressive. I was direct and confronted the person head on.
---
Some would say it wouldn't be classic without Chinese gold sellers. On a more serious note, hope blizz has the means to deal with them.
---
Can you tank instances as warrior without going prot until you hit high levels? Maybe fury Warrior/ ele+resto Shaman might be smart.
---
Im gonna wait for a explanation on stream To mutch text
---
Retail mantra
---
I'd encourage having her heal. DPS wouldn't be bad either, but tanking is the most important roll and having her do it on her first play through would cause ample frustrations for you both. 
---
You could also sit down with her and watch a youtube video outlining all the different DPS/Healing roles and perhaps one will jump out to her.
---
I'd have been more mad if I missed the opportunity to experience them spawning bosses and so forth, tbh. It was really the whole reason I wanted to get into the server at all. Spent 2 hours clicking "Accept" on character creation getting "Character creation timed out" while everyone else was having fun XD
---
Imagine feeling proud about a pvp fight against greens.
---
Thank you for proving the point :)
---
There was a blue post clarifying what they were doing with stress test invites before it even happened. Don't blame Blizz for not being able to read about the situation, they didn't bait anyone into thinking anything differently than what actually happened. Stress test = requires many people pounding the server with login requests. It's a beta designed to test and weed out bugs and issues, not a demo just for playing.
---
Wait, who is the one calling the shots? The warrior or the priest? üòÇ
---
Oh man I hope that LFR adddon will be banned.  
---
Or at least hope Blizz will block some API that is handling LFR/LFG/LFD stupidity and another one like  gearscore stupidity and how many duneons I was doing for that dungeon IO stupidity.  
---
Those addons should never ever see the light in classic as they were never ever in vannila game at all.  I want ot have really a nice calm play without some stupid gear score checking or dungeon classic IO checking...   
---
I am ok with Armory so party leaders can check ppl but pls not that addons I typed above...
---
AIM and Yahoo Messenger. Right in the nostalgia.
---
Dude, it was fake. Blizzard would be under so much hate if it was real as they should be.
---
You don't need level 10 to train weapon skills?  Am I just misremembering?
---
I want the ownership of the ‚Äúgive us beta‚Äù when classic releases!
---
Exactly my point, people will say the dumb twitch stuff and won't mean anything to people that don't do twitch
---
But you don't Chad.
---
Uh, no, it's not allowed.  They unbanned everyone who was banned for just altering their character models, but they also announced that this was their only warning and that any further usage of these programs would result in a ban.
---
People are only playing chess because of the nostalgia from playing it 2000 years ago. It will die any day now.
---
Nope, not a thing.  Don't use them.
---
Yeah they hinted at TBC and Wrath. I think they will eventually. I def don‚Äôt think they will ever go Cata. 
---
But even if they did go expansions I assume they would still leave some classic servers up.
---
Assert your dominance but playing a female gnome warrior with pink pigtails. Bonus points if you use Ashkandi.
---
World first?
---
Tips what do you think is better. EA or hardiness?
---
They did unban people, but it's still against ToS.
---
I thought he was one of the #NoChanges retards that didn't understand it's just an ongoing joke and not a literal movement, but he's probably [just a troll](https://i.imgur.com/poQxTe3.jpg). Don't bother arguing with him, it won't go anywhere.
---
Nature's Swiftness is incredibly important. Always get NS if you're going that deep in resto
---
There's a slider. Personal preference. Doesn't impact gameplay either way.
---
They're going to use layering to make sure players can log in, but if theres 50 ppl trying to kill 10 kobolds they're not just gonna layer that down to 5 players ( I assume).  Its part of the mini game though, I was doing the Nelf area last night on the stress test and the first quest was a nightmare.  But you just go grind like 10 mobs that aren't that quest and boom level 2, unlocks a few more quests.  Some quests you're just gonna have to skip, or at least wait till you have a skill to ninja tag the mobs (druid gets moonfire at level 4 for example).  Also for the kill quests, group up.
---
Correct. I mean the number's size. I would think some casters might care because they won't have the somewhat satisfying numbers pop up.
---
If you're leaning the paladin route, holy/ret would be a good way to go for the above reasons. I agree with the other posters that tanking is too big a responsibility for those new to the genre, especially with a hybrid class. If tanking is something she's interested in, feral druid or warrior would be a better pick.
---
IIRC there was still plenty of tension on Azeroth before the orcs. Like the war of the ancients, conflict between Nelf, Troll, Human, etc 
---
But I think the Orc‚Äôs arrival really paved the way for the big faction conflicts
---
No, they count. There was 1) no talk of EU english Servers but "Eu", which includes everything, and 2) had French people in FF14 look for a DD once which is enough for me to be able to accept that its not confined to some isolated german server.
---
But really, 1) is enough. Eu says DD. Doesnt mean the majority does.
---
do not think so
---
Whats the point of this wall of text? You lost a duel to a rogue, whats the big deal? The fact that you're so insecure that you feel the need to make an essay of excuses to validate yourself to strangers on reddit is sad.
---
We tried like 7 times to kill the fucker, and finally got him. Those green pants were worth it
---
did i forget wrong that in vanilla you could hide the helm slot?
---
Hi, /u/Windrider63
---
All around me are familiar faces, worn out places, worn out faces.
---
How are you or anyone else surprised? The internet does nothing but bitch. It‚Äôs not just WoW, it‚Äôs everything. People aren‚Äôt happy until you‚Äôre not happy. 
---
They don‚Äôt want the end of GoT. They don‚Äôt want classic. They don‚Äôt want HalfLife3....everyone just wants to be super negative about whatever the big thing is so they can be heard. It‚Äôs tiresome. 
---
Just have fun and enjoy. Keep negative attitudes to yourself.
---
Looks fun
---
Hi, /u/PhalinRed
---
You're not wrong
---
you posted this less than an hour ago and the thread got locked and you got told not to advertise your stream here, why do it again?
---
Let's be honest here, I know it's tough to hear but:
---
Blizzard is CHARGING people to Beta/Stress test the game.  People are in fact, paying to play.  They don't have to, they can wait, but people want to do what they want to do.  And since they are paying, they feel they should be able to participate, and actually like, log in and play it.
---
Saying Blizzard is doing this for us is not really true.  Retail WoW is dying, they have been devastated in the subs department and there's no spin to that.  They saw people asking for it, they saw the number of people playing it on private servers. Sure maybe someone said "i want to give the fans this, but, I'm going to have to spin this as a financial positive."  They know they're going to make money from it.  That's why Activision and Bobby green lit it.  Make no doubt about it, it's $$$$ first, good press 2nd, fans 3rd.
---
Works fine for me. I basically do whatever I want and not have the money to pay for it, and get 0% for 18 months any time I want. It‚Äôs really not hard to use it effectively.
---
I would imagine it is, they said they didn‚Äôt want to keep it and the game is based on a version of the game that had already removed it, so unless they reprogrammed it into the game it has to be impossible, right?
---
Idk the only reason I'm playing tank warrior is so I get a chance at thunderfury
---
Are you going to PvE for gear?
---
What roles do you like?
---
usless holy shit.
---
Paladin warrior since you've told me fucking nothing of use
---
A year ago, sharding in classic was as ridiculous a concept as adding LFG. But as soon as they announced sharding, suddenly everyone loved it and those who expressed criticism were branded as being "toxic".
---
 Same thing just happened with layering. Months ago, everyone was like "Oh stop complaining, it's just for the starter zones" and guess what? It's for the whole world now. I could go on, but you get the point.
---
These people probably aren't shills, but they are definitely fanboys considering they lash out if you dare speak poorly about their favorite company.
---
Curious as to why, he‚Äôs just a normal dude and is mostly respectful of other personalities in the wow community.
---
Right? Installed and logged in within half an hour and laughing at these idiots complaining about waiting a few months
---
Ah, so you'd rather see people posting the same memes about the beta over and over again instead of discussion? Cool
---
That requires you to be horde. No bueno
---
People will always still pug it. It just sucks for those in there early to have run it for weeks with no chance at a drop.
---
Of the bear not the tiger, what a scrublord
---
Might be worth looking into then... I admin our Jira, but it's pretty tedious to configure/customize. They rely a lot on third-party plugins.
---
Did you already get in for being friend/family
---
&gt;not gonna make excuses
---
It's okay to just say someone bested you. There's no shame in that. You're getting shit from people because there's been a couple examples of you seeming quite too proud to admit fault.
---
Nothing against you personally man, just an observation. Glhf
---
100% Legit
---
This is exactly how it was before release. A small small group got into closed Alpha. The group size slightly increased for Closed Beta. Every couple months more closed beta invites would go out and a new phase would start. There were only two actual stress tests and they didn‚Äôt really get enough people in to stress test anything, it was like an addition temporary beta wave invite. 
---
Two weeks before launch it went into open Beta and anyone could register and participate in the beta.
---
If you're looking to DPS as balance with the ability to heal I would do 30/0/21. Starfire is going to be your best damaging spell so focus on talents for that.
---
Improved Healing Touch, Reflection, and Nature's Swiftness are going to be your must haves for resto tree
---
Not me but one of my good friends had a very similar story.
---
During WotLK my friend decided to get back into WoW and started raiding. We were in college at the time. My friend is running ICC when someone in his voice chat says "Yo ****, your voice sounds familiar". At that point my friend realized it was a kid who was in his frat but then dropped out. He messed with him for a bit before revealing who he was, but that story was always too funny to me.
---
A couple of friends have told me that there's a side entrance to Blackrock Mountain that only gnomes are small enough to enter.
---
I mean.. are you surprised? 
---
Perp is insanely skilled and tips is... well.
---
Nah, I'm pretty sure Yahoo Messenger is gone for good.
---
Impossible to know
---
No, not really surpised at all - i more meant to say have a keen interest in and play live actively, so their interests would generally be different. But I know that a lot of regular players would certainly want to try classic at least.
---
Dude, you still dont understand what stress test means... logging in is just as valuable as actually being login.
---
It doesnt take many braincells to understand how login servers work, they are useless if you are not "trying to login"... if you didnt know you can play the game without login-servers, and that has been a fact forever... people have been playing the game while login servers have been down.
---
I didnt fail at all... you just fail at understanding basic concept of logging in. 
---
Writing your username and password is part of the process we call login... already being logged in is not part of it. 
---
So dont try to be smart by changing the wording around and misunderstanding english, its not hard to understand english, its alot simpler than most languages in the world.
---
If you want to play with wording then they  would have said " ...and it‚Äôs important to have as many people as possible logged in during this window!" instead of " ...and it‚Äôs important to have as many people as possible log in during this window!".
---
"Logged in" and "Log in" have different meanings, one of them is present tense... ill let you figure out which.
---
Lmao why are you so mad. There is no sense of logic in what you're saying. Just because something is good it doesn't make it cheap. Thats like saying Gucci is cheap because it's fabric is of higher quality than Hilfiger even though it costs a lot more. Most people don't want to spend 6g a day for food (thats about how much you would have to spend in order to have food for a 5-6 hour playing session)
---
It said I was doing it on a private server, which I wasn't lol
---
You can tank the dungeons as whatever spec as a warrior, just have a sword and board, and defensive stance keybinds and everything.
---
Whosyourdaddy I think is the one shot cheat
---
This is likely due to the lag. Many pservers has this issue on launch or during heavy times
---
So get a dog?
---
Looked like an above average rogue for sure. Even with all of the stuns that warrior couldn't do anything.
---
However, if the fight lasted any longer then the warrior could've easily come back and win from all of the diminishing returns.
---
None, I checked through inspection.
---
My opinion, which is probably preaching to the choir : Don't focus on a specific pairing.
---
With two players who are coordinating well (the two of you do coordinate well right?) you are going to almost faceroll any open world content. If this is your wife's first MMO I would focus on finding a class she likes to play, then you pick around that. I'd just try for one of you to play a character with some heals or some tanking ability. And if she's completely new that character should probably be you. Depends on how she feels about being the center of attention in groups.
---
It is certainly worth considering how easy it will be to get into dungeons since if you don't do dungeons you are leaving a bunch of gear rewards and XP on the table. Finding a group with room for 2 DPS may well be tricky. If you've got a healer or a tank you can start your own PUG.
---
I'm not subbed to many individual games for this reason. It's all just entitled brats screeching the entire time. gets old very fast.
---
Now show it with a different troll hairstyle and see it clip through the entire back.
---
It‚Äôs play a private server
---
I look at it this way: I get to enjoy the summer outside, have some fun with my dogs, continue working on the relationship with a girl I'm seeing.....and ruin it all in August.
---
That's not at all what I'm advocating for. Don't make a straw-man out of my post.
---
Did you play in the stress test? If so, did you enjoy trying to finish those quests?
---
How much did you pay?
---
Play runescape
---
Got to get that streamer privilege or die trying.
---
Source? I don't remember that they addressed this specific situation. All I've heard is that getting crit while sitting shouldn't work for crit reactive procs. 
---
What Esfand does though is standing up just as he is getting crit. Somehow the server thinks he is both standing and sitting and the same time.
---
I don't wan't to get in. I want to se it first time in august. 
---
But i don't se why the invite streamers left and right. They are often have not the most knowlage of vanilla. And don't se blizzard need the to get out there product.
---
I want people who know the expansions and the classes. Nothing more. I want a polished game, not videos of streamers fooling around.
---
Unless you want your friend to get fired and blacklisted from the industry, don't leak things they tell you.  Blizzard takes leaks extremely seriously.  It results in immediate termination no matter who you are.
---
It's really not. Where is the toxicity? I just see people complaining about it. So you go to negative voted comments and try to reason with dumbasses or?
---
Please show me where it says that this is allowed?
---
You kill a lot faster as a group though, so you end up getting about the same xp over time if you're chain pulling.  And you can handle big groups much better like murlocks and gnolls.
---
You can also look at it this way: streamers have thousands of people watching them which means by keeping the beta small but giving streamers the keys you don‚Äôt get 2 eyes in, you get 2000 eyes to look for bugs, check that every elite is hitting as hard as it should, that tauren have the correct melee range etc. It is about advertising but it‚Äôs also about having 100k viewers on Asmongold‚Äôs stream of which if even 1% are looking out for bugs gives so much more exposure and likelihood that when the game is shipped we‚Äôll get it as it was 15 years ago
---
Define "game"
---
Clips or it didn't happen
---
Your comments read like a jealous high school girl.
---
Stress test working as intended!
---
The point is to figure out where things start to break so they can be improved.
---
I'm a Vanilla player from 06. Hunters are the best 1v1/1v2/1v3 pvp class in the game from vanilla till cata.
---
&gt; The stress test had layering and it was still a cluster.
---
Even joining in a bit later there were still over 200 players in the starter zone only being at level 1-3
---
Release will absolutely be a clusterfuck.
---
If u want to PvP, Orc or Undead have the best racials
---
Everyone has a friend :(
---
How do we know the dwarf didn't shrink? 
---
\*taps forehead
---
You're just proving his point.
---
lmaoo he resisted 4 stuns but he on here talking about Escape artist I'm f\*cking dead
---
Aka this post is fake
---
There‚Äôs wall jumping in classic?
---
For your first question - yeah, you can just throw on some defense/stam/hit gear and a shield and you'll be fine for all non-raid content.
---
Second - Yeah, Arms is the preferred PVP spec. You have high burst damage, reduce healing received by your opponents, and gain a little boost to hamstring to lock opponents in place while you beat on them. 
---
Third - "With gold." It does get expensive, so you have 4 options for making money as a warrior. 1. Level up high-profit yielding tradeskills and sell your wears. Fishing and cooking are good ones since you don't have to give up anything to learn them and they both provide some good gold-makers. 2. Play the auction house. If you're good at day trading/investing at all you can do this on any server. 3. Level up a farming alt like a mage/hunter and AoE grind / solo dungeon run. 4. Do reserve tanking runs. If you're a good tank and people know it, you can do things like live strat where you reserve righteous orbs, or Dire Maul and reserve the rich thorium veins. 
---
It's not easy getting gold and holding onto it on a warrior, especially once you hit that 50g cap for respec.
---
You mean schiet?
---
I don‚Äôt get the hate on content creators here. Sure they‚Äôre fucking idiots for the most part, but they bring publicity to the game. Why would blizzard let you in over them? What do you bring to the table?
---
It died along with every other emotion through the release of new expansions. We‚Äôre back to basics!
---
And then you start running
---
I know they are good warriors dude but you put yourself in a bad position when you say you're one of the best NA warriors when it comes to dueling, thats all. Didn't mean to offend you or anything but when you say stuff like that to a big audience you kind of have to back it up.
---
They literally told the actress who plays Sansa to sit down and accept the petition after she called it disrespectful to everyone who worked on the show.
---
It‚Äôs embarrassing dude. Disgusting, arrogant behavior. I can‚Äôt believe this guy gets any views, truly. Everybody tells him he‚Äôs shit, I would‚Äôve killed myself at this point already if I were in his shoes. Better not talk shit though or he‚Äôll call the police on me.
---
The twohand wind furry build is pretty cool
---
Funny, in open beta in 2004 I ran to the dark portal too
---
Looks good.. is there a way to disable enemy swingtimer so it only shows your own? What about dual wielding?
---
So you are saying that warriors don't need far better gear to unlock their potential in PvP and PvE.
---
They don't share pre AQ40 bis gear with 2 other classes, that will be also fairly dominant, and up to this point most likely perform better. (atleast the rogue).
---
And being the most played class wont pose drawback as a whole?
---
What game have you been playing? And how guilds running 5+ furry warriors strengthen this bullshit thread point?
---
If you think that warrior isn't the MOST gear/skill dependant class in this game, then...well i don't want to get banned for calling you names.
---
Also im not talking about raiding and guilds only, there is more to the game and unless you strictly play with friends or guild, you are going to tank and you are going to SUCK in PvP. 
---
That's the price they pay for EVENTUALLY becoming overpowerd in both PvP and PvE. But since you are yet another redditor with tunnel vision, you probably can't think further than "muh guild".
---
Yeah I know. Just blows my mind people would actually prefer the worse graphics, despite what their computer can handle
---
They also did test the game servers under load, in starting zones.
---
[Looks like quite the stressful situation to me.](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/844718.jpg)
---
You still would have lost even if you fixed all the things you claim made you lose. 
---
There's a very good reason that every single warrior on the planet knows about you and make memes about you on all WoW related Discord channels. It's because not only do you suck hard at the game, it seems you're completely incapable of acknowledging that you can make mistakes and will continue to make it known to everyone just how big of a cringeworthy meme you are.
---
This community loves to shit on the entitlement of retail players, but benefit from holding up a fuckin' mirror every once in a while.
---
It's really embarassing.
---
You know, until your head moves even slightly...
---
Thanks for asking, updated op.
---
This is pretty cool.
---
I've just restarted warcraft 3 to tide me over for a couple weeks
---
Do you even know what shill means?
---
a salty meme
---
When I first played WoW my friend told me to make a NE Hunter as they were OP. I had a blast with that character and plan to do it again now. I'm sorry you had that experience.
---
I meant he goes out with friends fairly often, school isn't for everyone at least he gave it the effort, moving in with a S/O is a big deal and something not everyone is always ready for.
---
My point was that why shit on someone else's goals when the importance of them depends on the individual.
---
Thats definitely a lot of it for me, along with the fact that even as all of it was going on and there were issues there was almost zero communication from Blizzard.  Hell, the forums were even down for quite a while iirc.
---
I expected a rough night, lots of DCs, etc.  I wasnt really expecting to not even get past the log-in screen for most of the night and complete radio silence from Blizzard.
---
Someone who does nothing would probably say something like this.
---
As in we both do. We tank/heal, we decide who gets in the groups (We try and spread out armor types so everyone has a decent shot at  loot instead of a warrior looking for 4 cloth...lol) Get our pick of the guilds, pretty tough to gank. (Although I've tried Hpal on a few tries, ultimate anti rogue gank team lol)
---
didn't we? With some people in this post I had a good discussion.
---
Minced water with a little bit of egg, salt, pepper, pepperoni and the mustache of an old chinese miner.
---
It's just a circlejerk of low effort posts at this point
---
I was in the stress test and I couldn't get in, but i did my part, kept trying for the full 2 hour window. Then woke up today and was like, you know what, I'll wait til August 27th, I did my part.
---
Do hope they sort it out by then though, which I'm sure they will.
---
Surely you understand that the word "imagine" isn't a meme.
---
Not everything is a meme, and people disliking your opinion doesn't mean they're triggered, it just means they disagree with you.
---
Particularly when you're lambasting an entire generation for their parents behavior.
---
I urge you to go outside and realize that your behavior only exists on the internet. No one yells "triggered," in real life, and no one argues that using the word "imagine," is somehow a meme.
---
I realize that you probably derive a lot of self worth from your internet personality, but realize that it isn't real. People don't act like that. You need real life socialization.
---
Try running Enhance shammy with duel weps. You can downrank the windfury and use it on both weapons.
---
Ah shit, here we go again
---
These people have friends at blizzard, meanwhile I don't even have a friend.
---
You just level it by killing mobs it‚Äôs not that big of a deal
---
Understand and it is a great new system I guess?
---
But again why do I have to pay money for playing the Beta?
---
I do nothing with my subscription right now but paying :D
---
Arthas, my son...
---
Yeah, its SUPER clean out of the box. If youd like to check it out they offer a free private sandbox on their website.
---
Somtimes when I came home from school I would just tell myself ‚Äútoday I‚Äôm gonna do stratholme or brd‚Äù, and usually that would take the whole day. Finding a group could take hours, which is probably also one of the reasons I never cleared brd fully until AQ40 üòÖ
---
My plan is to play eso new dlc till August :D
---
Troll Shadow Priest masterrace rise up
---
Most servers will be overpopulated by Alliance because the people who play Alliance are shallow and only picked Alliance because they wanted to have "pretty character models"
---
I did not have that experience.  I'm glad that YOU had your experience.  It could have gone the other way, where you invested all that time and in the end wished you had rolled a different class.
---
Im not so sure about that.  Just popping on for an hour this morning i met a lot of nice people.  Friendly, grouping up for stuff, pretty 'normal' and peaceful chat, etc.
---
There were a few people being childish (DAE THUNDERFURY?  ANAL CHUCK NORRIS LOL!!!!), but overall it was a pretty fun time.
---
here's my gripe with the stress test: I received the invite, but due to the bug of having 2 PTR accounts, I was not properly flagged. I spent hours on the forums and I figured out that because the stress/beta test shows up as a PTR, and people are capped at having only 2 PTRs, when blizzard tried to flag my account for access, it could not because my PTR limit was capped. I called CS and told them this but they said having 2 PTRs would not cause this issue. I knew I was right even after CS said I was wrong, so I asked CS to delete one of the PTR accounts in hopes that the account would get flagged. CS eventually figured out that, yes, in fact having 2 PTRs was the reason people who got invited to stress but weren't seeing the install option was the issue. However, they only flagged the accounts of those people who still had the 2 PTR accounts, and not the proactive people like myself who asked CS to delete one of them. So while I didn't get to stress test, I did have fun watching some streams.
---
This guy makes it on top of Org, meanwhile I can't even jump down to the eye socket above Wailing Caverns in less than 3 attempts.  Feelsbadman.
---
Lol, it's Quin :) Chill guys &amp; gals
---
Because it is a beta of a game that is already online. If it were a new game beta I would have to agree.
---
I want to buy him so many god damn flowers. This man should have a fresh one on his desk everyday for what he has done. I think I might love him..
---
Not to defend Tips or anything, but Tips resisted 1 CS, then perplexity landed 1 KS, then he landed a CS, then Tips resisted a KS.
---
When they complain at the 40 second mark that Tips resisted his cheap shot, he clearly didn't resist, it must've been a poison he resisted or something.
---
He's not.
---
What I would give for the fortune that you have.
---
Thank mr Asmongold
---
Thanks for this post. It needed to be said.
---
Yeah when he is in human form he is called Lord Victor Nefarius, also called Blackwing.
---
Depends which classes you guys like to play.
---
Warlock+shadow priest is really fast, strong synergy of spells.
---
Warrior+paladin/priest compliment each other, with clear leader and shot caller. Almost immediate groups if the warrior is willing to tank.
---
I have seen a lot of hate posts, but honestly what can you expect with a community so toxic.  I know a lot of people are super excited for vanilla but i truly believe half will get a taste and not enjoy it.  Going to be difficult to juggle current content and past content.  I don't play at all anymore, they went in a direction i didn't enjoy but even i can see a bunch of people sitting in queue is a proper test so everyone needs to just calm down about it.
---
WoW community in general is just shitty sometimes. I've been attacked for simply saying I prefer vanilla over current WoW and seen the reverse situation for current players saying they prefer current WoW getting attacked by the classic community. Not really that surprising since most people are just shitty, especially on the internet. Definitely not just WoW with problems like these.
---
Hyperbole and hyperbolic seems to be the word of the year.
---
Gnomes are the best PvP race for Alliance and Orc for Horde.
---
What addon allows a focus frame?
---
&gt;i really dislike daggers
---
Excuse me?
---
This has been caught in our spam filter, and I shan't approve it, but no race can be a Paladin on Horde. Paladins are exclusive to the Alliance, and Shamans are exclusive to the Horde.
---
This is one of the well-balanced comments in this entire thread.
---
Jokes rely on understanding and relating, so its not an unfair conclusion despite it being a case of the prior.
---
That would be my guess, as sad as it makes me.  Some of my fondest moments were glitching and wallwalking all over the place.
---
Would you happen to have a link to when they said what version of the game classic is based on?  I believe you, I would just like to read that post for myself.
---
Fucking streamers man. /s
---
To everyone saying "Undead for PvP"..  
---
WotF is a great racial but the hex heavily outweighs it. Also worthy of note is that the Troll shield racial can proc blackout if you get hit. Add regen to that and 'zerking and IMO Troll is BiS horde side.
---
Hahahaha imagine being this butt blasted. You‚Äôre a douche and a bad player who brags about being good.
---
Glorious
---
no streamers were involved
---
Male Trolls are notorious for looking awful in gear clearly designed for a Human model in vanilla. This is a rare exception.
---
Wasn't that way - at least early on.  Pre 1.6 or so - when I last leveled.  I remember mobs getting  harder and harder as I got further and further away from my latest rank.
---
Wasn't on Scarlet Crusade. I don't get the whole argument anyways. If you just specify which side of Dire Maul you are running there is no confusion and people don't have to ask. If someone just says DM I assume they are running Deadmines unless i know they are 60.
---
[full disclosure : I started about a year into TBC]
---
In some cases it worked out okay. As some of the other comments note though, quest drops were not shared. So I found that impromptu groups didn't last very long. As soon as someone had the quest drops they needed, they dropped group.
---
If you have a group of three friends that would work out well. You'll be able to tackle just about anything in the open world. So long as the group members recognize that they need to help the last person to get their quest drops. 
---
One potential downside is that in some cases the number of available targets for quest drops is quite low. And three of you may well have to kill the entire spawn a couple times over just to get all the drops you need.
---
"that warrior" was monkeynews, one of the best warriors in the world...
---
I helped stress test yesterday, through all the login server queues, realm offline issues, character creation issues etc. 
---
I got in late last night and stress tested a starter zone, taking 1.5hours to reach level 5 (should've picked a class with an instant attack - mobs would spawn and 10 people try to tag it) and generally just chatting with folks. 
---
And you know what, I loved it! I helped Blizzard get stats to hopefully make the actual launch less crazy (will still be crazy but I'm sorta looking forward to that tho, can always focus on leveling the week after) which was the whole point of the Stress Test üòÑ
---
My opinion of tips aside, as a popular streamer he *does* have an appearance to maintain. A thread like this can affect not just his viewcount but also his actual income; it makes perfect sense for him to defend himself in it.
---
vanilla shaman doesn't have dual wield
---
A potato
---
I'm not so sure. From watching the interviews that popped up it seems like Blizzard is going all in with making Classic a permanent expanding game using the original WoW formula, and not a dumbed down themepark on rails for all the ADD kids.
---
At least that is my impression from reading between the lines.
---
Yeah i actually did login today 12 hours after the initial stress test and well... i was barely able to tag mobs in teldrassil. I didnt see layering  occur very often but it did happen maybe twice... i dont know if those people were invited to group or not but i saw 2 people disappear during my nostalgia trip while chatting in the general for the fun of it.
---
There were easily like 20 people spread around the teldrassil starting spot and maybe 50 in total around the area before you go to dolanaar. Just estimates, but there was alot. (and i couldnt see everyone at the sametime anyway) FPS didnt tank at all tho and neither did the server lag at all... very good, very good.
---
I was going to go feral for leveling and resto for pve. The general consensus on balance is that it CAN work but not well enough to justify the mana requirement. Innervate is just too important to waste on yourself when mages/locks already eclipse your damage.
---
I ended up getting on four hours later and played smoothly all late last night. Again - it was a stress test. We played our parts and stressed the servers. Some of us got in some of us didn‚Äôt. See y‚Äôall in August
---
Reefolk is calling you.
---
I had to race change 16 or 17 characters from Night Elves due to the male‚Äôs running animation.
---
My god, that upset me. Was my favorite race, but I couldn‚Äôt come to ignore the animation. It was so bad :(

Played many new server launches on private servers with 2-6k people.  The short answer is after about level 5, things start to thin out, then by level 10 it becomes much easier as people thin out a lot more.  The first few levels can be tricky as hell, definitely group up with as many people as possible to share kills.
---
wow in depth
---
love it

more please more!

if all layers are part of the same server how does that 'fix' dead servers, unless you are implying it is going to be cross realm.

I don't think many people care.
---
This sub: We want Vanilla! Give us Vanilla!  
---
Blizzard: You got it! But it's going to take some time to develop and get it right so that players can have an authentic experience. In order to do that we will need to perform rigorous testing to make sure the launch goes as smooth as possible.  
---
This sub: NO FUCK YOU GIVE IT NOW YOU PIECES OF SHIT MOTHERFUCKERS WTF COCKSUCKERS LET ME IN NOW NO TESTING JUST RELEASE IT
---
Oh well at least i can level everything on the stress test and do hogger raids üòÇ
---
I think I am going to skip the first few quests and go kill the mobs a few quests along. Like the spiders in Nelf area... get a few level ups then run to Dolanaar.
---
If they allowed classic posts on the normal wow subreddit you'd just run into the same situation. People there will just shit on classic and the classic community relentlessly just like this subreddit shits on retail and the retail community. I see tons of toxicity from both sides all the time. People on the internet are mostly assholes lol.
---
Mild? They just accept the trade and then everyone forgets about them the second that trade window closes. The people that follow streamers around and give them free stuff are losers.
---
Have you seen the Game of Thrones Reddit?
---
Oh darn we have to wait for something in vanilla? Who would have guessed
---
Its almost like the whole game is designed around building up hype and then releasing it rather then giving everyone what they want just for stepping into MC
---
any guild that is into MC early already knows they will have to clear it every single week anyway man relax

It has always been that. That's what every meme sub is. The only difference is now we have memes about how bad the writing was.
---
Could be. But maybe crits arent affected?
---
Stop making excuses lmao its pathetic
---
Cranking up older game with nextgen graphics can ruin the aesthetics. Again personal preferences.
---
Thank you sir
---
See: World of Roguecraft - it's well-known that any Rogue, even naked is insanely overpowered in the hands of someone who knows how to play the class. Not blaming Tips at all.
---
Several duels is enough actually but 7 attacks is not.
---
I couldn't find a good link for a 1.12.1 client that I didn't think would give me a virus. The links I could find were all dead, I was wanting to test some stuff.
---
layering is something COMPLETELY different than sharding, with a completely different reasoning behind it.
---
sharding was initially planned to reduce zone load by creating 50-60 instances of elwynn forests on every server in the beginning.
---
layering establishes a healthy server population of 2,5k-4k after a few weeks (after all the tourists leave, aka ~60% of every server) and because a layer is as big as a classic server it doesnt have any impact on starter zones, you will still see 500-600 humans in northshire for example.
---
i dont like layering and its exploitable weaknesses/disadvantages. but you know what i dislike even more? Every server at low population after 2 months! "just merge them lmao", so who is gonna forfeit his name/guild name?
---
alternatively you could do it by creating frostwolf1 to frostwolf4 and prohibit name/guild creation if its taken on a sister server already. But now you got group thinking inside those servers (+ its ugly)
---
layering is fine,although i hope it gets disabled asap.
---
8 Bucks free shipping
---
it's a near 15 year old patch
---
There is no experimentation let to be done. 
---
Any combination you think of was thought about a decade ago. 
---
If by "interesting" you mean bad and thus no one plays them. Sure they exist.
---
So are cultists, cenarion NPCs in Silithus or were they removed?
---
It's a numbers game. Sub count goes up, so does the percent of edgy memelords and general trolls. It's the reason I don't go to the regular forums, even when I had a subscription. Joined Reddit for this sub.  Been here ~6mos. joined at &lt;60K, idk the exact number. The salt has grown steadily w/sub count and increased exponentially since they announced the release date.  I can only hope those of us who aren't total shitbags will help keep those that are in check after launch. Don't put up with garbage behavior in your groups and guilds. Ignore/report toxic asshats. I'm 37, ain't got time fo dat. 
---
"I'm 37. I'm not old!" --Dennis (bloody peasant!)
---
Except it wasn't. It was Tribe. But it doesn't even matter who it was, the whole reason this post even is a thing is because Tips was on here a few days ago talking about how he is the best warrior from NA when it comes to dueling. You shouldn't say stuff like that to a big audience if you can't back it up.
---
The Barrens look like shit with it, it's supposed to be an almost desert and there's grass flourishing everywhere
---
The cycle of life can be cruel.
---
I may be remembering wrong, but I thought regardless of what spirit healer you used you would always be rezzed at the one your physical body was closest to?
---
I'm going for vanilla priest. I do it for the swoleness, not raid viability. Haven't you seen those biceps? Stubby tends to be thicker, its not all about length, girth is also good.
---
It automatically levels whenever you level. You don't need to individually level each spec.
---
As someone who has been GM and raid lead for 20ish man raids in legion and BFA, I want no part of ever having to lead a 40 man raid lol.  Its hard enough to get 15-20 bodies in the raid who don't stand in fire, now I need 40?  Ugh.  But most of this just sounds like the typical guild that raids.  Main thing you can do when its only 20 ppl is prevent cliques by always including everyone, but even then reputations are developed and smack talk still happens in whispers, or worse on a stream lol.
---
I'm honestly just looking forward to the easier mechanics compared to retail, I'm not enjoying raid leading and being the shot caller for H Uu'nat P3... :(.  Who knows if i'll even raid in classic though, I prefer raiding with our group so if they stay active on BFA i'll still smash my face with them.
---
I couldn't find a good link for a 1.12.1 client that I didn't think would give me a virus. The links I could find were all dead.
---
I remember I wall jumped in to caverns of time during vanilla, then I died inside by falling through the world and foolishly went back in with my ghost to try and reach my corpse which then got stuck. Had to message a GM to ask for help because I was a dumb idiot. They let me off with a warning. Still remember that like 14 years later. Couldn't tell you any memories from the last few expansions though which is sad.
---
Like I said, it was very slight.  The amount of health mobs had rose faster than the amount of damage your spell would do.
---
And it could have been TBC or Wrath.  It's been a long time.  But I do remember stuff like that happening.
---
Human sword rogue is a pinch better rogue than anything else (maybe 1%)
---
Followed by sword/dagger rogues being on par.
---
You will always level as swords because of the positioning against mobs.
---
The general forums are just a cesspool of entitlement and delusional expectations of what a stress test should be. 
---
At least I can console myself with the fact that most of those people will never make it to 60.
---
Elitism will find it's way in. It always does.
---
See you on the roof of the bank.
---
The second paragraph,that is a bug. Blizzard tried to recreate spell batching and this is a new unintended development.
---
Streamer cancer. Can someone give me a list of EU streamers so I know what servers to avoid? I am familiar only with NA ones
---
People always complain about stress tests for games as if its shocking its laggy or early betas a buggy. Like duh thats why there being done to get figure if there‚Äôs problems and how to make them better wtf.
---
Id gladly fail to login for a couple hours if its gonna help with future stability. Why do people go into a stress test expecting anything to work?
---
"Hey Ben, don't forget to print a debug message in a public log file that completely spoils our evil plot" - Classic WoW Developers, probably.

That one of those circlejerk threads? People lacking in self awareness or the ability to acknowledge criticism tend to be the actual toxic sub.

No changes is legit, what are you smoking? Are you here from modern wow?
---
Well it's weird that she would call it that, considering most people praised the cast and crew for doing an excellent job. The petition was entirely directed towards the writers who single-handedly ruined it, despite the effort everyone else (including Sophie Turner) put in.
---
If I'll have the chance I'll record more data.
---
Well done you got to level 5 congratulations, this will condone in the history books
---
That would‚Äôve been super obnoxious I‚Äôm glad you didn‚Äôt get in.
---
great write up. at least on my server, every guild that was able to get in bwl was able to kill razorgore, we called it a freebie boss, so i never thought of him as being a cockblock. vael on the other hand effectively killed 3 guilds on my server, including one i was in at the time. also people are so accustomed to 25 man raiding now that they will be in for a surprise when they get back in a raid with 40 and how much more difficult it is to manage (and get loot)
---
Trolls are the best horde tank for generating aggro unless you're using an axe but most of the tank weapons are sword or mace.
---
Mage Mage is crazy
---
Priest warrior can be amazing too

Ah! I remember transferring over from Tich as well with Validus. Some good times were had on Kalecgos.

You got a problem with World of Warcraft you got a problem with me. And I suggest you let that marinate.

---
A shit ton. To give you an idea, I didn't buy my epic mount til BC
---
thank you
---
Did it happen when you zoned out on a boat/zepplin?
---
Not to mention the hardware requirement to run them. I mean sure it might not be a big dent but imagine doing 40 man raids with ALL 40 players in high res character models. That would definitely increase the  graphical requirements of our computers, not by much but it still would.
---
The fact that they are making sure classic has or can have very low graphics means we can even run it on potatoes. I might actually be interested in trying to run it on my tbc-era laptop if i can only find a powerbrick for it, i seemed to have misplaced that black thingy somehow.
---
JUST to test it out... for the fun of it, i mean  why not? people have retro gaming machines all the time.
---
Yes I am a blizzard employee. That's why I moderate the subreddit for a rival MMO. You got me.
---
not at all, game experience was fine with the layering that existed on the stress test. Got out of the starter zone &lt;50 min which is fine for me. I'd rather play with layer sizes that existed on the stress test than decrease them.
---
Imagine thinking you‚Äôd be better at beta testing than a streamer with tens of thousands of people watching who can also spot bugs. Not to mention a lot of (older) streamers are really good PvE or PvPers and have more mechanical knowledge than a huge chunk of people
---
Those are minor obvious adjustments, like support for modern screen resolutions. Most people won't even notice, unlike a quadruple polygon character model that's in front of your screen the entire time.
---
At a certain point if you die along the coast line you're considered close to Dun Morogh than Wetlands.  Didn't know about it until after Vanilla. In Vanilla I just did the Wetlands run.
---
What?  Humans are considerably better with swords making daggers less optimal than they would be on the horde side.
---
You‚Äôre right, you‚Äôre going to spawn at the graveyard your ghost spawned at regardless of what spirit healer you take res sickness at.
---
If a big streamer stops playing, the server they're on practically dies overnight.
---
Before then (if it happens), there will be login queues at all points after layering is over.
---
World bosses will be super tough if your single 40-man raid is supposed to defend against multiple 40-man raids from the streamers guild and their fans.
---
You could be more impacted than you'd realize at first glance. Personally I'm in the "thank fuck I'm on EU servers" camp.
---
My friends and I learned early on that the best way to enjoy WoW was to stay as far away from the message boards, and now subreddit, as possible. You can find no joy or hope there, just anger and hate. Occasionally there is a well thought out post about why something in the game is wrong, but after dealing with a mountain of entitled complaints, they get lost in the noise. I feel terrible for anyone who's job it is to read these messages. I hope they can keep it together and pick out the legitimate stuff without getting hammered by the rest. I hope they have extensive mental health coverage and ample vacation time.
---
Seeing this post creep up the front page, a well needed call to stop the nonsense, I want to put out a warning to anyone who is just getting into this game or thinking of coming back: avoid these forums. Enjoy the game on your own terms. Don't let the negativity of some spoil it. Very rarely is something in the game so seriously broken that it requires public attention. Don't add to the noise.
---
Godspeed lurkers.
---
He resisted 2/4 of the stuns
---
Invite 4 random people around you to do the early quests.  Once you get out of the starter area it shouldn't be that bad.
---
Or just wait a few hours and don't play when the servers go live.
---
At least that is my experience during private server launches.
---
STOP TALKING ABOUT IT ON THIS SUBREDDIT
---
you dont get rez sickness under lv10
---
If it's not a big deal why the original post?
---
Pretty sure that was the case as well.
---
Idgaf about then beta. Just pointing out that streamers are cancer. Fuck off and stop crying
---
That's not the argument I'm making here, my point was that people who want to play the beta but doesn't get to will have a better experience being able to watch streamers, if they like them at all. I think there's probably more people who want to play the beta but can't, than people who can play the beta. So catering to them is a net benefit, even if you have to remove a number of random invites in order to invite streamers instead.
---
A couple hours, most of it was spent in Hillsbrad corpse running cause the damn murlocs near azurlode 1 hit you
---
Thats true. Happened yesterday on stream. Quin ran all the way from dun morogh to silithus as a ghost. (Even took the ship Menethil -&gt; Theramore).
---
And after rezzing at the spirit healer in Silithus he got teleported back to Dun Morogh.
---
Wow, how could I forget how complex checking the purchase date is.
---
Fuck off, fuck sodapoppin, and fuck streamers in general
---

---
Uhuhh... Not from what we just saw.
---
Based on the comments, you got your answer (rogue is OK throughout vanilla). As for absolute top gear, optimized talents and gadgets, I can give  you some insight because of private fun servers.
---
Rogues are still badass in t3 and they can shred people. They gain so much from engineering. The only downside is the cooldown dependancy, but that applies to all through vanilla.
---
Another note, you need to enjoy the rogue playstyle or else you wont have fun (hiding and attacking at poor folk, contolling and resetting the fight several times if needed, planning ahead and having quick reflexes etc)
---
This is true haha, just more meant using it to rezz
---
I reactivated my sub last night after many many years. Retail will have to suffice for now. :(
---
I ended up getting it from mega.us but I had to pay I think 5 bucks to be able to download the client without running out of space on the site. I'll see if I can upload it somewhere for you
---
It makes sense tho. Imagine how many accounts are there who arent even being used? and people who are subbed and play retail are more likely to give classic beta a try  than those who only play mobile games. No matter if they are opted in or not.
---
It simply makes certain that their invites have less of a chance of being  wasted.
---
awesome news to hear, I have a 2011 MacBook Pro with i7 2620m and integrated Intel HD 3000 graphics which some quick googling shows might be slightly better than your setup. hoping lowest settings at 720p on classic mode means I can play it!
---
Fuck you John Lennon!
---
I feel the same way. As much as I‚Äôd love to be in the beta, I doubt I‚Äôd even notice a bug unless it‚Äôs like something flat out doesn‚Äôt work.
---
Yah Apex got like 250k veiwers first 2 weeks. Now look at it. Let's wait and see.
---
How to out yourself as a grey parser in one comment...
---
There‚Äôs a *very cringey* video of TipsOut saying he‚Äôs one of the best, if not *the best* NA Warrior dueler on his stream. ‚ÄúNo Kappa.‚Äù 
---
Tipsout is a narcissist and is deluded about his gameplay ability.
---
No changes, plays with modernized actionbar
---
Oh that's really interesting! Query solved?
---
Sexy!
---
The only person who will notice it is the person who purposefully chose to enable the high res character models. It doesn't mean other players will see their character as high-res, they will see the settings they chose for their own character. 
---
I reiterate, they are choosing to use high res character models and know full well what they are opting in to, therefore it doesn't matter.
---
If you don't want to be around them, pick your server very carefully.
---
I don't care to be on one of "those" servers either, so I'll be mindful.

I know you can't turn off XP gain in vanilla but you won't get XP by doing BG or world pvp. And true I'm probably gonna need a money maker but I think I can still make money with professionals.
---
Ah okay. I just ran it every time. I was in a guild with several RL friends and they always offered to run with me, but I refused. It felt like a rite of passage and you had to do it alone lol.
---
Literally paying to be a beta. Thats peak virginess.
---
Lol @ using a video from 2005 as reference. That sh\*t is a meme nowadays bud. Thats like saying it's a known fact that warriors can 1v5 people just look at Pat and Maydie. What does a rogue using prep for every encounter have to do with this anyway? You obviously can't stunlock people to death at level 30
---
&gt; no cases to work with 
---
Sounds like OP is a case worker.
---
Man that brings back memories. Mages used to be able to simply blink through the portal entrance for it.
---
Completely agree that there isn't necessarily anything special about BWL and typical raiding drama -- was just trying to point out that the drama tends to come out when things get tough and BWL was pretty tough for many groups.
---
I know that guild leaders really went out of their way to prevent cliques but man it just got so hard because they would basically have to keep tabs on 75+ people (40 raiders plus replacements etc.).  I just firmly believe that when you get enough people, cliques are bound to happen.
---
I can't speak to raids post-TBC but from what I see on streams the fights in retail definitely seem a lot more demanding in terms of mechanics.  The hardest part about Vanilla raids was just getting the numbers (especially the right class ratios), the cat herding, and minimizing drama lol
---
The personalities (and drama) is also what made a WoW very memorable for me.  The bosses and raids were obviously cool, but the people made it more interesting.
---
Lol ignore him - he obviously wants to die alone on his mound of salt
---
This post is just an fyi that classic can run on older laptops and he was sharing his experience with that. Your comment serves no purpose other than to show how blind and ignorant you are, and we are all dumber now for having read it.
---
Cool
---
Can you imagine if this happened to every classes abilities also?  Potential impact could be huge.  (assuming the discrepency is as big as the OP described).
---
The only thing that bothers me is everyone saying you resisted every stun so you should've won. You only resisted half of the stuns.
---
Love this - Vael wasn't just a gearcheck boss, it was the FIRST gearcheck boss. Rag was a little bit, if you ended up with 2 sons phases you'd typically wipe, but Vael was so much more in-your-face about it. Like you said; short fight, easy to see where the limiting factors lie, that being said I also think it was one of the best designed fights of the entire raid content in vanilla.
---
NSFW
---
have fun :)
---
The loot aspect will be interesting, retail hands out upgrades all the time, In Vanilla it's quite possible you go multiple raids without even seeing an upgrade for your class let alone actually get the piece yourself. Players used to the modern loot style are in for a rude awakening.
---
what tv show were you watching where she was an angel, straight A student? literally every opportunity to make a real decision, she had to cheat off the smart kids to not ruin everything. her intentions were always good but the ways she wanted to execute on them were ALWAYS tending toward murder/burning.
---
3 months is plenty of time to complete many other games.
---
I spent 3 hours getting to level 5 fighting for tags on zombies in the undead starting zone. Shit was fun as fuck.
---
But on Live.. I've definitely got other plans on how to escape the starting zone and get ahead of the bottleneck. Over-use of Layering isn't necessary, just play smart.
---
&gt;...requires wallwalking at the final part, that's been patched long ago.
---
I'm here to randomly shit on classic.
---
They will just use the API to pull data to an external site and use a quick web search to choose to invite. 
---
It's literally impossible to stop this behavior. People WILL find a way to exclude lesser geared and experienced players.
---
Fuck this was a good analysis.
---
Why are you so insistent on defending yourself in this situation when you're usually quiet on criticism directed at you? 
---
You weren't playing like a god. So what? 
---
I realize people will, with the beta and release of classic, get to see how skilled or not you are but I don't think anyone watches you to see skillful plays. That's just not you. You likely won't get there. If you do, great. If you don't, nothing's changed.
---
You are great at selling yourself (and your sense of opportunity is amazing), that's why a lot of people watch you. I get that you're worried but these excuses (they are excuses) isn't really doing you any good.
---
Um..."as big as the OP described."  1 damage.  13-18, up to 14-19.  One.  Damage.
---
Ohh classic. Like, he‚Äôs a worker on cases?
---
Classic is going to be 1.12.  When it first came out, it was a guild killer.  1.12?  Have you seen what they did to the dungeons?    Lol.
---
Stop trying to talk sense. This sub has the biggest hate boner for retail
---
The stress test started at 4 PST. I hit level 5 at 10 PST
---
Well since most of the Retail addons use the built in /focus, we'll have to wait until someone makes one.
---
Glorious gnome dominance

.mod scale 0.7
---
Stress testing your gear‚Äôs durability as well i see.
---
I said it above, but Blizz can break these add-ons, but then it will just move to a website to check a player before inviting. This was the behavior in Wrath, and I guarantee it will be here in classic
---
At first I wasn't sure why people would argue this sub is super toxic, this clarifies it for me...
---
It's pretty spot on, but overall the other interactions in this sub seem pretty positive/excited overall!
---
I completely agree that Razorgore wasn't nearly as big of a guild killer as Vael.  I included Razorgore because, more than anything, I think he was just a communication check.  Didn't really need crazy gear to do that fight.
---
I even think I did Razorgore with a ragtag group of PvPers and some PvEr's with crap gear.  If I remember correctly, we just did a lot of kiting and fear chaining during the egg phase.  Just needed communication.  We died almost instantly on Vael though :)
---
no shadow form no go

It is because the community of wow players that post online are generally one of the most hate-loving, complainer-ridden, toxic communities pit there.  Like seriously, the VERY small percentage of wow players post inline just to bitch, and bitch they do.  I posted once about how I didn't think BFA was "The worst game ever released", and that after laying off a couple years and coming back was exciting...and the hate I got was crazy.  
---
"Oh you will see it sucks"
---
"Just wait until you have finished everything and have nothing to do"

Bitch, bitch, bitch.  If a wow post doesn't make the front page where I see it, like this one, I don't go looking.  I would rather hit some mythics, or work on my professions, or mounts, or achievements, you know, that endless list of shit to do in wow.
---
Did you even play at level 60? lmao
---
I dont see myself actively ganking other players so im still not sure if pvp server is the way for me, even if i dont mind getting smacked over and over as a new player.
---
oh *YES DADDY*
---
Yes, when you use mortal strike and ruin casters damage their enjoyment is diminished. You clearly never played a fire mage in raids. 
---
Selfish af.
---
Yea I was 15 back in classic, theres a 9 in 10 chance I was also an asshole.... I do look back on a few instances where I definitely showed my age like when I got kicked from a raid team for missing too many nights and raged, or like this story teased someone's accent. Its always rough to look back on but the best we can do these days is try to be better people. 
---
I'm more excited for the new people that would be getting into classic more because I feel like there aren't a lot of games like classic these days for newer players.
---
Yessss, and not those furry, entitled bastards, called "cats".
---
Maybe because it's not really funny
---
MadSeasonShow did a very in-depth guide to this on his YouTube channel a couple months back. It is very well made.
---
https://www.youtube.com/user/madseasonshow
---
True.
---
Though I can‚Äôt imagine streamers take up spots like some people complaining believe. At the end of the day, they are mostly there for getting the game out there, not the actual testing part. So blizz would just inflate the numbers needed.
---
When did blizzard release a public beta work classic?  It's still private as far as I can tell
---
Lol, I'm happy we are getting the game. I'm not one of the retail people that like everything being easy and accessible by everyone. I was just trying to see what people's thoughts were on it seeing as it's already a low drop rate. You don't just get handed the Bindings. So you can chill a little there.
---
That hadn‚Äôt even occurred to me and you‚Äôre absolutely right. The streams I‚Äôve been watching have definitely had viewers posing questions about possible bugs.
---
Savage
---
AIM shut down as well I think
---
At the moment no.
---
I really wanted to have a feature where you could select which bars to display similar to how XPerl unit frames did it where you could stack as many variations as you wanted into one frame.
---
Once I get home I'll start working on it but it'll be a while before I can release something.
---
Taking into account the appearent trend of better looking games being worse, I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre going to revert to the old models. Just good juju.
---
she didn't snap/suddenly go crazy. she has always had good intentions and shitty/murderous ideas of how to get there. in the past she had counsel that guided her away from doing what she did at kings landing, but she always defaulted to murder when it came to achieving her desires. the fact that she THOUGHT of herself as different from her father never meant that she WAS any different. tyrion went on long ass monologues explaining how she's not crazy, that her whole arc has been building her belief in her own demi-god stature, etc. specifically to explain this for people who wanted to believe she really is a good person. like PICK ANY ONE OF THE OTHER REASONS TO HATE THE SHOW'S ENDING, but this one doesn't make any sense.
---
I don‚Äôt play BFA, that‚Äôs a Level 3 Rogue in the final image lol
---
Saying that he doesn't like classic is not an opinion. It's dumb.
---
One of the biggest advocates for vanilla servers, has been playing since the beginning and has also actively played on private servers. Yeah, he hates it and only plays it because it for the money.
---
exactly. ive got lots of great games to play but none with the consistent community feel as well as character progression in an immersive world.
---
Good find, hope they look into this more closely
---
As a dev, can confirm. sys admin is becoming more and more part of the development job description due to the rise of infrastructure as code being popularized by AWS.
---
[Here's some details on wind furry spec](https://d.facdn.net/art/rocky8wolf/1488278723/1484345013.rocky8wolf_wiatr.gif)
---
Did she? I thought the facial expressions were way over the top and cheesy
---
Hes actually afraid ppl wont let him raid in Arms spec. He thinks arms is a good spec in raids based on his memories of vanilla before various buffs to other warr specs and nerfs to MS. He doesnt care that MS pushes off powerful debuffs. He just wants to not have to respec for pvp at his raid's expense.
---
Why you people focus on trivial stuff you act like little girls the model of gnomes is fine i like it personally so deal with it and stop complaining over stupid little things god always someone try his best to be the center of attention.
---
The tidepod generation is really the worst.
---
What exactly are you doing with this. Lol
---
Charge range kiting like a pro wow
---
there will 100% be a community you can immerse yourself in.
---
Incel is the PC version of cuck.
---
That's fine.  But what happens if it scales with level .....that's what scares me.
---
Maybe the reason you dont think tanks can wear lionheart is because you had ret pallys healing you.
---
‚ÄúOMAR HERE!‚Äù
---
All the layers will be like that.
---
just wanna say ur right and all these other comments must be retail supporters making excuses... idk. fuck layering.
---
hahahahahjahahaahhah
---
Nice.
---
Filled with retards
---
That's a whole lotta words to try and cope your way out of being wrong. Try again with like one small paragraph. My time is valuable.
---
I can let you know I bought some amd stock at 16.36 less than a year ago.
---
No, a lot of people are still online playing.. don't know what happened to you
---
no? they are nowhere near those npcs. The cenarion npcs are mostly around the main town in there with that one mounted patrol closer to AQ, and i think another in north, and the cultists are in their camps - nowhere near the road.
---
Imagin-aaaa-tion
---
Classic is also not 100% blizzlike.
---
Naw, aside from MAYBE dwarf priest (which is still a technicality and not as required as people pretend), even high-end private server guilds outside of the literal best few that speedrun usually don't care that much. My warriors have been an Undead, a Dwarf, and a Human, and I've tanked on all of them without it ever even coming up. Obv stuff like Troll Berserking is a huge help but you can get around it and every other race has at least something going for it. (Nelf high agility, Orc axe spec/stun resist are neat, Tauren HP, Undead WotF, Human sword/mace spec, dwarf stoneform is always clutch and also dwarves are cool, etc)
---
And yeah threat is really rough especially on Horde lol, I noticed a huge difference when I didn't have to deal with Windfury crits anymore and had Blessing of Salvation on all the high-threat DPS. Even then, the little that racials do matter, matter more on the main tank than the other tanks, so yeah I wouldn't sweat it. Obviously you might have an easier time holding threat if you have Berserking but that's sorta just up to you if you want that extra boost for certain scenarios.
---
Troll Warrior is definitely cool though and super rare, plus they look menacing as hell in ZG/AQ/Naxx gear imo.
---
Hi, /u/finalfixation
---
First thing I'm doing is trying to get that name
---
Had the same problem
---
Stress test still goin on
---
I really miss race-specific combat animations, it's just one of many ways the game has lost personality over the years.
---
How? I will be the first!
---
Yeah, I forgot that certain specs can even grief the raid with its debuffs.
---
And the title of this post is entirely misleading, he wasn‚Äôt stress testing
---
These *fools* think they're ready for vanilla?!  They must be tested before we deem them worthy for classic.
---
Thank god I know Python. That will be my job security.
---
100 duels would be an ok starting point. 1000 would be better.
---
I don't usually say this but
---
Never liked this guy, first stream I watched of his and he was saying some border line racist shit...what gives? His face is pretty abrasive too. Good on you if you enjoy his stuff though (idc).
---
Half the reason why people were so bad in vanilla raids. Ain't nobody getting shit done with 6 fps.
---
Congratulations on your working eyeballs. I'll put you in for a special commendation.
---
True, but no one seems that impressed by the way he's defending himself. Seems like it'd have been better for maintaining appearances if he approached it with more humility.
---
Then give yourself an impactful decision. Dont put that on me
---
Aren't you just literally doing what he did
---
Taking advantage of spiritual guidance while taking all the smite/holy fire talents, and weaving those spells between sw:p uptime and mind blast cooldowns.
---
You can hide both helm and cloak yes.
---
Fair enough.  Whether he's actually autistic or pretending, I don't care to voluntarily subject myself to that.  It's difficult enough when I'm being paid to deal with autistic people.
---
There was a time when wowservers was "semi-useful" now I dont look there more than once a week.  It saddens me to watch communities grow and gradually slide over the cliff....
---
but it's not anything unexpected
---
Horde players just got hoggers üòí
---
OMG! You CAN make it there after all!!
---
Only if you also download AIM again
---
&gt;Blizzard are doing it for us.
---
They're doing it because they want money.  That's why the streamers got into the beta first and why they ensured they got into the stress test.  It's why you'll need an active sub to play.  Classic is going to bring back a lot of people who haven't played in a while and they want to promote it as much as they can, so please don't mistake this for Altruism.
---
Saying that, I do agree that people were too invested in getting into the stress test.  It sucks for those of us who didn't, especially because it looks like everyone was having a blast.  The only thing I'm annoyed about is the streamer favouritsm.  It's very clear they aren't just players like us but are promotional agents for Blizzard.  I think people need to be aware that's going to be the case until the launch and potentially some time after as well.
---
Also, this is a thread that is literally complaining about people complaining and I look forward to this sub's devolving circle jerk and the eventual split to a second WoW Classic subreddit much like Battlefront 2.
---
Of all the exploring I did in vanilla I never thought of that area to jump up, I got around 60% of the mountain to get to hyjal from ashenvale and got teleported out, so tried to climb to winter spring lol. Only got around 1/4 of the way up until I fell.
---
Different realm
---
Its not close at all. Dwarf is far better than human. The spirit is hardly relevant.  That will be painfully obvious when any human priest experiences nefarian.
---
Let's hope that's true. Eagerly waiting
---
I fucking love this anyone who donates to a streamer lmao
---
we can only assume they were funneling too many people on a single server to deliberately stress test it.
---
which they succeeded.
---
The beta servers are down until the end of the stress test.
---
I just got my account back after 9 years of not playing and have been playing for the last week (since last Saturday). On the Blizzard launcher there is a dropdown for WoW BFA or WoW Classic Beta/Stress test. Is this an open beta now..? Because I installed it and I logged on and created a character without a key?
---
To level up weapon skills, Int does matter.
---
Ask for int buff from magea if you are leveling a warrior
---
 If they look at you weird, just tell them you have a big Vanilla brain
---
If this had been fixed in era it would have been acceptable and forgotten. The devs probably have better things to do than reproduce every odd quirk reddit can think up.
---
Well you're a ray of sunshine. I'm not talking about builds that nobody discovered ever. I'm talking about builds I may not know about that have been phased out of the retail game, of which I'm sure there are plenty, as it is a 15 year old game like you said.
---
I had that mousepad for a LONG time.
---
 [There are very very very few North American Warriors that can duel on my level](https://clips.twitch.tv/ScrumptiousTriumphantCatDatSheffy)
---
While I completely agree, the main facebook demographic in 2019 (25-35) is the same as WoW's demographic. But its also worth noting that I don't think that (my) demo is big on watching streaming.
---
This should explain it. https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=1547  
---
25:47 - 27:10
---
Yep completely agree -- especially on your Rag part.  I think Rag (and other bosses) were definitely a gear check for tanks (who needed fire res), but the rest of the raid could do okay without it.
---
One of my most memorable moments in WoW was when I was with a raid trying to do their first Rag kill. Most of the raid was wearing some fire resistance gear which was making DPS suffer.  After the 2nd wipe, where Rag had like 20% hp, the raid leader made a ballsy call and told the DPS'ers to shred the fire res and go full damage.  It was beautiful. They downed Rag the next attempt in record time.  Loved it.
---
They also said they weren't going to promise pixel-perfection between the two.
---
August, 27th
---
Wow, that's what WoW does with people
---
Connecting!
---
Because people like to hate on streamers
---
We need a shaman with farsight on the beta server to check what's the idea for progression in that zone :)
---
This is absolutely not true lol everyones playing the lvl 30 beta on twitch as we speak
---
He‚Äôs saying use max rank windfury and lower rank windfury both on one two handed weapon
---
Nobody seems to have understood what you‚Äôre asking, so here‚Äôs your answer:
---
Protection in that this is referring to what most people call Defense. Defense is the stat that makes tanks un-crushable (or was it un-critable?)
---
All level 60 characters can level up to 300 Protection, the same as your weapon skills. You don‚Äôt lose those when you respec. 
---
I think Blizzard might‚Äôve changed the name of this stat from Protection to Defense, or maybe it was just a change in the chat message you see, because I think I remember seeing ‚ÄúYour skill in Defense is now level xx‚Äù but I could be wrong.
---
Let's hope u weren't a dick to people. People (not just you) are in for a rude awakening on release with having your name and actions matter again.
---
You don‚Äôt mind blast in pve, you‚Äôre essentially using 20+ talents to boost swp
---
hahaha it was a good raid!
---
Yeah I reckon, spot on!
---
Large majority of the community has absolutely no patience, they won't appreciate Classic as much as the ones willing to wait it out.
---
I sure as hell won't be rushing to 60/14 hours a day/clear MC in first week. It's a game, enjoy it right?!
---
That is the argument we had when he talks about ppl not approving of certain specs. Ignite in AQ is a massive amount of all mage dmg all wrapped up in one debuff. It cannot be pushed off or you will make the mages lose their minds. Same with Nightfall. Eventually it became obvious it was more about him wanting to raid in a pvp spec than anything about entitlement or principles of the game.
---
Yup.  This is something that I touched on but edited out of my first post.  
---
The drama and infighting would escalate the more and more when the 'wrong' people would get geared lol.  
---
Or, when a diligent raider would literally never see gear ever drop for them -- but stuff would drop only when they didn't attend the raid, of course :)
---
You dont think so? Like I think you deserve one too if you are dedicated to this game and have spent so much money and time on it. I just hate the thought of those filthy casuals getting random beta invites, and just using the beta invite to fuck around and then complain that its too hard.
---
Yeah but you have more people competing for them, ending up with rogues taking daggers for the upgrade until a good weapons comes, its hard to get melee geared on allyside when everyone wants the 1 sword from mc and ony.
---
Worse or better is entirely subjective, you know that right? To me the old character models look infinitely better than the new ones, for example. The new water looks absolutely horrendous compared to vanilla water, despite having modern physics and 1000x more polygons and shaders.
---
Yeah, that's why that route isn't an option. You can still wall jump a bit, but it will never be as good as back then.
---
I got an invite but it runs so late for the European timezones that I won't be able to participate. Really upset but I guess they don't have a European server up?
---
Hey Tips, you should probably just abandon this thread, can't see how it is worth it for you. People here have decided not to care about what you say anyway. I'm not a fan of yours (kinda lost me completely when you reported Verdan as bugged) but the unfairness in this thread is a bit silly. 
---
Also, pretty sure Tribe said "he can't rage it" as in the sap since you don't have zerker rage yet.
---
Fun duels. Looks like he is wand spec which seems pretty dumb for dueling. I think VE would make a big difference vs all the rogue and druid fights. Silence would be nice but probably not worth it considering all the fights just come down to attrition anyway. Not sure what he's doing vs soda. Fear when he's in caster form, mana burn spam and purge hots, i don't think there's anyway a druid wins that.
---
It's funny how useless warrior is, even with a lvl 36 or something blue weapon and full twink gear. PW:S just screws them over so hard with vanilla rage mechanics.
---
Ultimately games are about fun, so if you have to cheat to get through a single player campaign at times that's fine as long as you're enjoying it, but you should give it a shot without cheating for sure. It'll be more rewarding if you give it a chance, and keep in mind WC3 is a lot simpler to pick up than most RTS. It's not like Starcraft and requires a bit of a different skillset.
---
They changed it to true white because in the modern engine they would be pink due to not having a color value configured, so they put it to how it was. Otherwise, in that same presentation comparing the character creation/select screen, they said they wouldn't be promising pixel-perfect recreation, especially as it relates to UI. So to expect them to do much of anything about this barely noticeable difference is also a bit futile.
---
I personally plan on doing what I've done since Vanilla, UI reskinning mods. Just waiting patiently for my Classic ElvUI port. (I use ElvUI on Vanilla private servers also, and have used things like perl/zperl/xperl/etc since Vanilla).
---
Hmmmm. This makes me want reconsider rolling priest
---
Ah your just a troll.
---
No I haven't.  What happened?
---
Look at the sidebar. There's a weekly LFG thread link there.
---
I made a human priest, and couldn't even cast spells or pick up quests the lag was so bad. It would show the animation like 2 minutes after I cast it. I then made a NE rogue and it was relatively lag free. Fighting for mobs was still a pain.
---
Good bot.
---
Idk everyone's situation, but I began on a shitty eMachines laptop, then I got a Dell XPS 400 with an LCD monitor in 2005. My brother had a similar setup and got a wide LCD monitor back in 2009ish when they were still newer. Most people I knew had LCD monitors in the mid-2000s.
---
How do you guys think it will run on a 2014 Mac mini?
---
Oh yeah lol, alot of the AWS stuff is really Python friendly. If you haven't already, take a look at AWS Lambda. Technically it supports a bunch of languages, but it tends to prefer JS or Python as they have a faster cold start time than the compiled languages.
---
I dont think anyone besides maybe tips has ever claimed he is good at this game.
---
Its not as bad as everyone makes out - I'm still having fun :)
---
For Warriors and Rogues, rage pots/thistle tea was a huge asset. 
---
Mages have a huge Mana dependence early on, but it tapers off as gear improves.
---
It was great sucess
---
Lmao I got 4 fps in Ironforge on my eMachines laptop in 2005.
---
These usually stopped scaling once you hit the level for the next rank.
---
Hi, /u/ShieldBae
---
My boy C'thun gets shafted
---
Same. At last I have excuse of being a warrior and having over half those items lol. It fact I still have the oeb and chromatic flight plate on him.
---
Were the pots and tea more of a necessity than an asset to perform equal to other classes?
---
How much does gear need to improve for the mana issues to be gone? I am not going to lie, I hate having to drink after every pull (pve) or mid-way through a duel.
---
The but-hurt is strong in this one
---
I did not know that. Huh.
---
Asmonmold LOL
---
does anyone know if the servers are going to just be waaaaaaaay bigger than they used to be? is that why all the beta?
---
Tin foil hat engaged.
---
Yeah it did. Otherwise how could be play 1.12.1 client on private servers with it? I run 2560x1440 @ 165Hz with the original client just fine.
---
These beta invites should be going to the players who actually have a sort of passion for this game. For a lot of people, vanilla WoW really helped them when it came out. For me it came out when I was 9, and I wasnt popular.  World of Warcraft gave a lot of people, just like me , a place where you werent just some 9 year old loser no one liked. A community that saw you as a warrior, or a mage, or a shaman, and didnt judge you because they didnt know you in real life, so it was easy to make a lot of friends. Thats why I think its important for them to really make sure they invite the right people because the people, who classic meant so much to, would be the ones to work the hardest making sure everything is just right and just how it used to be.
---
Your gonna have bad time going balance tbh
---
Veigar is that you?
---
woosh
---
I would only be mad if at the end of the day, only a small percentage of the people invited could log in during the 2 hour window. I don't know what that percentage is, but I'll say I would be disappointed in the results if the servers couldn't handle 90% of the traffic.
---
It's great if actually implemented properly...  
---
Thing is someone has to set all that stuff up.  
---
You can do some crazy shit with it, but yea if it was implemented poorly then it will be shit.
---
That was actually quite entertaining. Shaman still looks like the most fun class to me - even if you struggle with mana, you can still hit hard with your melee weapon, unlike all the caster classes who just have wands.
---
Lost a lot of interest in live ever since I got beta.  It just feels so pointless.  Any gear I get will just get made obsolete in 8.2 anyway.  And so on.
---
Only reason I log onto live now is to make rep, which makes gold, which helps buy my next token.
---
God I used to love disarming geared out warriors with no stronghold on. The first warrior to get ashkandi on horde would get chain disarmed all bg by men and my 3 other warrior mates. He eventually swapped the crusader enchant for a weapon chain after about 4 games haha. We did the same to the server first thunderfury rogue.
---
I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm 100% on this. It sounds like the layering system will consist of 3 ish layers per server. Roughly with 3-4 k on each layer. After the games initial wave of hype and tourist die down. They will merge the layers as needed.
---
Tribe is up there too, and Perp dueled them both. I'm not a fan of them either, but lets not pretend that the reason this post is a thing is anything other than this sub's hateboner for streamers.
---
http://classicdb.ch/?talent#bEMusoVqo0Et00b
---
This would be more of a dps smite priest spec.
---
Oh for sure.  As a raid leader, the hardest boss will always be the roster boss lol.  Also I feel like in Classic you won't have the people who only log on for 5 or 6 hours a week to raid, cause so much more investment is required to raid, so that could be refreshing.
---
People had them, but they weren't as good for gaming as CRTs until much later on. I gamed on a 21" CRT for almost 10 years in the 2000s. LCDs were still jank with low resolution and lower response times, ghosting and all kinds of issues.
---
I‚Äôll take better looks, more spirit and a rep bonus on my priest thx.
---
That's the status quo these days... There is always something to complain about.
---
Most people literally have nothing else to do or have zero perspective about how these things work. They are children (sometimes literally)
---
I just hope Blizzard understands this, that people are just complaining to complain. That they do not represent the community and will not try to appease their current/future demands.
---
That's how the game ended up the way it is now. 
---
That's why the #nochange movement is a thing.
---
People are afraid that people that have no idea what they are talking about will gain favor when it comes to the big decisions. It is easier just to let blizzard do the do and not try to appeal to everyone. 
---
Stick to your guns Blizzard you are doing okay so far.
---
&gt; OP would rather have mile long server queues for a month, followed by 2 months of ridiculous resource guarding, followed by 2 weeks of actual decent gameplay, followed by dead servers, followed by server merges, transfers, and every ballache that goes along with them.
---
&gt; ‚Äã
---
&gt; I'll take the layering for a few weeks, thanks.
---
I mean if you are expecting an already solved MMO relaunch not to be toxic AF and doomed, you're gonna have a bad time
---
People notice when one youtube video has different models than the other. They will notice when people discuss it in chat, "which models you using bro?"
---
English probably isn't their first language so they may not be proficient in it. Kind of the same relationship that you have with manners.
---
That‚Äôs fair  I bet either way nothing will happen for 2-3 years.
---
go play retail u fucking casual
---
Troll Hunter 4 life
---
I can see I probably shouldve started that comment with something other than "I DESERVE THIS!!!" lol but I was more trying to say that everyone like me who was there deserve an invite. Definitely not just me, because out of all the players who played vanilla, im definitely not any more special than they are. I'm just hoping theyre the ones getting the majority of the invites
---
I hate Gnome in general so, this just makes them easier to click on in BGs.
---
Lol, not trying to be toxic. I love Survivor and there have been some awesome seasons lately. The most recent one just wasn't great, imo. Not sure what else to say.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt change the relative heights in the same image though.
---
I don't see how people can't find the client. There's this little site known as thepiratebay that has had it up for years and years
---
my biggest problems is that the mates I want to play with aren't there :(
---
According to Joana (i'm not in the beta) shot weaving looks fine.
---
Problems are pet delay like you said, pet pathing, pet walk speed in some occasions, auto shot not going off fast enough if you start a pull with DoT Shot. 
---
Thats all i can remember.
---
True enough, enjoying it so far.
---
Legion launch was perfect.  Pretty much zero problems.  BFA was pretty good too.
---
The reason for a beta was the fact that the server code was re written to be usable on 2019 infrastructure.  There is a lot of bugs.
---
I'm not wand spec. https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#bx0oZbZVMGz
---
This is the spec I'm running right now.
---
Respects cost a lot of money on beta so it's tough to try out new stuff.
---
When i first did the wetlands run in 2004 on my level 13 Hunter, I made this mistake. Made me so sad to be telied back to darkshore.
---
Big if true.
---
Big gettit? Big Gnomes. Jesting. Ok,  I'll stop now.
---
I think it's fair to say that the people have indeed been stressed successfully.  No further testing required.
---
Here ya go.
---
[Mobile Wallpaper](https://imgur.com/Nlvw8Fd)
---
why is that a bad thing?
---
I thought the realm was only open for 2 hours for stress testing, so I login and get SUPER hyped thinking I got into the beta, but nope. Just the stress test. Pepehands
---
Was Bitola a random name or...?
---
It's a fact that the last couple generations have fucked up the world, and that they currently hold all of the power and are mostly refusing to do anything about it. That doesn't mean *all* of them are that way of course, but it is a significant number of them. None of that can be said about millennials because we hold almost none of the power or money in the world. In fact, millennials are the poorest generation since ww2 despite working as much or more.
---
So no, it's not the same.
---
what does pog mean ?
---
Even better yet!
---
It's okay, I found it funny!
---
And when we're older, we'll do stuff our kids and grand kids won't like and they'll say the same shit about us. Just stop
---
Do you also get black screens for the cinematics? I reinstalled it couple weeks ago and I couldn't watch any of them. Game still played fine though
---
Jessus Finally return to purify Goldshire
---
Polymorphed too!
---
I guess we can all be entitled to our own opinion..
---
that was my thought at first, too. but an unused account wouldnt have subscribed for classic beta interest last week.
---
It would have been nice to play around a bit and helping to test the game, but in the end blizzard owns me nothing and I think now I am glad that I can start the release with the main dish instead with an appertizer ;-)
---
That's the point! For some people the changes *don't* increase the visual quality.
---
Personally I want large ground clutter visibility distance but *don't* want increased ground clutter density. It looks worse.

There was a time in which I played private servers and didn't even know of this sub. Then unfortunately I discovered it. It was ofc useful, but boy it was really one of the worst community I ever swam throguh
---
Well, yeah. Any subreddit that jumps up in subs by an order of magnitude is going to end up a worse place for it.
---
If you are paired with 3000 out of 3000 there is no layering. No matter how long of a reply you leave that won‚Äôt change and thus the play experience *will* be less crowded than without.
---
That glorious day, May 22nd 2019, Omar ascended to Godhood. Praise be!
---
Made a gnome Warlock last night after the dust settled and the server came back up. Took me roughly 58 minutes to hit level 5. Took about 30 minutes to complete the first quest, which was killing the wolfs for their meat.
---
Reguardless of that, I've been on the side of the fence of making this launch as smooth as possible. I've been here for every launch this game has had to offer other than the launch of vanilla.
---
Fun fact, it's pretty easy to make a corpse's heart beat.  I've done it several times.
---
[Haha yeah I agree OP.](https://i.imgur.com/dTcAHZc.jpg)
---
Damn, that's disappointing. Would shocks be the only way for an enhance shammy to proc this then? Could weapon procs that shoot spells count?
---
McConnell? Is that you??
---
i'll tell a very short story that can be a lot longer, but i was a vanilla-wotlk raider. in vanilla i played a priest. i had every t2 piece except chesat because it never dropped. there was a full t2 mage in our guild who had to sell his account bc he ran into financial issues. this mage was able to get back to 60 and got full t2 before i ever got the chest. (i never got the chest until i did a transmog run many years later)
---
So salty, you just discover twitch.tv?
---
What did it say?
---
I vaguely remember gnomes's height was boosted, because they literally swam through little puddles while all of the other races could just walk through them.
---
Again, if your "without" is relevant considering they *could* put 10's of thousands of people on one server. 
---
No matter how snarky of a reply you leave that wont change the fact that each Layer has just as many if not more people than a Vanilla server had, and is therefore pointless when it comes to talking about crowded starting zones.
---

mobs aggro as soon as u cross the border of a zone and have them targeted
---
I've caught myself getting into a bad mindset about the game being released later than sooner because of all the hype and excitement. There's something about the whole community that creeps in and poisons my patience. It feels like because the game is old that it should be ready.
---
So, I try to stay away from the streams and I've been feeling better. Just let them test the game and be patient. It'll get here when it gets here. Maybe people have been spending too much time watching videos and listening to podcasts about it it's hard to think about anything else.
---
I've just gotta enjoy other things in the meantime. Seeing a streamer have so much fun is only going to make me feel left out.
---
Payo (Rogue) also beat Tips w/ WW Axe while being under leveled and under geared.

I'm not sure where this idea comes from that he's a good player. I've never see anyone say it besides himself.

Aw, okay, so i wasn't whoished. Self-doubt is real.
---
Why are you getting buthurt over people getting buthurt?
---
Did vael still despawn in an hour in 1.12? Thats actually interesting if they will implement that back in or not.
---
Yes ! The new wall jumping from and TBC to BFA is actually in Classic, but not the old
---
Did your mom overcook your chicken tenders or something?
---
Unplayable. Please fix!
---
For live content? No.
---
Probably. 
---
Maybe
---
Highly unlikely.
---
So long as this stuff gets reported early its likely to be fixed I'd hope.
---
Not sure I always respec at 40 to elemental since it‚Äôs more controlled ur damage and elenmastery rolls people in wpvp like nothing else. Grab some dream weave pieces and you‚Äôre set. Make sure to make at least one mage friend.
---
I totally forgot about that
---
But the bluepost also said they were pulling people from the warcraft-beta opt-in pool aswell. :o
---
And atleast i have been opted for that for a long while... if warcraft reforged ever ends up having a beta. or WC4. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

Ah I see, explains the ks resist and getting heals off so easily vs the rogues. Did you try VE or silence and found it not as good?

Also check out the classic wow discord. There are a LOT of guild recruiting there
---
Counterpoint: BWL was easy. My guild in vanilla netted a realm-first Nefarian kill 3 weeks after starting progression.
---
And the other 45% are in Durotar
---
And I hope you don‚Äôt expect to raid with this.
---
You need about 1000 points of data at  least.  You have 7 x 3.

---
I disagree. Once they get classic rolling the way they want I would expect them to start working right away once they see how many people are logging in.
---
Wow is down to a few million subs and still dropping like a rock. BfA was a complete shitshow. By the time Classic launches it will be a very signifigant portion of WoW numbers.
---
Just be patient. Many of the people in here will only be interested in Classic/Vanilla until a few weeks after launch, then they and the streamers will wander off to other games and the game and this sub will be much better off.
---
To be fair you very likely would have had more fun watching streams than trying to get on.  Some got on but many did not.
---
Too real
---
1.12 patch notes only have like 3 dungeons and 1 raid getting nerfed.
---
And disastrous results were indeed the desired outcome from the test.
---
What else can one expect from Belligerent Benny?
---
Salt
---
Gnome mages can't equip daggers cause you can't reach level 10 to mearn the skill.
---
Incorrect info. When you level up you now get a message saying your skill in &lt;talent spec&gt; increased by 5. This is a bug that Blizzard has acknowledged existed in 1.12.1 that they have replicated in classic.
---
it's never going to be gone.
---
Wasn't the stress test located on a single server? If so, you'll have a lot more people at launch, but spread across a lot more servers, each with their own set of layers. Unless they had 20+ layers during the stress test instead of the presumed 4-5 for a normal server, I would think that everything should be fine. The stress test was designed to see how the servers worked with a ridiculous amount of players - there shouldn't be any reason to expect there to be that many people on each server at release, so the inability to join your server shouldn't be a factor in the real thing. In fact, I'd say it's pretty cool how many people could fit into a single zone without the server crashing or completely lagging to death. I remember giant lag spikes when there were world pvp raids back in vanilla, and having about 1 frame per second. As another comment said, this isn't supposed to reflect how the real steady-state release will be.
---
Do you think the chat won't be cross-layer? I think it will, because otherwise people will use 3rd party stuff to find groups quicker.
---
Buncha folks on as Horde, particularly in the durotar area.  Friend was on as a tauren and ran the barrens at lvl 5 to come meet me over in the valley of trials.
---
Why? idk tell me
---
I remember finally stepping through in mid TBC (I started wow a few months after TBC launched) on my first character and was completely blown away by the slideshow on the other side!
---
That was way before rogue needs and war buffs.  World of Roguecraft was not relevant in 1.12.  
---
Honestly no Orc warrior has any business losing to any rogue in 1.12.
---
I‚Äôm playing on Ryzen 2600x and RX590. Everything was buttery smooth @ 8 on the slider with no choppiness or frame rate issues during the stress test. You should be fine.

Really hope this is true, very surprised my F&amp;F hasn't helped.
---
Oh man, I forgot about the old school skill bars.
---
I enjoyed playing overpopulated private servers. You have to be creative to level well, or you can just chill for a few hours, socialize, make memes about the lack of boars...
---
Bro if you're being serious right now LOL
---
I see what you mean.... The later expansions just have more fleshed out versions of very similar specs. So there probably isn't much there you won't understand.
---
Almost all the depth comes from your out of class items. I have 100 binds on my p server pally cuz there is just so much effective crap you can have.
---
You will find it very easy to theory craft what is best for most classes once you see the numbers if you enjoy that kinda thing. 
---
What the talent tree wont' tell you is how to use your engineering items and buffs in teh optimum manner for max DPS. That's really where the difference is. Much more about things outside your kit in just about any context. PvE and PvP
---
Lul they got all the data they could have ever wanted, the salt is so real. Its like half this sub just discovered twitch...
---
Clearly you aren't going for the full experience.
---
I am going back to gradeschool to get that real feel of coming home after learning nothing to play all night and into the weekend.
---
Just wait. Go in blind, you can only do that once.
---
Counterpoint: BWL was easy. My guild in vanilla netted a realm-first Nefarian kill 3 weeks after starting progression. Hardest boss for us (other than Nefarian himself) was Razorgore, due to the "totem highway" strat we were using and how complicated it was to get right. Chromaggus was 1 night of progression on our last night of week 2. Reset came, we re-cleared to Chromaggus and 1shot it for the first kill. Spent the next few days working on Nefarian.
---
Female for better animations :)
---
You're surprised? Really? These are the same people wondering why they can't get into the main beta because they got in the stress test or any other number of clearly stated well addressed topic ls regarding Classic. 
---
Surprised? No.
---
Dissapointed and annoyed? Yes.
---
Im not anti-new graphics but I find the old, blocky, low-res graphics endearing and nostalgic. Plus I don't have the best computer and have a tendency to turn down my settings across most games so things run smoother.
---
Is it new? I just know BattleChess 3D..
---
I was thinking of posting this exact same thing. I dropped in about a week ago, and by day 3 the toxic people of the community had pretty much driven me off. I'm good to just wait for the game without all of the elitist dicks.
---
I think he's talking about dungeon items that are changed with 1.12. I heard some were even better than raid epics but not sure since I didn't play back then.
---
There was also the guy on the official forums complaining that he took the day off from his trucking job to play and wasn't able to so he basically lost $2000 for nothing. If you're taking a day off and costing yourself $2000 for a stress test, you need to take a step back and reevaluate some things.
---
I like this guy. He seems nice
---
As a caster I hope they fix the floating damage text, the way it used to pop up and stack in OG vanilla was legit. Minor difference but to me its actually quite a big deal. Damage text feels a little floppy now
---
He said it would be up on Amazon in May and we are pretty close to the end of said month. I'll pick one up if Amazon makes it available or if a PDF/Kindle version comes out.
---
Depending on how hardcore you are. Cutting edge guilds and r13-14 will be stocked up on them. Along with free action potions, engineering grenades, and a plethora of trinkets for pvp. 
---
For mages, you have to get used to constantly needing Mana. In raids if you aren't fighting, you should be drinking. As gear scales you become less dependent, but it's pretty much perpetually drinking.

I don't know why people keep saying this when it'd be a client-side option that would in no way impact others or detract or add challenges.
---
Did you include the threat generated for being the first player targeted by the monster?  There is threat generated whenever a person body pulls.
---
It's sad seeing this post not getting the traction it deserves. Thank god you already reported all of these yourself! Thanks man! Keep up the great testing!
---
Yeah I had to get a pserver on the go. It'll all be obsolete Aug 27th but so will the beta so w/e.
---
Elaborate? I've heard this before but never heard the reasoning
---
You'd have to put all of your talents into Shadow at 30 in order to make that happen. It would be more realistic to test at a higher level which they can't do right now.
---
#reeeeeeeee

1-59 enhance shaman is awesome fun. At lvl 60 (enhance at least) becomes less fun, you just constantly get kited as everone's tools and stam goes up. Don't expect to win many duels as enhance after 60.   
---
There are annoying things about shaman you can see just in the clip too. You have to chose between slowing your target and interrupting them, so a good player can exploit that. Totems are pretty weak, he's not even using a macro here but still finding it easy to kill them with a wand swing.
---
You're uninronically dumb if you complain about streamer prio. Amongst all 20 of them how much of a greater chance you think youd have of getting that beta? 
---
Atleast now people can watch the streamers and atleast live vicariously through them. See what classic is all about and their impressions which were 99% positive generating even more attraction to the game we all love.
---
Have you ever been to /r/wowservers?

We were 80 people, but the raid I was in got put in a different layer when we entered Durotar :-(

POG
---
Yeah Vael was a dick and he was a first reality check to me as a rogue because after so many unsuccessful tries I was shown how low I was on Damage Meters. That's where I really started to understand rotations and my class in raids as a whole
---
LOL, the private servers are "Vanilla as it is" now, are they?
---
There's a difference between "doing stuff our kids and grand kids won't like" and literally destroying the planet and refusing to do anything about it. Some people like to chalk it up to "every generation thinks the ones before and after it are terrible" but this isn't like this.
---
Millennials are starting their lives with more student loan debt than any previous generation, own half as much property as gen x and baby boomers did at the same ages, and are paid 20% less than gen x and 30% less than baby boomers were at the same ages. This goes well beyond the "this is always how it is" rhetoric because this *isn't* how it always is.
---
You know all of those articles saying shit like "Millennials are killing the napkin industry"? Literally everyone one of those is bullshit because Millennials are worse off than Gen X, baby boomers, the silent generation, and the greatest generation were at the same ages.
---
So again, no, this isn't just the same old shit. This is something that hasn't happened in at least a hundred years, likely significantly more.
---
Yup I'm that Redmancometh sadly hurricane Harvey hit Houston and I was fired by Serayne during.
---
To his point about enjoyment Vs inconvenience...
---
If you enjoyed it back in the day I'd bet you'll love it again. I got back into final fantasy 11 on Nasomi and every time I play is awesome.
---
Same. Been playing SWTOR recently, but I cant go 20mins without alt tabbing and reading classic WoW related news üò•
---
Don't forget that it's also about getting to know how things will break. This requires them to break in the first place. Which, I noticed by getting kicked out of the queue for one hour, they did.
---
I'll do it but you have to roll horde and you have to become my wow boyfriend

Who pulled the surger with the core hound??!
---
Old Hyjal with that skeleton was so cool to think about. Coming fresh off WC3 to hear about this. Ooof
---
Yep. Can confirm. Work in a large building but we have multiple colos inside. The gas would kill me.
---
Hmm I didn't see anything like that in the patch notes.
---
ah okay, I did not know that. then it makes sense :-)
---
But please stop talking about a hypothetical wc4 and making me any hope. :-D
---
Considering you can put talent points into all three trees, how does it know what your talent spec is?
---
I have no intention on playing classic since I played vanilla and have no desire to replay it.
---
I do enjoy watching some of the old content from streamers as it brings back memories.
---
Layering is completely different than sharding. You will never phase in the open world.
---
/r/warframe and /r/MonsterHunterWorld would disagree with you. Some of the nicest, most patient, and passionate communities.
---
What's the location? Tanaris in a severe dust storm?
---
the Troll Racial causes AOE healer threat
---
Are you referring to your second paragraph as the source? Wow, there buddy. In that case I refer to my first paragraph.
---
Even 300 people on 3000 would make it 10% more crowded. Besides I bet they will have higher pops than original.
---
Stick to the established builds for pve. There‚Äôs a reason theyre used and reused time and time again.
---
Hoe's mad
---
good find!
---
Maybe this is one of the features that they will allow since moving your own items in the bag isn't game breaking.  Kind of like waiting 2 minutes to open a mail box when it is prime time would be the authentic experience, but to recreate that interaction it would only be affecting the single player portion of inventory management of the game.
---
Read ur name as gurubashi tape worm, enough Internet for today
---
I dunno man, I mean obviously they got beta and stress test. It‚Äôd just be bad business if they didn‚Äôt. 
---
I‚Äôm an average guy without a social media presence...I got in day one of beta, I was able to log in to and play stress test as the streamers were. I was like 40feet ahead of asmon during the race.
---
I‚Äôve heard some suggest it was a blind pool thing, some accts were flagged to get all the way in and others to systematically fail at other login points. Who knows. Maybe people in Texas just have a priority Internet. 
---
The hatred is unjustified. The beta isn‚Äôt about you, it‚Äôs about generating hype and testing the game. Streamers certainly fill the first, and by virtue of the eyes of their streams have already generated one blue post‚Äîso they do the second too. There are hundreds online, maybe even more than a thousand on beta at any given point. The game is being tested, so rest assured there. 
---
You will have from 8/27/19 until blizzard no longer exists as a company to play classic wow. It‚Äôs gonna be okay.
---
I expect it is random.
---
Gen X thinks millennials are annoying, boomers think millennials are annoying, Gen Z thinks millennials are annoying... There's a common denominator here... 
---
You do exactly as you are in this post, generalize groups and make everything about yourself and how superior you are even though you have "so many disadvantages". Having to pay more money for school? Oh no, the horror. Bet you' rather be forced to go fight in Vietnam instead.
---
It might be item tweaks from previous patches.
---
Warrior-shammy is such an op combo
---
Guild leading is absolutely soul crushing and exhausting.  If you‚Äôre up for all the extra work, then it can be very rewarding and obviously beneficial.  But I can‚Äôt stress the amount of work it takes to lead a success raiding guild long term in vanilla WoW.
---
Mage mage aoe grind is crazy fast, but you have to avoid certain frost talents that might feel counter intuitive (dont finish but take blizzard slow, no frostbite etc.)
---
Only problem with that is honestly by grinding instead of questing it takes so much away from experiencing the world. Questing, exploring etc is more interesting than blizzarding 400 gnolls in wetlands.
---
My suggestion is a single target frost mage crit build with a ret paladin. Ton of speed, wont need much in way of healing but its present if needed, gank proof, free mana/water and teleports, frost kiting will let paladins just do whatever they need or want to do without aggro problems, no competition on drops, easily can /train out of caves and respawns.
---
Thats the best in my opinion.
---
Perplexity is good but calling him the best 1v1 in the world is ridiculous. Stop making claims based on one persons skill and comparing to the rest of the players. Have you duelled all rogues in the world? No, so you will never know.
---
Tbh a lot of the stuff in the start ed. won‚Äôt  be applicable the game is so much different now. You could totally do the starter thing just to get a feel for it, but just remember that most of the skills, quests, and locations will be almost completely different in classic.
---
IIRC you get points automatically for all 3 specs.  I was showing 25/25 in Holy, Disc and Shadow.
---
That's not cross realm, that's just layering. They're still all on the same server.
---
Basically the coolest guy at Blizzard
---
Physical maturity != adulthood
---
Do you have any sort of rationale for saying so?  Or was that just as poor of an attempt at being clever as I think it was?
---
Dude has very little classic wow experience. Watching all the shamans think 2hnded spec is better for level 30 duel tourneys over NS, sword and board was painful for me to watch. That being said I have tons of classic experience and they have almost none.
---
wait what
---
Damn I don't give a fuck about Tips but that's just sad mate. Leave the hate behind.
---
The disrespect
---
When you resist 3/4 stuns and have the WW axe (generally not expected till lvl40) and a bunch of other BIS gear vs an undergeared rogue, the match is in your favour lad. This is just a poor showing, nothing more nothing less.
---
Swords are #1 until raids. Unless you get mega lucky and get dual Felstrikers (which is basically one in a million).
---
Is he going to play classic? I figured he'd be too busy grinding out current raids.
---
The message mentions all 3 specs, no matter what spec you are. For example as a priest, it would tell you your skill in holy, discipline and shadow all increased.
---
1h timer was removed in 1.8
---
Did the Draenei or Eredar had any appearance before TBC?
---
Being your wow boyfriend I could live with. Being horde however....Not a chance!
---
I'm currently doing the Undead campaign in TFT and it is HARD. I might give up lol.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a good point. I went MM/SV build, so didn‚Äôt have it either back in vanilla.
---
Thanks, man! I‚Äôm doing my best, haha. I hope you subscribe and I see you in a stream! Still no beta yet, though ): so I mostly just stream BFA for now and chat. 
---
But best believe come Aug 27 I‚Äôm no-lifing Classic and streaming it all.
---
Omar lead dev when
---
Yes because misogyny is the same thing as disliking people that are famous for being internet douchebags. /s
---
No, they won't. Or else you'll end up with scenarios like Pservers where they had to make Black Lotus and Thorium more readily available. The limit on top tier resources is a main part of a Vanilla Server. World Bosses as well. Putting more than 3-4k max pop after layering would break the game.
---
The current version of WoW is very very different from Classic.  I would wait for Classic to launch.
---
I‚Äôm so sad. I wanted to read all his rants
---
All I‚Äôve learned from this map is that the horde suck.
---
TIPS BAD, PERPELEXITY GOOD
---
Douche
---
It's fine and can make a lot of quests easier/faster. The only major drawback is quests that drop items - those only drop one per mob, so you have to kill more mobs so every group members gets their drop. But you can kill faster - either by killing the same mob or each your own mob - so it doesn't really matter. And it's fun.
---
...so turn on the old models
---
People that use the word toxic are just authoritarian jerks.
---
Wait what? You can die in Elwyn and respawn in Tirisfal?
---
Not quite, I‚Äôm just pointing out the toxic behavior and entitlement is the same
---
tldr: they make money because they can.
---
I agree with your assessment
---
if u really care about 1-10 u can go to r/wowservers and try out a private server to test things
---
I totally agree with you. Funny you mentioned Texas, I'm in it QQ
---
I wish I was in there beta testing with everyone else, but I'm no one special, just another old classic player out of thousands that wants to play. You won't see me trashing anyone unnecessarily. I played the game during my teen years, and I remember how much of a shithead I could be at times. Not this time! New WoW, new slate.
---
It's scary but also similar to how some people treat(ed) celebrities. 
---
If you think about it, it's just as weird to want to touch Elvis or have someones autograph even though it doesn't do anything.  
---
That being said, I still find it weird that people bend over that hard for streamers and youtubers. Even my own sister went to some event because she could meet one of the popular beauty YTers there. (tbf shes pretty young)
---
I swear this society is getting weirder and weirder.
---
I'm super excited for classic. Was excited to help out, even if it was a level 5 beta test. Also happy to stress test logging in or creating characters during the scheduled time, even though I didn't get to experience gameplay.
---
I'm just a little bummed I didn't get a chance to connect to the world after the scheduled test was over. The comms from blizzard made it sound like it would be available after the scheduled time frame.
---
Is that unreasonable or an opinion that deserves to be flamed?
---
You fool, you opened Pandora‚Äôs Box!!! 
---
Brace yourselves
---
Man, turns out Blizzard REALLY hates Night Elves.
---
google PogChamp, it's a twitch emote, Pog is a custom BTTV emote based off of PogChamp, which is basically a zoomed in version of just the mouth.
---
It would be better to play a private server. Some offer insta 60s so you can see what class you like without grinding 240 hours
---
Fucking hell youre good perp
---
spelled\*
---
This has been me for the last week. For the first time in many years I'm actually \*more excited\* about going BACK to university than slacking off this summer.
---
Yeah, but will they reimplement it despite the game running on 1.12?
---
Streamers made him do it.
---
There's one big counterpoint to all of this, which mostly makes it another 'easy' raid, albeit a bit harder than the raids before it.
---
Patch 1.12. At this point, itemization is way better. Talents are way better. Which leads to people performing much better.
---
Advicefriend nymnWeird
---
The private server client is built on a different architecture.
---
Armor is huge in vanilla.
---
Mimimi I'm bad player and others can see it l. üò≠
---
Didnt mean to come off as condescending, but I think your really overestimating how easy it is. It's  not as easy as just "roll the game back". They did a video on how they had to do it, and how they had to try to fit the old graphics and the old data into their current infrastructure and nothing fit 1 to 1. They barely got it to work with a bunch of bugs. They're now in the process of finding and fixing all those bugs, but the list is huge (remember how messed up energy regen was in the demo?) They've actually made huge strides towards getting this game back to how it played. It can seem easy to say "why didnt they fix this? It's so obvious" but from their perspective they're fixing so many things it's easy for no one to stop and think "oh shit yea we scaled player models awhile back we need to fix this". That's what the beta and stress tests are for, us to point these things out for them.
---
Also, those private servers were not running with anything close to what an actual vanilla server had in terms of scripting and data. It was all guess work, just like Blizzard is doing except Blizzard is on a bigger stage with more scrutiny and people expect them to fix every single issue (as they should). When you have some members of the original team who built WoW the first time on the Classic team working for months to get Classic working, I dont really think you can say that it's a small, easy thing to get right.
---
There's literally no point paying for WoW's beta as a vanilla veteran that retired in Cata. I'm currently playing for free in a private server to warm up my early game knowledge and mechanics so I'm more efficient on launch.  I'll be ponying up in August when the real thing is here as Koassst wishes.
---
In 1.12.1, yes. It was soloable at level 30. Especially as a twink.
---
Looks like Dun Morogh.
---
It isn't tho. I don't have a horse in this race since I'm not subbed to WoW currently but this post is some of the most ironic shit I've seen all week
---
Yeah lvl 6 would be the best cap for stress test, that's where the real duelling starts
---
Hes a pretty powered out 30. Most people wont have a whirlwind axe at 30 nor the gear collected cause we'd keep leveling past that point. 
---
I dont think its unlikely at all.
---
During evasion? no warriors love when rogues use evasion, they just delete them with overpower....
---
Level 30 without BIS gear was probably much more difficult.  Don't forget the testers have had days to get the best possible gear available at level 30
---
Nice work!  
---
If people had the gear, Vael was definitely not too difficult of an encounter.  
---
I think for a lot of guilds they would get stuck on Rag and gear up over the weeks and then be properly geared for Vael and it would be cake.  Also, a lot of the earliest guilds who attempted BWL didn't have the gear available from ZG or AQ20 (which were released later), so the main source of gear was MC.  
---
I once joined a guild that went from Ragnaros to Chromag in one night.  They downed Rag for the first time and with their momentum just blitzed through BWL.  This was pretty late Vanilla.  I mean once you got through Vael it was a cake walk to Chromag. LOL Maybe you were in that guild and we raided together? :)
---
It was very entertaining
---
I haven't got to yet :( The respect costs are just too much man. Really hoping that they reduce respec costs for beta so we can actually test different builds and spell interactions.
---
I'm so happy I can still go to Hyjal in WoW Classic
---
You realize that the private server client and the classic client use two different engines, right?
---
Classic is based on the Legion client, which features the new lighting system. I wish we could stop comparing things to private servers.
---
Swiper no swiping
---
If you've already said you are going to go on more date nights, forget it. You have to play WoW full time to lead a raid guild. You'll be expected to have max tradeskills, help farm consumables on off nights, help others get gear, and keep everyone in line.
---
wait, tokens are a million gold now? Holy shit!
---
I got the second Ashjre‚Äôthul on my server Alliance side back in the day.  Was kind of fun to have people come up and ask me questions about it.  Lasted for about a month and then the other guilds started to get lucky and have them drop.
---
I‚Äôm referring to the kind of comments literally calling for the streamers to be *killed*, the people posting wall of text rants about how they didn‚Äôt get into the beta and a streamer did, etc.
---
Are you able to do one that show cases some of the awesome environments and vistas in game?
---
anyone know the name of those addons?
---
No they haven't
---
Sticking your head in the sand and denying facts won't make any of the problems I listed go away.
---
&gt;Having to pay more money for school? Oh no, the horror. Bet you' rather be forced to go fight in Vietnam instead.
---
What a fucking strawman. That has literally nothing to do with what I said, not to mention that our country has been at war for literally the entirety of millennials' lives. People I was in gradeschool with when 9/11 happened fought and died in Iraq and Afghanistan over a decade later.
---
Issue considering Chat functions.  
---
Chat works as it does in BfA, at least in this regard. If I recall correctly, in Vanilla pressing Enter did not open up Whispers (chat). In BfA and Beta (stress test) if you have opened up Whisper for someone, it opens the Whisper again after pressing enter. In Vanilla it used to open Say, Party, Guild chats etc., what ever of these channels was used before. Only way to quickly answer whispers was pressing "R" or the equivelant keybind to "r"eply to Whispers.  
---
I doubt that Blizzard sees this as a bug as they have many other social / chat functions working like in BfA. This is the only function that annoys me though, because I would just like to answer whispers quickly with the reply button and then continue my other chats in Party or Guild chat, or so on.   
---
Anyone else feeling the same way? If this can be fixed with a simple addon I won't be minding it.
---
I‚Äôm just here patiently waiting for live. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
The bows sound like grandma's creaky rocking chair lol.  But i love it.
---
Classic misconception. Many people won't give a shit that you ninjad from random dudes they don't know. Sad but true.
---
The petition was for what, can you even recall? Enlighten us how the petition is not shitting on everyone involved.
---
And phasing is different from sharding too. You can still switch to another layer if you join a group or the layer gets too populated though.
---
Based on some of the bugs people have found, it's pretty obvious that layering is *literally* sharding with some tweaks to cut down on how often you change shard, but it's certainly not a new system.
---
He was there when the deep magic was written.
---
Great read, having only raided 25 mans in tbc and wrath I am lookingforward to hopping into the 40 man environment!
---
You can get a great explanation of sharding vs layering vs phasing in episode 105 of the countdown to classic podcast. If you‚Äôre confused, it‚Äôs worth a listen.
---
Way to completely miss the point of my post.
---
It's going to be a shit show, as it should be lol
---
Just wait until people realize that what made Vanilla Vanilla was the community of that generation and what was in popular culture.  When it becomes obvious how Classic is nothing like Vanilla, because the culture is no longer what it was in Vanilla, they will really lose their shit.
---
I think if you were able to find a crew of 50 (lol?) like minded people this could work out. I'm probably looking for a super casual guild that is willing to accept my all over the place schedule. 
---
I bet this time around I bet more people roll healers/tanks knowing the utility in raids. I leveled an undead mage in vanilla and switched to Pally once that was available for horde and never looked back (until i quit). This time around id roll a pally prioritizing my raid utility. I found healing more fun than DPS anyways. Also remember that 40 people was the max raid capacity but in some cases not all 40 were necessary.
---
Gnomes can't be priests!
---
BIS gear at 30 yes
---
My suggestion is actually that you play it alone first to fully enjoy the expirience cause beggining with friends that already know all the tricks and shortcuts it may restrain you to enjoy it at it most. Or at least have a character to level it alone when you are not whit your party.
---
[Hey!](https://giphy.com/gifs/tnYri4n2Frnig)
---
The very end of WC3: TFT is literally them founding and settling Durotar. They've had, at most, a few years to establish themselves.
---
He had all the add-ons in classic even before patch 1.12. that was the original classic game so that's not a change. 
---
Sharding is no longer a thing in classic. 
---
A lot of people who will be playing classic don't play retail at the moment.
---
You can still do all the quests and the story even if there's no one else in the zone for other expansions currently in retail
---
Yeah, Pendulum is level 39 though. It's a twink item.
---
You can decimate people with one swing if windfury procs with that weapon. Even 60's. @ lvl 39.
---
When they ended the original closed beta in 2004 it felt like a real cataclysm level event.
---
I'm glad they are back to those ideas and roots.
---
I was able to get though the starter zone with all of the people there in less than an hour, we don't need dynamic respawns.
---
The stress test has layering, and a lot of people aren't in. So release day will be 100 times worse
---
No it was never that easy in vanilla. Everybody is taking very little damage not just Asmongold. Whats the point of taking healers to the dungeons then.
---
We have a choice to go to Iraq if we want and stay home if we don't.  That's a privilege we have that older generations didn't. Why are your/our criticisms for them legit but their criticisms for us are all bullshit according to you?
---
Perplexity, aka the rogue god
---
I dunno man ill remember that guy when i see him again
---
it is because most of the people over at /r/wowservers migrated here after classic was announced, and that is quite possibly the most cancerous and toxic sub i have ever laid eyes on (years 2014-2017). Like just pure vitriol and hatred thrown around at everyone and anything. I am nearly certain this is the case.

Russians just hit hard (see Rocky IV)
---
How did you get the game? All I see is the reforged version which comes out at the end of the year.
---
All the good plate hats have that model. Herod's whatever, Lionheart Hat, Hat of Endless Rage...
---
Did it actually happen?
---
Im guessing its due to using the Legion engine. Might not happen unfortunately. Even though we would all like it.
---
You will, but others who haven't met him before likely won't care.
---
I have the beta and haven‚Äôt had a single issue with the server and there are people in every single zone I‚Äôve gone to.  Feels exactly like classic to me so far.  Only thing I wish is I could invite at least one friend or something but since there are plenty of people I‚Äôve made friends along the way.

I got super baked before walking into Ironforge this time around and I literally walked around the whole place reading all the stuff in the explorers league and shit. That city is straight fire.

Yes, the flippening is real.
---
We've been above r/wow every time I looked today, although it's pretty close now (7.4k vs 7.6k).
---
And then the whole WoW Classic server infrastructure will rip at the seams, and nobody will get to play it anymore as everyone instantly gets logged into BFA and is forced to grind levels for their Hearts of Azeroth.

They deserve all the accolades they can get and this petition is not a comment on their contributions to the show."
---
So little Druid batteries üò©
---
As long as the guild is built around a community with the same time commitment/expectations as you i think you could do it. I've seen private server guilds that are progressing BWL 1-2 months after AQ40 and have been functional until the server. Those guilds often ended up being some of the larger guilds on the server because the player base was just there to have a good time and didn't care about the "hardcore" aspects of end game. So if you're comfortable with that play style i'd say go for it. If not, I'd just try and get you and all your buddies into the same guild early in a server. Build a report in the guild, raid when you can, PUG raids when you can't.
---
Yoink mine now
---
What is this? Logic and reasoning on Reddit? Sir you know this isn't allowed here.
---
Agreed. 
---
For a young player like myself back in the day, clearing MC and ZG was no problem and you got through at the end of the day.
---
But when my guild started doing BWL...yeah we only got past razorgore once or twice when we all had full T1's. That's how much we sucked i guess.
---
Then later I joined a top guild on the server, shortly after AQ40 was released and they basically carried me through BWL and it was a mind blowing experience and I was dumbstruck just following my class officer like a puppy. 
---
By far the finest instance I ever saw. I just love the dragon theme and the secret labs and trap room. The drops were ridiculously cool looking too.
---
Lol. You better not play then and really stick it to the man.
---
&gt; 2004 wasn't THAT long ago lol
---
2004 is equally far from today as Romania abolishing communism for actual democracy.
---
It's a long time ago man.
---
Holy Paladin def fills the high demand util role. Priests are just generally one of the best healer classes for pve, master healing as a priest and you can go far, kid.
---
Mages are high demand, solid rdps choices for every raid basically.
---
Warlock... Man, I never saw a bad raiding warlock until TBC, but that's because they only took a few, tops, and they were competitive about it, at least in my raiding experience.
---
There is a couple of options for raiding competitively, but my only personal experience in vanilla is for druids (resto), priest (all specs), and rogue (??? spec, I sucked at rogue in vanilla lol)
---
Healing as a druid is... I would say gratifying. You are the raid healer, tossing hots like candy, innervating the priority caster for the fight, tons of stuff. Wow, I kind of want to roll druid a lot now.
---
Priest is also really gratifying, but way more stressful having to make sure the MT/OT doesn't die because you secretly don't understand how to keep him alive, or because he's an idiot who didn't change out of his mining outfit.
---
Like I said, I suck at rogue, ignore everything I say about it.
---
Also, the Tauren tribes and Lordaeron are all basically Horde Territory.
---
Sweet
---
I mean, people upset that streamers get to skip queues *should* be upset. From an advertising standpoint, streamers getting in makes sense....but this is a beta, not a PR special access thing. Streamers *shouldn't* be getting in over people who played back in vanilla.
---
The new orcs looks so bad :(  but then again the whole game is so utterly terrible it doesnt matter :P
---
you're delusional. it was really that easy. you also have to realize that Asmongold farmed himself the "BIS" for level 30 gear. vanilla leveling was never that hard nor were the dungeons before, like, BRD. if you're playing vanilla for the difficulty, you're gonna be disappointed.
---
play it for the community. you'll have people out, leveling and collecting, gathering, and the slow pace of the game allows you to chill out instead of the breakneck pace of BfA. since everything generally takes so much longer, it fosters the community.
---
Jesus Christ.
---
Do you people even bother to read up on how layers work?
---
You can‚Äôt just hop to an empty layer. The server creates a layer after the original one is full. You can‚Äôt just hop and find a pristine wilderness full of rich thorium veins, black lotus and devilsaurs who just lay down waiting to be skinned.
---
How? All I can find is Blizzard trying to sell be reforged.

---
Everything you said is wrong. Everything. A couple weeks ago the least few people who were against layering finally understood why it's being done. 
---
At this point I have to call your IQ into question..
---
hes geared af at 30, no lvl 30 was that geared in vanilla because they kept leveling
---
Awww, thanks! Until the responses I didn't realize I have it that good. I'll make sure not to waste a moment of it.
---
Just play BFA lol honestly it‚Äôs really not that bad, just level a new character you‚Äôve never played before, and do it on the opposite faction! That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing to pass the time! First ever alliance warlock and I‚Äôm having a blast
---
See ya in classic !
---
They will only be active for the first few weeks. Then it will be like layers never existed.
---
It needs to do its homework, take out the trash, and go mow the lawn.
---
he'd still be able to do it, he'd probably just have to kite/evade bug mobs more, though.
---
he doesn't know PepeLaugh
---
People are getting layered while in the middle of combat. If you think that people aren't going to find out how to trigger it intentionally, youu are mistaken.
---
Wondering the same thing! Think we should be alright
---
&gt; The only reason we are getting layers is so blizzard can get away with doing less work.
---
Not sure how adding layers is Blizzard doing less work but wev.
---

&gt;We have a choice to go to Iraq if we want and stay home if we don't. That's a privilege we have that older generations didn't.
---
Go to Iraq or be saddled with tens or hundreds of thousands in student loan debt. Yep, real great choice we were offered there.
---
&gt;Why are your/our criticisms for them legit but their criticisms for us are all bullshit according to you?
---
Because they hold all of the power and money. They control literally everything. They complain about the participation trophies millennials got when they were the ones handing out the damn things even though none of us wanted them. They complain that we don't buy stuff but ignore the fact that we're broke and they refuse to pay us reasonable wages. They've steadily destroyed the planet for the last 60 years and refuse to do a damn thing about it while us millennials have to sit here and watch because, again, we have no power and no money.
---
So again, this isn't just the same shit that always happens. This isn't a situation that's ever happened before.
---
I only got it, in the 2nd (EU) Wave and leveled from 1-25 in the fast ~2 Days and in most Zones there are a handful of people at best. But I mostly play during EU Times, like I started 10hrs ago and played until 2hrs ago. (before the WorldServer went down every few minutes), which should be the middle of the Night for Americans. 
---
I really wish there were a EU Beta-Server.

I'm not surprised it's quinn.

Another rogue= Payo. Quite possibly the greatest rogue in the world
---
Sure. Don't have to agree with that though. The Specs and classes werent that streamlined in vanilla and TBC
---
there is a glitch to get under stormwind and after that you gotta head all the way up north, there is a huge wall. the screenshot is just before that big wall
---
It might help if you got reel life frends instead of relying on games to keep you occupied. Only peeple with severe artism can't get frends (their severely socially and mentally disabled). Maybelline you are two, might want to get that checked out instead of browsering this stuped blog forum website (Rebbit) and waisting even more time playing pointless games that rot you're little brians. :)
---
You should organize your friend group into a package deal then apply to guilds with leaders that have way more time.
---
If the guild you join sucks you can just bulk app to another guild.
---
Breaking the limits, GodQuin69 in your max level Kappa
---
Isnt this the Irish, Scottish retard ?
---
And he is talking about entitlement lol.
---
Why would they have fake connect groups? Wouldnt it make more sense to let in as many as possible and those that couldnt get in were because of over capacity?
---
Maybe these streamers whose job is to have a good quality stream and get paid well can afford a better internet connection than the average person
---
It‚Äôs just leveling I‚Äôve done it twice before on classic wow. That‚Äôs why I have a guild op be running dungeons and stuff at 60 to gear up. And no I won‚Äôt be running end game raids and dungeons that‚Äôs where the game begins for me
---
Man you should have let them sperg out, would have been top tier content.
---
Yea i got that email. 
---
In my mind i was like "About time Blizzard, gimme dat Beta"
---
*Invited to Stress Test*
---
Gee thanks for telling me. 
---
I know it sounds ungrateful, and its still a privilege to be apart of it.
---
At the same time its like those macro guild invites i get all the time
---
*"Hello! -insert name here- I noticed you are guildless and would like to invite you to.... bla bla bla"*
---
I ain't too mad if i don't get an invite. 
---
Just please.. *Don't do that. Don't give me hope.*
---
A lot of money in merging servers. A lot of money lost when people aren't paying for their own transfers.

Not saltier than your comment though

That's not how this works. This means you're a streamer now. Sorry.

You're under the assumption that there's a fake connect group in the first place as opposed to just an overloaded login server which...was the entire point of the stress tests.

They should give u ur own server with all the pics u been pumping out. Should have limited graphics in the settings though.

The eternal conundrum
---
I'm gay, and I like playing healers, that's stereotypical af. I play male toons, even more stereotypical.
---
But playing a female toon? That's almost as gay. Except I'll have to look at a woman's butt.
---
But it's feminine, and that kinda negates it. What makes me gayest?
---
(Probably an orc because they're hotter than elves.)
---
Yes I don't know what I'm talking about.
---
Hello!
---
it doesn't matter what your spec is, what it refers to is what tree the abilities are categorised under in the spellbook. e.g. on a rogue, dinging level 2 shows "increased to 10 in assassination" and "increased to 10 in combat" because you currently only have Eviscerate (assassination skill) and Sinister Strike (combat skill). as soon as you train Stealth from the trainer, it shows "increased to 10 in subtlety" because Stealth belongs to the subtlety tree.

You do realize NA and EU will be split up? You do realize that there will be tons of different servers for people to play on?

The stress test is an accurate representation of how launch day will be.

Make sure you report this via the bug reporter to at least get it on their radar.

Group up ffs that's how you get though the starter zone fast

It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm forced to play at launch ... even tho I will play at launch ..... why do I do this to myself ?

Rofl. Damn. I am actually really worried about streamers in regards to picking a server though.

You must be slow, ketch-up

Check out tiragarde keep. That's what we did last night. A group of L1s and L2s had no trouble.

Is this some text you just copy paste? "Its not just Asmongold who is taking very little damage".

What do you mean by "mouse camera", just holding down left click while moving your mouse to move your view?

Lol he's obviously joking.
---
No, nothing ever gets better by engaging with haters on an equal playing field. This is badwrongpr. Making a video about it would be better than this.
---
it's true the first addon will probably be a sort of matchmaking addon to find people to do the raid, probably even with RaidIO built in.. they will never get that classic experience back, and i'm sure addons will be to blame..

Son, I'm in the red on this stock, price has fallen since I got in. That's why I need you gamers to GAME!

you also did a very thorough job of testing their internal PTR account system, so good on you!

The lag must have all been redirected to the Beta server. Kept having people freeze in place and catch back up to their actual position. Got disconnected several times.

Its weird though because you are much closer to the Coldridge spawn.

ironic, you say that right after insulting someone for remembering something wrong
---
This. More data is better, but around 100 attacks and you should be approaching the real average.

New animations and models are much nicer to look at.

I'd sub to get beta lol. Probably too late though..
---
Best DPS plate chest is from the Arena in BRD, lvl 50 blue, better then t2

Yea it really turned on it's head when he started to justify why arms is a better spec for a tank than fury or prot and tell me that tanks cant wear threat pieces like lionheart "bc thats dps gear". All of a sudden hes telling me how to play.

wait until you can't get a raid group because your raidIo score isn't high enough....

Definitely needs to be a list of servers that don't have major streamers on them.

I remember what it was for. I was asking you.

Others have already given you great advice but I have a few more tips, as someone who was a clicker for years and successfully transitioned to keystrokes. 
---
First, decide on the keys you want to use, set up your key bindings and force yourself to use them properly from level 1, no clicking! It's much easier to start from the beginning than to relearn a class once you have all your skills. 
---
As others have mentioned, setting A and D to strafe instead of keyboard turn will make a world of difference. Mice with side buttons are great too , if you get one you won't ever have to move your hand or click anything. I use the Corsair Scimitar but anything with 6+ side buttons should work. Get used to using shift as a modifier key. If you can do that plus the mouse, you will be able to bind absolutely everything you need comfortably without ever moving your hand.
---
You're making a good decision, trust me, clicking is probably slowing you down even more than you know.
---
I don't want both dynamic spawns and layering, but I know that of the two I definitely want dynamic spawns instead of layering.
---
I definitely bought gold to get my mount.
---
I have the beta as well, and so far you can't fucking avoid the Streamers or their influence on the pvp server. If you want easy access to basically 90% of the factions player base, you should join the streamer's guild. Then the focus is on the streamers and helping them achieve something, and get scolded for not participating in their raids and events. 
---
The beta feels like a sandbox for Twitch streams. The game should be released earlier than Aug 27 in my opinion.
---
The only thing I disagree with is this part " Sometimes it seems people forget they are doing this for **US** "  
---
They are obviously doing Classic WoW for financial gains. Hundreds of thousands to possibly millions of people will be paying $15/m to play Classic WoW, a game that required almost no development time, very little financial backing, and very little man power to reproduce. This is going to be a massive profit for Blizzard. So don't kid your self by saying this is for us gamers.
---
No this is a wrong misconception. chat will not be cross layer. if you want to group with someone with another layer you need to have them as a friend and know their name and who they are without ever seeing them. basically you need to have an IRL friend you know is on a different layer in order to get to another one. Or coordinate something on the forums. besides that you have no communication in game with people not on your layer
---
I did, linked to this post for more info just in case as well.
---
I was in the same boat.
---
Will login release day to see the mayhem, won't level properly till week 2 tho
---
Gonna be a fight for those vile familiars
---
Lightning's Blade, voting VC.
---
 "totem highway"   was what we used too. Espcially when the slowing totem got aggro from an add and it got destroyed with a spell.
---
I like wow... I just don't like the way the game is played... things that aren't really the game,  and things that could be fixed but arn't ..  also wow is an MMO i can't change the community that plays the game a certain way as easy I could just install an addon to make my experience a bit different..  and yeah I am entitled, I'm the center of the universe afterall
---
I love the might set, the helmet is one of the best in the game
---
Definitely! Already op as it is! By the way, with Karmond on stream we tested the macro, it now evolved a bit, and is pretty OP, you should try it :) 
---
it's : 
---
#showtooltip
---
/cast [@cursor] !Eagle Eye
---
I get this reference
---
That's completely different to ui addons, which are the ones you were being specific about.
---
I used to run 1-2 lowbies through on my lvl 32 hunter when I was 12 and I was super proud of myself for finally being able to do it after trying to solo it a few levels previously.
---
For me was the fact I never wanted to stop playing it. I was not done playing the game and before you know it expansion after expansion came out changing the type of game I originally liked to play. I still wanted to do AQ 40, get rank 10+ in PvP, play more than my mage and hunter. I still had not done everything in the game that I had wanted to and I still wanted to keep doing the things I had done before again and again because it was so much fun.
---
I completely agree that there should be an EU server.  It‚Äôs not fair to the EU testers honestly.  But even a handful of people in all of the subsidiary zones isn‚Äôt too bad for the beta (I know it‚Äôs not nearly the same as classic or what launch will be).  If there was an EU and NA server it would allow more people in too more than likely.  Hopefully at some point this will happen for you guys
---
( anti vax ( layers r badmkay )  )
---
I was actually Alliance, and I have forgotten most names by now. The only horde I remember was my nemesis, Gargamel the damn Orc Rogue.
---
No, no, no. They're not doing it for us. They're doing it because wow subs have fallen to such a low level the game might be shut down within the next year if trends keep on being the same. It's a last desperate attempt to take your money, not something they're doing to be charitable.
---
1 word, RaidIO... 
---
 yeah voluntary much?

Thankfully most of those items won't be in Classic until the phase that matches up with the patch where they were released. Sure, a few items got buffs along the way that make them WAY better and they will be BiS for the majority of Classic, but there aren't enough of those to make a HUGE difference, IMO.
---
No u
---
Tips is a popular guy, but not a great player. You can tell most, if not all, of his vanilla experience comes from P. Servers. Still, happy about what all he's done to raise awareness for classic and contribute to getting blizz to listen.
---
Perfect? Certainly not but millennials have already proven to be drastically more environmentally focused than the previous generation. We're the ones who have to live through it, it's in our best interest to do whatever we can. That said, 
---
&gt;So when they die and you guys get the power
---
we don't have time for that. The make or break point is in about 15 years. Plans need to be getting set in motion now but there's tons of resistance coming from the boomers.
---
Just tested this and it works. Also the gy it sends you to is Kharanos and not the Dwarf starting area so it makes this even easier.
---
Ha! That's a good one. :D

He is a top pvper in retail

I'd rather stay Guildless. Thats what I hate about the Server. I don't want anything to do with them or their Fanboys.
---
I just play it mostly as a Solo-RPG and test my Questroute.
---
If i was in charge of classic their would never be a classic, there would be a new mmo code named " project titan" and I would have never let it fail.
---
I'm not a paying customer because I don't want to play WoW as it is right now. I will most likely become a paying customer again in August though.
---
Thanks bitch
---
All though tips is bis his abilities as a warrior still suck
---
You're wrong.
---
tl;dr I don't know how layers will work
---
Imagine having 50 players like that rogue in one guild. 
---
They were able to wrap around themselves a 10k online pvt server with a bunch of nerds, getting all the ranks/firstkills/devilsaurs along with daily butthurt topics on related subreddit. 
---
A few times they've showed against soda, his squad couldn't do shit. Like, absolutely no chance, be it counter world-pvp or STV arena contest. Yet, there's only 5-7 people in the beta atm, but that's already happening. I kinda feel sorry for the folks who'll roll on their server at launch :D
---
Impressive plays by rogue, but I wouldn't blame Tips though. He was a pawn before the King, all is as it should be.
---
Wait till phase 2 to level then
---
People are still having trouble logging on? 
---
I figured it would have been resolved by now. 
---
I dont want to spend another 3 hours attempting to log in tonight but I will if it means a chance at playing.
---
I like him, he entertains me.
---
Above all, he does not act like a narcissistic psycho like soda or asmo. ;)
---
Only if I find enough concept art in good quality so i can make a wallpaper, will see, can't promise anything.
---
So for all of you saying tips is trash, what do you think he should have done in this video? Not that I'm disagreeing necessarily. I'd just like to take a bit more of an objective analysis on whether he should or shouldn't win a duel at this level.
---
&gt; legit part of the classic experience
---
have  fun using RaidIO and all the other addons that will be created by players like me who will ruin the entire classic experience and your so called community.
---
\*PTSD intensifies\*
---
Its always there EVERYWHERE.
---
&gt;so hyped for classic my dick is hard
---
me too 1000% and I don't even have a dick. I didn't think I'd be this excited for classic because I've been there, done that 10 years ago, but I'm so inspired to play now. I think I'm most looking forward to heading into a new area or doing the Kargath Badlands run and seeing mobs that are actually a higher level than you, what a concept..
---
I like this meme more when the virgin and the chad are two extremes with normal people being someplace between them.
---
Amen to this, i'll be as far away from streamer servers as i can get
---
How long until he realizes that just existing on the server is Stress Testing.
---
&gt;!Yes, I get it, he's looking at some peaceful waterfalls and going full Zen. !&lt;
---
Thanks for all the pointers. So, what about targeting? Do people mouse-click or "tab". I tried tabbing but that targets the thing closest to you and often I want to target something that is not the closest. So, do I just keep hitting tab to get to the target I want? This seems inefficient. 
---
Also, does anyone just move with their mouse. I've heard the really good pvp players only move with the mouse, and spell with the keyboard. But I find this awkward because if I need to click or change camera angle I have to stop moving. Any advice on that?
---
verbage, is not a word
---
That could also mean that he's so terrible at dueling that there couldn't possibly be anyone worse than him.
---
I loved the ragnaros hero
---
Updated with video, I have new challenger!
---
And who are you? Lmfao, literally more of a nobody than them.
---
Man, this post brought back some memories for me. My rogue's Horde side guild was finally clearing MC with relative ease. Our eyes moved toward BWL.
---
Razorgore tore us a new asshole. We probably lost 10+ serious raiders after the first week of trying to defeat him.
---
I think it took us three weeks to finally kill him, and we were definitely emotionally exhausted once we had.
---
Good times.
---
I'll let them know I don't, hopefully we will cancel out :)
---
As an old classic player i had no idea who Tipsoutbaby was until i started watching vanilla streams.
---
He seems very very arrogant "best dueller NA" was nice to see him knocked down a peg or two. He seems very average to me. I've watched him duel and Monkeynews duel and it's night and day.
---
It really didn't take long to get through even with all the extra people around. It took me maybe like an hour, and I even wasted some time killing the wrong mobs lol
---
Try dying in Winterspring and rezing in The Barrens.
---
No that is not a reasonable inference at all. Not even close. 
---
What the fuck does stolen wow valor even mean?!
---
What are we looking at?
---
That's Archimonde....
---
If i could get money to do what I wanted, I would start to create a sort of Virtual Reality MMO, it wouldn't be played with keyboard and mouse that's for sure.. and the world would be in the art style of Overwatch, colorful creative and vibrant. I'd have huge story driven adventures that force people to play together, id have all the intuitive features of VR, massive worlds that are diverse just like what we see in world of warcraft, i'd basically make world of warcraft but into something so much more than spamming tab 1 1 1 1 1 and running around reading quest dialog.
---
I still don't understand how people can like TipsOut
---
Updated with video now
---
Yes the classic client is based on the Legion client, but the beta is to find bugs like this. The lighting as seen in the screen shot form the beta is not as it was in 2005. This is a correctly reported bug.
---
The private server visuals are identical to the vanilla 2005 servers.
---
I think you can butcher Lordeaon since it hardly exists after the scurge, possibly even label theramore as Lordeaon.
---
The best part of Vanilla was the community, the thing that will kill Classic is the community of now.
---
You have to remember that no one had this good gear at lvl 30 back during vanilla. The streamers have been farming SM graveyard for rares and are almost kitted out in full blues at lvl 30.
---
No one had so complete BiS lists back during those days.
---
You can loot it but the first trinket requires level ~38, unsure about the master trinket.
---
Nice one, really got the looks as a SOV map from eve :)
---
Yeah so they are pretty good. I believe during the AQ40 patch we got the tier 0.5 set, which were damn good and I think better than a lot of MC epics (dont quote me on that). They also added new items to level 60 dungeons that, iirc, were of the same power level as tier 0.5. 
---
The way Blizz is going to to progressive itemization is that those items will only be in the dungeon loot tables when the AQ40 phase is released. Additionally, some items received itemization buffs/fixes throughout the course of vanilla because they were just trash items nobody used before. Those items will be in the buffed state day 1, which will mean people are going to be stronger than the raid teams fighting in MC during 1.1, but weaker than the raid teams fighting MC in 1.12
---
It's going to be funny watching as people realize they can no longer be dicks and get away with it.
---
IronMaiden kicks you out of the guild.
---
Feels good to be European, can pick any EU server and it probably won't have a streamer on it with more than 100 viewers.
---
I think you are right it requires lvl 10.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBHL_-biMrQ
---
Pure willful stupidity at this point
---
I usually get the jealous hatred for streamers for being paid to do shit I find fun, but Esfand is my man crush I just love the guy lol.
---
Lmao I'll ignore you and them just like I ignore any other ignorant people who thrive on outrage and constantly need something to be angry about.
---
okay well I need a team of developers, the best you can give me, that can create everything I want them to, and everything passes through me, and it's going to be a VR game, that will probably cost alot of money... so unless you have a winning lottery ticket, I should probably get a couple thousand and get a tech demo made and do a kickstarter,
---
Didn‚Äôt he start making videos after classic was announced?
---
Jesus Christ so much imagining going on
---
Deadmines was not that hard. Honestly the only spot where I ever had wipes was the forge room with all the goblins who summon mechanical mobs, and that's due to hunters not having their pets auto attack off. 
---
What made deadmines harder back then wasn't the damage values. The thing that most people forget about when Vanilla was new is the insane difference between technology we have now vs. technology we had then. We live in a time where people can buy full blown computers that are the size of a credit card and have the processing/memory specs of a 2004 era desktop computer (sans a video card.) Mobs in the deadmines didn't hit harder back then, people just didn't know what they were doing or what their defined roles were. Kids that were barely teenagers were your groupmates back then. Now they're adults pushing 30-40 with fully developed brains and motor skills. Makes a huge difference, breh.
---
to be fair, most of the kingdoms in the north barely exist
---
just grind its not bad at all
---
no I wasn't being specific about UI addons
---
/r/wowservers is the most toxic wow related subreddit
---
That‚Äôs Archimonde, Kil‚ÄôJaeden was the one who told Illidan he had to kill the Lich King.  
---
I think there may have been one or two Eredar units besides them though.
---
Reddit is a cruel and fickle mistress. The hivemind giveth and the hivemind taketh away.
---
I noticed the same with looting and NPC interactions. Guessing the server is hosted in NA, might explain it.
---
Oof. I feel that. I had a similar experience as a priest. I joined a guild that was already doing well in MC, so most of their priests had a lot of their gear already. I came into the first raid, just barely able to compete as a healer, and picked up three pieces the first night.
---
By the time we were in BWL, however, my luck had run out. I collected a total of 2 pieces in there before I stopped playing that priest for good. I miss that priest :[
---
my mention of UI addons was just a general example of one such addon that are popular that "alter the user experience"
---
You will not phase in classic at all unless you join a group in another layer. You will not be able to chat or see anyone in another layer which means the only way to group with them is some coordination outside of the game knowing that you're in different layers. And that's the only way you can change to a different layer for as long as you're grouped.
---
Hehe nice! I got halfway through ungorro when server went down.
---

Different damage with exact same gear, please check it out if you think its something that might concern you:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bs5q6x/different\_damage\_values\_same\_gear/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bs5q6x/different_damage_values_same_gear/)
---
lol no it isn't. The 1.12.1 client is the software Blizzard compiled and released to the public on September 26th, 2006. No one outside of Blizzard can "build" the client, because no one but Blizzard has the source code. Maybe check your understanding of how software works before replying.
---
Yeah but that's always rubbed me the wrong way how every important NPC in Undead society does not use the Undead models. 
---
It's like Blizzard acknowledging they hate it, too.
---
I mean it's not even a finished game, who would want to play scuffed Warcraft?
---
No idea, I don't follow the history of streamers/youtubers. I just watch their content while I wait for Aug 27.
---
53-47 no wonder there‚Äôs so much arguing
---
They have berserking which lets them attack faster, technically orcs have bloodlust but it also halves the healing they take for like 2 min.
---
Reread my comment please. I said he‚Äôs only been playing with seriousness for a fraction of the game‚Äôs life. Since he started streaming it seriously (which was mainly the start of Legion) he‚Äôs been serious. I in no way said that it wasn‚Äôt.
---
I'm sure that shortly after launch there will be asshole addons that people will use to remember such people. I had one shortly after WoW launched.
---
Thanks, trying to download the client again, started getting errors when launching from the folder and not the launcher.
---
Cool thanks... I might be going MM huntard. Do you know any talent build for 49 twinks for vanilla? I can't find information about it :(
---
Any grown adult who uses the word "influencer" probably would use "toxicity" as well.
---
inb4 thread lock
---
Look how far the range is when both characters are moving
---
No level requirement.
---
Yeah I've heard you need to keep an OT set. I don't mind that kind of stuff, it's very immersive I feel. Comparing it to camping out 3 weeks just to catch a special coloured cat in winter spring on my hunter. 
---
Will hopefully be leveling with old friends who are going to roll different classes to last time around. But ill try sway them to leather and cloth classes!
---
Chess is a game of strategy that most games can't compete with.
---
‚Äúbest NA warrior‚Äù nope
---
Just delete this post before you get flamed even more lol
---
Ty for the reply, this change made following pre-raid bis lists very hard for me. Guess we will see when the game actually launches.
---
No shit, Sherlock. That doesn‚Äôt invalidate my comment. It was around prior to Legion.
---
1.10/1.11 are most of the item changes
---
Don't play classic with us, please
---
I was finally able to get aroud to test this. I was able to swim from menethil to an area very far east that made me considered "Dun Morogh" and I was sent to the Kharanos graveyard after dieing, so spirit healered and bam. I recommend then taking the deeprun tram, as that'll be faster than swimming for the rest of your life.
---
I was also able to walk up a cliff near Gnomeregan to get TO menethil harbor from dun morogh easily! I used[this ancient video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOf9QfbE10M) to find it. Although he didn't provide a map, its practically the second your zone changes to "Gnomeregan" if you're following the road.
---
&gt;I'm looking forward to Classic especially because it isn't and has never been as toxic as other games nowadays
---
That's why I'm going RP-PvP instead of PvP, baby. World pvp goodness with a more mature community, theoretically
---
I don‚Äôt like it when Burt hurts me, its just so stressful somehow...
---
Its mail.
---
Tauren warrior is pretty  good combo because taurens have longest melee reach and melee range is important for warriors in pvp atleast. They also have racial for 5% more stamina or health, which makes them have bigger health pool than any other warrior in the game.
---
Human warrior on the other hand is marginally best warrior dps, because of their racials...  they have just the right racials when it comes to endgame dps because most endgame weapons are swords and humans have sword specialization.  So thats marginally better dps than other races, it shouldnt matter  for casual play but hardcore it might just be the best to only stack human warriors and the benefit of having them stacks too.
---
Night Elf hunters are one of the best ones for pvp, reason being their racial Shadowmeld. It is quite overpowered being able to cast aimed shot while stealthed so the opponent will have NO idea until both your aimed shot AND multishot are heading towards them... and those have the potential to 1 shot a cloth user.
---
Will see if blizzard makes it possible in classic, it was possible on retail but that was changed at some point so that you can no longer cast aimed shot while being in shadowmeld.  (i have proof if needed, Hunted pvp video made by Liger... its basically a hunter crit video and he uses this technique in it. I download this video long time ago and it has been pixelating on my HDD for years)
---
The other classes i think someone else would be more accurate... i dont know the benefits of every class but these are the ones i think are pretty good.
---
I‚Äôll be surprised if bfa has more than 10% of the player base for the entire first week of launch
---
The single thing I'm looking forward to the most. I mean shit I have friends from 04 I've travelled to meet. If there was 1 thing that bothers me in retail the most it's the anonymity of it all.
---
Someone screws up in WSG? Flame them and stop trying and call them  retards and /spit. After ALL you'll never see them again. Etc. 
---
Can't wait to see how it plays out when you actually have strong server presence.
---
The layers are just different instances. I'm almost certain you'd be able to communicate with people in a different layer, you just won't be able to see them. Again, they are using the exact same tech they use for sharding, they've just configured it differently.
---
Quite possibly XD we would clear MC in about ~45-55 minutes prior to resuming BWL on Tuesdays.
---
Also everyone pretty much just made a human.  The other starting zones I tried were fine with 0 lag.
---
I bought 1000 shares at 1.98 many years ago.
---
25% from racial and 5% base stun resist. He had 30% stun resist total.
---
Do you know where I can find a list of these weird/buggy responses?
---
you don't have to use addons and we regularly played (and still play) with people who don't use them either. i dunno why that point is bothering you so much.
---
knowing shit about the game must hurt.
---
I noticed a lot were kids trying to fit in because it's such a big deal to so many people. I remember what getting into a beta or alpha used to mean. Think back 2004. It was a great chance for people to help the devs understand their game better and polish it up a bit with feedback from members of the community that really enjoyed that developers content. Wait a minute... Lol a lot of people now just think it means "early access" not in terms of beta but just get to play first. I'm slowly believing adults with all the bashing they do about millennials after seeing that though not gonna lie. That was some serious crybaby stuff.
---
I agree!  u/d0nt-worry-be-happy do a deep dive on PvP in Vanilla!
---
100 percent this, it would be such a disservice to yourself not to try it once solo, you dont even need to cap, hell you dont even need to get to level 30
---
Tech support! So a case = Someone's broken PC and or Phone.
---
Private server bias again
---
The best thing about this is, that most of the changes only started happening around 5 years ago. Before that there were usually no artificial buffs (ecept for things like pre-nerf versions) and people were happy when servers had a stable 1k pop at peak times. There were no artificial  debuff slot limits or pre-patch X itemization changes.
---
Yeah i actually think so as well. It's going to be fun for while but i'm mentally prepared to quit already. It's going to be hell for anyone playing even slightly off-meta specs and shit like that.
---
Crits are also affected. Sadly.
---
Maybe. Then again most people here just didn't like tips to begin with so I wouldn't expect to see anyone impressed.
---
Guild leading is a job unto itself. Sounds like you know what you're in for, having done it in the past. It also sounds like you know what kind of players you're looking for since you mentioned your core group all have active adult lives. Look for like-minded players with similar schedules and grow your guild organically. Early 40 man content in vanilla was easily done with 20-25 "good" players and 15-20 warm bodies with room temperature IQ's. Get that core group of 20+ together and you'll be fine.
---
No, I just know it's happened to me before. :D
---
Option 2 will work just fine I don‚Äôt know what you all are talking about. You drown yourself in a little part of the sea which falls under Dun Morogh and get potted to the GY in Kharanos
---
One of the few still in BFA
---
im stranded at work in my cubicle, i totally enjoy this since im a huge gfx fiddler
---
I love this. What did you use to make it?
---
It's basically a marketing campaign in a lot of ways.
---
Imagine people downvoting posts like these. Yikes.
---
Good find OP, thanks.
---
He definitely acts a lot but he also permabans a shit load of people for even saying he is bad
---
Was he using a quiver as well? Maybe the quiver is affecting attack values (but not affecting attack speed) somehow? Unlikely but the only thing I noticed that stood out.
---
1 wasn't, even joana says its wrong
---
Okay I defended Tips in the other thread but now I can clearly see that he isn't good at all.
---
Which patch added this 2.5 yard change?
---
Omg, I never played any of the warcraft games and didn't think of this. Thank you, I now know what to do before classic launches
---
The irony in your crying is that they did invite people who didnt have active subs. Until you know something for sure, keep it off the internet. And dont choose the name Arthas.... how normie is that
---
No one is going to make a level 30 twink..
---
He's a shit player not afraid to say it either. He doesn't know much about the game and he only got carried through content by TL otherwise the dude wouldnt last in an end game guild.
---
UBRS 10 man, everything else 5 man
---
grats, you got stress tested
---
Already working on one that keeps an entire database
---
honestly if you're asking whether or not you should, for classic I'd say that's not a guild I'd ever consider
---
I don't understand hating on people for not wanting to roll pvp. I love pvp and would never roll otherwise, but what other people want to play is their own business.
---
Oh yeah it was mysterious, I remember first time I got to it, the place where it all begun, it was awesome
---
whoosh
---
Yeah, regardless of what people think about him personally, there's no denying that he's helped spread the word of Classic. Regardless of when he played the game, or when he started making the videos or whatever else, at least he was someone that was talking about it &amp; making videos about Classic. That's a positive thing to me, regardless of how I feel about him as a streamer. Since the majority of his videos were basically just positive, hype videos for Classic.
---
This game is going to be A LOT easier this time around. It really wasn't that hard to begin with. Hard part was getting 40 people not lagging/dc'ing. Computers are better now, class knowledge at a high. Raids will be ez mode IMO.
---
Its a beta, ppl are overeacting.... Everything Will be reseted dont know why ppl want to play a beta so much...
---
It's not the same though, I logged in to one of those and it just felt empty because I knew eventually I'd lose all my progress when classic came out
---
paint.net and memory
---
They typically didint give too much of a shit. I had been caught in hyjal and the goblin place off tanaris before and the gms just teleported me out and told me it could get me banned. Being the shit edgelord I was I kept pushing and pushing. Going so far as to contact a gm while in hyjal and asking if I could teleport some Guildies in with ne. They declined but still.  It was just a scare tactic.
---
A someone who was in a pvp guild through all of Vanilla (and even ranked up to Warlord) I can confirm this is all true. Got to see many raids rise and fall from BLW while I got to be there as a guest spot attempting to do my job lol.
---
I wonder if the wall jumping behind scarlet monastery is still possible. I remember on my paladin spending an hour during TBC wall jumping behind scarlet monastery and getting into "Quel'delar" or something like that. I mounted up and ran across the empty flatzone to Hearthglen in which I bubble jumped off into it. Ahhh good times
---
Alliance is overpopulated because the people who play Alliance are shallow and only picked Alliance so they could have "pretty character models"
---
I got the itch HARD this past week after the release date announcement. I made an account on one of these who shall not be named, and leveled mulgore through lv 12. 
---
Ya know, just for practice on the routes so I can get ahead of the rush on 8/27. I‚Äôm thinking of releveling from 1-12 again just to have that down pat without needing to reference a guide; just eyes glued to the screen and maximum efficiency.
---
hey! you had plenty of time to think what to do during the next slide. ·Éö(‡≤†Áõä‡≤†·Éö)
---
That just means more gear for us!
---
Ok, I was there for that in Deathknell and it was fucking awesome, Magmadar wrecking everyone was great. I can see some salt with the streamers getting in early and what not. But what did we expect? They bring big add revenue to twitch and to WoW. The beta is in many ways a marketing campaign. 
---
But to be mad at the sudden boss drop? That was just fun. Made trying to log in for 2 hours totally worth it.
---
And then you read the blue post saying that they're rapidly decreasing closed beta invites because they've reached the amount of testers they need. I guess there's still a sliver of a chance to be invited, but not looking good.
---
Til I wasn't in a clique in my vanilla raid and I was probably not liked as a player :(

The war of the ancients was like 10000 years before the events of warcraft though.

---
If you can't finish the quest, group with some peeps and head on out and kill some higher level mobs for a bit. Did that yesterday and ended up making 4 new friends for classic. Honestly, just need to adapt to the server population.
---
&gt; I was all for layers when it was first announced but giving it a second glance made me reconsider.
---
Uhm ... the first google result for "classic wow layers" links to wowhead and clearly says that you cannot do whatever you're complaining about ._.
---
My problem with tipsout is that he doesnt really provide anyrhing that anyone does
---
Hes not performing high skill game play videos
---
He comes across as a "yes man" and never really adds anything to the classic cast
---
He doesnt provide some sort of new thought provoking theorycrafting
---
His goofy content just feels cringey
---
i did 25-man raid leading for WotLK never again. the endless vetting and recruitment not to mention the poaching of your good guys now asking me to do that with 40 people that is a full time job mate.
---
that is not to mention the 1 on 1 time to fix the bad casual to become decent since somehow he has rooted himself to 3 good players i can't afford to lose.
---
40 man raids are epic but from a getting to play the game 10-20 people is much better for the leadership. but despite that i would really like to see some 40 man raids in current WoW. they have done mini raids in both legion and BfA why not do a single boss raid that is a 40 man fixed diffculity. more for the grandiour than the gear seems like fun to me.
---
&gt; What, you think it's even remotely acceptable to tell others how to write their show
---
Uh... yes? If no one spoke out about poor writing, nothing would ever change. HBO and other networks would continue to produce garbage because of people like you who will eat it up anyway.
---
&gt; and force the actors and everyone else who worked on the show to cater to the demands of salty Stans
---
Uh... no? The whole point of this conversation was pointing out that the fault rests on writers and them alone. Many of the actors have already expressed disappointment with this season, and its unfortunate that they rarely get a say in how their character is written.
---
&gt; Why the fuck is that post and why should I give a shit? It's not relevant
---
It's completely relevant. You asked for x, I gave you x, and now you whine about it.
---
&gt; Yeah, it is insulting.
---
You know what's even more insulting? The abysmal effort that the writers put into the last season. It's pretty clear they just wanted to say "fuck you" to the fans and end it as quick as possible so they can move onto star wars. I feel awful for the actors and crew who have to deal with this shit first-hand.
---
I don't think anyone thinks hes a good player, everyone just posts when he gets shit on cause hes not actually good
---
Lol everyone here thinking warrior lvl 30 are relevant in duels or 1v1
---
Raid on northshire, check the Twitter thread!
---
Sword skill of 25/30 vs 30/30...?
---
wow, never knew there was that many streamers
---
I just hope that Layers on Live don't work the way they were during the stress test yesterday. Asmon was literally just joining new groups to see which different bosses were spawned on different layers.
---
Wait Towelliee?
---
Wait til they get mad about the sub fee.
---
Rewrite everything you just said. It's incompetent and trash. An absolute dumpster fire. Seriously, you don't know how to write.
---
I mean, I thought the season was rushed as well, but what a bunch of entitled crybabies. 
---
"Acktchually, his character arc was all about..."
---
I think star wars might have met its match as far as whiny fanbases go.
---
Dude acts like this is some insane revelation when this is exactly how Blizzard told us it was lol.
---
Of course you want it given to you.
---
the raids nowadays are much harder, they're the vanilla leveling of raids
---
Vanilla raiding was mostly about logistics and knowledge of what to do, mechanically it is easy comparatively
---
Cool post, thanks for sharing.
---
weak sauce... You needed to model edit or bot 24/7
---
Show me the proof I am completely open to your evidence
---
I mean yeah it's basically the same thing but done different, that's not a surprise to anyone.
---
Melee Leeway was in Vanilla, no?
---
Is it bullying though? I don't think anyones shitting on him for enjoying being part of the community though. But when you self proclaim you're the best dueler ever or whatever, and you get shit on by people you should beat, expect people to take a jab at you when you lose
---
Yeah i know Wotlk, but still.
---
Credit goes to the healers there, no? /druid
---
Since they were originally introduced in 1.6 with BWL, they'll more than likely be a Phase 3 introduction.
---
Way to completely miss the context of the post.
---
And you are helping. You are helping them get an idea of what an individual server may experience on launch day.
---
But again, you just reiterated my comment. You believe this was an opportunity to test content. No that is not what it was for. It was strictly to test the servers, with a leveling cap of 5.
---
Blizzard does not need you to test content. That is what the beta testers are for. This was a stress test. I would advise not wasting your time on the next stress test, because that is exactly what they are. Massive amounts of people overloading the login / character creation / ingame servers.
---
Are you guys still going on about this, really?
---
I guarantee you buy what they said already and what we've seen so far that is not the case. Your lair will be a completely closed off layer basically its own server. You will never phase you will never see anyone from another layer. And we've seen just by the stress test that that is correct
---
Considering how the Orcs were at war and then in captivity up until a few years before WoW, I'd say they did pretty good for themselves setting down.
---
I like this dude. Been follwing him for some time now and I like his videos. Great guy!
---
probably because you have nothing to say, just like the rest of you retards. moo has it right, just ignore them, i'm wasting my time even replying to your dumb ass.
---
oh wow LUCKY! grats man
---
Thank you
---
Guys, maybe enough with the circlejerk? Level 30 duels don't say shit, and he's a fucking Warrior lol. They are notoriously trash before 40.
---
90% of you jerking eachother off over how bad Tips is would get dumpstered by him
---
I never said anything about 1.
---
To be honest I never played Druid so I couldn‚Äôt tell you.
---
I know they have an annoying stun but it‚Äôs a combat ability stun and I couldn‚Äôt tell you how long it lasts. 3 seconds maybe? I‚Äôm also not sure if they had that  combat stun in vanilla since it‚Äôs been so long. 
---
Mage wouldn‚Äôt be bad, though. You can turn people into sheep, ice block to get out of combat, Frost nova and blink away. Probably be your best bet if you didn‚Äôt want to stealth around.
---
I think this is relevant here:

Next time, take a bowl of warm water with some detergent and just soak the keys for 5-10 minutes, then wipe down with a paper towel and let dry. Works like a charm. /r/MechanicalKeyboards

We live in 2019, BWL will be cleared hours after launch easily.

Razorgore was also a gimme boss for alliance after the DI bug was discovered.
---
Pretty sure you're the one who wooshed
---
You do this at work? Haha, nice dude! When can I say... keep up the good work! No offence! Peace! :)
---
The only thing I don‚Äôt want is to play with people from another server that I may never see again. The whole fun of classic for me is the people in it, I remember having an addon that I could flag people as kill on site or avoid at all costs whenever I saw them. As well as making friends of course. Reading into layering though and it seems that everyone is still in the same server so all is good.
---
I'm not sure what you mean by very few people playing? Everywhere I go I'm running into random players having interactions/grouping to take on hard quests or dungeons.
---
Judging by screenshot he does not have one equipped, just the bags, good question, I wonder myself.
---
Don‚Äôt see the problem here
---
Yes, it's been that way forever
---
True pvper vs casual wannabe.
---
The way hunters use autoshot is different. quiver appears on back when you put bow away, when a mob comes into melee range it want to keep aiming the bow at the mob and when i press Raptor strike it doesnt attack, rather i have to right click the mob then press raptor strike. Also sidestepping while rightclicking camera to run away from the mob looks weird, like he's walking backwards at normal run speed.
---
Sigh
---
I feel sad for you.
---
That was part of the stress test and they‚Äôre testing layering. There are literally dozens of threads answering this question.
---
As someone who for the longest time just was in a spiraling drop into depression, it's really easy for things to get absolutely gross and then trying to find even the SMALLEST bit of motivation to get anything done. Depression and lack of any real life social stimuli can do a lot to a person's mental health and physical well-being.
---
I was able to get into the stress test and played for a couple of hours.
---
Honestly, I loved the oversaturation of players. We naturally formed full parties and competed against other parties to tap mobs. During down time we chatted about when we'd each started playing or which expansions we'd skipped, and made dumb jokes about how we were locking down our corner of the zone.  We helped eachother find our different class trainers, and got a few quests done together before I called it a night and left. Group wouldn't have formed if not for how hard it was to solo tap mobs. 
---
Before that, I'd made a different group for a kill quest, and once I'd finished passed leader to someone else and told them to pass the group forward as people would leave/join. Maybe that group lasted as a "grel kill squad" with people passing through it for an hour, maybe they all synced up and went on questing together. Either way, I liked people socially creating order out of the chaos.
---
Unbind key turning all together. That alone gives you two extra keys + modifiers to use for spells and forces you to mouse turn 
---
If you wanna go full dumb about it then unbind backwards running also, at least until you get used to not backpedaling.
---
YOU DO REALIZE?? DO YOU??
---
Just listen to [Rapwing Lair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNCrGAINkUw) and you'll be fine.
---
With my limited knowledge of the hardware involved; I would assume it's so that they can run as few servers as possible for Classic while still being able to support a vast amount of players. Servers when WoW originally released couldn't or didn't handle instancing like they do today.
---
So with layers they're able to support a much larger population on a, single, more powerful server and reduce costs.
---
I could have easily just made this up, so don't take this as gospel, but that's what I assume.
---
&gt; Sorry, this is objectively terrible dueling by Tips. Hard to watch
---
Actually, the rogue knows what he is doing. Perplexity is a known rogue for his pvp skills. This is what a noob vs pro looks like.
---
Uh zero Pandren during that entire time? 
---
Calling BS here.
---
WoW classic is so authentic that it knows men are stronger than wamen
---
So, me and two friends have created a guild that will raid kinda like you suggest, 8-11 tues/thurs. We created a guild since we have kids and real jobs and what-not but wanted to make sure that we would end up raiding in a manner that fitted us. 
---
So far the experience have been very cool. We have 80ppl on our discord and 45-50 are dedicated to raid with us, on the times decided. We wont get server firsts ofc but we think that we will do PvE-content while relevant. Ppl are nice, grown up and drama free. All the rules, loot-distribution etc are in place so everyone are well prepared for how stuff will work. I am sure there will be alot of ‚ÄùHR-management‚Äù still but as you say, you aren‚Äôt in highschool any longer but neither are your guildmates so stuff is easier and more mature overall then I remember it
---
That is because the "backup" graveyard in kalimdor is in the barrens. If you can¬¥t be send to the right graveyard for any reason, you will allways be send to the graveyard in barrens next to crossroads.

For lorderon this graveyard is in westfall.
---
Where have pve servers ever been called normal? It‚Äôs a game mode stripped of a very large and unique feature synonymous with vanilla, hows that normal?
---
Wouldnt expect anything less from perplexity , he is probably top 3 rogues : )
---
those daily topics about the devilsaur were deserved, they were colluding with the opposition lmao, APES is an incredible guild and will be an incredible guild, but they have their fair share of shitty attitudes in that mafia
---
Yeah I went through 3 pages looking for some but didn't see any.
---
No. Saying that you are calling someone out for a common phrase as being toxic. There was no active agression there, You are dancing around calling him a child but are alluding to it, Active agressive would be calling him what you think.
---
This was exactly what I was thinking when I was about to post, "I've seen worse subreddits."
---
Ah, I plated Wrath on an iMac. Those memories are not fond, Dalaran was a laggy mess that used to make me DC on raid days/nights.
---
Edgy cool kids vs the pretty characters, eh?
---
I want RP-PVP server.
---
The bigger the shit show the better.
---
Especially when you don't understand the definitions of either, eh?
---
That was the stress test and it was deliberately done that way. It‚Äôs the only way they can ensure the tech works the way it‚Äôs supposed to.
---
I got in to the stress test and it was fucking awesome
---
Nostalgia levels are high my friend
---
It is going to be worth the wait ü§òüèΩ
---
Always :)
---
I think the healers were the ones pushing for the switch to DPS gear because the healing was under control during Rag phases but the sons were a problem due to DPS which was draining healers' mana pretty badly and the need for spot heals.
---
he should try to defend his stance on being one of the best warrior duelers out there first, stuff like that is why people turned on tips
---
Because you can overpopulate it. 
---
Let's say 75% of all players will leave within the first 3 months. 
---
Without layering you'll have have to create lots of servers to allow everyone who wants to play to get in to the game. After 3 months every single one of those servers will be ghost towns.
---
With layering you can create fewer servers but the server consists of a bunch of layers each as big as a regular server. After 3 months every server will have a healthy population and they can remove the layers permanently.
---
This isn't hard to understand.
---
Dude you're awesome bro tyvm. So it won't kick you into coldridge valley anymore? If so that does make it a lot better, because I'll get the IF AND SW flights faster than having to swim to the backside of sw. NICE DUDE!!!
---
you can shoot him bro with a ranged weapon to keep him in combat : ) lool
---
I agree that raid leading and GMing at once is a hell of a job with 40 people. What I have seen work very very well in pservers is having a raid lead and a GM be separate people always. The GMs job becomes managing people and keeping drama out of the guild, managing guild resources, raid schedules, recruiting, that sort of stuff. The raid leader would have roughly the same power as an officer and his focus would be on keeping the raid moving quickly and running smooth. This was a loot council guild so most of the raid the GM was back with the loot and the officers discussed loot while the raid kept moving forward. If there was loot issues the GM and and and officer would just chat to the individuals in another channel if needed  This cut the raid times in half compared to my other raiding and experiences
---
Gender gap confirmed
---
THIS! I vividly remember double Netherwind chests dropping off of Neferian, six weeks in a row. The guild raiders despised, all of the mages at that point.
---
Burthurt is the best hurt
---
He's so bad.
---
is this not how its supposed to work ?
---
Yep and the loser is 30/30, all is good :D
---
LOL! Or you were in a low drama guild :) .  I specifically tried to put that part in there too.
---
Or people were too busy doing their actual jobs in raids :)
---
Thought this guy quit wow like 12 times
---
same, it was absolutely magnificient
---
Overpopulated side that wins AV because of map design imbalances vs The side that has to try extra hard to succeed even with "PvP racials"
---
Just like doing a beta, eh?
---
Furthermore, warriors glaring weakness in vanilla is 1v1 overall.
---
It was changed from one of the best TPS chests to one of the best DPS chests in 1.10.
---
We will never really know
---
Actually once bwl releases your bis tank weapons are axes basically until nax. Dooms edge/crul
---
What languages do you work with? What enterprise level software have you worked on?
---
Yea haha. I was excited can't say I wasn't. I booted the stress test today and played for like an hour. It was awesome.
---
You‚Äôve given me hope in the first few sentences. I didn‚Äôt see the email or I would have been there as well.
---
I have an active sub for this month that I canceled before they announced beta was coming and I still got an invite.
---
I would guess all you need is a subscription that's active at the time they send our each of the invites.
---
unlikely

You can like it more but saying that the old models are infinitely better is just straight up trolling

My question from this is: did he at any point group with a Paladin and get Devo aura? Could be a similar bug to the Stoneskin one.
---
Requires additional pylons!
---
I feel like with 16 Debuff Slots, 1.12 Talents and Items and Rotations and BIS Lists 1 Google Search away, it will be very hard to lack dps for vael
---
But what does that have to do with his question?
---
The closest is the "Lost One's" in Swamp of Sorrows e.g http://classicdb.ch/?npc=1776 . I forget if there's any "Broken" mobs  there in Vanilla but later on in BC there definitely is.
---
What does the symbol on the back represent?
---
Considering the fact that everything minus drop tables (and a few exceptions like race-specific riding skill) are being put in the state they were in 1.12, I'd say it's highly unlikely.
---
:laughing: Dude. That's SO wrong. I would pay to see that in action. That's been my life for the last 16 years, literally.
---
Holy FUCK, I'm old. Wow.
---
And "Beta test" is a nice PR term for NOT FINISHED
---
Get out.
---
FINALLY a new and fresh idea for this subreddit.
---
And with very very very few he meant 95% of the other North American Warriors.
---
The stress test server is still up for a few more hours! If you got an invite you should be able to get it installed and going pretty fast :D
---
I dunno if it's so much as argument as it's Nostalgia circle jerking.
---
Are you max level? If you're max level and cannot gain more exp then quests will start converting that exp into money. So if you're level 5 this is likely working as intended.
---
Just wait until they blame private server players for this as well :P
---
I'm technically part of that "participation" era so I don't exactly agree with it. I just never made that connection before so I found it funny.
---
they're not looking to go through every patch of changes though - once they add content, whether it's pve or pvp, it will be in the state it was in 1.12 (AV is a good example of this, so if you want in-depth discussions on why this is or isn't good, you can look up those posts)
---
&gt; People (not just you) are in for a rude awakening on release with having your name and actions matter again.
---
yes wow is full of hitler praising guilds that spread pedophilia propaganda. sorry but you sound like a hateful idiot.
---
you should try and repair or update your beta from the launcher. if everything fails ticket a gm. pretty sure you're fine :)
---
How does that lore work, does he get resurrected?

Also layering will only last for the first couple weeks. after that it's one server no layers no phasing exactly like vanilla was

Looks just like the pc monitor I played on

Raid comps will have a lot more dps these days. I was the only fury warrior in my guild back in bwl and aq and we only had 4 warriors.

Druids have a lot of utility that makes them good at everything, but not particularly great, where as priests are really good healers, can put out a lot of HPS and has a bit of utility, but not near as much as druids

Druids also have a brez but not a regular Rez, where as priests are the other way around
---
The dark portal actually connected azeroth to draenor. So that view would be one or the other I would imagine.
---
an interesting note about the auto shot strafe bug, it only happens when you move your mouse left. never happens on the right. at least for me. also something you might wanna test that i found and reported last night, if you auto shot and jump /backpedal and press strafe in the air, your character bugs out and spins a random direction. this was super hard for me to replicate but i could get it every few attempts.
---
:Thumbsup:
---
You could call it the Grifter list. Then in game it could be shortened to Glist, or sometimes GL.
---
Yes, but sounds to me you would be a happy druid so I say go with it. Plus druids have an easier time getting gear.
---
No because the game is running on 1.12...
---
Why because u can‚Äôt afford a boost :p ?
---
Just give beta access to people who aren't subbed to BFA, we don't want to play that shit game, we want to play fucking classic.
---
&gt;  My guild in vanilla netted a realm-first Nefarian kill 3 weeks after starting progression
---
Impossible, absolutely impossible.  "Realm-first" and "3 weeks after starting progression" cannot go together.  For a realm first you would have started when BWL released, but "3 weeks after starting progression" implies you started later, otherwise you'd just say "3 weeks after release".
---
You must have played on some backwater server or be talking about a private server
---
Hunter, you can pretend you need every weapon that drops and then just vendor it for cash. Ez
---
Maybe. We can't know what caused the issue, I'm leaning more towards incorrect infrastructure sizing, but we'll only know if Blizzard releases a statement.
---
Ya just playing alone last night I reports a few bugs, nothing game breaking just annoying ones really.
---
knowing an exact date makes the waiting 20x worse tho :(
---
Classic cap is currently at 1k people.
---
Sad but true but I would love to see the metrics. Love will be a ghost town for sure.
---
Before that there's going to be a shitload of "fuck! I died to a random patrol AGAIN!" 
---
Can't wait. Will be glorious.
---
Wait for classic to launch. You'll have a blast going in completely fresh and not knowing anything.
---
Did the horde players get something like this? All I've seen is the Alliance side.
---
About 65% of people I've played with over the years used it with no issues. They don't care. They only cared if your streaming it.
---
Found the shitposter! Do i get a beta invite now? 
---
Blizz???
---
Are you sorting by 'new'? If not you likely won't see them cuz layering/sharding questions get downvoted pretty heavily.

IICR it‚Äôs 500?

Their goal is to make the experience as authentic as possible. ‚ÄúA different engine‚Äù is not an excuse in that regard.

He said he was in a group with one, but can't recall if paladin used devotion aura. So I guess that's a possibility! Good one.

The blizzard 1.12 client is not a 'private server client' lol

But they may be putting the plague in for instance, or original cthun pre nerf. Its a valid question and you dont know either.
---
I assume they wont. There have been a lot of changes towards raids over the time and so far Blizz didnt make any notion towards rolling back these. Maybe they make an exception for this, who knows.
---
You don't need T-Morph there is a mod already for vanilla 1.12?/.21 that uses the new character models. There was a few bugs but once the real classic is switched over and it runs on the new back end they can be ironed out and will actually work fine.
---
You could get banned for that? I got there once with my mage and then decided to show my whole guild how to do it, I guess I dodged a bullet there.
---
You, my friend, are a hero.
---
Better healers, power word shield and fortitude buff are all nice things. Shadow is arguably a way better pvp spec compared to balance. 
---
Most importantly: mind control :)
---
yea, but they kill him in TBC though, is he alive because they go back in time to stop him through Caverns of Time?
---
Streamers provide a great benefit to me. I get to watch them and more hype gets built around the game resulting in a better play experience upon release. It is in my (and your) best interest to defend them. Regarding millionaires, I don't care if they care how much I fight for them, if they are providing benefits to me then I should be defending them.
---
FUCKIN PAYO ofc
---
hopefully, compared to my experience in vanilla, the strategy will have some focus on keeping dps alive. We were told not to heal DPS, they ended up dying and the fights dragged on, burning more healer mana on tanks. hopefully the 'modern' internet's better latency will prevent tanks getting gibbed. this could reduce the number of people focusing on tanks, to spread the healing love on others.
---
Nope they took that away what a year or two ago?
---
Not min max unless you max!  Silly sentence.
---
It was a lot of fun grouping up and having friendly competition with other groups.
---
One group I'd made locked down one of the grel camps in the NE zone, and when I finished I told them to keep the group going as people joined and left. Maybe that party went on for an hour as people passed through, or maybe they all synced up and went on questing together. Either way, people socially creating order from the chaos is great.
---
Thanks for the link. I'm very excited for all these crazy differences. I was in the middle of deployment when the changes happened.
---
Just do wow 2.0 and start everything over with hindsight
---
Think though once you put the old armor on the new models it just looks smoother. The old models still have bad UVs/stretching and low resolution diffuse maps.
---
Classic gamers: "No one is a special snowflake, you have to EARN the right to be in a guild good enough to clear Naxx, don't expect people to hand it to you on a silver platter"  
---
Also Classic gamers: "Why didn't \*\*I\*\* get the invite!? I deserve SPECIAL treatment!"  
---
I think my favorite so far though is how a portion of the community has shifted from yelling "#nochanges!" to "I don't remember Classic being THIS easy, they should nerf it to replicate my experience when I was a kid!" and justifying their demands for changes based on their misguided rose tinted glasses memories.

How am I broken by life because I‚Äôm getting a 1-60 boost in a game ? Explain it to me please? I‚Äôm sure u have used or bought a boost in game it‚Äôs the same thing so your broken in life too hahaha...
---
Well they didn't in vanilla.
---
And then after Vael, your reward is the suppression room, which is where my guild struggled a lot too.
---
Also, I love the fact that Razorgore has so many interesting strats. The guild/raid leader I had came up with his own strat (tanks with boot speed enchant kiting melee mobs around the room, then separate groups spread out to kill casters) just for the hell of it.
---
The whole point of layering is to avoid creating lots of servers as a way to prevent this problem at launch. There will probably not be dozens of servers... because what they don't want is a million people playing this game on launch (cuz hype) and 100,000 people playing this game in 4 months (cuz hype dies) ... that's not good for server healthy.
---
Layering means they can launch with far fewer servers.
---
blizzards tech is so fucking shit
---
here is a crazy idea have 10 virtual servers on every server then merge them at the end of p1
---
players should have 0 control over layering it opens up the door to crap like ghosting 
---
sharding and cross realm tech is terrible because of several reasons but mostly because its so obvious
---
this tech sucks also for a number of reasons but the main one being because its so easy to manipulate 
---
the other massive problem is it really does not let more people roll on each server if they are turning it off, if servers are over pop numbers they can support when they turn off layering its going to be a terrible experience for players.
---
Weapon skills shouldnt effect the damage you deal, only the chance to hit/miss the target.
---
You'll have to excuse my mis-info, Its actually plate, Thanks @mrmeowsen for the link

It was changed from one of the best tanking chests to one of the best DPS chests in 1.10."
---
isnt he fucking promoting it, by playing it all the fucking time? you guys take shit way outta context. watch his stream for 10 min
---
You can barely call a Druid a healer next to Priest.
---
And 100 attacks later shit's still fucked. Uh oh.
---
But this is all speculation. I got into the stress test just fine and even stood right next to Asmongold for a brief period.  
---
I got lucky right? 
---
But if I'd have just turned on my ole Twitch machine and streamed it to 1 viewer you'd be saying I had streamer privilege.
---
As the other guy said, probably hunter. Never played vanilla but it feels like if your only goal would be gold farming and getting to 60 fast hunter sounds like the exact class for that.
---
Me. I want to play a gnome, not a fat dwarf.
---
Username checks out.
---
You're stupid as shit, "Honestly there is no reason to participate in the stress test because you wont be able to actually test anything." What the fuck did you think you were doing by trying to log in? You were stress testing the server. During the stress test. STRESS TEST.
---
Mage, they are wanted in almost all dungeons, they are the fastest lvlers in the game, you can sell your fucking lvl 55 water (which cannot be purchased from vendors, so if you have learned the recipe you can just AFK at the mailbox all day long and rack in cash), you can sell portals, you can solo farm dire-maul east mobs for the reagent thats needed for fire protection potion.
---
Mage is just overall the best fucking class in the game, without a doubt.
---
Hunter and mage, like you said.  Both can level very fast, and both can farm pretty well.
---
Doesn‚Äôt mean the subreddit should be flooded with them.  But like the other reply, I should expect nothing less.  Time to wait it out!
---
I'll admit some resentment at the experience. It was free QA work for Blizzard. I did my part in stressing, but simply couldn't participate due to offline/ locked/ timeout issues. It felt very arbitrary and I wish I could have had the fun of those memories made.
---
I'm not angry, but I've definitely cooled on the idea of participating in future beta/stress tests.
---
Can confirm. Make Azeroth Great Again has hit cap so many times. The lowby purges are fun.
---
This post not being the top post on the sub right now is disheartening. Hopefully it goes up now that it's more updated/filled out.
---
Layering was active. How do you people not get this.
---
**Layering will do nothing to alleviate starting zones.**
---
What you guys saw **was** Layering. Entire raid groups were moved to new layers. 
---
This is exactly how it was when they launched new servers in Vanilla. Which happened fairly often, especially during the first year.
---
Yes, it is.   
---
I think you should just remove the human kingdoms except stormwind. Alterac is gone, Stromgarde is gone, Lordaeron is gone, Gilneas is walled off
---
I play games to have fun and relax, and for a challenging game like Classic there's also the reward aspect of working hard and achieving something. Having something play the game for me/achieve those things for me gives me none of those things. All it would give me would be the ability to brag about what I appear to have accomplished, but that's the saddest thing of all - having no accomplishments of your own to brag about.
---
Ok lets shrink taurens to be size of a dwarf while we're at it
---
 Azelikh's quest on top the mountain in the Blasted Lands?
---
Yup...It is now 95 days too many....OP is an ass
---
Wait, arms and fury 25/25? I don't remember skill trees going up in increments of 5 per level
---
Blizzard said that the cavern of time event with archimonde, was purely to please the players. It has no connection to the story line, but merely a look into the past, so people could experience it.
---
Good for you buddy. Have fun being a dick elsewhere.
---
Cool man thanks
---

You said it was okay.
---
Just here to locate and upvote this comment xD
---

You may in fact be spot on my friend! Wish I could cancel the bug report :( Great catch though!
---
Sort of in the same boat myself. Leaning priest but I‚Äôll probably make both.
---
_**Piercing Howl Kiting Intensifies*_*
---
They killed him in Warcraft, before WoW was even a thing.
---
There really was no reason for the caverns of time thing in TBC other than "hey wouldnt it be cool to do the battle for Hyjal in WoW?"
---
Look at my earlier comments on the other thread goober, I've been making fun of Tips for claiming hes the best NA warrior all day
---
Razorgore was super easy alliance side but horde side it was a much more difficult task.
---
We don't have to agree. But I'm going to say this: Have you ever put French onion dip on a sandwich? That beats every other condiment.
---
Mana burn and offensive dispel are invaluable in pvp. The only offensive dispel your team will have beyond warlock felhunters on alliance. 
---
Druids don't have a good of a support kit because they can shift into bear/cat form. SO the way the game is designed they have the weakest kit in humanoid form. Yea they're really good in many weird scenarios but that has nothing to do with group play. Shifting into bear form costs a lot relative to just using your abilities in your one form.
---
PvE same problem. Druids are good hybrids but hybrids suck in trinity tab targeting MMO's
---
They look good until you realize you don't fit into any role and no one wants you unless it's niche. Like buffing a raid or carrying a flag.
---
Ya mage is also considered cuz of the strong AoE they have compared to all other classes, just trying to figure out if rogue is the smart choice for a first character when there is multiple stronger "first lvl 60" classes
---
I never said they didn't. I just said they don't look good on photos. Have you ever taken a photo of a CRT?
---
Am I the only one that remembers that "a smooth and fun launch" wasn't the vanilla WoW launch experience?  
---
It won't be the same without the peak-population disconnects and hour-long login queues...
---
Rez alone is nice to have.
---
Not at all, you can straight up shrink the model
---
I cleared it all in vanilla on both factions ? Which is the top 1% of the world for classic. And I will do it all again they are only leveling not clearing the raids or anything for me. So your post is invalid my boy
---
It's a common thing people have been reporting, so I'm sure you're not the only one. The stress test seems to be treating level 5's as level 60s for the purpose of quest rewards.
---
The sky is falling.
---
You are seriously talented. These look surprisingly good for being more of what I assume to be meme drawings. Spot on, almost looks like an In game screenshot. Keep them coming,I love seeing them!
---
Mhmm. Well you know, except that Blizzard has changed their minds a few times now. Remember just a week ago how sharding/layering was only supposed to be in the starting zones? So much for that.
---
If Blizzard truly believes that layering is the only solution to population issues, you can be they'll use it again for things like the Gate of Ahn'Qiraj event.
---
&gt;You're uninronically dumb
---
Let me ask you a question.  When you are responded to with posts, where the opening statement is to accuse you of being dumb or retarded, does that cause you to be more or less receptive, to the rest of what that poster has to say?
---
If I had to guess, the people with Beta access had a tag attached to their account that gave them priority in the algorithm and allowed them to get logged in.  Everyone else is just butthurt because they didn't get to play to level 5, BUT they did exactly what Blizz needed them to.  They put a large amount of stress on the login servers and the world servers, the number of people who are pissy as fuck because they didn't get to login and stand with 500 other people is unreal.  The sheer sense of entitlement that I have seen this past week is more than I have possibly ever seen.
---
Imagine unironically using the word Yikes.
---
Thats the cost of having the global pvp taunt that being a gnome gives you
---
Good thing you censored everybody‚Äôs names, because I was gonna go harass them for being in a Reddit screenshot.
---
If you wouldn't have tried to do it, then the stress test would have failed. Streamers should be 100% given priority because playing is their job. You're just being a bitch. I did not have beta access and I got in just fine.
---
Now you see why the rest of us have been playing the fuck out of private servers all these years :D
---
Mind control is good for when doin MC, u can mind control mob in ubrs and buff raid w fire resistüòÅ.  But u might lvl faster in the beginning w travel form on the druidü§î.
---
&gt; I would assume it's so that they can run as few servers as possible for Classic while still being able to support a vast amount of players
---
Basically this, but the reason for wanting to control the number of servers is not really related to hardware costs. Nowadays everything is 'virtualized' - a 'server' is likely a cluster of CPU's configured to handle the traffic for one realm. Blizzard should be able to add, or remove, CPU's from that cluster dynamically to handle the load.
---
Rather the desire to control server numbers has more to do with Blizzard anticipating an initial surge of players that then drops off over the next month, or months. If they bring up loads of different servers to handle the initial surge then 3 months they'll have a bunch of servers at 50% capacity. 
---
Then everyone starts complaining about how the game is dying and they never see anyone.
---
I don't think it was a learning issue. Did you see his [nameless king kill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42AARSvxyig)? You can't say that ending wasn't entertaining. The DS3 stream was just a community thing and him going through some hard times IRL, he talked about it.
---
Yeah, tbh I don't mind not being the FIRST lvl 60, so don't think of the leveling speed per say. I am just wondering what would help me get a better start on a rogue when that eventually comes
---
The guild im in on a p server just recently got 8/8 BWL and it was indeed a roller coaster.   Damn is it satisfying to be moving into AQ40, this post is super accurate.
---
Oh; I misunderstood what you meant in that case, my bad.
---
i member !! also i can confirm most of hunters did it ... HUNTER WEAPON !!!
---
Women are weaker, I see nothing wrong here.
---
TO ME, the old models are infinitely better, from animation to appearance. I started playing WoW in vanilla and new models look and feel horrible TO ME.
---
As I've said, it's all subjective.
---
Proof? I just made a warrior in stress test, started with a 2h sword...
---
Oh shit, I didn't know, I did it yesterday also, make sure not to do it again:p
---
I did the exact same, and will continue to do so till release. Good to shake the cobwebs off.
---
i will always bring a priest over a druid for 5mans, not being able to ress people is just cancer
---
&gt;shows some serious autism and knowledge about twinking
---
Why you gotta call him autistic before saying knowledgeable ?
---
Except you quite literally won't "do it all again", because you will have paid someone to do some of it for you. Nothing you accomplish will have been your accomplishment alone.
---
Never underestimate...
---
Meh, I don't really consider whining the same as toxicity.
---
1.12 dungeons now are a joke - almost retail like.  Compared to their older iterations.  I'm not saying the numbers are inaccurate.  So far Blizzard has responded to and verified everything except elite trash mob damage.  Boss damage seems ok.
---
If things remain the status quo,  LFM 39 BWL all classes.  lol.
---
Actually the stress test showed very much the opposite of that, but it's also just a test so I'm not putting much weight on it. We're just waiting for them to limit the sharding a bit more before launch.
---
Again again, layering is the exact same tech as sharding, just configured differently.
---
I don't just wanna farm gold per say, even though it's a quite important component that I need to consider, I am just thinking of how smart a rogue would be considering the insane amount of gear they need to actually be playing the top viable specs (talents). I did lvl a paladin back in vanilla in 2005, and that is never happening again
---
No, we‚Äôre talking about the Undead starting area here.
---
Or you're just to sensitive
---
Thanks. I had never seen this.
---
I was banned for botting 24/7.. for 3 days.
---
He's complete Trash not even worth mentioning. on my mage i would ezly r1 fb + wand him
---
Archimonde is killed in the last battle of WC3 Reign of Chaos, when he attacks Mount Hyjal and is destroyed by thousands of wisps suicidebombing him. In TBC you fight him in the Caverns of Time in which you travel back in time to exactly that mission and replay it; just this time the infinite dragonflight is fucking around.
---
lol not even. No one is going to min max at level 30 why would you. Being capped at 30 will not create any "min max" builds since no one is going to stay at 30. Get real
---
Thanks for the clarification and insight!
---
I've really been enjoying his stream. Dude is super hyped.
---
He was debating whether he wants to do his weekly classic cast or play wow classic. I think he's going to choose playing.
---
The vanilla experience missed obligations is real.
---
Rogue is one of the worst "first 60" characters, because they are weak lvlers (probably more punishing than warriors,  at least until like lvl 40), they are not that good at farming (no natural sustain, and wears full leather armor), no AoE. Not really that wanted in dungeons (sap takes you out of stealth unless you are sub specced).
---
They are good for pure DPS and PvP, but not really a good option if you want to hoard gold. Would rather farm gold on something else and then buy gear on your rogue while lvling as a second character.
---
I hope that one report is enough for each issue. Unfortunately I haven't gotten into beta so I can't continue the testing :(
---
Classic wow doesn't require more skill than retail. Don't be dumb. Do not confuse skill with tedium.
---
I doubt he was, I have never watched Quin play retail WoW, but I have watched him play PoE and variety, and he intentionally says a lot of stuff he doesn't mean to trigger chat. It's just banter.
---
In my experience AQ has always been the guild killer because that is when you really need to start farming comsumes and the first boss is pretty challenging.
---
If you led this question any more you‚Äôd have it by a leash with a collar around it.
---
Blood Fury has a 2 minute cool down but the healing debuff on self only lasts 25sec IIRC. Still quite a long time.
---
Can we ban streamer posts from this subreddit? It‚Äôs blatant monetary promotion.
---
Last time i played vanilla i had my own room, a computer i shared with my brother and a Nokia 3310i. Now i have a 3 room apartment, 2 kids and a girlfriends since 10 years, a car, one of the better phones and a decent computer.
---
We are all getting old üí™
---
I will have to check that out. TY :)
---
How is it rng?
---
One hits between 7-10.
---
The other one hits between 10-14. I saw one 9 from him.
---
They're varying by the same amount, so if it was rng, then they'd both have to have a possible variance of 8 dmg (which is absolutely absurd at that level) while also not hitting half of it in ~30 attacks.
---
 If it was Rng, the dude should go play the lottery.
---
True, but kinda bad way of making gold, hunter is in general the fastest class to lvl due to the no-friends-required side
---
I don't get why screenshots like this get upvoted when you could have seen this at any point in the past 10 years on a private server
---
Yeah, that's my feeling. I'm playing because I enjoy it, but I'm not grinding it, if that makes sense.
---
I agree. 
---
If a video game means so much to you that it alters your mood in a negative way just for not getting to play it early, you need to take a step back and look at yourself.  This sub has and always will be toxic as hell.
---
I think it‚Äôs stupid. Saying twitch chat things in places outside of twitch is like saying ‚ÄúLOL‚Äù in real life.
---
So we've been raiding northshire with another guild for like 2 hours...  
---
 https://twitter.com/michelin\_boi/status/1131661983734849536
---
Not necessarily when 1.12 dropped, but the state of 1.12 - everything that happened leading up to 1.12.  From 1.1 onwards.  Also, keep in mind not everything was documented.  I can count on 2 hands the number of ninja nerfs that happened to mages that were undocumented.
---
Horde are gross.
---
And sure they'll all be absolutely shocked when they get banned next time this subject comes up and blizz doesn't unban them.  They gave people one warning in the recent unban and stated that there will not be a second chance.
---
I understand the difference. I want them to also shard the starting zones.
---
Clearly he thinks that whatever stage Star Citizen is at currently is a game. It's got a decent amount to do now. I know it's easy to shit on it, people do it all the time. Would not say it's a beta though. The closest thing is a beta announced for next year for the Single Player.
---
Not private server experience I played Vanilla-WoTLK melee classes. It is obvious to me and many other people that the range is extremely off.
---
If I got beta I'd never touch BfA again. Literally playing on a stress test server was more fun for me.
---
&gt; despite trolls looking way cooler as shamans.
---
How can you beat the rippling wall of muscle chucking lightning around like he's a tesla coil? Orc Shaman is the most metal thing in the world! ‚Ä¶of Warcraft.
---
After a long trek to VoT and killing countless horde we saw this guy appear outta nowhere. Lv7 on stress test? Nope. He had sharded from Classic WoW Beta PvP. We also saw players from PvE
---
You lack the ability to think in the abstract.

* Fear

I'd say those are the main things.
---
&gt; Biggest fear I have so far is finding a friendly guild that raids and has a decent raid leader
---
Same. I dont care about repair costs or grinding mats or constantly learning and trying new strategies but I have a super low tolerance for insufferable assholes and with P. Servers and Retail it's going to be hard finding a guild where "Chill Semi-casual" is a thing and not some bullshit recruiting line.
---
Phases though
---
You‚Äôre adorable. Right, retail 1.12 was build on MaNGOS.
---
I Agree. It Was A Bit Much. But, It Got Some Attention Though!
---
Maybe, if you don‚Äôt know, you shouldn‚Äôt make statements like ‚Äúno it was never that easy‚Äù
---
If you don‚Äôt know for sure, you shouldn‚Äôt tell others they‚Äôre wrong.
---
I finally got in today and made a druid. I got really bored the second time I had run across the entire start area and fell asleep at the wheel.
---
I was downvoted simply for saying we as a community shouldn't bully people like this. 
---
I don't even watch the guys stream. 
---
He lost a duel, I'm so confused what the big deal is here? 
---
Yeah, I understand he and many other people in the public eye have said stupid things which the public react to accordingly. 
---
But come on, he lost a freaking duel in Beta classic. Who fucking cares. And more importantly why do these people want to ridicule this guy so much over it?
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
Nooooo why have you done this to me!
---
I'm doing a no heirloom run to prepare myself and to better see class changes
---
Yeah, Blizz seems to think that way for sure.
---
I used VSM before ServiceNow. If you can configure service now properly amazing.
---
In a way, retail wow is already dead for a long time.
---
I wouldn't say it requires more skill. The activity that requires the most skill isn't even in classic wow. It's just that classic wow is better.
---
Then why did you ask the question? If you know nobody has the answer? Things that make you go ü§î
---
How would you make sure it's not abused?  IE my party of friends + 1 pug, pug legitimately rolls N on an item he needs, I get mad because I lost the roll, so my friends and I report him as a ninja in your add-on.
---
I'd blow up my rig with my 12 gauge shotgun before I subscribed to BfA.  It's Classic or nothing.
---
Old school WC3 does sound pretty cool though!  I never played it and it sounds fun.
---
People will still log in to raid
---
Rogues are the best in vanilla. I keep saying it. No one understands that this isn't TBC, WotLK, or Draenor rogues. Rogues can LITERALLY 100% STUNLOCK YOU WHILE DPSING YOU for a MINUTE STRAIGHT. 60 SECONDS. Trinkets in vanilla don't even dispell stuns on most classes. The only hope is FAP and I'm pretty sure you cant use those while stunned.
---
Sure, but in my mind far more likely to preserve what is important about vanilla. I also believe Blizzard is capable of setting up a system in which it is very difficult to exploit dynamic spawns.
---
People see dynamic respawn as something like ND 5sec respawn time, that's not how it has to be. something like 1 minute respawn time is completely fine on a launch server and you can allow bigger layers rather than splitting everyone up into very small groups.
---
Why do people even think this? Private servers are pirated versions of a game we all love, and it hurts the developers. 
---
Besides, none of this would be possible without the Single Client tech, even if people rooted in Irvine if there wasn‚Äôt an economical approach Blizzard wouldn‚Äôt have even considered it.
---
its 1k
---
You sound very intelligent
---
I'm still watching his first stream from the day 1 Beta. Planning to watch them all in order to get the full journey. I'm ~5/11 hours in and even just listening to him complain about ears not dropping has me hyped to play!
---
Where is this?
---
Yah but what are you guys going to do after naxx?
---
Is WC3 enough to set up for Classic? What about the older games?
---
So basically cross realm gameplay like in retail, this is so poor.
---
Classic does not require any "skill", and that's completley fine that's how I like it.
---
100% mate
---
Dungeons won't be an issue with the first/second 60, I've done all the lower lvl dungeons and I just find them blend, considering I don't need an upgrade of course
---
Yeah, I just chilled in trade chat. Everybody spoke about a streamer who said this and that was wrong with classic. Nobody used personal experience. I feel classic attracts people who never played  vamilla, to see how it was.
---
Funny how I left my guild basically for the exact same reasons this week. That gossip and clique shit is still killing guilds to this day
---
No, dying only happens in the private server community.
---
Its going to vary on your profession and willingness to learn the economics of your server.
---
Oh okay then sounds good cheers boy
---
This is very relatable
---
um no? it happened before classic
---
Na they already new they were gonna unban them when it happened. They were getting rid of the other people doing the weird shit with the models. 
---
I don't use it cause I love the normal models. But blizzard isn't interested in it.
---
best NA warrior? For classic only you mean right
---
the CoT is in the past... thats the point of it
---
Isnt the first Picture even darker because of the rain? But i agree, i prefer the darker pictures aswell.
---
Hit lvl 60
---
Do you have proof that Leeway was not in Vanilla?
---
no key ring?
---
Mind telling me what activity you believe requires more skill ?
---
Now try and find a good other game. I been waiting 12 years and still aint found one.
---
He's not the best warrior for anything. It's a joke.
---
Ahhh I remember the days of waking up Saturday morning and wiping on razagore for 6 hours at a time, we actually really stuck this out I think we wipped on him for 2 months before the guild got trueley ancy
---
That's a low tier bait post :/
---
Yes, that's how layers work. It puts you together with people inviting you, otherwise it would make no sense. This still doesn't allow you to hop onto empty layers. It only allows you to hop to people you know and they can all be on full layers too. There's no proper way to completely abuse it, though there are individual situations were you can do so.
---
So you have maxed out sword &amp; defense skill while he hasn't.
---
Yet he is doing more damage and taking less from your hits.
---
This makes no sense, it would if it was the other way around.
---
Good find, report it.
---
90% of raiders won't come over. Their fun is in beating content, and vanilla content won't be a challenge.  
---
90% of arena players won't come over. There's no rewards to chase for pvp in vanilla, it's mainly who can get a group of 10+ people together that all have bis raid gear and max consumables/engineering. Skill is only a small part of success compared to modern where you can just be dedicated 2s/3s player and chase top ranks.  
---
Of course a lot will come to check it out and muck around in downtime, but it seems unlikely many will make it their main game if raiding/pvp is why they play BFA.
---
Barrens is like a standard respawn place when the game doesn't know where to respawn you.
---
Start duel with Sword/shield until initial stunlock is over, keep hamstring up. Fear into bandage. Probably a lot more. I'm no expert myself, but that's what I noticed.
---
Classic wow was literally made for casuals wth are you talking about
---
Is that not a pretty natural occurence? I mean, to start doing classic videos after it is announced.
---
Good to have some confirmation :). Do other people mind this "change"? It is a small thing, but it buggers me a lot. But indeed, if an addon can fix it, I don't care.
---
You wouldn't be afraid to say it, you got nothing to lose.
---
Rain ended up being a pain in the ass here and I didn't expect it to be the image that uploaded to be fair, I expected it to be the tauren one. 
---
All in all I found that every shot I took was darker in the vanilla client.
---
More than 3 raid spots.
---
Implementing layers was 100% more work then merging a few servers on the DB...
---
I'm starting to think the hugest demographic of classic will be people who didn't actually play WoW at release.
---
D: you cant say that word
---
yeah you're right I definitely shouldve put 2 and 2 together sooner
---
or waiting for a named mob to respawn
---
I mean, it's fine you're having fun. But just because you're having fun it doesn't mean it's not that bad. People are complaining for a good reasons most of the time.
---
Yes I'm still playing retail too because getting into the new MMO for 3 months doesn't seem worth it for me. However I'll be honest with you, altough BfA has a lot of content, I enjoyed even WoD more because of it's class design and PvP. I guess if you can get past BfA's idiotic class design and some stupid gameplay choices, yes it might be fun. Raids especially. But that's it, other than raids I can't anything good about BfA.
---
you reported as bug right?
---
This is how I remember it too. Vanilla vet, pretty hardcore pve person here. Vael wasn't called the guildbreaker for nothing.
---
But. 1.12 talents will change stuff. On a private server recently, had more trouble with Razorgore at first till we said fuck it, let's just kill the adds instead of kiting (totally doable with 1.12 talents and itemization). Vael was much easier. Course, their numbers may be off on private servers.
---
One time we wiped twice recently on Vael (shit happens after all). Thought our GM had quit he was so pissed. People take this crap too seriously. But, it does expose what's up like the op says; we kicked one fury warrior who was fucking shit up (pulling aggro, turning vael the wrong way), went smooth after that. 
---
Also, the suppression room can test your patience if it is a guilds first time through there.
---
I may be wrong but I thought race + gender impacts the starting attributes. Male Humans might have higher strength than Female Humans.
---
Yeah that was my understanding but thats also why i was concerned when i saw the level 24 on the stress test realm (server? idk anymore), but i guess thats normal? IDK. i figured since they were different character creation screens they were supposed to be seperate but what do i know
---
We've always been repressed
---
But we've always been the most skilled
---
He got his teeth fixed
---
you are trying too look outside a box that doesn't exist.  the current level cap will create no new builds or mix maxing, come down to earth
---
Definitely not
---
Does anyone have blood?
---
*no one responds*
---
*group clears mobs to get a blood*
---
Goes to bat boss, hunter, ‚Äúoh I had a blood in my bags‚Äù
---
Why don‚Äôt you just let everyone experience it themselves. This post is actually quite negative.
---
I'm looking for the same time as well. lemme know if you find one!
---
its cause they're capped on xp, so since they can't get XP they get gold
---
It‚Äôs the Legion lighting tech. Which I‚Äôm extremely grateful for them continuing to use. The lighting itself makes the game look so much better imo. Yes it‚Äôs brighter, but the lighting helps hide some of vanillas age.
---
im not sure if something like hand of rags fireball can trigger that talent but either way you will want to get natures guidence talent instead of that one. your not going to be getting many spell crits as enh and its only 9% for 10 seconds. instead of 3% hit which is huge and 3% spell hit which is also huge as you wont miss your shocks as much
---
Electrician here.  I've always been perturbed by how bright certain areas of the game are despite a complete lack of internal/ external lighting sources.  Inside many buildings and dungeons you can see perfectly when in fact it should be complete darkness (ex: wailing caverns/ deadmines/ any zone at night/ etc.).  I think it would help immersion and increase difficulty to have realistic lighting in these areas.  Any true classic veteran should be able to remember every pull and target mobs accordingly in complete darkness.
---
Lol they're really not. Just increasing spawn time by 30% when over 200 people in zone is dynamic respawns, good luck 'exploiting' that.
---
Im sure at least half of it is trolling.
---
Not gonna lie, I got a stress test at least, and even with level cap at lvl 5 it was more fun than anything I do in BfA these days. Maybe this sounds ridiculous, but I still play BfA unlike most of the people on this sub so I can compare.
---
WPvP wasn't a lagging mess like on retail, once we were defending Durotar, then Attacking Elwynn Forest. 40 man raids, literally almost no lags. Exploring old world, old Orgrimmar especially.
---
I can't wait until Classic.
---
How do you learn this power
---
You can watch them play.
---
They didn't specify what frequency or many details at all. I had read that, but all I really took from that was that they are adding something similar to spell batching.
---
How do you get into the beta? How do you know yo‚Äôre in? How does it work?
---
So instead of it being necessarily "gathering information rather than try to  break it" it would appear to be "gathering information while trying to break it." They were certainly pushing the limits by encouraging people to stay in one spot, only opening up one server (with layers) and dropping multiple raid bosses in. They may not have been going for a complete system crash, that's pretty much always an oh-shit scenario. But certainly you are trying to get the server to malfunction (break) by throwing that much at it intentionally, and then ramping that up even more.
---
&gt;pulls hogger
---
&gt;FLY YOU FOOLS
---
Not only do they have BIS the skill gap from 2004 and 2019 are insane.. the casual player is just better now a days then back then.
---
I remember this.
---
Then it was all nerfed into the ground in 1.11, and by 1.12 people were pugging BWL in 2006.
---
:^()))
---
Tips is a goober
---
What's the buff on him?
---
Active sub since wrath no beta, no stress test nada. Oh well. Total War Three kingdoms comes out today so I can just play that
---
&gt; The longer the failures go the worse it gets. Everything is usually okay until the try-hards start to get antsy. This is usually where most guilds had an identity crisis: are we going to cater to the try hards and potentially ostracize the casuals and risk them leaving? Or are we going to remain more laid back and risk having the try-hards leave the guild?
---
This is exactly why I think it's funny when people keep saying that you can join a casual guild that will bring players with unviable specs. Yes, you technically can, and you might even get carried through most/all of MC and Onyxia. But once you get stuck on a boss like Vael for a few weeks the "try-hard" clique of the guild will start pointing out the DPS below the tanks. Which inevitably leads to losing those tryhards or to losing those players with unviable specs (either respecing or not inviting them). Casual guilds will already have a harder time clearing content, why would they purposely make it even harder by bringing dead weight specs.
---
Are you actually gay or just using the word in a demeaning manner?
---
I CANT WAIT ANY LONGER
---
I had a Legion Beta Key and could've sold it for a similar amount, but instead I used it myself and played for like 1 hour, but stopped because I wanted to experience it on live.
---
Really big waste when I look back at it :/
---
In Vanilla there were routes to climb in without cheating
---
I felt the same way. It took me almost 2h to get to level 5 and it was a great feeling. Had a chat and a laugh with all people I grouped with.
---
&gt; Don't be a downer dude, just do it. Stop complaining.
---
You must‚Äôve forgot the premise of our discussion.
---
It doesn't hurt the developers if they don't have a released version of the same game which you can buy. Retail and vanilla are argubably so different that people will probably not enjoy both experiences, as retail has been changed so much its almost an entirely different game. How does it hurt the devs?
---
Psyched about the stress test, I want those servers working on release. Psyched about beta (though I probably wont participate in it) I want those bugs squashed. Indifferent to streamers, Its not my way of life. I don't feel the need to watch streams or lets plays ever so its just not a part of my life.
---
I'm sure there is a very vocal minority that is going to complain, its to be expected in all environments. Just remember there is an equal or larger portion of the community who are content.
---
What patch?  The issue with people's "feel" of the game depends on when they started.  Unfortunately, early on youtube was just starting up / hasn't been created and wasn't very popular yet.  All videos were downloaded.  So it is impossible to prove it.
---
But even if we were, Blizzard is sticking to 1.12 so it wouldn't have mattered.
---
To be fair, at level 5 you get so much silver because it's converting xp to money since you're at max level. You probably won't be getting 30 silver for delivering a stack of letters to dwarf #3 in Kharanos on release, since level 13 quests on the actual beta give 7 silver.
---
I didn't think I needed to add /s
---
That's not what spell batching means, I was suggesting a delay, spell batching in its original form means sometimes there is no delay, sometimes there is 200ms.
---
Skype logo used to be red?!
---
I mean. Only a UD is worthy of that set.
---
wasn't the stress test up to lvl 5? 30 silver seems to be a hyperbole.
---
No I'm lying to you.
---
Anyone who thinks a classic launch with no layering or sharding is possible is retarded.
---
millions of active subs ‚â† dead
---
holy fuck enough humans?
---
It didn‚Äôt use to be.
---
Asmon plays a character in his streams..u want how he really is watch his treehouse videos where he talks about irl things
---
He might be an Aussie. That word is used all the time.
---
Got the Classic itch?  Try Ascension.  It's a classic WoW mod with a couple different tweaks.  The most interesting is a server that only allows people to play with random abilities.  It's very fun and definitely will hold you over.
---
I like vanillas age. First thing I did was hit the classic button.
---
I thought i was done with the drama when i left r/wowservers, looks like i can squeeze in another couple months of popcorn
---
What's with everyone saying yikes now? Like everyone just became a 90's teenager overnight.
---
America is afraid of boobs. Everyone important has a dick /s
---
Hello darkness my old friend....

---
The problem with reddit is that you're all terribly sheltered by this sites stringent rules, or at least you come across as if some of you either live in a PC bubble or haven't experienced the rougher parts of life. Criticism is not toxicity. That's just a very lazy way of using a trendy buzzword to avoid addressing the arguments that are often made. You must live in a very wealthy suburbia if you think mean but often overly critical comments are toxic. Incel too is basically a get out of jail free card for avoiding addressing an argument as well at this point.
---
The majority here don't necessarily hate streamers (some extreme few do obviously) most of the criticism comes from the fact that certain streamers were part of the classic WoW hate crowd. It's a little obnoxious to see people that were shitting on classic wow only just "yesterday" or trying to ignorantly gatekeep the discussion (you think you do, but you don't) jumping on the bandwagon or at times seemingly carry more weight in the discussion than any other legitimate feedback. Occasionally I'll watch a streamer like Esfand or Asmongold because they're good fun to watch when I have down time. They also tend have their finger on the pulse.
---
Streamers in general though are obviously (nearly all) just in it for the money and their opinion flipflops depending on what'll help their wallet. You can't expect people to be overly fond of them in that regard and that's largely why. They are parasites.
---
Lower weapon skill increases the chance of a glancing blow.
---
They probably didn‚Äôt.
---
Yeah pretty much. I have a dual monitor setup and either have up Netflix or twitch while I'm dicking around in game.
---
Roleplayer LUL

Persona meaning putting on an act

I bet most people that thought that, didn't experience or don't remember. Error 34.
---
No one is mentioning the log diving to see where the fuck you wiped
---
Can I ask a silly question?   Who is Omar?
---
i think yes but 8 dont think its primarily about skill 
---
classic is slower and more rewarding you could gear 20 characters in retail in the time it takes to level 1 character in classic
---
will players ditch retail for classic?
---
um there is a pretty good chance
---
That was me.
---
Hard to max when level cap is 30. So theoretically its max
---
we are actually gay
---
Or watch his actual serious videos lol instead of judging him just by the stream. Every big streamer uses a persona.
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/NeighborlyOriginalPeachANELE
---
A streamer got stuck between classic beta and normal servers.
---
I totally get that. It's just not for me. Nothing wrong with enjoying it or not.
---
I had fun yesterday. 
---
I started logging in 5 minutes before the gates opened and over the course of the following two hours I would read reddit and the official forums to see all the self-entitled morons bitch and moan about how it wasn't fair.  I had a good time before I even got into the game.  
---
When I finally got into the game they were still filling the server with massive numbers and testing how many players they could safely fit on each "layer" while dropping Rag, C'Thuun and Onyxia on the players.  Omar even showed up as a larger than life Human warrior.  People were generally just jumping around and being social or screaming out random shit in general chat.
---
Once all that died down and they shut the servers down, lowered the player count until it stabilised and let it go.  I got a couple of characters to level five, grouped up with players from Greece, Australia, France, England, Germany.... it was great fun.
---
To the wilted, pathetic, self-entitled brats that complained the whole time. I hope you continue playing whatever game you play because classic would be far better off without you.
---
I just went back to bfa to get the rust off before classic comes out. For the life of me cannot figure out why they changed this. If I‚Äôm in an instance and talking to a friend at the same time it‚Äôs a nightmare to have to switch back to proper channels while tank is running around agroing
---
Lmao no, I was streaming me being stuck at the login screen for three friends.  All I'm saying is it's not unlikely that streamers were flagged to be able to log in with priority.
---
REEE IM STILL NOT IN THE FUCKING BETA AND DIDNT GET IN THE STRESS TEST EITHER REEEEEEEEEEE
---
mad jealous if you couldnt tell
---
Except everyone on the classic forums trying to explain how its so different lol
---
What ar√© you talking about ? Then we can finally play the game
---
sharding from classic alpha
---
That's a pserver
---
I understand the mindset of missing vanillas quirks l, game mechanics, etc. but I‚Äôll never understand people who miss how the game looked 15 years ago. Like the people complaining over the ability to have more grass. It makes the game so much better to look at.
---
Very interesting. Thank you mate, too bad u haven't got any horde data. Still very much appreciated
---
There will be no time for WC3: Reforged, not with classic available, friend.
---
Would have been real cool to be apart of this but you know... character creation timed out.
---
It makes business sense to prioritize paying customers, you already have a paying customer and you want to keep them.  It is easier to keep a paying customer than it is to acquire a new one.  Also who cares who gets Beta access, the people here are the biggest whiners I have ever seen.  Not you, just agreeing.
---
This is trolling yes?
---
The only thing i can think of is that the alpha servers are "layering" with the beta servers.
---
Good to know. I was lucky enough to get into the beta, was wondering what to do with my rogue to screw around with. Now I know.
---
Troll or dumb. Can‚Äôt tell.
---
The SERVER not the CLIENT... you're the adorable one XD Do you understand the difference between the two?
---
And I pay for it so it's my RIGHT to use it, I am a paying customer and they should be required to do what I tell them to! /s
---
Still remember killing Razorgore the first time and running outside in my yard and screaming I was so hype. That boss took my guild awhile and him/Chrom/nef were the only ones that gave us trouble in BWL.
---
Unfortunately I don't see any guild that can kill even a single mythic boss now wiping more than once to any boss in all of classic, but it will still be so much fun to go back and do it all again.
---
Its ll opinion based. You like it better. I like vanilla warts and all.
---
No old ironforge without wall jumping. Definitely wish that was part of the game again but obviously i understand why its not lol
---
Why not?
---
&gt; The lag must have all been redirected to the Beta server
---
People on competitive games like: LoL, DotA 2, RL CS:GO, act like children, but are above 20. It's quite depressing to see full grown adults act like children.
---
Quite literally anyone who disagreed with them for any point they disagreed with.
---
alpha comes before beta, more lika a closed beta layering with "less closed / streamer" beta ;)
---
are you saying we can't talk about bugs in the beta since it's to be expected?
---
I hate all these BIS posts
---
Thank you, I'll be okay. It's nice to find someone who I didn't turn away because I talk too much lol
---
My eyes are automatically scanning for Horde around the camp. 
---
Beta is a bit sparse though. There's only ever 2-3 people at Fargodeep mine in the evening, so far. Then again that wasn't under Beta launch circumstances, I started playing on Monday.
---
I'll have to ask mum lmao
---
I too think Tips is bad at the game.
---
How dumb can someone be seriously...
---
Layering is a good system for maintaining server population. If I had said sharding only, people would have said ‚Äúwhat about layering‚Äù.
---
I mean in this way
---

---
You see that PVE realms are labeled as normal? It was a sort of provocation of course :-)
---
Bruh lol, you literally said "There very very very few north american warriors that can duel on my level". They you get played hard and look like someone who hasn't touched warrior before. That's a yikes from me dawg.
---
That is gold.  I would have laughed so hard at that.  There are poor attempts at trolling, then Epic attempts, this would fall under the latter lol.
---
This has happened to me on stress test. Im on a layer with Beta server players. https://i.imgur.com/CEVcdd3.png
---
I can vouch (anecdotally) that number 1 is indeed correct but was also changed during vanillas life. My first character was a Nelf warrior I did the trek to dun morogh at lvl 6. I died and spirit rezed in loch Modan ez pz. 
---
Later in vanillas lifespan I was leveling one of many alts. I tried the same trick with reading at the bb spirit rezzer as ally. Was ported back to westfall where I died.
---
Yeah and get reported.
---
1 - This is behaving correctly. 
---
2 - Orcish is the "Horde" language, so all races get it immediately, similar to Human on Alliance side.

Wow pro? Kek

Ernie doesn‚Äôt like it when Burt hurts him either.

You seem to have forgotten that they kept adding new realms well into the release of Wrath.  A ton of new realms were added after the BWL World First - here's a [realm timeline](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline_of_the_creation_of_US_realms).  Some, like Garithos, were only open to transfers so would have had realm first shortly after creation, but most were just fresh realms and people would race to realm first all over again.  Some guilds even transferred to new servers just so they could get another shot at the AQ event.
---
lvl30 twink killing people leveling, okay.
---
Oh loard. I know it‚Äôs prob fine, but classic having anything to do with beta for ass a lot is making me stressed :[
---
Pleeeeeeze
---
I'm having PTSD from reading this. AQ40 sucked because some shit was straight broken, Twin Emps / C'Thun were huge offenders.
---
BWL had nothing to do with gear. It had to do with relationships. Often these relationships were smoothed out with a little patience and a lot of weed / alcohol.
---
No i really saw it in deathknell starting zone. Some of the early quests had rewards for 20 silvers.
---
He's barely played pservers.
---
He just makes content.
---
Any pro 'tips' you get from him take with a grain of salt because he's not a good player.
---
It doesn't matter, thread is gonna get deleted
---
Most of the strategy don‚Äôt love it for the skill. They love it for the community interaction, the feeling of power gain when you level up, and actually earning gear and how impactful even a green item is.
---
Like I want to play wow with a bunch of other Boomer millenials.  Screw that.  I'm gonna no-life this game like a Zoomer.  I'm still young, bitch!

You need 11 points enhance just to equip a 2h.

is that supposed to be a brag? public sector has some of the shittiest IT products, usually stick with legacy tech because they're cheap and hire shitty workers who can't adapt so keep doing everything the way they always have to the detriment of the state gov
---
I prefer the old forsaken faces.
---
How is that even a question?
---
It's a PVP server
---
Off the top of my head, he's the lead engineer for classic and was the one who built the prototype showing classic assets up and running in the modern client. Prior to that Blizz had made statements about the infeasibility of reviving the old code of Pre-BC.
---
Yes it is, one of the top rated comments here is "Tips is so fucking trash Jesus christ" 
---
From the clips I've seen, he has said "im the best" with mixed levels of seriousness, and people already give him some cheek for those comments.
---
But ridiculing the guy over losing duels? This is just getting to next levels of pettiness.
---
Cool gatekeeping bro.
---
If my memory serves me right, both WC3: Reign Of Chaos &amp; The Frozen Throne Expansion are pretty much the layout for WoW Vanilla, Burning Crusade and The Wrath of the Lich King. 
---
They stated in the old Vanilla interview that they essentially brought the WC3 content to life through what we have today as an MMO. 
---
Long story short, yes. It‚Äôs more than enough to give you plenty of information about the things you‚Äôll come across in Classic.
---
Fuck you op
---
Too many days!
---
That was probably from streamers skewing it since a lot of people went as humans to interact with GMs and streamers. They were spawning different bosses in that starting zone
---
I agree AQ40 killed a ton of guilds.  
---
My logic though was that to get to AQ40 you had to go through BWL, so most guilds that would have disbanded due to AQ40 frustrations would already have disbanded due to BWL failures.  Just by virtue of being before AQ40, BWL killed a lot more guilds because it had a lot more player volume.
---
Main point of my post was that BWL, IMO, often gets overlooked. Molten Core was the 'first' raid so everyone knows it and has memories. AQ40 is where a ton of raiding guilds got stuck so they remember that.  Naxx was always a mysterious raid to many people because so many people never got to try it.  As a result, I feel that BWL was the forgotten raid even though it played a massive part of Vanilla.  I definitely think BWL was the biggest PvE 'gatekeeper' raid and just wanted to point that out for possible discussion :)
---
I can't disregard that possibility. But the knowledge alone makes the players who ARE interested in getting better / maxing dps are going to be that much better. I was pretty good back in the day but i've learned a lot in the recent months. My gear was good, but probably not enough hit. My consumables were okay, but there was 2-3 more i could have used. That adds up! And now most players will know about it.
---
Plus these days with the mods and everything, it is easier to figure out whose sucking / not helping. Plus i really do believe the strong classes will be overpopulated, thus resulting in a better overall raid comp! But we will see, i hope i'm wrong.
---
3 weeks upon our guild starting BWL, with no other guilds on our server having yet done so. Is that really a hard concept? It was later in Vanilla, probably patch 1.10 or so, on a newer server (ie: not one that was launched at the start of the game).
---
That and most oce servers had pretty shitty communities
---
considering he has 1/4 stun resist chance, its honestly not that lucky to resist 2/4
---
Did we get any numbers on how the server actually did perform? Like how many were trying to get in throughout the test and how many the server was able to hold?
---
Help, help, we're being repressed!

It's the "vocal minority" problem. Say WoW has 4,000,000 players and they're all content and having a good time, you go to Forum X expecting to see a sample size of that 4,000,000 maybe rounded down to 4,000. 
---
But then you forget that the people who are content and/or busy aren't scouring the forums. So out of those 4,000 people, 2,000 are bitching. 
---
Now it looks like 50% of the community is trash, but in reality, it's only about 2,000 out of 4,000,000. 
---
Even high-voted and lowest posts are meaningless because 90% of Redditors don't even vote, and 90% of those that do, don't even comment. 
---
Reddit--at best--can only account for about 0.01% of any given population. If even that.
---
While that‚Äôs true for many, I won‚Äôt, even as a mythic raider I‚Äôm entirely dropping live to play exclusively classic, but I do know guild mates that will be logging in at least during raid nights. Still, there‚Äôs a huge base that doesn‚Äôt raid at all.
---
So if you die in Frostmane Hold in Dun Morogh you should spawn in Coldridge I believe from what you're saying.  
---
Blizzard at some point in their history protected back-spawning into starting zones. So while it might work in the above video, it doesn't work in the opposite direction. I expect to respawn in Coldridge based on proximity if I die in Frostmane Hold, but I actually spawned at Kharanos.
---
Jesus man, I know that. That's the joke.
---
here ya go, a freshly cooked downvote :D
---
Why should we have to do this? It should be implemented before shipping.
---
There was a guild on my RP-PvP server, &lt;Kul Tiras Marines&gt;, who had ready to go Tiarassian uniforms on some low level alts, and would head to Tiragarde and antagonize Horde levelers to fight them.
---
I dont know with this sub. 95% of the users here act very weird but think they are the only normal one here.
---
I think there is a lot of people here that think they are superior because they act like the right guy in that picture.
---
Also lots of young folks apparently.
---
im surprised how good level 30 twinks are tbh
---
The Paladin has an Alpha server tag by the way. So this is an issue with all the servers being on one cluster and not filtering out properly. People are seeing players from alpha and beta servers on the stress test server, ect.
---
I've played loads of ~10k launch pop p servers and let me tell you I despise it. It's not fun nor engaging to spam right-click on a boar spawn for half an hour just to complete one quest. The wow factor of all the players around you gets really old fast. I really wouldn't mind sharded starting zones for a week or so.
---
At least the game would be playable and not "run as far away as you can and skip quests to grind". 
---
Just my opinion though as someone who has played really high pop servers and couldn't wait for Classic with normal pop again.
---
I'm saying don't turn into panicky doomsayers because of bugs.  Too many people are taking what they see on beta as gospel as if it's already live.
---
You mean like this https://clips.twitch.tv/IronicCautiousRuffPupper
---
Tauren have their normal extra range PLUS Melee Leeway Range. This is NOT Classic Vanilla. This video is proof of the absurdity.
---
Same time of day?
---
I think it was just for this week ;)
---
Took me the first hour and a half trying to log and create a character over and over to finally get it working in the last 20 minutes. I was basically camping the login screen the whole time, as I assume many others were as well. Sorry mate :(

I don't even remember falling for Alt-F4, but I have fallen for Alt-W.

Well there is obviously a lot of theorycraft involved and personal preference. The better PVP hunters tend to lean into something like this:  [https://rankedboost.com/world-of-warcraft/classic-survival-hunter-build/](https://rankedboost.com/world-of-warcraft/classic-survival-hunter-build/) 
---
There are other top tier trees that focus more on group buffs and aoe damage. But for the skilled 1v1,1v2,1v3 scrims you deal with most of the time this is best. Reason being it has the highest mobility. Allowing a well macred and skilled hunter to cut through most players.
---

Blizzard's twitter poll had a 56/44 split in favor of Horde; 50k votes.
---
Not sure how accurate that polling is, but it doesn't look good for Alliance
---
Not sure about a 2015 but I ran it on my MacBook Pro 2016 and it ran perfectly fine, so I would think you‚Äôd be good
---
The guy who you respond to has no clue wtf he is talking about.
---
If you spec for a higher stealth level you can pickpocket farm BRD for a good amount of gold, gear is not a factor. Once you have gear you can invite 1-2 guild mates if the rare boss spawns for fiery weapon recipe which is a good chunk of bonus gold.
---
How much time would you say is required per week to raid in classic? Complete scrub here.
---
Yes and that's exactly how it works in the beta. Annoying as hell since you can't predict if you'll get a delay or not
---
I got mine shortly before Nam. Then I deployed.
---
Which is weird. I think the only good looking vanilla race on Alliance is Night Elf.

Just show them kill videos of Method when Naguura was part of it. Or just one of the high key runs she does basically daily.

The majority of guys like the one you mentioned usually haven't even touched any remotely challenging content in video games or even WoW. Guys like those probably don't go past MC either.

It would look more like goons owning all of Kalimdor.

Are you really that inept? MaNGOS was a third-party unofficial SERVER emulator project. The 1.12.1 CLIENT (the game engine, the thing you run on your computer that makes the fancy pixels dance), cannot be built by anyone except Blizzard. It also happens to be the thing that would be responsible for rendering the game, which it still happily does to this day in 2560x1440 on Windows 10 64bit with a GTX 1080 ti, despite having been built in 2006.
---
The one thing I noticed and had no actual answer for was:
---
I couldn't skin any wolf in Northshire. Rabbits and deers could be skinned, but not wolves in that region, which seems very weird to me. Considering you learn the professions in SW and rarely go back to NS, it's not weird that nobody noticed, but I had a big doubt on that one.

Anyone has an answer?

Do you seriously believe, that all the people that were on this sub 1 1/2 years ago played Vanilla when it was current? Dude, do you even know how the internet works?

This is a problem.

I prefer it with the glow.

My mum's toon was/is a NE :P

Uhm...layering IS lots of servers that eventually get merged
---
The movie butchered that story. There was plenty of conflict before the orc invasion. Sargeras lusted after the Well and tried to get it long before the invasion. Plenty of conflict between factions within the races, humans especially.

Thats why im going Druid, more loot for me!

Imagine not playing both at the same time.

Does walljumping up to the airfield still work in classic?

Accurate

Assuming that people with beta  access were more likely to be able to connect (which I haven't seen proof of), it might have been something as simple as beta testers having already downloaded and cached some data from the beta that is required for connecting/character creation while people with only stress test access were all fighting to get that information from the same overloaded server.
---
Great to hear, I'm looking forward to it!
---
Intimidating shout costs a whopping 25 rage. If you look carefully, at no point in the video did he ever get 25 rage. He could not have used Blood Rage to get more rage since he used it in the beginning to get the intercept, which in my opinion is a valid use (he appears to not be playing Tactical Mastery).
---
I agree with you on the sword/shield though.
---
Considering you need 2 in a 40 raid.
---
Seems sharding or something is taking effect. Was watching a stream earlier and a Stress Test level 5 player was on a zeplin with the BETA players. They couldnt speak to him but were able to send him whispers. 
---
Could be blizz experimenting with cross realm layers but I think this is just a glitch.
---
Girl? In wow? I call photoshop!
---
don‚Äôt say problem, you‚Äôll awake the valiant gatekeepers of this sub
---
thats not how dynamic respawn time works.

It's more about people disliking how arrogant Tips is. Unless you forgot that Perp is also a streamer lmao.

They probably read the description about warrior class on character creation, that warriors are "the best class for the beginner".

Combat rez ?
---
Right, which is exactly what I said - you played on some backwater server launched months after bwl had been beat.  So your "bwl was easy schtick" is totally irrelevant
---
yes, they could cap the exploitableness of dynamic respawn (like hardcap it so it cant be under 2 min), but so can layering (inviting players need to be nearby, cooldown etc)
---
If game is in beta, then why on earth is there still alpha version players in the game?
---
it is
---
hes right though
---
Eh, this map is cool but kinda leaves out that a large chunk of Lordaeron is controlled by the Forsaken (Tirisfal and Silverpine).
---
You can also invite someone that came online recently from your guild or friendlist to a group to get into the 'freshest' layer. But yea, prepare to get downvoted and obliterated by the blizzard dicksucking crew. Phase 1 only btw.
---
You signed up for the stress test. Idk what you expected
---
Yep managed to do it just now on the Stress test realm, there's surprisingly a lot of scripted events up here with a battle against Mountaineers and Frostmane trolls as well.
---
Your post really evokes some memories and was a great read m8. Appreciate it &lt;3
---
ahh! That‚Äôs awesome! Did you make it to Org?
---
That's my thoughts, and of course exclude certain mobs from dynamic respawns, as in the sort of mobs that people would want to exploit dynamic respawns for (Devilsaur anyone?).
---
More than likely, they just haven't properly removed the cross-realm support and this is a bug they'll fix. Remember, layering is still just a subset of sharding.
---
I can't watch survivor anymore. My favorite thing about the show was the challenges and how creative they used to be. Now it's run to this spot to get puzzle pieces and make a puzzle. Or they try to add some bamboozle and make you swim to it instead.

I remember in I wanna say wotlk I was chatting with a dude in a dungeon about WC3 and he says "yeah remember when u controlled onyxia and beat up a bunch of guys".. I wonder if he was lying about playing WC3 or if it was some sort of mod. Maybe someone out there knows.
---
deam 4 resists and cant do shit about being kited to asia ... painful to watch
---
In my experience it was Princess Huhuran that mercilessly destroyed guilds.
---
But really, if you get to the core of it, it tended to be guilds being in over their head.  I was in guilds who fell apart in ZG and guilds who failed in Naxx.  The common theme was always that they were trying to do content their raid was not geared for.
---
What are the pros and cons to each?
---
&gt; you can allow bigger layers rather than splitting everyone up into very small groups.
---
layer size is \~3k, there wont be "small groups" except for a few min when a new layer is opened.  
---
&gt; that's not how it has to be 
---
layering can be made harder to exploit aswell (cooldown, party leaders have to be nearby in order to switch etc)
---
Hi, world ranked druid raid healer from vanilla to cata here. In vanilla a Priest 95% of the time will blow you numbers out of the water so the name of the game isn't to be the meter topper. That will belong to Priests and Paladins most of the time. The joy of druid healing comes in filling the gaps in the healings left by the Pally(shamen) and the Priest.  You will mostly rely on Rank 4 HT and Rejuv, sprinkling in higher ranks of HT and Regrowth for big d\*ck damage hits. You also end up being close to the mages/ s priest as innervate is important. You also have B res and roots which allows you to cheese certain encounters. It's not for everyone, especially min maxers, but it's a great class.
---
Right, so his " BWL was easy" is meaningless because he beat it months after it had already been cleared and figured out
---
The reason you play an MMORPG is to enjoy the world with others. 
---
The way you enjoy the world with others is to group up. 
---
A reason to group up is to help tag mobs that others are killing because it may be over crowded. 
---
That group could end up questing for hours and potentially become friends. 
---
Those friends could end up creating a guild. 
---
And that guild could potentially become a very successful raiding guild. 
---
If you remove reasons for people to group up, like dynamic respawning creating enough mobs for solo gameplay, you remove a bit of the MMO from MMORPG. 
---
I feel like the overwhelming amount of votes in favor for dynamic respawning are trolls. 
---
I cant believe we are still having #nochanges debates a year and a half after announcement and 90 days before release.

Eh I‚Äôm a relic. To me you make your product first, finished state, then you sell it.

It's either layering or dozens of near dead servers in 2-3 months. Seems like a fair compromise.

Asmongold just cleared SM Library and looted the scarlet key. He did not get a keyring. The ring was put in his inventory. This was the old Vanilla system of having to have all the keys in your bag, before they added the key ring. They either have not added the key ring, or are choosing to keep the old pre key ring system.

I know this is a month old but I‚Äôm in the classic rabbit hole rn lol! Just wanted to say I was a kid when the game came out but my dad played in beta and day one release. I watched him all day every day he played and I was there on launch. The night elf starter zone was FLOODED with people. Getting spiders in the cave was so difficult. Not to mention in the town over there was a guy who had to do some Rp and plant a seed while talking to you. He had to complete the Rp entirely before the next person could click. There were hundreds if not thousands of people clicking that guy for hours and hours. The vanilla launch was nothing short of a nightmare that was so cool to witness. Didn‚Äôt mean to say this out of spite just thought I‚Äôd share a first person experience with you! See you in classic, friend!! Also op is a jack ass.
---
Quick update. I went Stormwind (i'm elf), completed a quest there that gave me 75 Stormwind rep, and it also gave me 18 rep points in other factions :) so maybe it something about quests of your own faction
---
I'm sure there's lots, like us, that feel this way. I think we'll be fine.. I think the isolated servers that foster communities would be a benefit.
---
Either way, I quit right after BC release having done all the content so I'm really excited for the nostalgia regardless!
---
Intellectual Property Laws in the United States. Basically every time there‚Äôs a private server, Blizzard is required to pay lawyers to investigate and go after it. This effort can be very expensive, and hurt the company‚Äôs profit margins which in turn can effect stuff like CMs who get laid off. 
---
If Blizzard chose not to lawyer up, other companies could steal their IP and compete for real, and then use the argument ‚ÄúIf it was intellectual property, Blizzard would‚Äôve defended it‚Äù, and steal their legitimate work. 
---
It‚Äôs not something a lot of people realize about piracy in the US, everyone assumes it‚Äôs lost sales because it‚Äôs the popular misconception, but a huge part of what piracy does that‚Äôs damaging is required lawyer fees to retain IP.
---
We did! Killed Horde outside Org then went to the starting zone and it was a lot of fun. Really looking forward to classic!
---
Lol this is amazing
---
whose judging? I love acting. I watch movies all the time.
---
True, sword and shield would have reduced a lot of damage in the opener. However, if I'm not mistaken it costs a global to switch weapons, and when you're only getting a few globals before you get kited into deadzone, it does make me wonder if it's even worth it to reequip it.
---
For intimidating shout, yeah, there was one point near the end when he was low life when he had enough rage (25) for an intimidating shout, but then he went for a heroic strike which seemed pretty bad.
---
No, you actually can't.

Did they fix the Dun Moro bug in Ironforge to where you could duel each other behind the pillar, fight, run to the shop, fear and get sent to Old IF?

a 48 mounted paladin was spoted from alpha realm today by monkeynews though :3

Sharding/layering HAS to exist for the launch of classic in some form. If they launch it with out any sharding/layering tech the only ‚Äúclassic experience‚Äù you‚Äôll be having is the inability to connect to the servers and play for 2 weeks.
---
Whether they will like it or not.
---
I'm mostly just looking forward to proving all the naysayers wrong.

"Classic WoW is dumb i cant wait when ppl realize that they are only being nostalgic"

"Rose Tinted goggles!"

"Classic is gonna fail so hard"

Hmm i didnt notice where i said any of that. my bad, though you do sound like a hateful idiot.

one is bright.

the second one, on the other hand, is not.

 Exceptions, they say? Hmm...

apparently they try to make guildies go into the same layer though but okay

Man, I think I want to make a Tauren warrior now and name him Bigmad because, well, larger hitbox = big, uses rage = mad.

Thanks for the inspiration!

Dr. Reddit demands 10,000 duels. It's the only way to be sure. Trust him. He has a doctorate in everything.

I really hope Blizzard fixes this. I knew the lighting looked completely wrong in classic.
---
ah yeah thats true, forgot about that
---
Lol actually caring about the mudhouse faction
---
Why would one be an improvement of the other?
---
Yea good advice on here. Im a vet. I plan on returning and still find myself lost but i played all the way up till pandas. Just play how u feel for the time being. Dont worry about what everyone else is doing. Ull meet cool people that will teach u along the way too. Seems overwhelming sometimes but we all felt like that at some point. Id say around 30 put a little time in checking out what ur class ur playing, how u should rotate spells for more damage, and things to avoid from other classes. Gonna be a long journey and i hope u have fun doing it. Research professions now so u understand. Its simple concept but good to know about rare recipes u can benefit from. Lots to say. But youtubes a descent source. P.s there used to be a guide book for vanilla. Would be a good pickup for getting started. Just bough one myself from ebay for .99 cent.
---
Nice! Stress testing has been a super fun experience. I hope the live servers will be just as fun
---
Awesome write up, looking forward to more. 
---
I was one of the founding members of a Horde Guild on Destromath (Eternal Bloodshed). We started as a leveling guild, and eventually transitioned into a small raiding guild. We eventually got ZG on farm status, but didn't have the people for MC. At the time, the top horde guild on my server was just a few bosses into BWL. We did a few joint guild runs with other guilds to try and progress MC. We never made it far, but it was fun.
---
Then Blizzard enabled server transfers. An entire guild from a different server transferred in, cleared BWL server first, and proceeded to farm it until they opened the gates of AQ. It was horrible, they totally destroyed our server. All the existing raid guids before the transfer fell apart, everyone just joined the alternate guild for the good one that transferred over.
---
I thought I had settled on troll for my shaman, now I'm not sure again!
---
Well hopefully this kind of stuff is what they are testing for.  Did you report it in game?
---
I mean that and you're gonna walk in there with very few people having 5 fps or doing their 1st or 2nd raid.
---
no you don't. Take a statistics course.
---
Might as well add LFR while we are at it
---
its crazy that they seem to play together so much. Esfand is like the polar opposite of asmon
---
Yea, you can abuse the system to get into empty zones constantly.
---
This is actually really interesting, and not just because of the photo.  
---
  Remember on the panels they said they're basically mixing up 2 different clients, so they end up with clashed assets and a mess on the maps.  
---
  The fact that hyjal seems to be fine could indicate that they fixed it here, possibly indicating they're thinking of using it already.
---
another guy who dont understandd statistics.
---
Obviously.  Just pointing out that it wasn't impressive.
---
Yeah they are legit feared on server that should not be named, i'm just staying away from whatever server they roll on.
---
I think the point he was trying to make is that there's a lot of discrepancy between their gear/HP and esfand's, so much so in fact that this video, that was made for the some purpose of trying to paint esfand as a good pvper, is basically worthless. In which case he'd be pretty spot on
---
Find more pages!
---
yeah i explained word for word what i did in bug report.
---
Yeah I literally dont understand at all what these people are salty about. Not being able to play the renowned stress-test content?
---
Just fucking stress test, keep smashing that connect button and quit talking shit about it on reddit, fuck this community jesus christ
---
McBadguy, my coworker and I would just yell "EYEBEAMS" at each other when we were fucking around.... good ol Lan center.
---
Your joking right? They were testing.
---
You‚Äôre not gonna see the rogues ;)
---
Not how that works. /who isn't limited to elwynn. There's as many hunters as there are rogues.
---
Fucking cone heads man.
---
Oh god..
---
I dont know why everyone stops playing when Naxx is clear. I know its a repetitive grind and a huge consumable sink but the raid is fun.
---
No idea, probably just busy.
---
Maybe after a while I'll change my mind, but I love the new breath of life the glow adds to Classic when compared to private servers. Still, cool to know you can toggle it. Thanks!
---
\|Pyromaniac
---
That'll be a nice addition to my hats
---
i wouldn't call that much better healers, just different healer.
---
I played druid in vanilla, I would play druid again if I wanted to play an healer:
---
\- you will end up top healer (and top over heal)
---
\- it's fun, you put HoT on everyone on the raid that is less than 80% HP
---
\- you can heal while moving.
---
\- you can instant huge heal (with a cooldown),
---
\- you can combat rez,
---
\- you just need to work on +SP, and spam rank 3 healing touch. 0.5s  cast heal that cost almost no mana.
---
Now your druid cannot resurrect ? Well, keep your people alive.
---
I mean its kind self evident, you can prob see stuff better when its brighter, and your eyes dont bleed as much on the darker one, which looks more normal/natural.
---
Obviously only a fraction of those invites are utilized.
---
I'd argue that LFR is completely unrelated. LFR changes the literal gameplay experience. I'm talking about visual changes only.
---
Left side pserver.  Be honest.
---
I see your point, and I can understand looking at the process happening here with that perspective, but at the same time this:
---
&gt;make your product first, finished state, then you sell it
---
Is exactly what you get if you wait till august and then sub to play classic. Everything else, like the demo, the beta (which is like 10% test 90% hype), is just an optional extra, and to me I don't see anything wrong with making and selling those if you want to. 'You', as a "relic" who wants to be sold only a finished product, and then buy only a finished product, lose nothing for blizz releasing what they have and letting others pay to (sometimes maybe) play it.
---
im guessing hes a streamer...... he seems cringeworthy.
---
This is a really cool take on the map. Nice work.
---
Eh rogues are very average in 1.12. Rogues are great when nobody has gear, but they get outscaled eventually. The world of roguecraft movies are not from 1.12, they are from earlier patches before rogues got nerfed a little and other classes got massively buffed.
---
Ask anyone Tips is one of the best NA duelers tho!

This is all it‚Äôs going to be now. Problem in the beta? Worlds on fire game is shit

Or broken.  Whatever makes it like Vanilla.

It's not a bug issue or anything, but I'm just really bummed they decided not to allow /sit crits to count for reckoning and enrage. I always liked that sneaky strat of having a sit macro on your bars.

Shhhhhhh...
---
We have over 650 members and rising!
---
people apparently believing in blizzard planning to implement crossrealm-sharding-layering despite them opposing it in EVERY FUCKING INTERVIEW
---
Rogues really aren't that amazing in 1.12, especially around BWL levels of gear and above.
---
&gt;Also I feel like in Classic you won't have the people who only log on for 5 or 6 hours a week to raid, cause so much more investment is required to raid,
---
Man Im completely torn by this because I'm looking forward to Classic, and I want to try to do more raiding in Classic than I did in Vanilla, but this just pretty much describes me. Running the same ten or so dungeons over and over again for gear loses my interest after awhile, happens to me every expac. For BFA I fell in with a good crowd of people with a strong positive attitude about raiding, so I logged in for the two three hour sessions each week to push progression, but there's only so much I can keep going at doing the same content and same fights over and over and over. I also share the household with family that can go all day without needing anything, then suddenly five minutes from raid time suddenly I have to drop what I'm doing for them, but that's a whole other aggravation.

Can I use the bright with sunglasses and get both benefits?

Welcome to Paladin.

Only thing is, that Census+ always gathers data from the whole faction and not just a zone...
---
Yeah I remember that was in patch 1.10 for the wall-through and it was fixed later
---
Model Changing... I liked this a lot for doing myself a Housing, changing textures, models, creating my own zones in the game and be able to visit it on live with other players
---
not a glitch. level cap is 5. he is max level. max levels get increased monetary reward for lack of experience rewards...since they are max level.
---
Others have already said but I can only repeat what I've already written in the post: graphics is not dependent on the server in this case. It's a screenshot from the official Blizzard Vanilla 1.12.1 client (wow.exe). I couldn't find an original screenshot in an inn but it looked exactly like this in 2006.
---
There's no DirectX 12 in Classic Beta and it's enabled in BfA build.
---
Did you account for weapon skill?
---
Layering is supposed to be server specific.  That shouldn‚Äôt happen and hopefully won‚Äôt on release.  This is one of the many reasons we needed a beta and stress tests
---
Census+ takes data for the whole faction.
---
Or people can just patiently wait in a queue, but I understand that some people want instant gratification, so there's no that that'll fly. I always figured server merging was the best solution. It isn't perfect either, but at least it won't ruin the first few weeks of the game.
---
They've already covered hitboxes and melee range for Taruen in their blue posts.
---
Not a big deal, but if you're playing a Tauren when you interact with Tauren NPC's you can do so further than the mouse over cursor interaction indicates. IE: If the cursor is greyed out you can still interact.
---
Headschuhe
---
It is still possible ;)
---
Models and such are player only, they do not have any impact on the game or other people. If someone wants to play with higher resolution graphics then so be it.
---
You have to remember we're also playing on much higher resolution monitors so it looks worse than what it did back then if you're still using the classic settings.

Browse new on the subreddit and you will see how really really dumb many people are regardless how many you explain them basic concepts...

---
Were? I'm in the game right now, looking at people from the other faction in a contested zone... who I can't attack because they're on a PVE SERVER!  
---
Are we serious?
---
Well its very simple to explain. Difference is that Layering effect is worldwide, not just zone wide like sharding.
---
I got into the stress test and my sub finished yesterday but idk about the beta.
---
OP definitely agrees with Sylvanas covering her belly... probably also thinks Overwatch was "groundbreaking".
---
In case you don't get it, I'm ironically pointing out how overtly political and stupid these threads are. Everyone knows what "toxic" is supposed to imply. Fairly obvious dog whistle. But then again, you people seem to thrive on joining communities and making them unpleasant for the original members, so, par for the course.
---
Us "toxic" people are likely the only reason you are getting this game. Because this community was peacefully "toxic" for 10+ years until this game was finally announced to make money from us. You should be on your knees thanking us OP. Instead of making these stupid toxic threads.
---
The whole point of a game is to waste time.  Don't play it if it doesn't seem compelling.
---
The default lighting should be exactly the same as it was in vanilla.
---
I was just trying to get rid of this on Classic. Thanks!
---
As someone who's played since Vanilla I was gonna spend some time refuting some of this stuff, but my best advice is just give it a try. There's no guarantee you'll like it but there's also literally no downside to trying it out. The game is paced very differently than modern WoW and I think you'll be able to find a lot of enjoyment both in the journey and at the endgame.
---
Don't be fooled by the apparent simplicity of the gameplay either - there's a lot that goes through your mind in a pve or pvp encounter and it's a very different experience once again than retail. The fact that you have more buttons to press more frequently in retail doesn't make it more complex.
---
&gt;  feel like in Classic you won't have the people who only log on for 5 or 6 hours a week to raid, cause so much more investment is required to raid
---
heh wait till you get the people that have been in the guild since the beginning and are so farmed out they only need 1 piece of gear in BWL, so they only log on for raids.  then they dont get that piece of gear because some noob saved up all their DKP from zg runs that the veteran doesnt go on anymore because hes done it for months/couldn't go because there wasn't room and he/she didnt need any gear.
---
those situations are fun when raid/guild leading, let me tell ya.  especially when its chromagg/nef gear.
---
Put yourself in his shoes. Everyone is saying you're trash because you lost to an undergeared rogue, you should have won because you have BIS gear (which he apparently doesn't), you suck at this game, when in reality you played fine for the most part and just because of the talent situation (which isn't totally obvious to your average twitch viewer) you lost. You'd be okay with those posts getting having a bunch of upvotes?
---
Enlighten us, else gtfo
---
It's a fucking beta / stress test.
---
Man, World of Logs was so great when trying to pin down who kept fucking up the harder WOTLK raid encounters like 3 drakes.
---
It's hard to predict when they lettering will happen. Each continent is in it's own layer. You can predict peak hours though. Perhaps farm black lotus or whatever an hour before and an hour after peak time.
---
you can learn to use staves on warriors at woo ping in stormwind not sure why hoggers staff isnt bis on here
---
I died every 40 yards from Gadget to the CoT mountain....so yes
---
40 yards is 36.58 meters
---
To give you a simplistic answer ~ 
---
The game was in it‚Äôs most simple form. It focused on a couple key aspects - community, a sense of reward, and progression. The game is a little harder, but if you take the time to progress and get better, the reward is so much better. 
---
It is about the journey, but the game really starts at 60. It‚Äôs one of those things where you have to play to fully understand. I have recommended it to all my coworkers who didn‚Äôt get the chance to play it first time around, and they are excited just like you.
---
That is only during this beta. They only have one server online so they are all squashed together.

Maybe the one which is nearest to you for the best latency?
---
Welp, now I know the first thing i'm gonna do, once I get to play the game. Ty for sharing this.
---
lol, now I remember the terrible FPS issues.
---
I remember that for a lot of flashy fights the healers had to have their cameras in first person view looking at the floor to get decent FPS and basically heal through the UI.
---
Don't be so butthurt, that's not gatekeeping lol. It's perspective.
---
Are you able to join the servers? I'm on the F&amp;F list and can see the beta as well but that's cause I was in the stress test. The servers aren't showing for me yet on the realn list though.
---
Hey man, get the rumour out there yourself and one day you'll hear people tell you how good they think you are. Tldr: make a lot of noice and ppl believe you.
---
Always funny watching a Warrior RP walk towards someone while out of combat.
---
Who gives a fuck?
---
Not until level 10
---
Play it when it's out. It's included with your retail sub.
---
You'll die when you try to pull multiple mobs and you'll be forced to use your brain instead of face rolling everything. You're an average adventurer in Classic, not the Champion of Azeroth.

I just got my fianc√© into world of Warcraft. Although not the best parring for efficiency purposes, I rolled a prot warrior and she rolled a frost mage. We leveled exclusively through dungeons to get her accustomed to group content. 
---
Took awhile to be sure, but she picked up the mechanics easy enough, and really enjoyed handing out food and water every run.
---
Great write up dude. Fortunately Vael didnt break or disband my guild at the time, though it did make some players quit...lol
---
Wasnt the hardest raid then though obvioudly, that honor (imo) was Vanilla Naxx, though an argument can be made for AQ40 as well. You couldn't even do Naxx without AQ gear and many AQ cleared/fully geared guilds still had their struggles.
---
People like YOU ruin games.
---
exactly! how will you know someone is using new vs old player models? you won‚Äôt. it literally has no impact on your own visuals if someone has the option for this
---
I scroll all my characters out to max view distance because of the shear amount of visual data you can receive. I barely even notice my characters model. That me personally and if you play up close with your toon (ie 3rd person over the shoulder) I can see how this affects you!
---
I stress tested the fuck out of the character creation screen lol
---
Logged in a lot over the course of the stress test and got to it twice only to time out.
---
Did they confirm that? 
---
If it's so, then like I said, it's just forcing people to use 3rd party stuff to LFG.
---
eu playing on na is stupid

Not butthurt. Just calling out gatekeeping when I see it. Don‚Äôt like it? Don‚Äôt be a gatekeeper.

What's up?  Why are you so angry?

They initially banned the people making the model mods and then unbanned them. It's still against the ToS and if detected again will result in another ban.

Fuck you guy

Except I'll be playing a (B)OOMkin.

He aint a dick rider you just paranoid and an asshole.

Thank you. I am. I'm just happy  I got to experience all of this. :)

For the love of God please vaccinate your children.

how is he lvl 46

I'm not sure how this hasn't been mentioned yet, but dynamic spawning **WAS ON** and still is during the stress test. Those mobs should have a 5-6min respawn and they are spawning in under 2. I cleared 12 boars in the gnome starting area in 7 minutes, 5+ competitors. The spot I was at had 9 spawn points in range.
---
How do you know it‚Äôs bullshit? It‚Äôs entirely possible that beta accounts were given priority over stress test accounts. They never made it public.

It‚Äôs also possible that they let a few random stress test accounts in just so that they could say it wasn‚Äôt entirely rigged.

That makes sense. I was wondering how lv5s got in, I always thought you needed a mount to do it.
---
Nothing about classic is exactly the same as vanilla
---
lol!  and every PvE'er wanted to duel you outside the instance during downtime just to size you up in PvP lol.
---
Many players, including myself, regards classic so highly mostly due to nostalgia. Although it is much deeper than just that. It‚Äôs really what you make of the game and how you want to play it. You can go balls deep with PVE, PVP, professions, leveling, etc.  BFAs progress is too shallow and set in a tunnel vision for you. Classic allows you to experience any aspect of the game with a broader sense of progression and reward. 
---
Oh yea, also the community aspect of the game. Don‚Äôt expect to not make friends by level 10. You can‚Äôt top that experience. 
---
You have a rare opportunity to experience the unchanged world first hand for this first time and no doubly most of us are envious of you. Don‚Äôt waste that opportunity with the mindset that you‚Äôll just quit after two months! I hope you enjoy your experience and it‚Äôs as joyful as most of ours when Classic was around!
---
Shut up you muppet
---
thats good, do you have a source? :)  thanks
---
The journey from 1-30 is so smooth compared to 30-40 that I feel like even the people in the closed beta right now will be surprised at how much effort it takes.
---
I recently rescued my account in anticipation of classic. Naturally I tried to get back with my old chars from Legion. I have *no* idea what to do when I logged. The state of the current game is a far cry from the original - and so much worse off for it imo.
---
Wait for classic or try a private server if you want to dip a toe. 
---
Retail is not a game I want to actively play or recommend.
---
np man
---
Not a follower of yours, but yeah the people in this thread are being ridiculous. Your explanation of why you have a shit talent build does put things into perspective honestly. And the average twitch viewer probably doesn't realize how big of a difference TM could make in a duel like that, or they didn't even notice that you didn't have it, or whatever. 
---
The only thing I can really say is that you probably should have used intimidating shout into bandage if it was up at the end instead of heroic strike, if it was up. Other than that, it looked like you played fine to me. There's just not much a warrior can do without zerker rage using your build to NOT get deadzone kited.
---
Bro i did the same exact thing but at RFK, i was like 12 at the time and i got so sad cus i thought i had to create a new char, and the old one would be stuck forever in ghost :P
---
You can look at peoples WoW accounts you fucking retard lmao
---
My personal experience in vanilla was that once my guild had cleared MC (essentially learning how to raid in the process, which was new to many players)  -- BWL was a breeze by comparison. We started farming MC weekly, and we'd take what what BWL would give us every week, downing a new boss every week or two. 
---
Me, personally, my warrior had acquired a Sulfuras not long after our third or fourth Rag kill. Our rogues invited me to their private chat channel, as I'd essentially become a "plate rogue", having more in common with them in terms of boss positioning and loot wish lists (Drake Fang Talisman!) than our tanks. This was one of my favorite times of WoW, especially when it came to kiting the Razorgore encounter, which I had a blast with. 
---
Our real guild-killer was AQ40. We had no trouble with AQ20, but for whatever reason, I think a lot of our members started burning out in AQ40. It didn't have sexy tier gear, and setting up after wipes seemed to take forever, especially with players Ralph Wigguming that respawning trash gauntlet. We were fourth or fifth on our server for MC and BWL progression, and then dropped way off with AQ40. 
---
Sadly, Naxx really tore our guild up. Maybe 15 or 20 people really wanted to push Naxx, the other half were like, BC is coming out in three months and a bunch of us were in the beta and saw that Naxx gear was going to be useless almost instantly, and wanted a break. By the time BC came out, cliques had evolved for 10 man Kara and people started drifting off to other guilds, myself included.
---
But if you don't have at least one, it will be really difficult to raid at all. No Brez, no innervate, no Gotw. Brez alone has saved quite many attempts as some tank gets oneshot. 
---
Also, at higher gear levels resto druids can compete with holy priests just fine in raw healing as well. At least if they are any good.
---
Holy shit you're dumb
---
As if there wasn't enough to grind...now I gotta grind packs for my in game TCG?!?
---
Real talk though, adding this to classic would be sweet and make me take the zeppelin way more than necessary
---
You think I care about Karma when kids like you are letting blizzard off the hook with phasing? The same shitty tech that ruined modern wow. What‚Äôs next? Raid finder? Pathetic. This beta is in such a poor state.
---
Yeah primary OT would be ideal with a MT to give me tips. I'd be bitch boy if that got me in a super good raiding guild though. 
---
Honestly I'd rather wipe a little and like people than clear everything asap and not have fun. 
---
Yeah I'm thinking troll, I think they look pretty sweet and they're def rare I can't even remember seeing one.
---
This comment section is so cancer. Tips duels a rogue, rogue counter warrior. He not only duels a rogue but one of the absolute best rogues from the private server scene. I'm sure every single person in here would beat Perplexity in a duel as a warrior. 
---
We get it, Tips=bad but the fucking circlejerking on Tips in this subreddit is beyond anything I've ever seen.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/zetoxxd/clip/ZealousEvilOxOSfrog
---
That was almost everybody's experience outside of the original realms though.  Based on the raid history every boss in BWL was cleared in the first week except Nefarion.  It took weeks and weeks to gear up a 40 man raid, so for some of the low population second generation servers guilds were still on Ragnaros by the time BWL came out.  I re-rolled to Firetree which opened in Feb. 2005 and was in one of the first 5 or so Horde guilds to clear MC on the server and going into BWL we already knew all the strats because they had long been cleared.  The hardest part of vanilla raiding for most guilds wasn't the fights...it was getting 40 people who could avoid standing in fire.
---
which should now been moved into a in-house beta(even tho it's same they played on before)  since game moved onto that stage
---
Couldn't care less about his skill level (Classic wouldn't be the same without scrubs) but I am glad his arrogance and lies are getting exposed.
---
There's a larger feeling of accomplishment for things in Classic as well as a sense of community. It was just a fun and simple game that could be as hard as you needed it to be.
---
You could end up meeting a person and playing with them for hours just by running into them at an elite you needed to kill for a quest.
---
Plus, anyone who leveled horde in vanilla could tell you of the days of Barren chat. I remember questing for hours there and either LOL'ing or facepalming because of the shenanigans that ensued in that chat. Plus seeing "THE BARRENS IS UNDER ATTACK" and wasting 6 hours world pvp'ing random people.
---
Unplayable. Remove this shit. I‚Äôm not testing anymore until it‚Äôs fixed. Cross realm and phasing RUINS MMOs.
---
the forsaken are literally the citizens of Lordaeron
---
I don't mind/kinda like streamers (a bit too old for them at 26) but I've seen this kind of talk on this subreddit a few times now... referring to #NoChanges people, anti-streamers, and a few other groups of people as incels/virgins/neckbeards.
---
This is literally the kind of stuff that anti-vanilla people were saying to us from 2006 onward. If you disagree with welfare epics, you are a nolife virgin. Think raids should stay hard? Obviously because you have no friends. And so on.
---
So it's kind of funny that most of you guys complaining about our "toxic" community, seem to be recent arrivals to this community after WoW Classic was announced. So basically, our toxicity was good for getting you something that you want, but now you want to change the community to something else. It doesn't (shouldn't) work that way.
---
Me not losing anything is no reason for me not to object to it. I realize the time has moved on and promises are easily worth as much or more than quality or integrity, but your not gonna find some way to spin it where I'm gonna be okey with that.
---
Even then, skills should be maxed for PvP.
---
NO FEAR, TIPSOUT IS TRASH!
---
Difficulty isn't only in how many buttons per second you push.
---
And challenge isn't mutually exclusive from slow progress.  In live there is no difficulty in leveling or reaching 60/120.  In fact most people do it without ever leaving a capital city.  They have more buttons but it doesn't matter or make it more difficult.
---
It's only a waste of time if you don't enjoy it imo.
---
A toggle option would be good. Atleast I would be playing for the gameplay and not for the graphics. It's not like they've changed the art style completely.
---
The Static Range is correct; what's not correct is the PvP range of melee and range characters vs other players with movement involved
---
BLIZZARD WILL TURN CLASSIC INTO BFA REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Not acceptable. I need my gnome to be as tiny as possible so it looks even better once I get my huge night elf saber cat mount.

But you‚Äôd have already established such a strong connection that they will miss you, long for you, write you letters, dream of you! xD

If I recall I think swp was the highest dmg dot in vanilla by quite a bit.

Not worth watching.

Then dont fucking use them, stop whining like a child.

they have a few funny commercials!

You've clearly never heard of Athene then.
---
Why is this here? What is the point? If its not for you then that's fine but clearly there are people who like the clunkiness, the slower pace and everything else that comes with classic. That's fine too. Your post is so devoid of purpose especially on this subreddit. You aren't even asking a question or looking for discussion.
---
I think a lot of people know exactly what they‚Äôre getting and are happy
---
This exists in Vanilla too and even with "ffxglow 1" it's much less "glowy". It seems Classic's implementation is too strong.
---
This is objectively incorrect
---
Id be more pleased if people that literally started playing after Cataclysm didn't get invites Because it was an entirely different Azeroth.
---
Darn. I wonder if I didn't get through this time.
---
It's ok. Not everybody needs to like everything.
---
Also no one had whirlwind axe at 30
---
Razorgore with low fps = doomed from the start
---
They were testing the technology during the stress test as a saw a GM deliberately move people from 1 zone to another. It might be that there are still some bugs.
---
Uhh, no. You don't have to use them. Just because you don't want to use them doesn't mean they shouldn't be supported. Not everyone plays this game for the same reasons you do and not everyone should be forced to play it how you do.
---
&gt; cheap gouge trick to waste his blink
---
lmfao, this only works vs double digit IQ palyers though
---
We get it, you've seen reckful 3 lol, but this doesn't work vs competent opponents
---
When you cheap shot a mage that has a triple digit IQ they will instantly blink
---
when you cheap shot you have to wait your global cooldown before you can gouge - the mage isn't on global because you just opened out of stealth so they blink during the global cooldown EVERY TIME
---
you NEVER cheap shot in rogue vs mage duel it's ALWAYS ambush
---
please stop spreading misinformation like this
---
Does it get any better as you level or is that... it? I was planning on maining a Ret paladin for classic but this is really disheartening.
---
I‚Äôm gunna say paladin because everyone keeps saying priest. I feel like on launch day everyone is going to be the same 2-3 classes because of how min/max obsessed everyone is with classic
---
I‚Äôm convinced people complaining about addons didn‚Äôt even play back then
---
happened to me to, i left a group and then got phased into a server with a level 19 guy running by, was like WTF am i in the beta? but no i'm not, relogging put me back in the lvl 5 realm
---
Don't feed the troll
---
That is the dumbest thing to say. If there is an addon that fundamentally changes certain aspects of the game even at the detriment of the overall game experience but it simply makes you play better or something, you fall behind by not using it. So in a way you are forced to use it to simply catch up with other players. "Just don't use it" is dumb.
---
&gt; t doesnt have any impact on starter zones, you will still see 500-600 humans in northshire for example.
---
it does though.
---
if i have a friendly interaction with player X on launch day, and we quest in the same place on the next day. there is now a 75% percent chance that i wont even see them and maybe that means we wont form a relationship we otherwise would.
---
at least theoretically, layering creates the same kind of "nameless mass" of players that sharding does, even if not to the same extent. its a steep price to pay for a healthy long time server population, something that doesnt even seem to have been that big a problem in vanilla to begin with, in my eyes.
---
Oh yeah, CPR. They could've been there, on the ground, dying and it'd still be more life in them than Ass-mongold
---
Play a private server???
---
pretty sure it's right click, but yes!
---
&gt;The game was perfect, i really enjoyed every part.
---
&gt;But, wtf ? Do you really want to do like it was in the past? 
---
But did you though?
---
It was added sometime in an expansion before right before MOP or WoD?
---
Nobody wants it, that is why there have been Vanilla private servers for 6+ years. Also, did you see the numbers from Nostalrius?
---
It was a size increase, his size increased with every stack.
---
OP was only saying he found it entertaining to see what people are doing to push their advantage while everyone is capped at 30. Stop being a sperg.

Isnt 30 max level? how does max level twinking work?

Still nothing for me =/

Thanks man. Unfortunately this clip doesnt show the full duel (judging from the OP, probably intentionally) - I had already used intimidating shout and got off a bull bandage prior to the end.

What kind of proof do you mean it was not added. Can you show me videos of people for 9yards away? This is not how it was at all
---
Play whatever you want lol
---
Not a bug or a problem but do the graphic settings have an actual impact on the environment? I switch to a higher preset just to see if anything changes and very little happens. Is it because the old "ultra" is like preset 6 or something?
---
Did you read the post at all? He's complaining.
---
The Plaguelands are controlled by the Scourge and not the Forsaken.
---
That's pretty much it.  Blessings and grenades too...  and on cooldown she you have BoF and BoP and HoJ.  But yeah, pretty boring.
---
Play a paladin if that's what you enjoy.
---
but as a paladin you'll like raid as holy, and pvp as ret in classic. TBH.
---
\+ Getting 40 people together isn't as hard anymore, because the 'meta' game is to play a lot more efficient than back then. You're basically cutting off 1 raid night and a bunch of hours. Which leads to more people willing to raid.
---
You should see [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bs8n23/how_to_fix_the_bright_glow_with_a_console_command/)
---
lvl5 Quests have never given 30 silver pieces. lol. Private servers are wrong but they aren't proving to be "incredibly inaccurate", they're proving to be surprisingly accurate given the circumstances required to recreate such a gigantic, old,  largely undocumented and inaccessible game. They literally had to recreate basically everything from scratch without a complete reference. So much was based on guesswork and faulty memories, the fact that its largely the same is amazing.
---
A lot of the things you listed as negatives are actually viewed as positives by a lot of the MMO/RPG community. These are elements that add to the RPG experience - while not necessarily "convenient" they add to the immersion.
---
That just like... Your opinion, man.
---
Yeah iam with you... i will be looking for a guild that wont use them. I got forced to many times into using them and thus played way worse. 
---
If needed i create my own guild for that
---
Isn't it worse when you Capitalize words at random for Seemingly no reason at all?
---
Do you let him finish on your face ?
---
lvling in classic not like. if you don't have much time you need to make your search before you start
---
Which is the case with addons like DBM which severly changed how raids are designed in retail wow.
---
Because has to assume that every single player uses an addon that literally tells what to do at any time during an encounter, as oppose to actually using their eyes and paying attention to the game.
---
Enemy castbars aren't a thing in vanilla, so how long until addons are out that calls out when enemies are casting spells, and what spells they are casting?
---
I really want to enjoy Classic as a new player. I didnt play much as a kid but I really like the route Blizzard is taking because it allows someone like me to experience this game at its peak when I completely missed out before. But as I read through this subreddit man, I dont know. Will the community will disappoint me?
---
For MC, ZG and AQ 20, you can easily do them all on a 3 day raid with 3 hours a night. After that, it can take two raid days to clear BWL, however your guild will still want to do MC because it drops legendary weapons pieces such as Eye and the bindings to make Thunderfury. It can take a long time to get both halves. For AQ 40 you can still do the 3 day a week raid schedule. Naxx is when you will have to raid 5 days a week as you will spend a lot of time farming gold, mats and consumables.
---
No, it's actually still Not worse.
---
Good. One less idiot on the server.
---
Everyone who wants to play the beta why not just play on a private server? Either way you're playing a character that will be pointless in 3 months
---
This is bullshit. That's not how the law works. This is an urban legend people peddle to justify aggressive enforcement of IP. Google it, there tons of lawyers on this platform that have gone over exactly why this train of thought has no legal basis.
---
You don‚Äôt say. I appreciate the clarification!
---
Yet that's exactly how a census works. You spam /who with specific commands. It literally says "**waiting to send next who**". That's how Census works.
---
In the case of the OP, you can see that it's currently checking human paladins with 
---
    /who r-human c-paladin 3-3
---
1) Feral cat
---
2) Fine in dungeons, weak in both tank/dps in raids, great in pvp duels but somewhat weaker in BGs
---
3) Fine, they are missing a rezz for 5 mans but the battle rezz is great in raids. Not quite as good as other healers, but perfectly acceptable and you won't see people complaining.
---
4) Well there's only 1 race per faction, so... that race.
---
i didn't heal once in 7 year playing this game and i don't think i will ever do. i like to hit bosses and see big numbers
---
Start your own guild and do it your way then
---
So tips 5 Stam 5 spirit shoulders are bis? Dope!
---
Didn't find myself in that list, eventhough i  hung around in northshire pretty much the entire stresstest.
---
From this we can extrapolate that a single layer was about 8000 players?
---
No problem!
---
&gt;xpearl in vanilla.
---
Which was a superior raid frame because the standard one was completely dogshit, didn't even show if you were in range of the target if I remember correctly. Thats why are using the BFA raid frames.
---
If they added the most basic addons like threat meter which is a necessity, and a DPS meter because wants it anyways. Then everything should be covered, and the game could actually be played the way it was designed to.
---
Omar made a mess!
---
Question for those following this more. Is the layering replacing the sharding in the earlier zones they had mentioned?
---
Auto Attack Simulator 2019. ;)
---
Go watch old vanilla videos more closely, you can see it there..
---
One obvious pvp example is in "pat pvp vid 2" @ 6mins he charges a druid and shows the huge range by moving the cam from the top view.
---
In that whole video though u can see examples of huge melee range, leeway mechanic &amp; spell batching
---
maybe i‚Äôll get invited into beta when a spot opens because you stop. I‚Äôll happily report this bug and play
---
Same here. Maybe they have to do it manually so it is not all at once?
---
That and Epi.  If you run enough Epi, you'll get a heart beat out of a pound of ground beef.
---
Well, Hunter seems to be a great choice for you.
---
Playstyle is very interesting and different with pet management, aimed shot timing/auto attack clipping
---
Their gear looks arguably cool (dont roll male night elf though :))
---
Definitely fun to play, very strong solo and at gold farming, high skill cap in pvp and pve.
---
Viable and needed for end game raids solely for tranq shot.
---
Content for Classic Plus. The only dream I have.
---
My guild tried BWL back in the day... haven‚Äôt seen any of them in 14 years.
---
Right... As a grad from Prof. Utts in Data analysis. Your full of shit.
---
&gt;  I think most people dont remember how it was and will leave as soon as they will realize.
---
Has been throughly debunked.
---
Would you stop complaining about complaining? Thanks
---
Who else immediately set up all their action bars and keybinds?
---
This guy fucks
---
Then do that
---
&gt; Hell, I guarantee Classic will see a guild clearing BWL within the first 24 hours of the availability of Phase 3. Quote me on that.
---
What? Do you think this is some Nostradamus level prediction?  AQ and Naxx got cleared on the first day by some pvt server guilds this year
---
"Counterpoint: BWL was easy"
---
This is your original claim.  You are basing that claim on your experience of clearing BWL both several patches after release and on a "newer" server - which meant you weren't actually "progressing" in the same way guilds were at BWL launch when the strats had to be figured out.
---
Your experience is both anecdotal and irrelevant to the claim of whether or not BWL was easy.
---
The fact that your guild didn't start BWL (released 1.6) until 1.10 just further confirms that your server was a backwater one.
---
&gt; so if anything it will be even easier than it was when it first released
---
No.shit.sherlock.
---
Absolute lols
---
...We must test this now. I want a replacement heart but it's just a block of ground beef and an epi-injector
---
You misspelled mop
---
I agree with both of you.
---
You're an idiot. Is all I took away from this post.
---
My guild never beat Vaelestrasz but we had only just gotten there maybe a month before BC came out, still it was always server news when you heard XYZ guild disbanded yesterday due to failed Vael attempts.  I enjoyed the deep dive.
---
You ever just wanna go into a coma for a period of time?
---
Because I'm not 12?
---
m8... i very much doubt people currently playing on the beta/stress test servers care that the character creation description says lol.
---
If we're going by the typical mantra....
---
#\#NoChanges
---
Addons were available effectively from the beginning. Additionally, their removal isn't going to make anything more difficult. Raiding in Vanilla, mechanically speaking, is no more difficult than most 5-man dungeons of modern WoW.
---
&gt; Phase 1 only btw
---
for now
---
I'm not really excited for the beta, rather experience it on release with my actual characters.
---
Regarding first question, 1-20 is torturous. I had an orgasm when I got cat form though, worth it.
---
Some people enjoy seeing fun and interesting clips off Twitch, you don't have to click them if you don't enjoy them or don't wish to monetarily promote them üëç
---
Exactly this.
---
Im going to lvl one just for the sheer fun they are lvling
---
Im trying to understand actually. What people can enjoy on this. Everything was longer, based on farm an harder
---
&gt; That was almost everybody's experience outside of the original realms though. Based on the raid history every boss in BWL was cleared in the first week except Nefarion. 
---
Wrong, "world first guilds" and guilds competing for world first don't represent most guilds
---
Plenty of people back then complained about adding though. I remember how it was sometimes frowned upon to use addons, since some people thought you were skill less to use them. 
---
I personally don't have any problem with them, as long as its responsible.
---
This doesn't really matter, but better animations are a welcome change.
---
The new models are garbage. Bouncy, wayy to bouncy. No.
---
Not much to test, I've brought lots of people to the hospital with a heart beat because they were pumped full of epi, only for it to fizzle out once the drug wore off, or for them to already be brain dead anyways.  Best case scenario, you save a few organs for transplant to someone who needs them.
---
I'm great at reading, maybe it's your shitty writing that's at fault here?
---
Hope so
---
The way census works it gets around the 50 person limit by using narrower filters until it returns less than 50 results. /who is pretty powerful and has pretty good filters for class, zone, guild, race, level, or character name.
---
So it will do like /who c-Paladin r-Human to find all human paladins in any zone. If there's more than 49 results then it will start filtering by name, e.g. human paladins with names starting with A, or if still more than 49 it will find names starting with AA, AB, etc.
---
Eventually it will find every character regardless of what zone they are in.
---
Only because he didn't get a beta invite.
---
Last time blizzard tried patching it was in wotlk iirc, but if you walked into a wall in a way where your character raised up against the wall, having a priest cast levitate on you while continuously walking towards the wall would mean that you would always stay at the same altitude if you hugged the wall. So if you can get up to some mountains that are above the hyjal gate, then you can hug the mountains all the way across until you can drop down. As far as I know the properties haven‚Äôt changed since 3.3.5
---
its not normal servers, most likely alpha / dev server
---
I'm subbed for news but yeah, this the by far the most toxic sub I've seen. Entitlement, streamer hate, gatekeeping, my God the gatekeeping
---
‚ÄúThe Law‚Äù implies there‚Äôs a law, which there isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs based on Judicial Precedent. Completely different beast, but I‚Äôm not sure they cover that at Reddit Law.
---
I‚Äôm leaning towards pally but I‚Äôm worried there will be a lot of pally cuz they have always been popular
---
I play retail atm with next to no addons im always top dps in bfa raid rbgs arenas so no you arent forced to yse addona but it does help if you need the help
---
Ive played on pservers that handled it perfectly with way higher pop
---
&gt;Addons were available effectively from the beginning. Additionally, their removal isn't going to make anything more difficult. Raiding in Vanilla, mechanically speaking, is no more difficult than most 5-man dungeons of modern WoW.
---
I am pretty sure raiding without DBM is more difficult, as people actually have to pay attention to the game, as oppose to hearing the addon tell you "run away little girl" or whatever it says.
---
and modern addons (whcih will be on classic) will even fuck the game up way more than the original vanilla addons, which were mostly to cover the huge flaws of vanilla, like a threat meter or the awful standard raid frames.
---
Won't matter when it only last a few weeks. After that when they merge all the layers and there will be ques that is how it's going to be.

Ah, I wasn‚Äôt aware that was possible. I assumed it was just counting players seen nearby. Thanks for the info
---
Confirmed you be trolling.
---
Wait till you see the Gnomes.
---
I agree with you but most people wont until they see 100% video from vanilla that leeway wasnt there. Because memory alone can always be faulty.
---
Takes me back to BC release trying a spacegoat.  Good times.
---
As someone who experienced the 40-man raid guild going from doing ok on MC to having a lot of trouble in BWL, I can totally vouch for this, especially the part where the tryhards get antsy.  We did clear up to Broodlord before TBC so the guild didn't die.  However, several of the tryhards started a new guild immediately upon hitting 70 after TBC launch, specificaly to keep out the casuals from the previous guild.  It sucked and turned me off from raiding for a long time.
---
Just play on a private server...
---
Reeeeeee
---
Anyone who has gotten to MC is far past bitching about old school WoW. Most of the complaining and quitting will come at around lvl 30 when the difficulty ramps up, the gold costs increase and quests are sparse. Not to mention the looming reality you won't be able to afford your mount at 40.
---
Yea WoL was pretty great, it allowed you to jump to a better guild easily. 
---
Also since we couldn't pinpoint where we were failing on Dreamwalker(HM), it ended up killing the guild. I always suspected it was our healers though because they would dance around the issues of people dying.
---
That also brings up another point, people not being up to par in a guild, hiding/placing blame etc. All that fucking drama, no thank you.  I'm rolling a huntard dps this time around.
---
Shamans can't use swords....
---
The stress test race was for $500 dollars, I assumed that's what you were talking about since this thread is about the stress test.
---
Three main reasons for player to stick to MMOs; Social, Achieve and Immersion (Nick Yee*). This game scored high in all, especially social. Did my thesis work about this. 
---
* http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus/motivations.pdf (note: link downloads article)
---
And they already have a tcg to integrate
---
The "nostalgia" argument, while somewhat valid, is such a strawman.
---
This post reminded me of [this](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/314/087/c1a.jpg) lol
---
Uhhhh .. wrong?
---
BWL is very easy the hardest part is getting enough ony cloaks for nef lol
---
Tips is a fucking scammer. How do people support this shit.
---
Seriously? I was using his words, I fully understand encouraging is bad, but I was using his tweet.
---
reeeeee it has to be authentic /s
---
Yeah I was wrong about that, but most probably went Human cause that‚Äôs where all the fun stuff was.
---
Obviously sword and board is just an expression lol.
---
Is this actual true or a bit of hyperbole too. If its true its weird and funny
---
Eh, it's not a problem if you've got a ret pally/shaman/SPriest dps. So long as there's someone else who can rezz, you're fine in 5 mans.
---
But yeah, just a druid is pretty rough; although I bring them if I can't find anyone else... Just remember to take it slow and CC everything to avoid wiping.
---
A small percentage of guilds progressed in AQ40, tons of guilds were stuck on MC, 20-mans and some of BWL.
---
It's "We're all waiting" which is the problem.
---
i'd rather have gotten to play on a lvl 5 capped server for one day
---
They can tank fine in raids, look for Skarm on youtube and he has a ton of videos some of which are him tanking KT on a bear. they take more work to get the same output but they do have their place. its mostly gear that will be the problem, just not a lot of options after a certain point till something like AQ 40
---
OP, these are good points but I'll add a few points.
---
Feral tanks are very viable in 5 mans, not so viable as main tanks, but they do fill a niche as an off-tank. 
---
Also, keep in mind BG's won't be available until Phase 3 of Classic so don't that coerce your opinion. PvE wise, they're definitely on the weaker end of the spectrum but are definitely capable raid healers, and having the innervate is super handy.
---
Casuals: Why do people take /played 4 days to hit 60? I do it in like 6 hours! Guess I‚Äôll just be server first and own all the xmog markets.
---
Modern monitors are basically cheating and for casuals.
---
CRTs or GTFO.
---
Clown post. Get out.
---
ok bye
---
Why does his melee attack power say 30 and yours 25 when you are the exact same stats?
---
AQ40 nearly destroyed the guild I was in. It is the first raid where everyone \_must\_ farm pots etc. Nature resist was hard to come by and couple of the fights were overtuned. Never finished Naxx before TBC came.
---
*gasp* twitch people are a bunch of rowdy douche bags?  Noooooo.
---
Yes Omar showed up in Tristfal Glades and dropped Magmadar on me and other undead newbies. There are screenshots and videos in a prior post of mine and elsewhere on reddit.
---
As someone who plays on pservers, the toxicity was definitely already there.
---
Hi, /u/Dankfault
---
You know what I mean.
---
i mean i was assuming you'd assume I meant dwarves...since theyre short, ugly, spawn in the same place and can be priests...
---
I'd love to see that post.
---
Your access will be revoked soon and you can go back to checking on the drop down list.
---
They apparently hate streamers but are constantly watching them and posting clips on here.
---
&gt; Our real guild-killer was AQ40
---
Ironically the first "hard" fight in Vanilla is Skeram in aq40 lol so the moment you got to a "hard" boss your guys gave up
---
It's immersive.
---
for PVE, Paladin is the best, most-efficient, but overall, the most boring of the available healers. you'll be largely spamming one button.
---
for PVP, Paladin, again, has the most utility/survivability with the different blessings, such as Sacrifice, Freedom, Protection, and plate makes you basically unkillable 1v1 vs melee classes.
---
for PvE, Priest are the most versitale and before you start getting gear, the best healers due to their healing output.
---
for PVP, Priest is still good. Mana Burn, Mind Control, an undispelable Fear, DoTs, some decent mobility with Renew/PW:S.
---
honestly, we need more info in what you wanna do since both are good in PvE and PvP.
---
You're comment screams sour, making a claim/strawman with no evidence. And I don't mind being a gatekeeper, but that wasn't even closer to gatekeeping. Just laying down what happens in the world and for people to relax lol
---
It's in the [big ass thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bp61yw/beta_bugsproblems_megathread_report_issues_here/) that's stickied.  It's literally the [first  thing listed](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-not-a-bug-list/175887)
---
"inv for rag layer" 
---
It has begun.
---
Stats are the same, but skills are different, his sword skill is at 25.
---
&gt; Sharding/layering HAS to exist for the launch of classic in some form
---
No, it doesn't. You can add new realms as others fill up and then merge them as populations fluctuate. It may be a good solution, but it doesn't HAVE to exist.
---
Anyone else had AMAZING latency? My regular latency is between 65-80 and the stress server gave me a constant 50. I really hope this will be the case for the whole game and not just beta
---
Oh yeah I basically told my Raid ‚Äúno ct_mod‚Äù no loot. Download or don‚Äôt raid with us.
---
You need to stop repeating bullshit
---
Kill boars, a lpt of them
---
Used to be Paladin CL on a popular PServer two years ago. [I gave Esfand the middle finger and didn't let him raid with us because he was Ret.](https://i.imgur.com/kS5eiDk.png)
---
i think shaman are just buffers in classic paladins actually keep the tank  up too
---
wrong again, layers will be sticky, you have your "home layer" assigned to you when u create ur char and you will always play there EXCEPT youre in a group where the leader is from another layer. this part is VERY important and the devs explained how they wanted us to keep seeing the same people/guilds as we level up
---
Most stuff I dont care but I agree Boss timers like DBM and Bigwigs are complete bullshit and literally suck the bit of fun that there is in vanilla raiding out of it.
---
Hi, /u/Frosthorne
---
One of the (few) benefits of rolling Tauren. Looking forward to the open plains of Mulgore.
---
I miss lan parties, sounds like it was a fun place to work :)
---
Never thought about it this way with the territories, good job!
---
I saw the early resist and was wondering how he managed to win. He didnt just win but embarrasses tipsout.
---
Yeah, that's crap.
---
I'm one of those who intends to mosey my casual ass through everything the game has to offer on my way to 60. I'd never get an unarmored epic mount just as I'll never achieve rank 14 or open the gates of AQ. Sure, it would be cool to do those things, but the effort they would require simply isn't worth it to me.
---
For those as would be willing to put in that effort, though, there's really no good reason they shouldn't have the option.
---
For all their claims of wanting to give us an authentic Vanilla experience, Blizzard seems to be so damned terrified of anyone feeling left out any point they'll tie all the systems supporting that "authentic experience" into Gordian knots in order to avoid it even being a possibility.
---
Which is ironic, considering they're apparently taking great pains to make sure the PvP ranking system is every bit as awful and unhealthy as it was back in '05, and that one's a hell of a lot more significant with respect to people being left out than whether or not your character's mount is wearing armor.
---
1. Feral
---
2. PvE its bad for raids, but okay in smaller 5 mans. PVP feral druid is a great class. Just not enough burst to be S tier. 
---
3. They are great healers but have a high learning curve and arn't kitted to top the meters. 
---
4. Thats personal preference. But I would say Tauren for PVP.
---
75 fishing is 20-30 minutes...
---
Yep,
---
You can whisper &lt;username&gt;-ClassicBetaPvp from the stress test realm.  They can also invite you or you invite them onto each other's realm.  So probably what happened with MN was someone on the alpha was testing this bug and joined a party with someone on the beta realm which punted them into the beta realm's shard.
---
Likely this is a hangover from the way live realms work with cross-realm invites etc and will be blocked from occuring sometime soon.
---
NB: I tested this with my stress test char (no beta cuck) and was on the beta pvp realm and could see level 30s n stuff but I was still limited to level 5 and would not gain xp.
---
Read it again. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre confused.

Your not wrong, Male characters have hidden strength bonus. Females have hidden intelligence bonus
---
I honestly thought CoT was added in BC.....TIL.
---
So the Might helm doesn't look like dogshit on *not a tauren*? It looks so stupid on a Tauren.
---
Not in pvp
---
Yepp, it's most likely only for testing purposes :\^)
---
PvE wise, in Vanilla you sort of just have to accept that there are certain classes that aren't going to produce big dick numbers. Druid can do okay healing, but a good priest will do more. That said, healing meters don't tell much of the story even in retail and the same is true of Vanilla. You can be a useful healer if you know how to play. You also bring unique utility in terms of battle res and innervate. 
---
PvP you have incredible mobility, you're very difficult to CC, you have good survivability in bear, you have good burst healing with NS HT and swiftmend. Very fun to world PvP with a druid because of these things.
---
But you sacrifice a lot. No magic dispel, no offensive dispel, etc.
---
God this is so accurate is hurts wat do we do
---
You're are bad and a scammer. View bots will only take you so far.
---
I'm not sure what the alternative is, there are like 10k people in this bridge as it is
---
You‚Äôre right my bad, looked a bit to quickly there
---
Thank you very much for testing this.
---
Big numbers and ret pally cannot exist in the same phrase. (joke)
---
But you'll need TONS of consumables to deal a decent amount of damage, and still are not going to be top dps in most cases.
---
Of course, play what you want.
---
Enemy cast bars was an add-on in vanilla and everyone used it. Even I did and I didn't know what I was doing in vanilla. I had tons of addons in vanilla. I even changed some scripts to make certain particle effects look different because you could do that in vanilla. That is part of the vanilla experience that's not anything different or special.
---
Chat is cross layer, already confirmed by blizz in many videos.
---
Then why are you on the subreddit for a video game?
---
evidently not NA's like bestest best warrior dueler.
---
Feral/resto is good for leveling.
---
feral druids might be used as offtank utility in a raid (innervate battlerez and offtank), one out of 40 with 1-2 more resto druids at most. You need to be a godlike feral to make this work.
---
resto druids are shit healers regardless of pve or pvp, their bg role is flag carrying. good luck doing this without knowing all the jumps in wsg by hearth and having tons of consumables.
---
tauren is better due to war stomp but alliance has paladins.
---
Which is glow or not glow?
---
Thank god everyone on this sub isn't super stupid, i thought that the post would get burried in downvotes at first
---
As someone who's recently moved to Spain, you'd be surprised at how immense the Spanish-speaking media sphere is, considering just how little we hear of it in our English bubble.
---
Well you have lots of time finding people that actually pay attention from 1-60. I mean i will already see in dungeons if they are good enough or not. 
---
Or they dont even need to be good.. just patient and pay attention. I will have 0 tollerance for tanks that dont taunt and DD¬¥s that cant wait like 3-5 seconds before making damage.
---
People need to take dungeons serious its a good pre training for raids even if the AOE there dont onehit you and so on you can train a lot in advance. 
---
Sure you can just offtank bosses and burstdmg them down so fast that they go down easily but that is not preparing people for raid content.
---
Had similar stuff happening back then and wont tollerate it this time around.
---
I hate to say it but with today's experience and the current climate around vanilla raid familiarity thanks to private servers, Vael is actually a very easy fight as like as the dps in your raid arent literal mouth breathers.
---
I know it's fun to prop the bosses and raids up from your memory, but it just won't be this way on classic wow. Any guild that can clear Rag, is capable of clearing BWL 1st week it comes out.
---
I think would be much more interesting if addons weren't a thing, especally that most of the glaring flaws of the vanilla UI has been solved the BFA client. 
---
You can have an ingame threat meter and the frames don't suck. So if people played the game as oppose to being guided almost entirely by addons during encounters, or spamming a billion stacks on AH based on an addon calculating the prices, and also posting the stacks for you. The game might actually more immersive, and you would fuck around with the UI, which is the thing you do in BFA anyways.
---
Addons were a necessity 15 years ago, because Blizzard's standard UI was shit, while the modern UI has most of the issues solved. So maybe for the first time since like 2005 we can actually try to play the game as it was designed to be played.
---
What is it about AUTHENTIC vanilla experience do you guys not get?
---
Ret pally is unplayable trash in PVE raiding. That being said as a pvp class they are amazing albeit gear dependent. The reason you see so much hate for ret in PVP is that it is over shadowed by holy which is the best pvp support in the game. Also it sucks with bad gear and kids try to run it out any way. But if you can get your hands on the right stuff. You can be a super strong pvp class.
---
You can't redirect lag lol.
---
Take the poll and we'll see if the numbers are acceptable. 
---
https://www.strawpoll.me/18042292
---
This deserves more attention! Really strange bug.
---
Not representative at all.
---
the actual instances were added in BC,  but the Area was in vanilla,  you have to clip to get into it.  Its sealed off and guarded by 3 dragons.
---
&gt;I think raiding without "Insert Threat Addon Name Here" is more difficult, as people actually have to pay attention to the game, as oppose to seeing the addon showing you're about to get threat.
---
I don‚Äôt think so, but however any bonus weapon skill over maximum doesn‚Äôt affect PvP.
---
Like human‚Äôs plus +5 sword is great for PvE but doesn‚Äôt do anything for PvP.
---
care to elaborate?
---
1 streamer could potentially bring 1,000 people to a faction. Factions in vanilla had 1250-3000 max. If you‚Äôre not concerned with potentially overpopulated servers after the collapse, I would argue that you‚Äôre short sighted as hell. Looking forward to reading your complaining once phase 2 starts
---
Based on what I‚Äôve been seeing, I think most of the healers are going priest. So if you want to be unique, pick anything else.
---
A level 4 rogue can pickpicket 10s in like 5 minutes in northshire abbey.
---
I played vanilla since release and private servers for over a year. I've played all classes and specs. 
---
Instead of just sharing my general opinion and wasting your time. I will address each of your concerns one by one. 
---
"I'm scared there will be a lot of veterans, so my chances of getting in a good guild or in raids will be pretty slim as a newcomer, that's why I want to play some high demand class with utility."
---
\*\*I 100% assure you this should not be a problem. By the time you get to level 60 you'll likely be a very proficient player. The leveling journey is designed to give you more and more difficult challenges. Take you time and learn to play your character. Try to get into lowbie dungeons like DM, BFD, SFK, RFK, RFD, MARA, BRD, LBRS, UBRS, STRAT, SCHOLO, ZG. By the time you get this far you should be just as good as anyone. \*\*Then you get into a raiding guild\*\* you likely won't even be able to apply unless you have full \*\*PRERAID BIS\*\*  which you farm on your own, without a guild. After all that you get into a raiding guild and wait for Molten Core to come out, BWL, ONY, AQ20, etc. Classic WoW is slow and the content is slow. I promise this shouldn't be a concern.\*
---
"Is it a good idea to play Alliance warlock, priest or mage?"
---
\*\*Warlock - Dueling beasts, farming kings, easy leveling, decent utility, but most people will pass on a warlock for a mage unless they're looking to summon ppl, which is way more popular than people think. Warlocks will always find groups looking for DPS in Dire Maul and some other dungeons. However, besides soulstone utility, warlocks arent valued over mages for ranged DPS in end game like NAXX raiding but they aren't far behind. Banish is required for some Boss Fights in NAxx, for example.\*\*
---
\*\*Priest - Dwarf priest for PVE, very good class to play, always find a good spot in raids, however, some consider pallys to be better healers in Naxx. Undead priests are common and formidable PVP but have a high skill curve to be dominant. They lack CC utility but make up for it in sheer healing dominance over any hybrid in raiding, pvp and some dungeons. Holy Pally is very close behind, in many ways pallys are OP for a hybrid class healer in vanilla.\*\*
---
\*\*A mage is the highest DPS in the game with the exception of BM hunters in some situations. Sheep is very important in dungeons and raids, CC sucks in classic, except for sheep is OP. Mages do very well in PVP and duels. Portals are convenient for travel. Faring and leveling is excellent but they will be very populated.\*\*
---
Priest as healers are always welcome in every MMO, so I assume WoW is the same.
---
\*\*Yes, this time around I saw a lot more warriors. I think healers will be the minority over tanks when classic launches because people arent so intimidated with tanking anymore, now that we've had 14 years to figure out the mechanics.\*\*
---
Alliance warlock because I've read that warlocks are liked in parties for their utility and there aren't many alliance warlocks because of the undead racial.  
---
Mage because portals, conjuring food and good dps should help me make some friends and get a spot (tho mage will probably be overpopulated like rogue).
---
What do you guys think? Any advice for a noob?
---
I don't have a recollection of the first few bosses being difficult as my guild cleared to Huhuran week 1, but I definitely remember the nightmare that was farming up not just your typical consumables, but a ton of nature res potions AND a whole set of NR gear (particularly when we were seldom able to take down the green dragons before another guild got there).  Twin emps was one of the first fights to nearly destroy my guild.  And, unsurprisingly, four horsemen was the nail in the coffin.
---
This post reminded me of the similar levels of stress with Vael that I'd nearly forgotten about.
---
I didn‚Äôt mention queues and I have no issue with queues
---
One of NA's bestest best warriors isn't near top level? Blasphemy! [https://clips.twitch.tv/ScrumptiousTriumphantCatDatSheffy](https://clips.twitch.tv/ScrumptiousTriumphantCatDatSheffy)
---
&gt;That is part of the vanilla experience that's not anything different or special.
---
Yeah, if you had the addon.
---
Then they might as well make it baseline then?
---
This is the problem with addons, they have way too much impact on the gameplay, and has been a key contributor into steering the game into the trainwreck that is modern WoW.
---
Never forget that gearscore was an addon-based system that was almost required for anyone who wasn't in an established guild.
---
Addons have done way more harm than good to this game imo
---
If you want to hit the boss for large numbers. You need to find a new class Ret is good in pvp with gear but, it's prolly the lowest raid dps of any spec in the game.
---
If you like hunter style, go hunter. You have much less competition for gear than most other classes. It's also a great farmer. If I enjoyed the play style I'd make one myself.
---
Staves can still be equipped, they have comparable weapon damage at least which I guess is all you want?
---
I mean this is still exactly what I remembered and said in my head when I heard of classic coming out
---
From this weeks beta and stress test we can clearly see the implementation of sharding/cross realms like retail, and it will stay like this once classic is released.
---
Population has literally never naturally spread on any server in WoW history. But apparently this time it will. Got it.
---
Validation.
---
Number 1 is how it worked it 1.12.
---
Number 2 is definitely something you imagined.
---
Mk that more aligns with what I had previously thought.
---
World of Warcraft 
---
Civil War
---
people don't seem to understand that streamers are basically the new form of game journalists. They're going to get behind the scenes access and shit, this is like getting pissed off that some writer for gamespot got a sneak peak at something in 2003.
---
So your exploit is being on a low pop server?  Game breaking.
---
?? How did this single stress realm show we're getting cross-realm? Maybe we're just getting layering as they stated?
---
Priest is easier (er... faster) to level, paladin has better mana efficiency, both are very strong healers that can top meters in raids; and both are decent in PvP.
---
Honestly a pretty subjective pick, both are pretty good. Personally I hate alliance, and also love the BiS pieces for priests, so I'm going priest.
---

---
says classicalpha if you watched your own clip, but yeah seems like they have something broken
---
You didn't miss much with stress test honestly.  Stayed up to midnight just to attempt to log in for 45 mins before I gave up.
---
The funny thing is history is repeating itself already. I just came from a thread arguing against ADDONS... 
---
"To those who argued against welfare epix and easy raids on the old WoW forums, the first real battle, the first indication that we were outnumbered
---
To those who argued against race/class homogeneity and the crybabies calling for it
---
To those who argued against LFG/LFR and other anti-social mechanics that eroded the community
---
To those who maintained, joined, and supported pservers after we completely lost our game in Cata, you are ultimately responsible for getting us WoW Classic"
---
Add addont to that list. They were one of the first steps to rewards being brainddead half afk in a raid and refusing to improve or pay any attention.
---
Also thanks for the kind words.
---
They're doing everything in the newest engine as the starting point, then changing things to match 1.12.1. 
---
It's in one of the first articles about the game and referenced in almost every post lol.
---
Thanks a lot for the very detail dude, i was worried arms was way superior but its not apparently.
---
I never played vanilla and plan to no life it, will i need to have alt mage as everybody say or there is decent way to make gold as warrior ? ( no AH flipping please :))
---
Man, even when people get in they still complain.
---
There's seriously no pleasing this community.
---
Imagine one good guild crushing all the streamers at once.
---
True, although from tips' perspective I imagine that perp appeared very close to his character, especially given that perp is playing from EU and therefore has higher ping, so his displayed location in game would be further offset from where is actual hurtbox. I agree with you though, taking the most predictable path for 6 seconds almost every time is probably not the best method. And also, tips was able to get an intercept off by juking back very early on, so based on that he should have gotten a feel for how he could possibly escape that situation in the future.
---
I can't remember exactly, but I don't you could see your threat on targets in vanilla, maybe there was an indicator which said high or low threat, but because of that perticular mechanic encounters could appear to random due to the lack of specific information on how close to overaggro you were, and then factor in 40 people pulling threat.
---
Which is why a threat meter is a necessity
---
Nowadays this shit is so easy. It is going to be so easy. I started going afk during razorgore week 2.
---
Was not made in 1.12 i dont believe m8, nor did he use blind (the real mvp of that era) in this video.
---
&gt; atching the gameplay makes me think it is just more grindy to get to end-game 
---
Your first mistake is thinking about playing classic only for the end game.
---
this is 1.12, not the patch world of roguecraft was made in m8. Besides, the real strength of rogues in that video is blind, which he doesn't use.
---
The AUDACITY
---
A lot of clueless and/or mediocre players will try to tell you ret works in pvp, that is false.
---
Ret is a laughing stock in pvp as you bring cleanse freedom offheals etc to a group, everything a holypala has but worse due to manapool, no talents, not efficient gear for it etc.
---
You make up for it by... auto attack procs inferior to warriors etc.
---
Why would you be an auto attack bot no one will invite due to being useless, dealing bad damage due to being kited 24/7 and requiring serious grind for gear that works for your spec, when you could be the overpowered immortal heal/dispelbot everyone is dying to have in their premades on alliance?
---
Holypala is the reason why ally&gt;horde in premades (generalizing) because of how ridiculously hard it is to kill one (whilst they cleanse and freedom away making the lives of casters hell).
---
Ret in raids. Lol, never gonna happen.
---
If you are best friends with the guild leader and 38 other people agree to carry an additional burden then it works, you would be on nightfall duty (2h axe with a proc that increases spelldmg taken by 15%, every raid has one casters love it. Your BiS and you will never get any other items until every other dps is geared (whose gear you need)).
---
The problem? Hunters are better at this. Wingclip spam + auto attacks = more nightfall procs than you provide.
---
Ret paladin is useless and redundant in every piece of content.
---
Ironically protpala can maintank almost everything once ZG is out (need some items) but you require ridiculous autism in the consumable grind (farm 3-4 days nonstop inbetween raids for cap avoidance) which is too much for any human being to handle. Needs  a raid to learn how to deal with it, too, I guess.
---
TL;DR play holy. You won't regret it and everyone will be dying to have you in their party.
---
Good man
---
No shit... It was a joke. I was having lag issues when the Stress Test servers were going. That's all. I can't believe people are this stupid.
---
Well that's nice.
---
Agreed, no shame in him losing. Plenty of shame to the dudes act and attitude though [https://clips.twitch.tv/ScrumptiousTriumphantCatDatSheffy](https://clips.twitch.tv/ScrumptiousTriumphantCatDatSheffy)
---
It was WOTLK, I was in the guild.
---
Rat-man should just be ignored.
---
I think he started in cata
---
I was invited to the stress test and still couldn‚Äôt play. So there is always worse.
---
Just added a source since you don‚Äôt seem to understand.
---
I think you're missing the point. If "retard" is a derogatory term, and "pepega" is just a way of masking the shock of the actual derogatory term, it doesn't make it any better.
---
It's like creating a different word to use in the place of a racial slur and saying it's ok because you're not actually using the slur. The meaning and connotations are the same, you're just an asshole trying to argue that you're not being a jerk on the grounds of a technicality.
---
And you should check out the source I just added.
---
What was wrong with it?
---
In order to test a theory, you need both a control and a variable.  
---
Variable:  Many videos that you have provided, which show that there is indeed leeway in the beta concerning attack ranges.
---
Control:  Your memories of Vanilla WoW.
---
To say your control is lacking would be an understatement.
---
In Vanilla, my guild had 3 raid nights (Wed, Thurs, Sun) of 4 hours each, so that was a minimum of 12 hours already.  
---
We consistently in the top 20-10% of the server progression (Naxx 4HM down before TBC pre-patch), and expected people to be able to supply their own consumables (aside from flasks for tanks or their special pots). So pre-raid prep was usually a minimum of 30 minutes per raid night (picking herbs, crafting stuff to sell on the AH etc). Warlocks and mages had additional pre-raid prep for soulstones and water.  
---
Most people spent a decent amount of time for the good PvP rewards, so you could be looking at 2-40 hours per week for that as well.
---
whoever is keeping these servers alive needs a raise. this is hilarious
---
&gt;Your full of shit
---
You're not a graduate of anything with that grammar. Nice try.
---
What is his UI
---
The hate boner people have for Asmongold is so fucking pathetic. You're a sad person.
---
That is essentially what layering is.
---
Still figuring out the details tbh. i have a few ideas in mind but nothing concrete yet. Server voting seems to be the best bet.
---
yes dude because addons definitely weren't a thing in classic.
---
Not sure if this was in original but it's definitely a bug. Coldridge Valley graveyard is much closer judging by the map.
---
It's not because he's bad or that he loses. It's because he does so after boasting about being oh so good. No1 gives a fuck if he is good or bad, their calling him out on bad conduct and attitude, which is completely legit, healthy even.
---
Hell yeah. Not only that, I'm not even going to dual wield on my fury warrior in PvE. That's right, chums. I'm going mfing *big dick* with some big, badass fucking 2 handers, the strength of the Gods and the might of the Horde's greatest asset - shamans and their totems. As I recall 2h fury was fairly viable, I'm really looking forward to trying that for myself. Dual weilding was lame.
---
Just like your shitty useless comment, who knew!
---
he once said interacting with twitch chat is like playing 'Marco Polo'
---
You're either really picky or really boring lol

Man, look at all those achievements completed years after their relevance. He sure was serious in TBC with his oldest achievement from that expansion being completed in Cata.
---
Oh damn. "Citizens." We aren't some damn "hero" or "champion." Thank god.
---
Hence the inclusion of the graphics toggle. This toggle already exists for graphical improvements to the world. Some people want the "authentic" Vanilla experience, and they (somewhat) get that by turning the toggles off. Other people prioritize gameplay, but prefer a more polished look.
---
I'm simply trying to gauge the support for both of these mentalities.
---
Look at this noob! Doesn't even know things!
---
Which is pretty crazy considering I never see it online besides from random Youtube videos. I'm from the US and I took Spanish in high school, my girlfriend took it as well and she's not from the US, so you'd think they would be pretty integrated and spread out like other languages

&lt;No Offense&gt; Alliance | NA-PVE | Late-Night Raiding Guild
---
Introduction: No Offense is a group of old school raiders that just want an enjoyable gaming experience. We are currently running Heroic Raids and obtain AOTC on every content tier in retail, and we plan to do the equivalent in Classic WoW.
---
Late-Night Pacific Time (PST PDT PT):  The guild tends to log on after the kids go to bed and log off around midnight.
---
PvE:  Because we have kids and jobs and we enjoy raiding, not corpse camping streamers and being called terrible names by kids younger than our children.
---
Alliance:  We currently raid as Horde.  So we're mixing it up!  Plus - Paladins!
---
What we are looking for in members:
---
* Mature players interested in raiding and playing to support end game content.
---
* Social members that want to hang out and have fun playing later into the evening with a friendly group.
---
* It would be great to get several farm groups going, so even if you just want to goof off and get carried by the main raid team through BWL while we're farming our 12th Ashkandi for a hunter... come on by!
---
* We will also be pushing AoTC and Mythic+10 content Horde side on retail WoW, so that option will also be available.
---
* Anyone that is also looking to participate in both retail and classic, this will be a great fit for you (though it's certainly not required).
---
General Gaming Schedule:  8:30 - 11:30 PT Weeknights and Weekends
---
Raid Scheduled:  TBD, though our current Retail raid schedule is Wednesday/Thursday
---
If you are interested, please contact:
---
skrith#1174 (btag)
---
skrith#2628 (discord)
---
So what should tips have done to win this duel then? So many people saying perp embarrassed tips, tips is a clown etc, yet nobody offers options that tips could have used to beat perp here.
---
This is one reason streamer privilege comes in handy. Nobody would care enough about the stress test normally, but fans will log in just to get near the streamer‚Äôs character in large enough numbers to accomplish an adequate stress test.

I can understand a bit of why they advocate for world PVP. I used to only play on PVE realms until I played on a private server that only had PVP realms, it‚Äôs really a whole ‚Äònother beast. Still doesn‚Äôt justify being a douche tho.
---
I was in a layer with someone today, invited them to a party and it put us both in a new layer with everything alive then slowly started populating people.
---
Layering is supposed to be gone by then.
---
Soz
---
Mate they're joking, it's a meme. The whole joke with getting world firsts in the wow classic beta is that it'd all already been done before.
---
I mean to be fair Classic WoW is a different game. world first will still 100% be a thing. nothing to complain about.
---
I played a pally in wotlk when you basically just spam flash of light and I actually didn‚Äôt mind it. I want to be the more unique healer I was originally going to be a Druid but the no dedicated Rez killed it for me.
---
Kick, punch, it's all in the mind!
---
See your the perfect example of what i mean. You didnt even understand what i was saying yet made a reply. I could not be clearer in any way to explain to you further what i mean and you still dont get it. 
---
Thats why retail wow is utter shit that is easy as fuck.
---
They had to do some rule changes recently because of people shitting on the devs.
---
Granted Synthesis was pretty shit but that sub is fairly toxic whenever a new mechanic isn't absolutely perfect day 1.
---
some people are just not worth your time it sucks (:
---
:( i can't play as a healer it's not fun at all for me ..  on the other hand prot pala is so much fun for me but if i understand right they don't have a taunt so how they are good ?
---

Someone makes this thread every day, and everyday we tell you you're getting mad over a joke.
---
Guy above you is casual
---
"I don't know if images are NDA or not"
---
I wouldn't be surprised if he isn't even in the stress test.
---
I agree. The game doesn't need addons but it's impossible to take a feature away, sigh.  I find it funny that some players are so vehemently against the idea of removing them considering how hard those players fought to get the game they wanted with fewer "features."
---
I personally didn't even acquire DBM (or relevant boss-mod) until I was raiding in TBC, however, boss mods were available during vanilla and were no less useful then than they are is today. 
---
&gt; and modern addons (whcih will be on classic) will even fuck the game up way more than the original vanilla addons, 
---
I would actually submit that such is not true. If anything, the opposite is true as addons in Vanilla were WORSE than addons of today, due to the minimal constraints on the API prior to the TBC pre-patch, which allowed for things like "healbot" or "decursive" to automate gameplay with 1 button push. Healbot, for example, with a single button macro would automatically pick appropriate targets, spells, and spell ranks to heal as efficiently as possible. (As well, if I'm not misremembering, could synchronize with other healbot users as to not choose the same targets to avoid over-healing.) None of which has been possible since 2.0.1 patch.
---
These were also available to other classes via rotation scripts. I remember even dabbling one in one called "AutoRogue", that would one-button-press automate ganking by perfectly timing stunlocks and abilities with your energy tick and so forth. Addons in Vanilla were the wild-west by comparison to modern addon API.
---
Addons are not going to kill anything more than they did back then. Stop doomsaying. If you don't want to use an addon and have a "challenge", then no one's stopping you.
---
Well, thank god you dont work for Blizz and it would be really unfortunate if you work in politics.
---
Pretty sure you‚Äôre a troll. 
---
That said, live is plenty grindy, look at m+, weekly chests, the Azerite mechanic, titanforging. Those are all layered systems above gameplay. Most have us elements. 
---
In contrast, the grind in classic is hitting level 60, getting gold for a mount, and farming for consumables for raids. 
---
The gear in retail is anonymous and boils down to an ilvl, the gear in classic is bespoke and itemization on the part of devs is more creative resulting in more interesting gear decisions by players (negative stats: hit, and set bonuses). 
---
Content isn‚Äôt skippable, it is released staggered with easier content‚Äîwith stuff the high end players want too‚Äîcoming out after harder stuff or concurrent with. The idea being you can‚Äôt skip but can supplement to help get the raid loot faster. 
---
No it isn‚Äôt as hard as live m+ or mythic raids. But who knows maybe blizzard would make a WoW Classic Mythic Edition one day.
---
Never seen this before on this thread TBH? My bad I never new it was a joke either
---
You take this thread as complaining without giving me the benefit of the doubt, that maybe I'm trying to make those who didn't get into the stress test feel better.
---
It definitely did say something like, "Now is the time for heroes" or something, but more from the perspective of "Now is the time for normal people to step up and protect their land and become heroes along the way" or something
---
No Naga or Furbolg territory?
---
This post is self evident that the owner doesn't understand what the purpose of the Beta/Stress tests intent. 
---
May Elune have mercy on his/her soul.
---
Looking forward to share those zombies in Deathknell with half a billion people tho. I'm going to *wait* and I'm going to *savour* the struggle.
---
It's shopped
---
Why did you go with skeram over cthun?
---
&gt; &gt; so if anything it will be even easier than it was when it first released
---
&gt; No.shit.sherlock.
---
Hmmmmmmmmmm then we're saying the same thing.. that BWL is easy and is not going to be a "guild killer" like OP is claiming.
---
Im considering not even playing classic cause of this. Im really upset. This was my main goal to get back in and feel the hardcore aspect of fast leveling and farming for those old epic mounts..
---
We should do something about this. Don't think its just me that is upset.
---
Why would the best warrior in NA even need tips from me? I don‚Äôt even play warrior, I play healers almost exclusively, so I don‚Äôt necessarily know. 
---
You see, admitting you don‚Äôt known something is what separates normal people from narcissistic psychopaths like Tipsout.
---
Ooh you touch my tralala!
---
Ugh, I am dreading the administrative aspects of being a guild officer, but it always seems to be a thing that I end up doing. Probably because I'm anal about it and consistent. :V
---
Sounds so easy. Go get started and let me know how it goes.
---
Don't worry the head clipping through the shoulderpads during cast anims will be so much more noticeable, you won't notice that as much.
---
Try wow cartographe 1.07 on google, outdated but I hope you see what I mean. ;)
---
Do weapon augments appear in inspection?
---
r/wow is the same. A lot of people stopped playing BfA so it's devolved into mostly memes and random art related posts since the more serious player base has stopped caring, but wow in general just makes people hyper defensive.
---
I don't think it is, I took the menethil harbor boat and it took me to somewhere near here. Just disconnected me though.
---
I sure did! I don't know if the game was supposed to crash or not, but I found it hilarious either way.
---
I totally forgot about the ony cloaks lol good call out.  If I remember correctly, everyone who didn't have a cloak had to hide behind the throne or column or something right? LOL
---
btw, I never said BWL was super hard :) I said it just killed a lot of guilds because there was a clear jump in required gear/coordination going from MC to BWL :)
---
the naga live under the sea, what would even be their territory, the one shrine in azshara 
---
as far as furbolgs, they live in logs, and are entirely contained within night elven territory
---
They do it because the drama helps grow their channel

Have fun paying to watch someone else play video games :D

Basically the reasons the orcs are in azeroth is because the burning legion influenced the darkest amongst the orcs (Guldan) to make a portal to &amp; conquer Azeroth. They ultimately failed and the events of WC3 start (with thrall leading the orcs to freedom from human internment camps and starting the orcish nation of durotar). This is all memory so might be off on or missing a detail or two. Jwalla's post explains the actual opening more in depth, but i thought the context might be helpful.

\+1 for RP-PvP
---
Why?  Because it is more immersive.  I have a tendency to do RP stuff just for fun, whether it is gear, macros, etc.
---
I like just walking around the world and seeing what people are RPing, while still having that Horde vs Alliance feel that comes with PvP.
---
No, it blew ass. Fortnite players outta the whazoo, a terrible terrible owner who instead of giving us overtime because the store made no money, he'd give us "store credit, aka game time". Never came in to play once because the shit music there was absolutely 10 garbage spec PCs where you had to download YOUR OWN GAMES and 25 Xboxes.

Lol what are you talking about? It works however they want it to work. All it means is it's not base respawn rate. Just because private servers copy pasted the same code or TBC was a certain way doesn't mean it **has** to be the same way in Classic.

Basically the entire western half is firmly held by the Undead. As well as any other starting zone.
---
Well, there was some sort of server crash so I only have data about players level 4 and 5 and the addon can't resume where it stopped so the player count is not accurate (+ late night EU &amp; peak time is over). Still, 40% undead not bad :p

In addition to having the guild lead and raid lead be separate, have the MT be neither. The MT's priorities will be different than that of a guild and raid lead, and should be balanced to prevent a tyrany.

Well I skipped MoP. So I spent most of WoD just doing MoP content...
---
Protpala is something you do if you are bored with the game and have a guild full of bored tryhards.
---
You have a ret judge crusader and sanctity aura whilst you use unimaginable amounts of consumes for mana to generate an infinite amount of aggro, forgot if you judge 2ranks of SoC or not.
---
It's suboptimal but it works. It requires the entire raid to agree, not something you can choose to play on your own. Gearing up is a hell of a lot more difficult, too, as you require even agility plate to reach the avoidance cap (tankier than any t3 warrior in naxx gear) which is another problem in off itself.
---
No taunt means some fights are untankable by default. Our guild used to have a pala who was in a tank/holy spec swap in as an off tank in mc and bwl, we had the guild leader retpala friend tho so it worked (shitty dps..).
---
Don't attempt to do it you need to know vanilla inside and out to know which items to go for, what to abuse etc. Not an experience you will enjoy if you do not play this game for years plus lots of people will give you a lot of shit for it.
---
You are basically as useful as a warrior (better and worse in areas ofc) with 1500% the effort required to make it work. Later on in AQ+ it's easier to farm stuff and the time required to grind is much less and all since better gear exists for you but it's the equivalent to the perfect powershifting feral offtank. You have one of those on the entire server, that's it.
---
How can a mage suck if all he has to do/can do is spam frostbolt every 2 seconds with infinite mana?
---
BWL ramps up difficulty sure, but I really think AQ40 is the actual guild killer. Every single fight, boss and trash, requires a ballet of coordination and overgearing stuff isn‚Äôt really a shortcut. The trash between princess and twins emps for example: stacking for meteors, collapsing for shadowbolt volley, outranging thunderclap, getting people with poison out of the raid (like geddon bomb), spell reflection, running out of explosion, dealing with frequently spawning adds that aoe cleave the raid, on EVERY SINGLE PULL.
---
Wow layering is awesome /s
---
‚ÄúNote that try-hards aren‚Äôt necessarily better than casuals.‚Äù Cute pandering, but lol.
---
I have really fond memories of leveling there and seeing Theramore castle for the first time, saying hi to Nat Pagle, trying to knock out a few quests before I was dragged off to chuch on Sunday (I was a kid, nothin' I hated more than having my leveling ruined by church).
---
and layering doesnt have to be as exploitable as retail harding is :)
---
It is except you don't add in a whole meta game around layering lol
---
But yes in many ways it is
---
Maybe it's the person commenting that OP was complaining when he was in fact trying to instill encouragement to those who didn't get the invite who is really being the detriment to the community. End the needless toxicity.
---
i see. i wasnt aware. that changes things.
---
Precisely this. Yet when i claim i would do this over having phasing and layering play any part, people figure I'm not serious or just don't know what I'm getting into. Meanwhile i genuinely would love every minute of it, get some mates together and try over there, over here, or fucking 5 man group on mobs 4 lvls above us, whatever we could think of. It would be a blast, not a chore, and even things like the login que etc is something I'd happily accept over phasing/layering.
---
I do see that exact thing you're talking about and I understand tauren have extra 2.5 yard range. 
---
The problem is not their range its that other races seem to have the same range when moving that the tauren have passively. Does that make sense?
---
"Adequate level of cleavage"
---
Blizzard knows.
---
seems like it
---
DI bug? I‚Äôm not aware of this, please explain :)
---
I don't know if it was add-ons and I don't know if it can even be considered a slippery slope. It was a ton of design changes over a long period of time.
---
Think of addons like atlasloot. People know what drops, it just let's them see it in game and plan for it or even just imagine they'll one day get it. It adds excitement. Bartender and unit frame mods allow people to make the experience theirs with custom UIs they can be proud of and key binding done quicker. 
---
Not everything is a quest helper or raid finder or gear checkers. The last one might not even work when you've got pallies in cloth. And if someone is using a quest helper, it won't be a detriment to your playing. Let them enjoy themselves how they see fit.

My god, if people got 30 silver from quests at level 5 no one would bitch about mount prices, I assure you.

The very first zones are supposed to have dynamic spawning (of sorts) enabled anyway. Sources:

https://twitter.com/Grummz/status/1131426701517312001

&gt;The spawn rate in the newbie area is too low. We used overspawning to handle it back during launch. Wonder if its working right or not.

---
&gt;I don't think this is any different from what Blizzard was already doing in the level 1-6 areas. Bliz sets a minimum population of boars, or skels, or whatever -- if the number alive drops below that minimum another spawns with no respawn timer.
---
&gt;Try exhausting all the wolves in the human newb area...it can't be done.
---
yes, its literally several soon-to-be-merged servers with a shared namepool/guildname pool where you can temporarily switch servers to play with your friends :3
---
A lot of it is from Warcraft RTS games.
---
Warcraft 1 sets up Stormwind and the bottom half of Eastern Kingdoms
---
Warcraft 2 sets up Lorderon and the top half of Eastern Kingdoms.
---
Warcraft 3 sets up Kalimdor and Northrend.
---
Unfortunately true these days. Each region has maybe one true RP server left, all the small ones are dead or are just normal servers now in all but name.

Awesome post. I love the level of objectivity you bring to the topic, and go in depth on the social woes and triumphs that BWL can bring. 
---
I wonder if the 1-hour spawn timer will exist in Classic. So far, Blizzard seems to be trying for 99% authenticity, so I can‚Äôt imagine they would change it.
---
We had a solid dkp system for our guild so even if you didn't get anything for awhile, it more or less guaranteed you'd stand a really good chance of getting something when an interesting item dropped.   
---
Fixed cost, highest dkp total had first dibs on the item. If you passed over obvious upgrades trying to save up for a top tier item, you got a warning.  Two warnings got a one week raid suspension, third warning got you kicked off the raid roster and moved back to recruit.  This was implemented because several dipshits wearing greens and blues were passing on serious armor upgrades because they wanted to get one of the cool swords/daggers from Ragnaros or whatever. (Go figure, dps being carried were content being carried)  We did fixed cost to prevent loot cartels from forming, which inevitably happens in a bid system.  Ex: all the warriors in their own chat agreeing on what the highest bid for a piece of armor would be so they could all save up extra dkp to bid on trinkets/rings/etc. that multiple classes competed for.
---
My advice play what you want to play. Do not play what you think other people want you to play. As long as you are playing a class as it's main spec you will be fine. The only class I will warn you off of is warrior. That class will have all the most hard core adherents.
---
It's because 5 was the max level so it was converting the xp into gold.
---
OP is very confused.
---
Lol really? Are you this dumb?
---
You claimed bwl was easy because you cleared it months after it had already been cleared, because you could use other guilds strats and knowledge in your "progression"
---
The game is 16 years old, the game has been beaten multiple times, which is why Vael dies in 30s on pvt servers and why most fights apart from Saph, Cthun and KT are over in a few minutes.
---
So yes, the game is easier
---
This doesn't mean every guild will stream roll through all content.  On ND logs you can see guilds clearing BWL in 1 hour, some in 4.
---
3 weeks after Naxx release on ND and there are still experienced guild who are only 13 or 14 /15
---
None of this changes my original point, that your experience of bwl is irrelevant
---
Eh, if they release the new gnome/goblin allied races around then it will probably pick up. WoW: Ratchet and Clank
---
People keep saying anything. I need a fucking proof to when he actually started playing instead of shady rumours from retards. Tips says he plays since vanilla and I'd like to see a proof for that as well
---
Aq40 time tends to be when a lot of people burn out / quit
---
Oh yikes.... I try to stay away from them rogues though...
---
Layering or sharding in some form is necessary, but that doesn't mean there aren't legitimate complaints about flaws in the currently planned implementation.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/wpq8k25.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/wpq8k25.jpg)
---
Yeah, the addon is looking for every race/class/level combinations + each letter in the alphabet to find as many player as possible because you get 50 results max (with 4 seconds between querries), in the end you get something like:
---
/who r-"human" c-"paladin" 5-5 n-a
---
/who r-"human" c-"paladin" 5-5 n-b
---
/who r-"human" c-"paladin" 5-5 n-c
---
/who r-"human" c-"paladin" 5-5 n-d
---
...
---
and then start over for level 4 and for the other race/class combo

He literally didn‚Äôt boast about being oh so good. He said he was one of the better na warrior duelers on h\*\*\*\*\*se, the server got like 200 players and almost all of them are eu. So he might actually be one of the better ones on there even though he ain‚Äôt a good player.
---
You‚Äôre just bandwagon hating on him for the most absurd childish reasons. I don‚Äôt watch the guy at all but I keep seeing so much hate for the guy who literally did nothing at all.
---
Autmod removed my comment
---
The dork nest is real.
---
I remember it being a strat in Vanilla to skip quests in vanilla until you hit 60 and then do quests for gold.
---
You completely left out the faction neutral Goblin territories in 1k needles, Shimmering Flats, tanaris, Booty Bay and winter spring.
---
Layering = less servers handling more people. When the initial launch population dwindles, layers are eliminated, but no server merges need to happen. This concentrates everyone into fewer servers.
---
Old server capacity = 3000
---
New server capacity = 15,000 (example)
---
Effective server size for you = 3000 (1 layer)
---
Literally the most playable. Amazing. Cool ears, too.
---
There's a difference. Streamers like noxxion, kargoz, etc, and YouTubers / podcasters like Josh, frost, etc are classy and humble. Genuinely likeable people who have a sensible grasp on reality.
---
Then we have the whole LH streamer / private server tips, stay safe, alexensual, etc and their grossly overinflated egos are why people hate them. These guys managed to teach a few internet kids that never played vanilla into thinking they know everything about it. And now that they are streaming the beta we get to see just how crappy at the game they are, AND at the same time, they have the moral compass and character to match.
---
I agree there's not a knowledge deficit anymore, but I do think that many people are heavily discounting the 'mouth breathers' part in your own post.  
---
People got very frustrated in Razor and Vael attempts because people couldn't do basic tasks.  Again, I never said that Razor or Vael were that hard.  However, it only takes 1 person in 40 to mess up a Vael attempt.  
---
That's why Razor and Vael killed a lot of guilds: a handful of 'mouth breathers' could ruin an attempt.  After enough failures, people got antsy and the guild was in peril. 
---
If you're with a competent group of 40 people, of course you're going to do well.  But getting a competent group of 40 people was harder than most people remember.  Maybe that will be different this time.
---
Thats why i talked about addons in raids. 
---
I mean all you mentioned is fine in my opinion and doesnt stop you from becoming better. Maybe i should have been clearer with my words but talking about raids i thought its clear enough.
---
I talk about Healmeter/damagemeter/aggrometer and all the addons that explaint to you what to do on bosses. 
---
I mean i let everyone enjoy what they want. Problem is when iam talking about seeking a guild that are not using them or creating my own that will not use it iam the one getting attacked and downvoted. 
---
Its just my simple opinion that this stuff ruined raiding. It was the early first steps to make stuff easier which doesnt need to be easier. With threatmeter people stopped looking at the screen.. they only started at the aggro meter and waited for a loud noice to appear before checking if anything goes wrong or not. 
---
I was in so many raids where people screamed at rouges in teamspeak to stop making damage for XY reasons and they didnt hear it because they heard music at full blast and only looked at their addons. 
---
Of course i had different guilds too. But overall imho the addons i mentioned where the early steps of WoW¬¥s downfall to the current one we have.
---
It nutured people that instead of trying to get better tried to find ways to make everything easier.
---
I dont even have issues with QOL changes.. but i think you get what i mean by now?
---
I was so young when I played. This just brought back so many memories of my first time playing classic wow on my old shitty pc. Gonna go cry now
---
We only did dkp for the 40 man raids.  ZG was very optional....because ZG is a very optional raid.
---
Play what you enjoy, player skill and determination are large factors in successful gaming. Meta culture was and is created to give subpar or average players the means to compete on a successful level.
---
If you really enjoy something, you‚Äôll make it work ‚Äî don‚Äôt buy in to the sludge pool that is ‚Äú meta ‚Äú. That being said, don‚Äôt conform with failure either, if you aren‚Äôt willing to do well or go above the rest don‚Äôt expect to get carried or burden other players either.
---
Ret is very doable and I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs actually one of the most fun spec/class combinations in vanilla, but you‚Äôre going to have to learn a lot of tricks and go far above what‚Äôs normally required to be successful.
---
Am I suppose to be impressed by your internet anonymity?
---
Being asked, "who should have won this duel?" and responding with "I don't know" is acceptable. But saying that "perp has no business winning this duel" just shows that you're making judgments about tips's gameplay based on a limited understanding of the game. 
---
But whatever, the upvotes and downvotes in this thread make it very apparent that people really just want to make tips look stupid, even when he was fine.
---
Oh...oh my...
---
&gt; Thats why they are using the BFA
---
has this been confirmed?
---
I mean, the towns are there, but like with all the troll villages, i didn't want to make a bunch of tiny 1 settlement territories all over the map to confuse the already very busy map

This is because you are level 5 and the game thinks you're max level. When you don't get experience you get more money instead.

I find it funny that you are giving legit concerns about the game and you are getting negative comments filled with nostalgia goggles. IMO the only thing that vanilla stood out for was the community that was more tight. On the other hand it was just really grindy and i guess you had to manage your resources. I recommend you to try it and if the game isn‚Äôt for you then just quit and let the nostalgia players live happily. Im not sure if people will retain their interest in this server since its OLD and maybe it doesn‚Äôt age well. I don‚Äôt see many popular vanilla servers maybe because people didn‚Äôt like it as much as BC or WoTLK where they maintained the vanilla feel but patched up the grindyness.
---
Spell batching.
---
Okay, but this still doesn't actually work out. What if everyone but 500 people stop playing that server? 
---
What if more than 4000 stay?
---
Either way is a broken server that will require a merge or transfers.
---
Thats because theres fuck all to do.
---
You wont see the same level of that because you arent getting XP by following someone for 5 hours a day and eventually you are going to be one shot by mobs they are questing on. You reach a point to where you physically cannot attentiom whore.
---
You also wont be able to just reach them in 2 minutes with 40 flight paths and a flying mount.
---
 If a streamer is in Un'Goro and youre in Swamp of Sorrows its going to take you 10 minutes+ to get to them.
---
When everyones 60 it will be a different story but until then thats not feasible especially when the big streamers have no life and live off the game allowing them to play for 14 hours a day, you arent going to catch up.
---
Time's up, let's do this, LEEEROOY JENKINS!
---
If you preorder reforged you can also download wc3 frozen throne. You just have to find the classic downloads Web page.
---
I'm pretty sure that Blizzard already stated that they wouldn't be sending out anymore Beta invites for the time being.
---
+Weapon skill also affects crit chance, so the +5 racial bonuses definitely do affect PvP. Just not hit chance, glancing blows, etc.
---
Vanilla had this glow effect too, even back then. Maybe not quite this strong though.
---
He said both were best for pve but thats a lie
---
All classes just spam one spell, ideally their most mana efficient in 40 mans
---
Paladin is best pve and pvp. As to how the populations break down who knows. Paladin should be more popular because it's better......But a lot of horde players going around telling people priest is best healer.
---
The whole goal in vanillla PvE isn't progression, that's a given with all we know about tehse fights. It's all about going quickly so mana efficiency is everything. Less drinking more aggressive strategies, and in any fight longer than a couple minutes Paladins have vastly more healing potential than the other classes. 
---
You pay a hybrid tax the more offensive options you have. Holy paladin has non existent offensive options relative to the other healing classes. And they were in turn given a pretty OP kit when it comes to defensive/support CD's.  In the patch we will be playing on anyway
---
I guess it's kind of the "default"? Like, I don't care about the character, so I'm just gonna spawn a human
---
I see
---
Oh no :( the cinematics are my favourite part. I haven't experienced this. You installed through the classic download page?
---
Who would love in a mid hut?
---
Incredible write-up, hit me pretty close to home lol. It's going to be a real gut-check for a lot of people I think. Vael killed two very good guilds I was in. It was a real personal responsibility check for each of the 40 people.
---
Truth be told, I feel like most of the playerbase who are looking forward to classic are probably not going to even make it to raid-ready level 60, let alone BWL.

BWL is where I started to really feel the burn out that eventually lead to me quitting the game. I remember being in the middle of a run once and we were stuck on a boss, (can't remember which) and it just really hit me that I was no longer having fun playing the game. Raiding had become my part time job and I hated it. I left the guild not too long after that.
---
There's been a few threads on it when beta started a week ago.
---
&gt;I‚Äôm pretty sure it can be achieved by holding RMB and turning while casting. I‚Äôm like 98% sure that‚Äôs what the guy is doing in the video you linked. If you cast a spell at something off to one side I‚Äôm pretty sure you don‚Äôt naturally twist to face them.
---
that is what I'm doing in the beta clips as well.
---
convince the no change people of that. Personally as someone who has always used addons to completely change the UI and everything since vanilla, I will use them if we have them. But I wouldnt care if we didnt have them. 
---
I do think some should be added then like cast bars since so many had that in vanilla. Of course alot played with no addons back then. Alot of those people didnt even know they existed. And cast bars would make a big difference. I agree there should be limits to addons. Cosmetic changes and other things. But blizzard did ban decursive back in vanilla so they can ban ones that shouldnt be allowed
---
This, I think people tend to forget how bad the average players were in classic. We sucked. Like really sucked. My guild cleared BWL when it was current (although not the fastest) and I am pretty sure we had ele shamans healing.
---
I was a warlock and I know for a fact I was so far removed from the optimal spec but I still did well on DPS charts.
---
They do not in retail or classic pservers. So I'd guess no...
---
Yep, I was there.  Guild PvP was real serious business.  Especially for world bosses.  I was in the alliance progression guild and those world dragons were SRS BUIZNESS.
---
I love the underwear chick just casually dancing in the background
---
And? The game is running off 1.12 as a base. They're not gonna remove fish schools for like, a year.
---
The fact they specifically put a toggle in the menu options for it when the entire menu options were redone for Classic.
---
Watch the video and look at the hamstring icon; when pikaboo stands still (which takes away the leeway) his hamstring goes RED even though he is moving towards him, then once he moves BACKWARDS it goes white. That is Exactly what I'm talking about.

What more control do you need? I don't have Real beta so I can't test this further
---
I remember the good ol Xbox live days where I could tell someone their IQ was lower than their kd and be considered "normal." RIP
---
All of what you just said vindicates my point that BWL isn't going to be a guild killer. We have the knowledge, just like my guild did back in 2006, to beat the bosses. That knowledge can't be erased. The strats are solved and widely available. No one outside of those that ran the raid in the first few months of it being available had guild-killing difficulty unless they were simply a bad guild.. which wasn't all that uncommon back then (or now as the case may be), due to the lack of knowledge at the time. That doesn't mean it was a hard raid, which it isn't. Nor does it mean it will be a guild killer now, as OP is trying to espouse to people with this write-up as some kind of forewarning to players of Classic. It simply won't be the case.
---
You can keep sperging out over semantics and arguing over the same conclusion that we both agree on, that's your prerogative. Doesn't change the fact that BWL is easy, even among Vanilla raids.
---
Great post but I don‚Äôt remember vael despawning ever. My guild would do 3 hours of vael attempts each night when we were stuck on him. Despawninf after an hour would be absolutely ridiculous. Especially with the downtime between pulls (corpse running from thorium point was fun)
---
Fish schools are in the stress test version. As they were added in patch 1.9 it could be worth to add them to a content progression phase. They are an easy way to get alchemy and mp5 fish as well as wreckage for vendor profit (cloth, leather, pots, sometimes a green/bag). Wonder if Rumsey Black Label already drops from STV schools (that stamina beverage was a thing before AQ40 not MC :))
---
Woah there. Many of us hadn't seen that yet - I had to search the sub to find a thread about it, and reddit's search sucks. 
---
There was an actual bit of beta invite satire posted last night which a lot of people took seriously. Not having seen the real one yet, I cautiously suggested the previous poster might have seen a/the hoax version.
---
I didn't scream at him, belittle him, or call people here insane. I wanted to let the other guy know he might want to double-check his sources.
---
Private server players have been here for two years now. They're not the ones who've been flooding in and doubling this sub's size in two months.
---
Layering across servers? That‚Äôs weird to be testing when it was meant to be server only sharding.
---
That's literally what layering is lol
---
Is that an actual thing? Are they really releasing gnome/goblin allied races?
---
I am getting married on the 30th, you guys don't know pain, so screw you, sincerely!
---
Prepare to blacklist a huge portion of the population. Including a lot of people who just want to be well/properly geared so that they can do their best in raids/groups.
---
/played 4 days hahahaha  
---
it'll be more like 12-16 days for most people
---
Any idea what the state of fishing will be at the beginning of wow classic?  Will it be like vanilla was on day 1 or after they made the post launch changes?
---
It seems very odd to assume any reason why they wouldn't be shared. It would obviously be a terrible idea.
---
Looking at other replies/comments, I think Blizzard eventually patched it.
---
[Here's an old Blue post from Tigole confirming Vael would despawn after an hour and that this was working as intended.](http://blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-dungeons/83818.htm)
---
this cannot be , please say it isn't so. :(
---
Yes, Yes I really want to like it was in the past. I thoroughly enjoyed the time it took to work towards something you wanted instead of it being handed to you.
---
Traveling taking time? It made the world feel large and immersive.
---
One shot pvp? Meh, it was mostly from gimmicky specs popping a few cds then becoming useless while waiting for those abilities to come off cd.
---
Wait in front of bg/instance? God forbid you had to be social and interact with people while waiting.
---
Eat and drink after every kill? Mostly wrong here. In the early levels before you started to get gear sure, but after gearing up a bit it wasn't really an issue unless you pulled additional camps/mobs or fought a named/something higher lvl than you.
---
I wasn't in a clique, but I was a healer priest who watched a lot of people do stupid shit repeatedly, and also looked at the damage meters to notice when dpsers who survived the entire fight did less damage than someone who died halfway through.  I just told the raid leader or class leader for the person in question about it and let them figure out how to address it.    
---
Some people were just fucking stupid or stubborn and we had to accept that we needed to carry them or ally with another guild to make a better A team for BWL.  The guys who were holding us back complained when they didn't get invited to BWL....but they also made zero effort to improve. They sure loved spending dkp on loot though.
---
Haha glad to play on servers I don't run! Looking forward to seeing you! Are you in the beta?
---
Layering makes it a lot less likely of a server being dead. If you can‚Äôt understand that after the explanation I just gave, then I‚Äôm not sure what to tell ya.
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/ZanySucculentBobaFUNgineer
---
Watch this and look at the hamstring icon
---
That's possible, I haven't tried to /who names found on twitch that are guaranteed to be online and see if it's possible or not to see and talk to them.
---
Auction houses will be shared, as with guilds these are supposed to be be a single server when the dust settles, the hope is that the supply and demand will balance out, given that each layer is an authentic size to original wow, with the same respawning rules and rates.
---
It will be interesting to see how long it takes a decent guild to clear vanilla raids. I think it will be a numbers game because the mechanics aren't very difficult in comparison.
---
I'm just going to play with whatever highest settings there are.  When I play private servers I already use a FoV fix, real max settings via the terminal commands and editing the ini, and an ENB.  I don't want the new models, but having things look the exact same as they did isn't a requirement.
---
no i dont give a fuck
---
He means a single 2H fury build
---
Watch the hamstring icon in this video
---
I will watch this video tonight and respond with every mistake he makes tonight. Im at work currently, but have around 150 days played on classic pservers as warrior main. R10+ multiple times. And I don't even consider myself that good. Im decent at best, but losing to a rogue way below your gear level is pretty bad
---
was this on Darkspear?
---
The people who insist on playing the deadweight specs when their guild is running into a content wall are a special breed of idiot.
---
Oh, please do post more.  I love this.
---
Well for me its pretty insane how a bluepost can turn into a maybe hoax in less than 24 hours.
---
Same goes with the obvious satire you were talking about as been taken serious.
---
And believe me you see my comment way more hostile as it seems. I didnt even downvote you.
---
"I wanted to let the other guy know he might want to double-check his sources." 
---
What other guy are you talking about ? Its only us two speaking.
---
Jeremiah was a Furbolg, was a good friend of mine
---
On alliance side, Humans are the kings of PvE for Warriors and Paladins. +5 Sword/Mace skill for free melee hit chance, bonus Spirit for faster regen between fights, and a 10% rep bonus to cut down on grinding time.
---
Sounds like you wanted to move on and did by leaving. Why do you care if other people do? What exactly did you expect freefolk to be after the show with that shitty of an ending? Did you expect it would just stop existing. Why were you still there in the first place if you were so high and enlighted and moved on immediately without a thought. Just get off your high horse you fucking retard
---
What does the shading within each section mean? For example, the shading on the Thousand Needle's edge of the Feralas region.
---
few more [few more](https://imgur.com/a/9sTbyRC) it's a lot of people
---
O shit waddup
---
The difference here being that there are glitches in Classic that are newly introduced, which differ from the original Vanilla and are unintended to exist. People don't want NEW bugs, just the old ones.
---
Pally bubble
---
I'm all ears. Just keep in mind that tips is stuck in a full prot build in this clip which he is unable to change because of very high respec costs. His intimidating shout was also on cd and he was recently bandaged for most of the duel.
---
Crying toxic is for babies, you won't survive vanilla if you can't handle text
---
My opini√≥n &gt; your opinion
---
It's a visual bug
---
At least game companies caught on to that and started to offer beta access when you order the high end package.
---
If you think those two poison resists made Tips have no reason winning this duel with a meme talent build I hope we play on the same server and opposing factions.
---
Getting boring to see posts like these get high votes only because they shit on Tips or another streamer.
---
&gt; and ofc i played ret coz arther was ret
---
Hmm, Holy Light, Devotion Aura, Divine Shield and Ressurection, yea, ret paladin confirmed.
---
cLaSsIc lOoKs ReAlLy BaD 
---
Then go play bfa? The literal purpose of this game is to simulate 15 years ago.
---
On Emerald Dream? Awakening?
---
Not only that, but you can abuse the layering system to 'refresh' your farm spots for some juicy new rich thorium veins or black lotus spawns.
---
Any update on this?
---
I don‚Äôt mind layering in and of itself, since we need *some* kind of population management.
---
Still, I hate how we went from ‚Äúmaybe sharding 1-10‚Äù to implementing a system all the way from 1-60. Either way, if it *truly* only lasts for 2 weeks, I don‚Äôt mind it. I‚Äôm more worried that the populations won‚Äôt dip as much as Blizzard thinks, so they have to layer for the entirety of Phase 1. That could be 2-3 months of layering. 
---
I get why we need it, but I hope it‚Äôs short and sweet, and GTFOs sooner than later.
---
See the violence inherent in the system!
---
I mean, why the fuck is he full prot? Let's start there...
---
In all honesty, i fully plan to not use that name, i just thought it would be awesome to see a ton of people running around named Manhoney and I could be like "Yup... I did that..."
---
Not sure if this is the one hes talking about, found a post about it before:     
---
&gt;If the paladin put DI on the MC-ed Razorgore and the whole raid died then the adds despawned but using soulstones to resurrect after the mobs despawned you were able to continue the fight without the adds.
---
I got a beta invite and never logged in during the time period. I was a log-in server tester.

Base of 1.12 is a later release than 1.9
---
&gt;Who should have won this duel
---
That wasn‚Äôt even the question I was asked. You sound like a clown with no reading comprehension, little guy.
---
He \*can't\* use it yet. At 34 he can. I'm talking about level 60 rogues. And prep resets blind cd in classic too.
---
brighter indicates that the people of that region have control, darker means they have lost control
---
&gt;Layering across servers?
---
Again... there was only one stress realm online. How do you get "layering across servers" from that?
---
I was testing Ryzen 3 2200G with integrated Vega 8 GPU and in the cave on preset 4 at 3440x1440 Afterburner recorder:
---
* Average framerate  :  152.3 FPS
---
* 1% low framerate   :  126.2 FPS
---
* 0.1% low framerate :  115.5 FPS
---
But when putting that water in field of view the FPS quickly decreased:
---
* Average framerate  :   37.4 FPS
---
* 1% low framerate   :   35.4 FPS
---
* 0.1% low framerate :   35.1 FPS
---
It's known that some hardware handles such effects on retail poorly. People have problems with caves (like Xibala cave in Zuldazar) due to them often having mists.
---
You remind me of when I used to get my kicks on maintenance/patch day reading the forums to laugh at all the people complaining that they couldn't play for a few hours, one day out of the week and demanding compensation from Blizzard. Bonus points for the extra salt on days with extended maintenance, especially extended maintenance on patch days that was unannounced.
---
To come back on Tribe, anybody in Apes is a beast anyways. Sure I know it's 'o't your point, but I want other people who read your comment to know.
---
The bnet launcher did not exist back in the day .....

Blackwing Lair is only a "guild killer" for awful guilds with terrible leadership/organization.
---
Even my first time ever doing BWL with a group of people who were mostly the same, we still cleared it in 3 lockouts, never wiping more than 10 times on any boss.
---
That‚Äôs not saying much though. Seasons 1-4 are like Vanilla, and Season 8 is BFA.
---
So ? And if you didnt get to play because of login issues, you helped them with another issue. Its a fucking stress test not a demo.
---
What parts of the Thousand Needles and the Shimmering Flats are goblin territory? The Mirage Raceway is co-owned with the Gnomes.
---
That is basically what happened to me on my warlock. I gave up raiding for awhile because my guild broke up in BWL. 
---
Then I was talking to some AQ 40 guilds and they brought me in and I learned the class a lot bettet and I got to see how fun it was to raid with a great team
---
That was the really OP warrior trinket wasn't it? I remember the warriors in my guild really wanting it drop for so long.
---
yep! I figured that out when testing retail. installed via Bootcamp and good to go

IMO you should try testing the same thing, level 1 fresh character vs fresh character. Male vs female.

---
I remember using Remote Desktop programs specifically so I could get into the queue before leaving my final college class for the day, that way it would be almost my turn to actually log in by the time I got back to my dorm room.
---
This is it exactly. It made the fight a joke for Alliance.
---
It'll definitely be fixed for WoW Classic, since it was long fixed by 1.12.1. However it meant that a lot of alliance guilds could clear razorgore with as few as 20 people.
---
INDEED, INDEED, UPVOTES TO THE LEFT FELLAS.
---
Thank you so much for replies, everyone!
---
I mean, WoW pvp sucks ass so whatever. Doesn‚Äôt really take skill to faceroll on a keyboard
---
feeling cute today, might show you my flaming butthole. might wipe a raid...idk
---
They may or may not - just curious what the will do or what advantage we can take from it. Similar issue can be made for for example Silithus mobs and NPC - will Cenarion Circle NPC and cultists mobs will be before Silithus patch and if so what they will offer, what they will drop, will they give rep? Imaging having access to summoning stones in those cultist camps in first phase.
---
Yeah, before mortal strike evasion is a really bad idea with the improve crit from overpower. But people don't know shit and still like to talk I guess.
---
I would disagree with this, but then I would be labeled "toxic" too.
---
The stuff is time-gated, but as far as we know, the actual data will stay as it was in 1.12.
---
Wow I had no idea, I imagine that was changed due to some upset guilds haha
---
it's crazy how much better a 2005 online game is than current online games.
---
This x100. I really don't get when people say "oh you don't remember how bad it was back then".
---
I don't need anyone to tell me what I remember and what I don't. Yes Vanilla was almost 15 years and I obviously don't remember every little detail in what I did or exactly how long something took me, but I still remember how I felt when I accomplished something. 
---
Over the years that feeling of accomplishment and pride in doing something has diminished over time. Hardly anything requires any work or any real time investment anymore. Gear is thrown at you, leveling is a joke, most classes are carbon copies of each other, the community is dead thanks to the LFG tool, and there is no server identity thanks to cross-server everything. 
---
Vanilla was far from perfect, but for a large portion of people it was really damn good. Classic obviously isn't for everyone, but I personally feel it will be a lot more successful than people think it will be.
---
Have you not seen the videos? People seeing players from the alpha that are over lvl 40?  Players in the stress test finding lvl 7 beta characters along side them?  Have a look and see for yourself.
---
Sssshh, that doesn't fit the narrative.
---
You're the problem
---
Yes it is but it also has content progression so the question is - is it something that should be under progression or not?
---
You posted here like 6 times already, are you on TipsOuts payroll? If not, get off his nuts. I can tell you‚Äôre a retail bab just by reading what you say and how you say it.
---
I'm guessing he went prot solely for concussive blow since it has a lot of value in PvP in the level 30 meta.
---
Why should the tank be allowed to wear lionheart but the pally can‚Äôt roll Ret? You see the flaw in your reasoning now?
---
I was confused because the shading that starts in Feathermoon Stronghold swings right up into dragon territory.
---
I hope Launch has a version of layering where it‚Äôs not easy to be on the ‚Äúwrong layer‚Äù. It really sucks when the neighbor later is having thrall fun but you‚Äôre just stuck there twiddling.
---
I wonder if you get yourself phased to the other server and then just never log off if the server would kick you or not cause technically youre on the beta server when the stress test goes down.
---
Link the videos or everybody here is just gonna go ahead and assume you're an insane troll.
---
it's been a while and I did that part last
---
also i'm not sure i ever actually levelled through feralas
---
probably messed it up lol
---
Yeah they're eventually releasing one for each of the core 12 races. Google Vulpera and Mechagnomes
---
Maynard?
---
Who gives a shit if their damage is ‚Äúruined?‚Äù (Also having debuff on the creep don‚Äôt affect your ability to cast frostbolt)
---
You have no idea what the fuck you're talking about.  
---
If you don't understand something, don't open your mouth / keyboard.
---
Battle res/rebirth is amazing in raids as well
---
You will become the object of absolute hatred in raids as you can fd to survive wipes. Pick up eng and get some shock paddles to offset the salt.
---
Nope, haven't seen any of that. Regardless, if it has happened, it's obviously a glitch. I have no interest in the "no matter what this game is ruined, Blizz can do no right" comments. If you can do nothing but find disappointment in Classic, I genuinely pity you.
---
No one rolled a Death Knight either.
---
**Interesting, very interesting**
---
Intentional or not I don't really care.  The fact of the matter today is that people need to quit being so damn whiny and thinking they're entitled to whatever they demand from Blizzard.
---
Lol, 50% crit on OP. 5% crit, deep wounds, so many things are better
---
if you unironically like pixar models instead of the actual kino models they managed to make in 2004 you're a lost cause
---
This game was always paid by subscription. You play for the service and it quality and the income is put to the game development too. In case of classic - either to support existing and future fresh servers for years to come and potentially - classic version of TBC, WoTLK...
---
Just remember, more dots
---
Whats the spot?
---
Tirisfal seemed bright to me (green glow in the sky) last night on the stress test (midnight), but I don't have any screenshots quite that old to compare to. Has anyone checked 1.12 to beta videos or screenshots of night time light levels?
---
Hi, /u/Panda719
---
oh whattt  why didn't I think of this
---
Exactly and I am not getting any attention, so why should she?
---
It's almost like the alpha could be... dare I say it... another layer!
---
Just because they're listed Realms to us doesn't mean they are.
---
We should stop assuming stuff we do not know.  Pro-layer or not.
---
epic moment
---
sTrEamErs arE RuinIng BeTA
---
They're not so much worse than other healers that you "only want 2".
---
One of my previous pserver guilds had 4 resto druids and we did perfectly fine. Healing was rarely an issue.
---
Considering that Druid is the least-played healer by a large margin, you often can't find enough of them, and having more brez/innervate is never a bad thing.
---
Who cares? Essentially everyone who originally developed your precious pservers for starters...
---
Also, I would hope, that‚Äôs why we are all here: because we enjoyed vanilla and want a chance to play it now... after this comment I‚Äôm relatively certain you are a troll.
---
Well played sir, subtlety followed by increasingly absurd conclusions is a pro troll move.
---
I disagree that all publicity is good publicity, bad PR exists. That being said this is great publicity for classic.
---
Can you use shortcuts on the Who tab by default to search multiple things?
---
Why didn't they just cheese him lol
---
Was going to include this but wasn't 100% it was a part of Vanilla :P
---
Really good to know, thanks man.
---
Something tells me you‚Äôre all talk like streamer bab Tipsout. You‚Äôre probably shit at the game:)
---
Poggggg
---
Who‚Äôs that?
---
He started in Vanilla he just didn't start soon enough to hit the level cap until BC. I'm not sure which expansions he quit/came back during though
---
Priest so you can go shadow form for that one Naxx boss. Worth it.
---
??? Yes, you could. Mage is a hard counter to warrior, as a mage myself, theres no reason in bragging about it. Beating warriors doesn't take any skill at all unless they use FAPS, trinkets, and consumables, and even then its still an easy matchup. Inabillity to beat a hard counter doesn't speak for an individuals skill, but rather the design of the game.
---
Over 70k watching him.
---
I don't know why this is relevant for a beta since this would never happen live, but I really don't care I just love it.
---
It's not BWL that kills the guilds imo it's the players being bad that kills the guilds but I see what you're saying yeah
---
If you got through bwl together as a group, you became a family. A really irritating, annoying, closenit family that you could rely on to learn the next bosses. 
---
I must have lucked out on the shit talking or never knew it was happening to me because I didn't really have to deal with any of it. Maybe I was part of the cool kids and didn't know it.  
---
I'd say a huge sign of the health of a guild was how the class officers acted and the bars and results they looked for in recruits.  Class officers, the middle management of Guilds. 
---
For sure though, bwl was a raid ability and mental fortitude check.
---
Hence my trepidation towards the game (see above) sharding/layering was already a significant enough change to turn me off.
---
I really thought that blowing DI on the earlier trash was going to fuck them at the end.
---
Those private servers that allow income will get shut down or sued as it is legal to profit off some one elses product so yea
---
Man that is such an awesome moment, the whole dungeon was intense as fuck. Love it.
---
Oh wait I mean fucking streamer didn't even report a single bug that whole run.
---
New to this stuff... what is the significance of this? Is this because the party is heavily underleveled?
---
Cool and all, but if they're able to do this at level 30, they should have absolutely no challenge at all doing it in later levels.
---
That was fucking crazy.

Thank me later.

No idea, from summer ‚Äò07 till Christmas ‚Äò08 I played only on the 14 day trial accounts by using fake emails. Not sure how many time I did this but I know I at least played every class except a warlock once. Soooo yeah lol
---
Why? Defeats the purpose of doing something challenging.
---
Are you seriously asking why he's in prot? Why do you think a tank would be in prot spec?
---
Yeah they were pulling mobs 6-8 levels higher the whole way. It's not particularly hard, it's just kind of tedious with little margin for error if they pull too many. 
---
Plus with respawns there's a lot of tension because one wipe and you have to reclear all the trash.
---
If your guild breaks up because of Vael, your guild isn't a hardcore guild. Seriously, if you think he's rough, you will never kill C'thun or 4 horsemen.

Why does he never use shield block?
---
I don‚Äôt know. I mean, the player base is what, 1.7 million now? (There was a leak of that number in November). It was 7-12 million during vanilla and TBC. Hardly anyone raided Naxx, but they were subbed still. Maybe even casuals prefer non-trivial, more social gameplay.

and?
---
Yes, biggest issue being threat generation since most attacks miss and beating the relatively short mob respawn rate.
---
First point: there‚Äôs a reason the term ‚Äúwrath babies‚Äù exists so I‚Äôm pretty sure it is a reasonable reference.
---
Second point: (also if you don‚Äôt know what ‚Äúwrath babies‚Äù means)
---
https://www.google.com
---
basically yes, most of those mobs are 37+, while the players are capped at 30
---
yeah the instance is intended to be done 8-9 levels higher than their current level
---
Funny how you assume im salty. You don‚Äôt know me. I was just saying why I couldn‚Äôt get in. Jesus bunch of forum police around these days.

The font style / size is super important. The first thing that stuck out to me watching beta clips was that it looks like the modern text, which seems objectively worse.
---
No one will be raging about mc trash pulls being hard I promise.
---
Yes, the levelcap is 30, Herod is supposed to be downed by a full group of lvl38-40.
---
They basically missed almost every attack the entire dungeon through.
---
Im not a big fan of this "layer" thing
---
Yeah i know. Try telling them that.
---
gratz
---
This instance was definitely fun to watch. The stakes were so high. Definitely miss Classic, 3 months is a long time for us non-beta users to wait.
---
Autorun?
---
He said earlier that it was only knocking 18 damage per hit off. I don‚Äôt know how significant that is but that was his reasoning.
---
That may be true, but at the same time, the only reason that the decision was made is because of the lucrative $$$ potential that added additional weight to tip the scale to the "yes" side. To think otherwise is naive.
---
press num lock lol
---
Worthless at this level
---
It is very much hard when you have to manage threat when most of your attacks don't hit.
---
The intent is to have it be far shorter than phase 1, even. It all depends on how populations decline. A few very popular realms may not decay as fast, but not all servers will have the same layering curve/effects.
---
It's still a world first
---
Holy shit that was an intense watch. Glad they got him down in the end.
---
In vanilla people knew how to take a proper screenshot.
---
haha oh man, the irony dude!
---
And how did they hand out this priority? Do they have some way of punching in a streamers name and it forces them into the server before anyone else ? Do you have proof of this or are you just retarded and FEEL like this is the case ?  
---
Its a stress test, not a demo for you to enjoy and have a great old time in, end of story. You were not artificially locked out by a streamer bias barrier, seek some actual professional help if you believe that to be true.
---
Its a fucking meme obviously, anyone who is upset over streamers calling kills in classic wow World Firsts is retarded.
---
I forgot if you can need on gear that isn't equippable or not, but as a druid it is 100% possible to roll on cloth healing gear and leather healing gear, alike.
---
Kisses
---
Pog
---
honestly, I prefer it over the dynamic spawns alternative
---
its only like a 5% damage decrease.
---
Its great when Rage isnt an issue but he cant hit the higher level mobs so Rage is precious
---
We used an auction style DKP system. With no minimums. Generally what happened is the guy who got the first amazing drop( most likely a weapon) was the last to get his full set tier. It worked out really well and it made it really easy to catch up new recruits. 
---
We gave out dkp per boss kill and time in raid.
---
\#FurbolgLivesMater
---
Two keyboards, but does not even bother to learn the hot-keys.
---
Yes, everyone can roll, but it's considered bad manners to roll on gear that other people need if it's not for the spec you're currently playing. If you want to do this, clear it with the people in your group first.
---
My brother used to play 2H fury and the numbers you could pull on clothies was crazy
---
Half of these kingdoms are dead though...
---
I prefer classic way.
---
Wishing I could do more towards making the game great!
---
I really hated that Asmon didn't use his gun to shoot whenever Herod was doing bladestorm lol..
---
Would have been good to see if they could so blizz could make sure he cant be in the future.
---
It's very cool they did it, but man, it's actually astonishing how bad Asmongold is at the game. Taking unnecessary hits, refusing to use boss pathing/kiting to his advantage, his refusal to use bandages and other items. His in-game awareness is just piss poor. He needs to worry less about his pretend shot-calling and that monologue shit and just play the game. I'm honestly surprised he didn't wipe them.
---
I just felt some of the excitement was a little bit manufactured that's all. It was still a fun run to watch.
---
Such an intense watch! Fair play to them!
---
My dude! I cannot wait to run Scholomance again. Easily one of my favorite dungeons in classic.
---
Everything is viable.  Play what you want.  Life is too short to worry.

He can be ret but he shouldnt be a ret healer. How does being ret make you a better healer in any way?
---
Now do it on a version that isn't 1.12. Everyone knows it's dumbed down and casual.
---
Took them like 3 hours to clean the trash before getting to the boss, that's why the reaction was so epic.
---
what is that man doing to his portal
---
I‚Äôm surprised that priest seems so low. Maybe I should roll one?
---
Nobody ever explicitly asked you the question, however based on your original statement of "tips had no business winning this duel," your answer to that question, if someone were to ask it, would have obviously been that tips should have won the duel. But you're unable to explain what he could have done to win, and yet you still go on to make judgments. That is my point here.
---
 –°–µ—Ä—ë–∂–∞ =)
---
Another example of why layering is stupid
---
&gt; In Vanilla it's quite possible you go multiple raids without even seeing an upgrade for your class let alone actually get the piece yourself.
---
One of the big reasons I want to play lock. My guild in vanilla got enough druid, hunter, and warlock gear to give multiple people 8/8 before a single other class in the guild hit 8/8. It got to the point where we were disenchanting druid, hunter, and lock gear while other classes were struggling to get 5/8. Maybe it was just confirmation bias, but gear for those three classes seemed to drop more than any other class by what appeared to be a significant margin.
---
I know I linked an Esfand clip over Asmongold, but the run was Asmon's idea so I felt the title was appropriate.
---
New layer on demand. so in classic there are resources that are very scarce and valuable. Now apply what i did to farming resource/gold. I cant imagine blizzard will let it work like it currently does for release thankfully.
---
I‚Äôm ready for the chaos. 15 years ago I was 12 and unmarried. Haven‚Äôt played retail since MOP really
---
It's pretty cool to see all the creative stuff players are coming up with to make the most of a level cap of 30.
---
The casters care. Playing fire in raids is all abput rolling ignite w the mages of the raid. Playing as a team. Sonething you dont seem to get at all.
---
I don't really understand this comment. My guild got past Skeram pretty rapidly, it was around Fankriss and Sartura that people started getting frustrated and dropping off.
---
He explained it during the run, that it only blocks around 18 damage and wasnt really worth it for the rage it cost's
---
I don't think you understand, they are real neckbeards.
---
if you saw the part leading up to it the trash was honestly more exciting than herrod
---
That was so fun to watch live. I wonder what would‚Äôve made that even easier and what the limit is for level 30 players to clear dungeon-wise?
---
I'm playing the most autistic oomkin
---
Num lock existed in vanilla . Then again so did the arrow keys so wtf am I judging for
---
This belongs in r/classicwowporn
---
Its not. I saw it happen on asmons stream a few times.
---
I'm pretty sure if people are aware of Vanilla boss cheese strats, the devs are too
---
Was fucking epic
---
We killed thrall and you baddies couldn't even kill cairne??????
---
Traah
---
It also seemed as if every shot he did hit. Is this a thing? Or was it just coincidence?
---
Tanks in vanilla dont really go down much in the prot tree my dude
---
I think your dark iron dwarves is off, looks like searing gorge isn‚Äôt highlighted. They very much control that.
---
Also needs more steamweedle cartel.
---
Nah, not really. 
---
Everyone is in the same boat. It's not like the warrior is having everything resisted and everyone else is just trucking him. 
---
There's not really some mechanical finesse required to manage threat. Everyone else just chills for a minute while the warrior keeps trying to hit. He's hitting enough to land some sunders, it's not surprising that dps will have a hard time catching him when they're all missing constantly too. 
---
The heal aggro came into play a couple of times but again, what is the mechanical solution to that? Keep trying to hit him. 
---
If anything threat management is more of a factor when DPS have no problem hitting the mobs.
---
Oceanic?
---
Pservers =\= classic totally different clients.
---
Generally speaking, main spec before off spec.
---
That said, a tank usually has a bit more weight in the party's dynamic. So if you put a group together and simply say, "I'm rolling on X gear", people can either take it or leave it.
---
Hm, how about farming devilsaur leather?
---
I watched most of the run yeah.
---
What's the significance? Am I missing something?

Funny that herod hits harder on that level 60 Warrior from 2006 then on Asmongold with lvl 30. Damage seems insanely off.
---
2006 video as proof:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwV9GfSUHW4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwV9GfSUHW4)
---
It would be cool if they even layered NPCs then we can interact with other players more by trying to go to other layers /s
---
Yes someone enjoys a clip, so they post here to give the streamer money Pepega
---
Level 37 dungeon boss
---
classic is tuned right btw
---
I thought it was showing the Hinterlands for no good reason.
---
You won‚Äôt get beta. They have pretty much sent out all the invites.
---
Ah yes, the legendary cowcatcher.
---
The fights themselves aren't so bad, there's only like 6 or 7 truly hard bosses in the game. The difficulty is a social one, keeping a tight group of players, training people up, allocating gear well to people who will keep it in guild. If all that stuff is done for you and someone let's you log onto theirnfully geared char, you could probably do the fights. The game is about all the other stuff leading up to that point.
---
Fucking cringe
---
That's why they have a hunter. They were doing like 80% of their DPS due to the way ranged hitrate works.
---
Which jackass summoned the Firelord?
---
He probably doesn't know that blocks are immune to crits and crushing blows, which happen alot against higher level targets:) I tried to tell him but u know, chatspam!
---
You know you could change key binds in vanilla?
---
They're capped at 30 and Herod is lvl 40. All the mobs are at least 5 levels higher than them. They missed like 80% of their attacks. Quite the achievement imo
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Sounds like jealousy.
---
Sellouts /rollseyes
---
The screenshot isn‚Äôt the point of this post
---
They basically just renamed sharding.
---
Male has much more strenght than the female so naturally he swings his sword harder
---
SquadW
---
I watched the run and he said he doesn't want to "waste" cd's if it's unlikely to affect the outcome of the fight. Here he thought they would kill Herod regardless so no need to use it.
---
The higher the boss level, the more the hunter's inability to do glancing damage mattered (as well as blades of light stopping mdps damage). If you watched the last fight, you would have seen that there were inconsistencies in damage across the party that made Herod's threat difficult.
---
Blacklists are definitely common for players/servers. People don't forget assholes and ninja looters. I guess it depends on how egregious the offense is though.
---
Imagine ninja looting from your first Deadmines run.... Ha, no one will remember me. It's cool. Ding! I hit 60. Wait, that Warrior I ninja'd from is the GL of that guild I like? What do you mean my application is denied? Dude, it was just one piece of gear, bro!
---
If i was in that run i wouldn't have even cheered when we killed the Herod, i would be on the verge of tears because nobody in the run reported any bugs. The beta shouldn't be about fun.
---
Prot is actually pretty rare for leveling in vanilla. Arms is good enough to tank in without having to raise your respec cost unnecessarily.
---
I feel this so fucking hard
---
and if they didn't encounter any bugs?
---
Do you have some Videos? I only found 1? =(
---
Nope!
---
Yeah sorry I really didn't use my canoodle on this one.
---
You had my upvote at the ‚Äúreeeeee‚Äôs‚Äù
---
This was legendary ! :D
---
you must be fun at party
---
Looks like a cult.
---
Log off. They're job is done.
---
A well-written and thoughtful post. We don't see many of those in this subreddit. updoot
---
Asmon had buffs, elixirs, defensive stance, etc
---
As far as i remember if you Block you can't get crushed or critted. So specialy at Herod, where he got crit/crushed nearly every hit, it would have made a big difference in damage taken.
---
That's me. A few hours with the level 5 in classic was so much more engaging. I never forget to eat when playing BfA.
---
I didn't think Herod was as hard as the pack of mobs, I watched most of the run and they had much closer calls with them than the boss. This isn't AQ40 stuff but for a levelcapped party that's still something I haven't seen done nor have I seen any sane person try to attempt.
---
Perhaps you can make it a party vote. If someone is a complete ass odds are the entire party will sign off on it.
---
Or you can make it a percentage thing where people also thumbs up good players.
---
Me no likey.
---
literally all of the searing gorge is highlighted, as well as the the eastern third of the burning steppes and the northern ridge of the badlands
---
I've never related this much to a meme before. I think I'm about to experience something.. Epic.
---
I got lucky here. I was playing Live and told myself I was ending my subscription once we downed the last boss of the current raid. Did that a a week before beta went out. Got my invite the next day. So playing beta, and not paying a sub anymore. Got on pure luck. That or blizz wants me to stay around and knew this would get me sucked into it.
---
hey let me be jealous god damn it
---
Gift of the wild. Group wide version of it.
---
These guys have BiS.
---
there isn't a point to this post lol
---
is having fun mutually exclusive with finding bugs?
---
God, thinking about something rubbing the inside of my ear every time I slightly turn my head would drive me nuts.
---
I watched most of the instance, and I'm aware of the concern with hunters. I don't think you and I are working with the same definitions of mechanical difficulty. Threat management is a thing in Vanilla, but it's not as difficult to manage in any situation as people paint it.
---
Again, Vanilla is awesome. We don't need to pretend it's harder than it is for that to be the case. It was a run with some pretty mediocre players making lots of mistakes, but they were about as geared as they can be and buffed to the gills. It was fun to watch.
---
As someone planning on running a raiding guild yet hasn't raided in Classic...This is good to know. 1.12 Talents probably will help a bit, as will better access to decent PCs and information, but if you have any further advise for this part of progression, do tell!
---
Great write up. Best of luck to everyone in Classic!
---
they're all on BiS aren't they?
---
BuT i'Ve hAd mY acCoUnT sInCE wORlD wAr 2!
---
Cry anyway
---
They expected to gain some data on how the servers would perform under a massive amount of stress. Buffing up the servers to get more people in doesn't help them on launch. They set the servers up for how they want to run them day 1, beat the shit out of them with spergs like yourself trying to login, then collected the data. Beefing those servers up only inflates that data and it doesn't represent what they will be working with come launch.  
---
Quell the entitlement and google what a stress test is. I can guarantee the definition doesn't have "demo" in parentheses
---
&gt;i want other people to do it for me.
---
lol.
---
Not sure what you're implying, I want to join the party not be kept outside it, so yeah I'm pretty fun.
---
Probably due to how the very dated engine handles these kind of transparencies. You have to remember, WoW's engine shares lineage back to Warcraft 3.
---
Screen-covering transparency effects with the rudimentary/naive shaders employed by the engine push the fill-rate on GPUs pretty heavily, especially at modern resolutions.
---
Supply and demand. Imagine having the farming potential for scare resources out in the world of a low-population server, but having the economy of a high-pop server because of the amount of people actually in your server. It's gonna fuck over the economy, and make tons of things more easier for people.
---
Hey no worries at all. If ya get it then fantastic. Figured it was worth a try. Keep at it! It‚Äôs much appreciated.
---
[You're mistaken, we just made it here!](https://i.imgur.com/MDv6dlR.jpg)
---
The only thing which is hard, is the CC'ing and making sure not to pull extra mobs. In no way is doing less damage/getting crushed and missing attacks/spells changing anything fundamentally. 
---
The fact that they did this with limited knowledge proves just taking it slow and steady can get you far in Vanilla. Here's a few things I noticed, which would've made it way easier:
---
Asmongold spamming abilities on Herod when he already got aggro. It almost killed him, because he probably doesn't know when someone parries an attack, their swing timer is reduced. He was taking a shitload of damage from this and almost got bursted down with the instant Cleave into auto-attack he does.
---
Hunter kept running the stairs down, instead of jumping down to path him all the way around. Which would reduce Herod damage significantly since his charge will time out. BoP was used because of this.
---
Spamming Hamstring kiting the mobs when there was space for it, would've saved so much mana.
---
There's a bunch of little things like this, which could've made the run much more smooth. Not hating, just stating that they did it slow and steady with limited knowledge and still got it all done.
---
Jeez, some people are so jealous
---
Yeah I mean the reason no one but the spergiest of spergs stuck at level 30 would attempt it is because it takes fucking forever, not because it's oppressively mechanically difficult.
---
Probably, either way he was having trouble even keeping threat, not sure if it would have been worth. I did not know that about blocks however
---
Ah yes a brand new technology can never be flawed or *beta tested*
---
Considering how much of an issue aggro was, I think using his rage for more dmg/hits was the smarter choice.
---
It‚Äôs not like this fight requires some crazy tactics. 
---
Its just moving in and out when he WWs. I give credit to the healer though. Dude‚Äôs health was seesawing like crazy after enrage.
---
What happened if you tried to run through it in Vanilla?
---
Fair enough lol
---
Very well put together post. Nice job! Hopefully Blizz understands the importance of these "seemingly small" items and takes them seriously. Especially little things like the crit text and sneaky stealth walk imo make a big difference.
---
Me neither, but i think they are only using it during launch and the first couple of weeks to ensure that everyone can enjoy the world.
---
Cheers, didn't know that! That must also be why he pulled agro. :D
---
One of the things I loved about transmogrification was that I could take random blue/green gear and transmogrify a set that essentially looked like a functional hunter's outfit with an elegant and sensible bow (or non absurd gun if the mood suited me) ... instead of having a shit ton of spikes and dangling chains everywhere with some of the more weird looking sets they made.
---
Imagine being a non-crackhead elf
---
Wtf... a post that‚Äôs not a meme, bitching about not being in the beta, or a clip licking the filthy asshole of an unwashed streamer?
---
Actual useful information about Classic?
---
How did this sneak through?
---
STREAMER PRIORITY REEE
---
I've been 'hating' on narcissists for a while, certainly glad it is a 'bandwagon' now though. Eh I'm a child to you for that reason, your a child to me for that deep need to excuse away unacceptable behavior with whatever poor logical thought you could come up with. I used to be quite frustrated by this trend, but i thankfully started studying psychology a while back and it all made much more sense when i learned about confirmation bias in more depth.
---
Then go play fucking retail!!
---
The new models are clipped sloppy bullshit with retarded animations and a full on product of the new half ass modern WoW.
---
I‚Äôm tired of you so called ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù players coming in here and pushing for that shit.
---
And yes, I‚Äôm mad.
---
Full tier 2 except my helm (warlock), did ony every week for countless months, i missed exactly ONE ony run.  Guess what dropped that week.  Almost made me quit wow
---
Anyone that thinks Vanilla takes even an inkling of skill (especially compared with the later expansions) is a dipshit; so you criticizing Asmongold's gameplay is actually idiotic. PS: I raided well into Naxx 40.
---
bug free, lmao.
---
I would be ok if the tank was a warrior and rolled on spirit gear.  Warrior leveling is a PITA and spirit gear helps immensely.  Also I main warrior and will remember the healers that were cool with me doing that and help them out whenever I can.
---
But every other class should defer to the healer on spirit gear.
---
Welcome to Classic, you‚Äôre part of the cult now.
---
All of that checks out, still not 1.12 tho and still no blind in equation.
---
EQ2 had layering and it was a complete non-issue.
---
This shit is starting to make me so fucking jealous ugh!!
---
It's not on demand.  You can't create unlimited layers.
---
I'm really looking forward to seeing how Classic turns out in this age of total information and theorycrafting.
---
Thank you. It was generally a sloppy run by mediocre players who were as geared as they could possibly be and buffed to the gills. 
---
It was really entertaining. We don't need to pretend it's a bigger achievement than it is.
---
Was it because of no glancing blows with arrows/bullets? I played a hunter in vanilla and can't remember for the life of me.
---
Lets be honest here bro. Streamers aren't in the beta to be testers. They were givin the beta because 70k people will watch and get hype for classic. Different people have different jobs. Asmogolds is to generate hype. I am sure Blizz has a short list of people that really get into the bug reporting.
---
Okay that explains it.
---
if you dont want addons dont use them.
---
vanilla had addons and classic will have addons.
---
Yes, we want it exactly like the past. Everything you said pretty much translates to "Do you guys really want the game to be challenging like it was in the past?" If we wanted to play ez mode, no skill WoW, we would play retail.
---
You watch the stream? Seems to be hitting near the same outside  crush/crits + he's sword/board D stance with pally devo aura. Damage doesn't look 'insanely off' at all.
---
&gt;  what the limit is for level 30 players to clear dungeon-wise?
---
Thats likely it. They were having problems keeping up with spawns and repairs.
---
damn omar respawning
---
If I'm paying a monthly sub to play a game, you better believe I want to play the game
---
Server merging is long term layering where the communities clash even harder, it's not better imo
---
its difficult because they have to very very finely control mana expenditure, threat, and hits taken. There was a point where asmon took a couples hits too many and even McCool said he was likely about to die, i think i saw the hp go down to 400.
---
That's been around forever.  It's also been posted ever since test opened.
---
Heaven forbid someone getting shit all over defend themselves...
---
Discussion and a rhetorical question. Looking back on it yeah, i wasnt very clear on that. Sorry. 
---
Just felt you said it like duh idiot.
---
No one had mana pots btw. they wanted to give the hunter it before they went for the boss but no one had.
---
Yeah it's been up all day
---
Cool, you raided well into Naxx 40 but Vanilla takes no skill right?
---
So you're saying Asmongold played well, considering how much of his life he has dedicated to WoW? Or are you some Asmon whiteknight? Sorry for criticizing your favorite streamer
---
Need a tampon?
---
It literally is a world first in beta. It doesn't matter if there is 1 player or millions of them. It still is the betas world first.
---
Check his post history, definitely a troll or a sad human being. Probably both either way.
---
Self awareness is the first step
---
Literally can‚Äôt tell if this is sarcasm lol
---
I don't know anything about EQ2, it's game design, how layering was actually implemented in comparison to classic wow's, etc etc. so i can't really argue anything there  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Do we really need to look at the countless reaction videos of retail players achieving significant kills over the years?
---
thanks for the advice bro :) What's step 2? I'm just so jealous of Asmon so I vent it by critiquing his tanking ability! Makes a lot of sense right?
---
&gt; the way ranged hitrate works.
---
how it works?
---
I missed that screenshot by a second but was in the next few the stress test has been sick

Weak auras will destroy everything like it did on live.

Oh yeah he is, I've done plenty of duels against both on my druid and I can honestly say Tribe was a tougher fight than Mn (no offence Mn if you see this! :D) both still great at their class.
---
fuck yeah, dude
---
Fuck yeah dude. You tell em. Stupid idiots and their enjoyment of a video game.
---
yeah nice exaggeration it's like it's true with gnomes they look fine and better looking and they're still short so your point is invalid and retarded
---
I spent hours trying to just login yesterday during the launch. Finally got to play around 7pm. Made the best of it and leveled all 8 classes to level 5 and reported / found plenty of bugs. Patience is a virtue. But a beta invite would make my year :)
---
It's a fear of missing out. If it's a disability I want my damn cheques.
---
yep, being stuck at 30, running dungeons constantly,  they are basically twinks (or close to it) at this point
---
Oh that‚Äôs super cool, I didn‚Äôt even know that.
---
Yeah, Its just human nature I think lol.
---
I‚Äôd rather make sure than assume they are.
---
I watch Asmon all the time and I really like him as a streamer and he is a decent person outside his stream persona, but even I have to 100% admit that he is a bad player. He may be decent at retail WoW, but he is dogshit at anything outside of that.
---
I personally think Main Tanks make the absolute worst Guild Leaders.
---
yeah watched it, the crits and crushes were as high as the non crits on the level 60. And maybe the Devo Aura and Potions give enough armour to be around the same amount of a level 60. cant exactly tell how many leather items the lvl 60 wore, but if he has just some plate items from 60, his armour should be at least as high.
---
But if I'm not GL, RL, and MT then how can I assure my Thunderfury and all the guild's resources to forge it?
---
Yeah I also never really played a hunter. No glancing blows + looks like hitrate is just much better. Asmon was shooting consistently for 60s while hitting with his hammer for like 5 damage. And his gun skill sucks.
---
True. Im not overly worried about any launch day catastrophes, just queue times for day 1
---
They did it was level 30
---
It looks like he's wearing leather too
---
In the future, whenever you see a retard post, quote them with /u/ and &gt;

This is awful. I don't think I can main this class anymore. What makes it so good for pvp?
---
That‚Äôs a level 6 spell.
---
he didnt pop shield wall, he didnt bandage for most of the fight, he took random hits, and they ended without any death even after the zerg
---
it wasn't tough, just long
---
you must  acquit
---
&gt; Cool, you raided well into Naxx 40 but Vanilla takes no skill right?
---
That's right. It *literally* takes no skill. All Vanilla was is a grind for shit: resistance gear, reputation, DKP, PvP. Don't even get me started on organizing 40-man raids (triggering my PTSD).
---
It's a testament to how garbage BfA is that people are this excited for Vanilla.
---
FWIW, I don't watch Asmongold.
---
No they're missing pieces.
---
Priority should go to main tank! "Just" secure MT and you should be good. Maybe join a guild that's not raid led by a rogue though...
---
I watched him stream the Soulsborne games and a few others when he took a break from retail, it's not astonishing. He's just not very good at video games.
---
Dude of course; it's alright its just a game. There willl be plenty of ppl that did not experienced vanilla raids. The community can be glad to have you as it is often timea not very rewarding to put in work as a guild and or raid leader
---
Not against Herod no, would prevent getting crushed / crit on the blocked hits which is significant
---
Same but I didn‚Äôt get an invite this time. I guess I flew too close to the sun the past few years.
---
While that is another topic, it's quite an interesting one! May I ask why? 
---
Is it mainly because you aren't seeing everything because you have a giant boss in your face? 'Cause that's a reason why some guildleads I've talked to disliked Maintanking in TBC onward atleast.
---
No as long as you take the advice of your experienced raiders. Make people who know what they are doing officers and not just your friends.
---
Did you not ever use Autorun in vanilla? O.o
---
Yeah I did. Tried a few different things but black screens everytime. Might just be my old rig. I actually just alt tabbed between missions and watched them on youtube lol
---
Yeah I couldn't tell if he was self-aware meming or if he was genuinely trying to pretend he knows what he's talking about, but his whole raid lead persona was pretty contrived lol.
---
He's hard to watch for so many reasons, but this was a fun run.
---
Thanks for all the good times guys.  
---
Until next time.  
---
See you later, space cowboy.
---
The changes between private servers and classic will be so minimal they will barely affect gameplay.
---
Well said, man.  Our guild def. struggled at the beginning of BWL, but we managed to have some amazingly fun times in between raids doing stupid stuff like city raids, holding Blackrock Mtn., etc.  I really think that helped our morale a lot.  I even remember one time taking a vote to not even raid that night and instead I think we just had a guild-wide FFA PVP with prizes.
---
Fucking epic, god I can't wait for classic
---
He is bad  
---
Alkaizerx would completely destroy both of them  
---
Alkaizer will btw go for Rank 14 and dominate NA with his group
---
Damn you sound like all the people I played vanilla WoW with, a massive fuckin prick.
---
So blue! So impossibly blue!
---
What were you going to roll before this poll?
---
The mobs were doing insane damages, they were close to dying many time on trash pulls
---
Tailoring was a must have for cloth players in BC due to BoP craftable gear.
---
In vanilla crafting professions are noobtraps. Except maybe for enchanting, not sure about that one. Get gathering.
---
When you zoned in, if the zone was full/had a lot of people (whatever the cap was), you went to a different layer that wasn't full.  You could select the layer you wanted to join manually if you really wanted to go to one.
---
Woops I was just trying to summon the sun.
---
... great? Streamer completes a low level dungeon that has been cleared millions of times prior...... let's make a post on reddit about it.
---
Could be that. It hits some cards more than others. In 1.12 client I can't see this effect, although the client is running on much lower framerate (below 55FPS), different settings and DX9 instead of DX11 (Classic client seems to be locked to DX11 as of now).
---
Everybody knew that the streamers are gonna be there beforehand. And if you use your brain a little, you can assume that Blizzard is not gonna let 190k people stare at a login screen.
---
Was thinking maybe Druid. I‚Äôm gonna be focused on PvP though and was also considering mage or priest.
---
They said they are dialing them back and that more invites could be in the future. Just enough info to keep people subbed just in case.
---
If it‚Äôs her first MMO, let her choose the class whose fantasy appeals most to her and then play whatever you want because duo leveling is incredibly easy.
---
Seriously.  Play what you want!
---
PvP leveling guilds were a huge, huge part of Vanilla, with guilds staying in each bracket for weeks at a time, getting to know all the PvPers on both factions of the server, running BGs with no immediate rewards other than the fun of playing and perhaps getting a new title after a couple weeks in a new bracket...
---
And then, while in the 50s bracket, one of your more hardcore members who has already earned rank 10 and completed their blue set, gets antsy and "accidentally" dings 60 by killing NPCs in AV...  and life suddenly changes in ways nobody could have imagined just a few happy weeks ago...
---
Yeah, most people were pretty elitist because raiding was pretty much a closed loop. Much better than LFR, of course (which IMO is the biggest mistake WoW ever made), but I wonder if it's going to catch on once people realize what they're signing up for.
---
100% agree.
---
The funniest thing abou this is the idea that GameStop will still be open
---
When I got on a gm started spawning edwin vancleef in the starting zone. Hearing and stay down every 2 seconds was awesome
---
Me either. So funny to me, it's like half of the stuff I see here is people shit talking streamers. 
---
Reminds me of the classic Tyler the creator quote about cyber bullying. "Just shut the screen off" If a ton of people are posting clips from a streamer and they're reaching the top of the sub, it's not like they're super unpopular, yknow lol
---
He doesnt know lol
---
Very well written and true, oh so very true.
---
No, I think MT's make fine raid leaders, just not guild leaders.
---
A guild has to come together to gear a Main Tank. Everyone takes a back seat to the tank. Everyone pushes to get their tank resist gear and they're the first to get Thunderfury. Tanks usually have consumables and repair costs thrown at them. Because of this, main tanks need to be very humble.
---
Guild leaders aren't humble.
---
For real, can we get a "no streamers" server? I want to play the game with other neckbeards, not run around as an extra in the world's shittiest TV show.
---
I agree that it shouldn't launch with them.
---
Keep it real for a week or two, then add them in.
---
Most people will probably be doing the grind instead of sorting out addons though :)
---
Thanks for the advice, most of my friends won't play enough or even want to be officers anyway, so this won't be an issue for me. Have a good one!
---
and ony and aq and naxx

WoW erotica 101
---
The stakes were high? It's 10 year old content mate
---
Notice how the servers were fine until the streamers showed up. Ugh, they ruin freaking everything.
---
Hi, Asmon.
---
Negative Andy's WeirdChamp, just salty a streamer did it like so many others on this sub. No one wants people that are negative like you around.
---
Yep.
---
I noticed the plaques in the Scarlet Armory (herods room specifically) weren't all there. Three? (perhaps more) were missing from the wall.
---
‚ÄúBrick, are you just looking at things in the office and saying that you love them?‚Äù
